Just when you thought all was quiet on the OS front , Apple breaks its silence to slam Windows 7 as being complex , expensive , and the cause of user headaches .
Brian Croll , Vice President of OS X product marketing , explains :
Windows users are really tired of all the headaches that they ’ve been getting over the years , starting all the way back from Windows Me to NT to Vista and now Windows 7 .
As a result , I think people are looking for something different , and the Mac offers real ease of use , stability and security .
Windows 7 is still just Windows .
It does n’t change a lot .
It ’s still complex , it ’s still really expensive when you look at the cost of the upgrade , and there ’s still security concerns .
It turns out when you get Windows 7 it does n’t even have some of the basic applications like mail or chat , or programs to manage your photos .
You actually have to go and find them and download them .
For the consumer , there ’s a lot of headache and annoyance built in to Windows 7 .
It ’s built on a lot of antiquated technology that does n’t change from release to release .
We think that most people probably are n’t going to make that jump ( from XP / Vista ) , and as a result , are going to be looking for new computers .
Let ’s examine his statement in detail :
1. Windows users are tired of the headaches
Really ?
We ’ve all had problems with Windows but does any OS offer a trouble - free experience ?
I think not , Mr Croll — and Macs are hardly exempt .
2. Windows 7 is still just Windows
That ’s a relief — users would be very confused if it were n’t !
The OS has evolved and it ’s certainly more reliable and less confusing .
Perhaps its evolution could have been quicker , but people like what they know .
3 . There are no basic applications
Microsoft has dropped Windows Mail , MSN Messenger , Photo Gallery , Movie Maker and several other applications from Windows 7 .
Internet Explorer 8 can also be uninstalled ( to an extent ) .
But is n’t that what the industry wanted ?
Everyone complained about Vista ’s bloat and Microsoft was fined on several occasions for providing free software that destroyed competitors .
It finally looks as though the company has listened , but they still ca n’t win !
You should also note that the applications are still available .
They can be downloaded for free from http://download.live.com/ and they also appear as an optional “ Live Essentials ” entry in the Windows 7 Update panel .
However , Windows users can choose alternative applications if they wish .
4 . It ’s built on a lot of antiquated technology that does n’t change from release to release
Microsoft work hard to retain program compatibility between releases .
They test and support thousands of applications , so it ’s not surprising old code is retained .
Windows compatibility may not be perfect , but how many other companies strive to support 15 year - old software ?
Perhaps Mr Croll is unaware that OS X has been available since 2002 and is based on a 40 year - old operating system ?
I ’m sure some of the original Unix source code can still be found lurking beneath the surface !
It ’s slightly bizarre that Apple ’s marketing departments regularly resort to Microsoft bashing .
Their most devoted fans would never touch a non-Apple product .
Even Microsoft users recognize that Apple make some glorious hardware and software .
So why is Apple always on the attack ?
It ’s rare for Microsoft to retaliate .
Has Apple become overly arrogant ?
Is Windows 7 a big concern for them ?

A veteran policeman has branded a man , caught steering his car with his knees while holding a mobile phone in each hand , as one of the most careless drivers he has ever seen .
Acting Sergeant Rob Atkinson was in an unmarked police car when he noticed a city - bound Honda swerving in the far - left lane of the Eastlink tunnel about 3.15 pm on Saturday .
As he pulled up beside the 30 - year - old Fitzroy man , acting Sergeant Atkinson was stunned to see he was driving with one finger on the steering wheel as he held a phone in each hand .
Once out of the tunnel , the driver was pulled over and told police he had been transferring information from one phone to the other while gripping the wheel with his finger .
Acting Sergeant Atkinson said that , in 10 years on the force , the incident was one of the worst cases of careless driving he had seen .
The man was fined just over $ 500 and was penalised six demerit points .
" I reinforced the danger of this type of driving , especially within the tunnel and issued the man with two penalty notices , " acting Sergeant Atkinson said .
France is considering forcing some sex offenders to undergo chemical castration after a public outcry over the murder of a jogger by a rapist who had recently been released from prison .
The prime minister , François Fillon , said the government was looking at legislation on hormonal treatment for offenders after the abduction and killing of Marie - Christine Hodeau .
The 42 - year - old , who lived alone with her elderly mother , was snatched on Monday morning while out for her regular jog in a forest south of Paris .
Just after 9 am , she called police on her mobile phone from the boot of a car , saying she had been grabbed by a man with a knife .
She gave the car 's number plate , but the call was suddenly interrupted .
Police moved fast to trace the car and its owner , Manuel da Cruz .
But for days the French public were gripped as searches did not find the woman .
Hodeau 's DNA was found under the fingernails of Cruz 's left hand and eventually he led police to her naked body , hidden in undergrowth 12 miles from where she was abducted .
According to police accounts , Cruz stopped to change cars after interrupting Hodeau 's call .
He tied her to a tree while looking for another vehicle .
She managed to escape , but he caught her running through the forest and strangled her before disposing of her clothes .
Public shock was compounded when it emerged that Cruz , a 47 - year - old concierge and father of four , had served seven years of an 11 - year - sentence for kidnapping and raping a 13 - year - old girl in 2000 .
Released from prison on parole , he had moved back to the neighbourhood where his teenage victim lived .
The case has reopened the heated debate on how to deal with reoffenders in France – a favourite subject of President Nicolas Sarkozy , who prides himself on his tough stance on law and order .
This week he met Hodeau 's family at the Élysée palace .
When , in reaction to the case , a spokesman for Sarkozy 's centre - right UMP party called for wider use of chemical castration , an outraged Socialist party spokesman called the idea " deplorable " and " indecent " .
But several ministers have now suggested a discussion on broadening the use of chemical castration , including the justice minister , Michèle Alliot - Marie , and the family minister , Nadine Morano .
Fillon said today : " We are not ruling out any line of reflection on any subject . "
Chemical castration is a reversible process in which the administration of drugs or injections lowers the sex drive .
France , along with a number of other European countries including Sweden and Denmark , already allows the procedure if offenders agree to it .
Poland last month approved a law making chemical castration mandatory for some offenders convicted of sex crimes against children .
Several US states enforce similar measures .
" Chemical castration exists today , it just depends on an agreement by the person concerned , " Fillon said .
" We have to look at how , as part of surveillance and control measures after someone leaves prison , we might make this more restrictive , if necessary .
It 's a subject we are working on and we will make proposals to parliament . "
Sarkozy called for the closer supervision of paroled prisoners and a review of France 's criminal psychiatry system .
But magistrates unions protested after the interior minister blamed the jogger 's murder on lenient judges and parole officers .

Plutonomy , perhaps like me , you 've not heard much about this term , except in the occasional poorly defined rant .
Well it 's a word we should all learn more about -- since it's one of the new " code words " the uber - rich use to maintain their " high stations " in life .
Plutonomy
n . An economy that is driven by or that disproportionately benefits wealthy people , or one where the creation of wealth is the principal goal .
[ Blend of pluto - ( wealth ) and economy . ]
http://www.wordspy.com/...
In a report called " The Plutonomy Symposium Rising Tides Lifting Yachts , " Ajay Kapur , Citigroup 's global strategist , says the balance sheets of the rich are " in great shape , and will get much better , " which is why he recommends going out and buying stocks of companies that cater to that very select market .
Spending by the uber - rich overwhelms that of the average consumer and helps explain why the U.S. economy has continued to do well and the U.S. dollar has n't collapsed even in the face of the current federal budget deficit , a negative savings rate , global imbalances and high energy prices , he says .
The United States is one of the plutonomy countries countries whose economies are powered by a relatively small number of rich people .

You see Michael Moore highlights a confidential report that Citigroup initially circulated only to it 's wealthiest customers .
Those reports , since leaked , plainly discuss the power of the Plutonomy in America , and how it would only strengthen , as long as the " the rest us " ( the non-plutonics ) could be kept in the dark about the Plutonomy existence , its role , and its over - arching control in the American Economy .
Even though the Plutonomy ( the top 1 % ) control over 50 % of the net worth in America -- they do n't control the Votes !
The thing they most fear is the principle of " one person -- one vote " .
You see despite their extreme wealth and power , they only have 1 % of the vote ; " the rest us " control the other 99 % of the votes .
So if we ever caught on and , I do n't know , maybe raised their taxes back to where it use to be ( 40 - 90 % range ) , well maybe they could n't have a Yacht in every city , or a Mansion in a half dozen states .
Maybe they could n't " lose count " of how many homes they owned .
Well I tried to locate the confidential Citigroup reports cited in the film , and think that these next two links are them .
Remember these Reports were NOT meant for consumption by us " common folk " .
Citigroup Plutonomy Report Part 1
Oct 16 , 2005
- The World is dividing into two blocs - the Plutonomy and the rest .
The U.S. , UK , and Canada are the key Plutonomies - economies powered by the wealthy .
Continental Europe ( ex - Italy ) and Japan are in the egalitarian bloc .
- Equity risk premium embedded in " global imbalances " are unwarranted .
In plutonomies the rich absorb a disproportionate chunk of the economy and have a massive impact on reported aggregate numbers like savings rates , current account deficits , consumption levels , etc .
This imbalance in inequality expresses itself in the standard scary " global imbalances " .
We worry less .
-
There is no " average consumer " in a Plutonomy .
[...]
Indeed , traditional thinking is likely to have issues with most of it .
We will posit that : the world is dividing into two blocs - the plutonomies , where economic growth is powered by and largely consumed by the wealthy few , and the rest .
Plutonomies have occurred before in sixteenth century Spain , in seventeenth century Holland , the Gilded Age and the Roaring Twenties in the U.S.
What are the common drivers of Plutonomy ?
Disruptive technology - driven productivity gains ,
creative financial innovation ,
capitalist - friendly cooperative governments ,
an international dimension of immigrants and
overseas conquests invigorating wealth creation ,
the rule of law , and
patenting inventions .
Often these wealth waves involve great complexity , exploited best by the rich and educated of the time .
We project that the plutonomies ( the U.S. , UK , and Canada ) will likely see even more income inequality , disproportionately feeding off a further rise in the profit share in their economies , capitalist - friendly governments , more technology - driven productivity , and globalization . [...]
In a plutonomy there is no such animal as " the U.S. consumer " or " the UK consumer " , or indeed the " Russian consumer " .
There are rich consumers , few in number , but disproportionate in the gigantic slice of income and consumption they take .
There are the rest , the " non-rich " , the multitudinous many , but only accounting for surprisingly small bites of the national pie . [...] i.e. , focus on the " average " consumer are flawed from the start .
http://www.scribd.com/...
Here 's the key part , mentioned in the Moore film , where CitiGroup frets about us pesky " laborers " could some day push - back , that we might demand fair treatment and pay for all our productivity :
Citigroup Plutonomy Report Part 2
Mar 5 2006
RISKS -- WHAT COULD GO WRONG ?
Our whole plutonomy thesis is based on the idea that the rich will keep getting richer .
This thesis is not without its risks .
For example , a policy error leading to asset deflation , would likely damage plutonomy .
Furthermore , the rising wealth gap between the rich and poor will probably at some point lead to a political backlash .
Whilst the rich are getting a greater share of the wealth , and the poor a lesser share , political enfrachisement remains as was -- one person , one vote ( in the plutonomies ) .
At some point it is likely that labor will fight back against the rising profit share of the rich and there will be a political backlash against the rising wealth of the rich .
This could be felt through higher taxation on the rich ( or indirectly though higher corporate taxes / regulation ) or through trying to protect indigenous [ home - grown ] laborers , in a push - back on globalization -- either anti-mmigration , or protectionism .
We do n’t see this happening yet , though there are signs of rising political tensions .
However we are keeping a close eye on developments .
http://www.scribd.com/...
The arrogance displayed , as Citigroup sees their iron grip , slipping , yet scheming to hang on to that Plutonic Control -- is truly appalling ... and a bit frightening too .
It 's as if we , the other 99 % , are merely the cogs in their grand design .
And as long as any worker push - back , can be held in check -- well No Worries , then .
They get to keep that Capitalistic Money Machine humming along fine , Cha -Ching !
This Citigroup message of catering to the needs of the Plutonomy , once it got out , has n't been lost on the Wall Street Journal crowd , although our National News Media , has n't really reported on it much , have they ?
The Wealth Report
Plutonomics
Robert Frank looks at the lives and culture of the wealthy .
By Robert Frank , Wall Street Journal - Jan 8 , 2007
It ’s well known that the rich have an outsized influence on the economy .
The nation ’s top 1 % of households own more than half the nation ’s stocks , according to the Federal Reserve .
They also control more than $ 16 trillion in wealth — more than the bottom 90 % .
Yet a new body of research from Citigroup suggests that the rich have other , more - surprising impacts on the economy .
[...]
" The Plutonomy is here , is going to get stronger , its membership swelling " he wrote in one research note .
" Toys for the wealthy have pricing power , and staying power . "
[...]
Of course , Kapur says there are risks to the Plutonomy , including war , inflation , financial crises , the end of the technological revolution and populist political pressure .
Yet he maintains that the " the rich are likely to keep getting even richer , and enjoy an even greater share of the wealth pie over the coming years . "
All of which means that , like it or not , inequality is n’t going away and may become even more pronounced in the coming years .
The best way for companies and businesspeople to survive in Plutonomies , Kapur implies , is to disregard the " mass " consumer and focus on the increasingly rich market of the rich .
A tough message — but one worth considering .
http://blogs.wsj.com/...
Nice , eh !? ... well not really .
What was it they fear most , again ?
The principle of " one person -- one vote " ?
Say , NOW that 's NICE ! ... that could one day be the People taking our Country back .

jvm and scala Compressed Oops , escape analysis , iteration , jvm , optimise , performance , scala Ismael Juma 2:00 pm
Internal iterators like foreach tend to do very well in micro-benchmarks on the JVM .
In fact , they often do as well as the equivalent manual while or for loop .
There is a catch , however , and it ’s easy to miss it in micro-benchmarks .
A few months ago , David MacIver forwarded an email from Martin Odersky to the scala - internals mailing list about this .
The problem as described by Martin :
“ The reason seems to be that the foreach itself is not inlined , so the call to the closure becomes megamorphic and therefore slow . ”
I was curious about the benchmarks used to measure this and Tiark Rompf ( who had performed the measurements ) provided the source code .
I said I ’d try to take a look the next weekend and I did it … more than 3 months later .
Well , better late than never . ;)
There are 3 benchmarks :
Benchmark A : traverse a collection with N elements
Benchmark B : traverse a collection with N elements , inside the loop / closure traverse another collection with N2 elements 3 times
Benchmark C : build a collection ( front to back ) of N elements
Various approaches are used for each benchmark with various collections types .
One weakness of the these benchmarks is that they do n’t include a verification mechanism to ensure that all benchmarks produce the same result .
However , they include code that tries to prevent the JIT from performing unfair optimisations ( e.g. print something if an element in the collection matches a certain condition ) .
The original results produced by Tiark can be found here .
I added a few benchmarks that use plain arrays ( RawArrayIndexed , RawArrayForeach , RawArrayForeachMega ) , made minor changes to the scripts and pushed the code to a GitHub repository .
I left the rest of the Scala code as it was to make it easy to compare with the original results and ran the benchmark with various JVM settings to see what effect they would have .
All the tests shared the following :
Dual quad - core Xeon E5462 2.80GHz
14 GB RAM
Fedora 11
Scala 2.8.0.r19261
Revision 59521431f5c118b73e35b0b396e3efd6aecec3dd of project
64 - bit JDK 6 Update 18 early access b03
JVM base settings : - Xms1G - Xmx1G -XX : +UseParallelGC
-XX :+UseParallelOldGC
JDK 6 Update 18 is scheduled to be released on Q4 , 2009 and it includes HotSpot 16 .
Even though JDK 6 Update 14 ( HotSpot 14 ) introduced compressed references and scalar replacement , HotSpot 16 includes improved compressed references and many crucial fixes to both features .
According to my testing these features are now approaching production - level stability and the OpenJDK engineers seem to agree as they are both enabled by default in HotSpot 17 ( which will eventually hit JDK6 too ) .
Interested in how these features would affect the performance in these benchmarks , I ran them with various combinations .
I also added Scala ’s compiler - optimise flag in some cases .
The original benchmark from Tiark used 3 collection types : array ( java.util.ArrayList ) , list ( scala .
List , immutable single linked list ) and vector ( earlier version of immutable vector that has recently been added to Scala 2.8 ) .
I added JVM arrays and they are shown as “ rawarray ” in the charts .
Finally , we get to the actual numbers .
There are some interesting data points here :
Compressed references is a _huge_ win .
RawArrayIndexed went from 500ms to 142ms and many of the vector operations were much faster .
Escape analysis ( which enables scalar replacement ) does n’t seem to have much of an effect .
scalac - optimise does n’t seem to have much of an effect .
foreach is misleadingly fast in micro- benchmarks , but it ’s easy to bring it down to earth .
RawArrayForeach performs similarly to RawArrayIndexed , but RawArrayForeachMega is 10 times slower .
The latter simply calls foreach with a few different anonymous functions during the collection creation phase causing the call site to become megamorphic .
Once this happens , the only hope for good performance is that the foreach method gets inlined and it does n’t seem to happen here .
With this in mind , it seems like ticket 1338 ( Optimize simple for loops ) is a good idea .
Once again , compressed references are a large factor in some benchmarks ( halving the time taken in some cases ) .
The new bit of information is that scalac - optimise causes a huge improvement in VectorForeachFast and VectorForeachFastProtect .
This makes sense once one considers one of the findings from the previous benchmark .
We said that inlining of foreach is of extreme importance once a call site is megamorphic and this is precisely what - optimise does in this case ( and the JVM fails to do so at runtime otherwise ) .
Sadly , - optimise cannot do this safely in many cases as it ’s shown by the results for VectorForeach .
Once again , compressed references provide a nice boost .
Seems like this option is a winner in 64 - bit JVMs ( if you do n’t need a heap larger than 32GB ) , it saves memory and gives better performance .
The usual disclaimer applies though , you should benchmark your own application instead of relying on micro-benchmarks when deciding what JVM options to use .
The complete results are also available .
Feel free to play with the source code and provide your own numbers , fixes and / or improvements .
SAN FRANCISCO – With an overwhelming strike authorization vote Oct. 22 , workers are ratcheting up the pressure on the city ’s top hotels to end their stalling , drop demands for takeaways and agree to a fair contract .
Many of the city ’s most prominent hotels are among the 31 affected by the vote .
With more than 3,000 workers casting ballots , over 93 percent voted to authorize Unite Here Local 2 ’s bargaining committee to call actions up to and including strikes , if necessary .
In the meantime workers are remaining on the job .
The union is calling a “ day of action ” from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Oct. 27 , at an as - yet - unspecified hotel .
Speaking to reporters as the vote was in progress , Local 2 President Mike Casey said employers are proposing “ deep , unjustifiable and impossible cuts ” in bargaining ongoing since mid-August , when the previous contract expired .
The union has proposed two options : a one year contract keeping affordable family health care and making “ extremely modest ” adjustments to wages and pensions , and a three year pact addressing core issues including continued affordable family health coverage , better dental and retirement benefits , fair wage increases and guarantees of reasonable workloads .
Though the corporations “ may be crying the blues right now , ” Casey said , “ all the analysts indicate that in 2011 - 2012 , we ’re going to see a rebound ” in the hotel industry as well as in the economy generally , and hotel workers must also benefit from the upswing .
Meanwhile , he said , the hotels are “ seeking to use the economy as an excuse to combine jobs , shorten shifts , require workers to pay for health care , and reduce pensions , ” in the hope of accomplishing what they could not during talks for the previous contract in 2004 - 2006 .
As in most contract talks throughout the country , health care tops the list of issues .
Though negotiations are taking place separately with the various hotel corporations , overall the union says they are trying to cut health care contributions , putting workers on a path to huge monthly copays and / or drastically reduced benefits .
Several are also proposing combined job classifications , new four - hour shifts , and cuts in starting rates .
Addressing the reporters , Ringo Mak , a server at the Hilton Hotel , underscored the health care issue ’s seriousness : “ If they do n’t give us the health benefits , we will have to go to San Francisco General Hospital [ the city ’s public hospital ] and the burden will fall back on the city .
I do n’t think anybody should want that .
The hotel is making a profit every year , and that makes what we ’re asking for affordable . ”
The union points out that in the “ boom period ” of 2004 - 2008 , hotel corporations made record profits of over $ 110 billion in North America , and that they remain profitable even under current conditions .
Workers participating in the strike authorization vote included room cleaners , dischwashers , cooks , bell staff , servers , bussers , bartenders and others .
Their earnings average $ 30,000 to $ 35,000 annually .
About 40 percent are of Asian / Pacific Island descent and another 30 percent are Latino .
The average Local 2 member has worked at the same hotel for more than a dozen years .
Is this what you call “ educating voters ” on Maine ’s Question 1 ?
Led by Bishop Richard Malone , the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland “ played a big part ” in the information campaign , reports a Catholic website .
Just how big a part ?
Well let ’s look at exactly just where all those “ education ” dollars came from .
And went .
Nicholas Kristof made an excellent point in his column about troop build - ups in Afghanistan :
For the cost of 1 more America soldier to be sent to Afghanistan for a year , “ roughly 20 schools ” could instead be built .
So when it comes to the Catholic Diocese of Portland , which donated more than $ 553,000 to Stand For Marriage Maine and other anti-gay parties hoping for a “ Yes On 1 ” vote , how much real good could have been done in the community instead of stripping away the rights of gays and lesbians ?
The break - down of the Dicoese ’s cash transfers — available here — is remarkable .
Ten thousands dollars here , fifty thousand there .
The financial disclosure also reveals the various parishes and individual the money flowed from :
The Archdiocese of Philadelphia had $ 50 k to spare ; the Roman Catholic Church of the Archdiocese of New Orleans offered $ 2 k ; Cleveland ’s Most Reverend Richard G. Lennon donated $ 1 k .
The reports , dating from June thru October , detail just how influential the Catholic Church ’s money was in Maine .
But this cash comes from an organization that , supposedly , does good for the community .
And while the Roman Catholic Church unarguably does much good in local communities — providing food , shelter , and social services — it ’s hard to reconcile a group calling on its parishioners to donate their much - needed paychecks to a hate campaign .
( This is the same organization that just admitted a priest sexually abused at least two people some 60 years ago . )
For what it ’s worth , Bishop Malone wants to thank the Church ’s supporters , particularly because Question 1 “ has also been an opportunity for listening , and I trust that those who voted for such a radical change did so out of concern for our gay brothers and sisters . ”
Concern .
Right .
( In the meantime , could someone explain why Christine Pitteroff , identified as a staffer in the Chancery Public Affairs Office of Portland ’s Diocese , was on the receiving end of $ 10,033.88 of the Church ’s own cash ? )

Artist 's impression : Astronomers are finding smaller and smaller planets
Astronomers have announced a haul of planets found beyond our Solar System .
The 32 " exoplanets " ranged in size from five times the mass of Earth to 5 - 10 times the mass of Jupiter , the researchers said .
They were found using a very sensitive instrument on a 3.6 m telescope at the European Southern Observatory 's La Silla facility in Chile .
The discovery is exciting because it suggests that low - mass planets could be numerous in our galaxy .
" From [ our ] results , we know now that at least 40 % of solar - type stars have low - mass planets .
This is really important because it means that low - mass planets are everywhere , basically , " explained Stephane Udry from Geneva University , Switzerland .
" What 's very interesting is that models are predicting them , and we are finding them ; and furthermore the models are predicting even more lower - mass planets like the Earth . "
Size selection
The discovery now takes the number of known exoplanets - planets outside our Solar System - to more than 400 .
These have been identified using a range of astronomical techniques and telescopes , but this latest group was spotted as a result of observations made with the Harps spectrometer at La Silla .
The High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher instrument employs what is sometimes called the " wobble technique " .
This is an indirect method of detection that infers the existence of orbiting planets from the way their gravity makes a parent star appear to twitch in its motion across the sky .
Astronomy is working right at the limits of the current technology capable of detecting exoplanets and most of those found so far are Jupiter - scale and bigger .
Harps , however , has focussed its efforts on small , relatively cool stars - so - called M- class stars - in the hope of finding low - mass planets , ones most likely to resemble the rocky planets in our own Solar System .
Of the 28 planets known with masses below 20 Earth - masses , Harps has now identified 24 of them - and six of those are in the newly announced group .
" We have two candidates at five Earth - masses and two at six Earth - masses , " Professor Udry told BBC News .
Combined approach Harps has previously identified an object which is only twice as massive as the Earth ( announced in April ) .
Scientists are confident this planet harbours no life , though , because it orbits so close to its parent star that surface temperatures would be scorching .
In revealing the new collection of planets on Monday , the Harps team - members said they expected to confirm the existence of another batch , similar in number , during the coming six months .
The ultimate goal is to find a rocky planet in a star 's " habitable zone " , an orbit where temperatures are in a range that would support the presence of liquid water .
Scientists believe the introduction of newer , more sensitive technologies will allow them to identify such an object within just a few years from now .
The US space agency ( Nasa ) recently launched its Kepler telescope .
This hopes to find Earth - size planets by looking for the tiny dip in light coming from a star as an object crosses its face as viewed from Earth .
To properly characterise a planet , different observing techniques are required .
The Kepler " transit " method reveals the diameter of an object , but a Harps - like measurement is needed to resolve the mass .

The little town of Tenaha , Texas has been all over the news in the last year after several defense attorneys revealed the town 's police had been pulling over motorists along a main highway , seizing their property ( cars , cash , jewelry , etc. ) , then presenting them with an unsavory bargain :
Sign a waiver forfeiting all of their property over to the police , or be arrested for drug crimes where , even if innocent , they 'd face a night or more in jail and attorney and court fees that would usually amount to more than what the property was worth .
One defense attorney found that of 200 seizures made by Tenaha police between and 2008 , just 50 were ever criminally charged .
That 's actually about average for forfeiture cases .
It 's the bargain Tenaha police struck with motorists , nearly of them black , that 's illegal .
Tenaha 's police department and Shelby County District Attorney Lynda K. Russell — who used forfeiture funds to pay for a Christmas party and to buy tickets to a motorcycle rally — are now subject to a federal civil rights investigation and a federal civil rights lawsuit filed on behalf of motorists by the ACLU of Texas .
Here 's the crazy part : Russell is attempting to use proceeds from the county 's forfeiture fund to pay for her legal defense .
That is , she wants to raid the fund she 's accused of stealing from motorists to fund in order ot defend herself from accusations that she stole from motorists to fund it .
The ultimate irony here is that when law enforcement officials freeze a suspect 's assets in anticipation of a drug prosecution , the suspect is n't allowed to use any of those assets to pay for his own legal defense .
The ACLU of Texas is asking the state attorney general to block Russell .
Constantine " Connie " Xinos is the president of the home - owners ' association in a gated community in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook .
He dislikes being near poor people ( he successfully blocked a permit for a senior 's home , stating , " I do n't want to live next to poor people .
I do n't want poor people in my town " ) .
He reportedly worked to elect an Oak Brook village council who would shut down the town library , which he also campaigned against .
When local kids showed up at town meetings to ask that their library be left open , he is quoted as saying , " I do n't care that you guys miss the librarian , and she was nice , and she helped you find books ; " and to the library staff to " stop whining . "
The librarians are now attempting to unionize under the Teamsters .
Sydney was upset and " her little friend was in tears " after Xinos spoke at the meeting last week , says mom Hope Sabbagha .
" I wanted that kid to lose sleep that night , " a grinning Xinos says Wednesday , as he invites me for a nearly two - hour interview in his Mercedes - Benz in the gated Oak Brook community where he lives .
" This is the real world and the lesson , you folks who brought your kids here , is if you want something , pay for it … "
A poor kid who grew up in Berwyn and worked in his dad 's cafeteria in Chicago , Xinos went to law school and served in the Marines .
Xinos says he speaks for Oak Brook 's view of the Teamsters when he says , " Nobody here likes those kind of people . "
Xinos , who says he never had children in part because he was n't sure he'd be able to support them , sprinkles the F - word throughout his conversations .
He dismisses a recent library event involving dogs with a blunt three - word rant in which he bookends swear words around the word " that . "
Ugly battle has librarians in Oak Brook turning to Teamsters
( Thanks , Lynn ! )

The online encyclopaedia invites anyone to edit entries Wikipedia has disputed claims that it has lost a huge number of editors that help maintain the online encyclopaedia .
On 26 November it was reported that ten times more editors had left Wikipedia in early 2009 than during the same period in 2008 .
The group overseeing the reference work said the claims on losses were not accurate , blaming a difference in what counts as an " editor " .
By contrast , it said , the numbers of people editing Wikipedia were stable .
In a blog post the Wikimedia Foundation responded to the publication of a report by researcher Dr Felipe Ortega which said that 49,000 editors had departed Wikipedia in the first three months of 2009 .
Dr Ortega 's comparisons suggest that only about 4,900 left the site in the first few months of 2008 .
Wikipedia relies on editors to keep the online reference work up to date , expand entries and make corrections .
Writing on the blog , Erik Moeller , deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation , and Erik Zachte , one of its data analysts , said that while Dr Ortega 's article comprehensively described the challenges and opportunities facing Wikipedia it mischaracterised the changes in its editing population .
The pair said that the numbers of people contributing to Wikipedia hit a high in early 2007 , declined slightly and have since stabilised .
" Every month , some people stop writing , and every month , they are replaced by new people , " they wrote .
The confusion arose over the differing definitions of what constitutes an editor .
Dr Ortega counted everyone who made one change as an editor giving a total population of three million people .
By contrast , the Wikimedia Foundation counts only people who make five edits or more as an editor .
This gives an editing population of about one million people across all languages .
Of that total , the English edition of Wikipedia has about 40,000 editors .
The pair also disputed Dr Ortega 's attempt to measure when Wikipedia editors start and stop .
" It 's impossible to make a determination that a person has left and will never edit again , there are methodological challenges with determining the long term trend of joining and leaving , " read the blog .
The Wikimedia Foundation said it was continuing to work with Dr Ortega to iron out some of the methodological difficulties and uncover long term editing trends .

As promised , we finally present our sequel to the Top 10 Most Evil Women list .
The women on this list are all infamous for the horrors they caused .
It is a very difficult topic to rank , so I have done my best to do so in an objective manner .
If you think anyone is missing from either of these two lists , be sure to tell us in the comments .
10 . Williamina “ Minnie ” Dean 1844 – 1895
Death Toll : 3 +
Minnie Dean was the first , and only , woman to be executed in the history of New Zealand .
She was executed by hanging .
Under the guise of helping poor young girls , this evil woman murdered their children and took what little money they had to improve her own lifestyle .
At the time , a young woman becoming pregnant without a father was severely stigmatized by society .
This gave rise to a phenomenon called “ baby farming ” , in which people would offer to take the children and raise them for a moderate regular fee .
Dean was one such farmer , but rather than raising the children , she murdered them at the soonest opportunity and kept the money .
This was made possible because “ adopting ” parents were not required to be registered by law .
In many cases the children simply vanished in to the homes of these “ farmers ” never to be seen again .
Dean murdered at least 3 children , but it is likely that there were many more whose bodies were not recovered .
In my youth I was given a tour of the New Zealand Police private museum , and I saw the bones of the 3 recovered children – it was something I will never forget .
9. Dorothea Puente 1929
Death Toll : 9
Dorothy Puente was an elderly woman who ran a boarding house for down and outs .
During her years in the house she slowly murdered the people who lived with her , and forged their signatures on social security checks , in order to live the high life .
She refused to allow her tenants to touch the phone or mail .
She would take any money that was sent to them and keep most of it for herself .
Among her victims were drunks , and schizophrenics .
One of the bodies found in the back yard had had its head , arms and legs removed .
The money she stole helped pay for luxury clothing and perfume , as well as a face lift shortly before she was caught .
Puente showed no remorse for her crimes and is currently serving time in jail where she will die .
8. Karla Homolka
1970
Death Toll : 3 ( at least 5 others suspected )
Karla Homolka is a Canadian serial killer who attracted worldwide media attention when she was convicted of helping her husband , Paul Bernardo , rape and murder teenage girls .
Her victims included her sister , Tammy Homolka .
Karla videotaped her husband brutalizing and murdering young women – these videotapes were used against them in court , and parts have leaked on to the internet despite the fact that the Canadian government ordered the videos destroyed .
Shockingly , Homolka was released from jail in 2005 after just 12 years , and is now living in the sunny paradise that is the West Indies .
Justice , commonwealth style .
7. Elena Ceau?escu 1916 – 1989
Death Toll : Genocidal
Elena Ceau?escu was a Romanian self - proclaimed scientist , wife of Romania ’s Communist leader , Nicolae Ceau?escu , and Vice Prime Minister of Romania .
Romanians hold Elena Ceau?escu responsible for the elimination of birth control , which created crisis conditions during the 1970s and 1980s , resulting in a flood of unwanted infants , babies and children , that were housed in substandard state operated orphanages throughout the country .
She also headed the State health commission , which denied the existence of AIDS in Romania , leading to one of the largest outbreaks ( including pediatric cases ) in the western world .
She was also responsible for the destruction of churches and the food rationing that took place in Romania in the 1980s .
She was eventually executed for her crimes against humanity , and died screaming “ go to hell ” to her executor .
I wonder how she is finding it there .
6. Elizabeth I of England 1533 – 1603
Death Toll : Thousands ( at least )
Elizabeth I , in order to suppress Catholicism , had thousands of Catholics in England and Ireland murdered .
While she did good things with regards to parliament , she was an evil tyrant who is , unfortunately , portrayed as “ Good Queen Bess ” these days ( as we know , the victors write history ) .
Additionally , Elizabeth gave Mary , Queen of Scots refuge , then immediately betrayed her and kept her prisoner for nearly 19 years , before murdering her ( with no intervening freedom ! ) .
She encouraged piracy against Spanish ships and allowed the slave trade to thrive .
5. Marybeth Tinning 1942
Death Toll : 9
Between 1972 and 1985 , Tinning had 8 children and adopted another one , all of whom she murdered .
Throughout the period of the deaths , no one had any suspicion that she was murdering them , and genetics was blamed .
This happened despite the fact that her adopted child was the seventh child murdered .
She confessed to smothering her children , but later retracted the confession .
She was eventually sentenced to 20 years in prison – since then , both attempts at parole have been denied .
4. Rosemary West 1953
Death Toll : 12 +
Together with her husband Fred , Rosemary West is believed to have tortured and murdered at least 12 young women .
In August , 1992 , Fred West was arrested after being accused of raping his 13 - year - old daughter three times , and Rosemary West was arrested for child cruelty .
The Wests developed a habit of picking up girls from bus stops in and around Gloucester , England , and imprisoning them in their home for several days before killing them .
West had a voracious sexual appetite and enjoyed extreme bondage and sadomasochistic sex .
She was bisexual , and many of their victims were picked up for her and her husband ’s sexual pleasure .
West also worked as a prostitute .
Two of her children were fathered by these clients .
West is one of only two women ever to be condemned to die in prison in the United Kingdom ( the other was Myra Hindley , who has since died in prison ) .
3. Phoolan Devi 1963 – 2001
Death Toll : 22 +
Phoolan Devi was an Indian Dacoit ( armed robber ) , who had a brief career as a politician later in her life .
In the 1970s she was kidnapped by a gang of dacoits , and she eventually joined them in their crimes .
At one point she was raped by a group of men in Behmai , a village they attacked .
She managed to escape and continued her life of crime , stealing from the wealthy .
She eventually returned to Behmai , where she ordered all of the men in the village lined up and shot .
At least 22 men were murdered at her command .
She was finally arrested , and spent 11 years in jail .
She went in to politics but her short lived career ended due to abuse of her power .
Shockingly , in 1998 , Phoolan Devi was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by some members of the British Parliament .
In 2001 , she was assassinated by a man in revenge for the murders she caused in Behmai .
2. Delphine LaLaurie 1775 – 1842 ( ?)
Death Toll : 10 +
LaLaurie was a sadistic socialite who lived in New Orleans .
Her home was a chamber of horrors .
On April 10 , 1834 , a fire broke out in the mansion ’s kitchen , and firefighters found two slaves chained to the stove .
They appeared to have started the fire themselves , in order to attract attention .
The firefighters were lead by other slaves to the attic , where the real surprise was .
Over a dozen disfigured and maimed slaves were manacled to the walls or floors .
Several had been the subjects of gruesome medical experiments .
One man appeared to be part of some bizarre sex change , a woman was trapped in a small cage with her limbs broken and reset to look like a crab , and another woman with arms and legs removed , and patches of her flesh sliced off in a circular motion to resemble a caterpillar .
Some had had their mouths sewn shut and had subsequently starved to death , whilst others had their hands sewn to different parts of their bodies .
Most were found dead , but some were alive and begging to be killed , to release them from the pain .
LaLaurie fled before she could be bought to justice – she was never caught .
You can read a more indepth article on Delphine LaLaurie here .
1. Jiang Qing 1914 – 1991
Death Toll : 500,000 +
Jiang Qing was the wife of Mao Tse-tung , the Communist dictator of China .
Through clever maneuvering she managed to reach the highest position of power within the communist party ( short of being President ) .
It is believed that she was the main driving force behind China ’s Cultural Revolution ( of which she was the deputy director ) .
During the Cultural Revolution , much economic activity was halted , and countless ancient buildings , artifacts , antiques , books and paintings were destroyed by Red Guards .
The 10 years of the Cultural Revolution also brought the education system to a virtual halt , and many intellectuals were sent to prison camps .
Millions of people in China reportedly had their human rights annulled during the Cultural Revolution .
Millions more were also forcibly displaced .
Estimates of the death toll – civilians and Red Guards – from various Western and Eastern sources are about 500,000 in the true years of chaos of 1966 — 1969 , but some estimates are as high as 3 million deaths , with 36 million being persecuted .
Conclusion
We have now shown 20 evil women and I am sorry to say that I have found enough to do a third list in the future .
Women , and mothers in particular , are trusted by society to raise future generations – what a tragedy when things go so wrong that we end up with murderous mothers .
It strikes me that there must be some warning sign of impending evil with these people – is there any way we can detect it , and if so , can anything be done to prevent the evil from blossoming ?
Do we have a moral right to dispose of these people before they can do any damage ?

Many business owners and marketing professionals respond to the social media buzz with what Olivier Blanchard calls the “ Social Media Terror Syndrome “ — a wait and see approach .
The next barrier is often a lack of time .
And the focus becomes “ how do I avoid the social media time suck ? ”
Here are 7 steps to help you overcome the time dilemma .
1. Set One Specific Social Media Objective
One of the reasons why people waste time on social media is because their objectives are :
Not clearly linked to their business strategy
Inappropriate for the environment of social media
Do n’t be surprised if you find you need to participate in social media for a little while before you find the right way to use it for your business objectives .
Take the time to observe your audience and learn how to connect with them on social media .
Read the Social Media Marketing Report to understand how other marketers are using social media .
Return on time investment :
Before you see any return on your time investment in social media , you need know what your business can get out of it .
Do n’t jump into social media with both feet and no business objective .
Develop your social media presence with one clearly defined business objective in mind .
2. Find the Right Social Media Strategy for Your Business
This is what Mari Smith , the Pied Piper of Facebook , says : “ The main reason people fail in social media is lack of a strategy .
There ’s so much confusing and conflicting advice out there , it ’s easy to get lost in the social media jungle .
By having a clear objective , developing a strategy to accomplish that objective , and measuring milestones along the way , you ’re bound to have better results . ”
What can you say on social media that would interest your audience ?
How should you say it ?
Where should you say it ?
Many businesses choose to use a blog as their central social media hub .
A pivotal role is played by what Authority Blogger Chris Garrett calls Flagship Content .
The truth is that your social media strategy needs to be tailored to the particular message you want to convey to your audience .
Return on time investment :
When you include a clear objective in the social media strategy most appropriate for your business , it boosts your overall marketing strategy .

3. Make Your Presence Social
Once you have defined your social media strategy , the process does not end there .
It will only work if your presence is truly social and , as Rebecca Leaman says , you need to also “ focus on being good online neighbors . ”
A good resource to find out how to connect with your audience is Groundswell .

It is a social environment .
Businesses need to create a social presence and it can be hard to find the balance between business and social .
Do n’t fall into traps when adapting your marketing to social media .
As Chris Brogan says , the question of friending and reputation “ is difficult in the face - to - face world , but it ’s even harder online . ”
Return on time investment : Social media marketing creates stronger relationships with the people in your market .
You can use it to build trust and loyalty with more people and in less time than with most other marketing tactics .
Do n’t waste time by getting sidetracked .
Adapt social media to work for your business .
5. Adopt Social Media One Step at a Time
Amber Naslund says trying to be everywhere on social media is a big time waster .
Social media is made up of numerous different places where people hang out , and these places all have different environments .
You cannot try to be everywhere all at once and know how to act and what to say .
You need to take things slowly :
Research to find out where your business should be present .
Observe and learn what to say .
Listen and learn how to adapt to each different site .
Be sure to add your own social touch to all of your social media communication .
Have a look at Chris Brogan ’s social media task suggestions .
Look at them closely and you will see how these tasks add extra value to his marketing strategy as a whole .
Return on time investment :
When you choose your actions wisely and add some social juice to them , they can give you back much more than you put in .
Do n’t try to jump into all social media platforms at once .
Find the social media sites that work best for your business .
6. Get Extra Mileage Out of Your Social Media Marketing
Many businesses look at what the social media “ stars ” are doing and think they would never have the time to do the same thing .
Here is the scoop :
You need to get into social media before you can fully understand how your time spent can multiply in value .
Once you get your basic social media presence up and running , something very interesting happens .
You begin to see little things to do to get a much wider presence on social media .
Return on time investment :
The good news is that you can get extra mileage out of your daily social media actions as soon as you begin .
One of the very first things you need to do when you begin marketing using social media is to set up professional listening activities .
The time you spend on this aspect alone usually adds much more value to your overall sales and marketing activities than you can imagine .
Do n’t waste opportunities for more visibility and buzz .
Adopt the social attitude .
7. Avoid Social Media ’s Fatal Attraction : The Shiny Bells and Whistles
The truth is that there is a lot of movement in the social media arena .
New social media tools , applications and platforms hit the news every week .
And you just do not know who the key players will be this time next year .
It ’s natural for businesses to hesitate in investing time in such a climate .
Return on time investment :
The key is to focus on developing social skills and to integrate these into your marketing strategy .
This is how you can spend your time wisely and be well - prepared as :
Marketing becomes social
Media habits change
Do n’t focus on the social media tools .
Focus on developing the social skills you need for your business to create a strong social presence .
Use Social Media to Add Extra Value to Your Current Marketing Strategy
Social media helps businesses to create stronger relationships with their clients ; for instance , by creating trust agents .
This trust factor can be so powerful it removes the question of time investment .
Social media marketing can save your business time when it is included within your overall marketing plan .
When you add the ability to build trust , social media becomes a powerful marketing tactic not to be ignored .
These are just some examples of how to integrate social media into an overall marketing strategy to save businesses time .

Hi , Ken ,
The best description of this is from a book called A Man on the Moon : The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts by Andrew Chaikin .
You should definitely read it if you 're interested in the Apollo missions .
Here is an excerpt from Chapter 3 , " First Around the Moon " :
But one aspect of weightlessness was so unpleasant was so unpleasant that even the thrill of exploration did n't make up for it .
If this marvel of engineering called Apollo had one major design flaw , it was the ' Waste Management System , ' perhaps the most euphemistic use of English ever recorded .
For urine collection there was a hose with a condom - like fitting at one end which led , by way of a valve , to a vent on the side of the spacecraft .
On paper at least , it seemed like a reasonable , if low - tech , way to handle urinating in zero g , assuming you got over your anxiety about connecting yor private parts to the vacuum of space .
You roll on the condom , open the valve , and it all goes into the void where it freezes into droplets of ice that are iridescent in the sunlight .
One astronaut answered the question " What 's the most beautiful sight you ever saw in space ? " with " Urine dump at sunset . "
In reality , using the urine collector did n't work so well .
For one thing , it could be painful .
If you opened the valve too soon , some part of the mechanism was liable to poke into the end of your penis , which prevented you from urinating .
And at that point , as if to confirm your worst fears , the suction began to pull you in .
Now you were being jabbed and pulled at the same time , so you shut the valve , and as the mechanism resealed itself it caught a little piece of you in it .
It took only one episode like that to convince you to never let it happen again .
Next time you had a strategy : start flowing a split - second before you turn on the valve .
But once you began to urinate the condom popped off and out came a flurry of little golden droplets at play in the wonderland , floating around and making your misfortune everybody 's misfortune !
And in no time at all the whole device reeked ; it was an affront to the senses just sitting there .
The astronauts got used to the urine collector , though , and they got used to mopping up afterwards .
But there was no getting used to the other part of the Waste Management System .
Tucked away in a strange locker was a supply of special plastic bags , each of which resembled a top hat with an adhesive coating on the brim .
Each bag had a finger - shaped pocket built into the side of it .
When the call came you had to flypaper this thing to your rear end , and then you were supposed to reach in there through the pocket with your finger --- after all , nothing falls in zero gravity --- and suddenly you were wishing you had never left home .
And after you had it in the bag , so to speak , you had one last delightful task : break open a capsule of blue germicide , seal it up in the bag , and knead the contents to make sure they were fully mixed !
At best , the operation was an ordeal .
In the confined space of the Apollo command module , your crewmates suffered , too .
One of the Apollo 7 astronauts said the smell was so bad it woke him out of a deep sleep .
When the crew came back they wrote a memo about it : " Get naked , allow an hour , have plenty of tissues handy . "
In his column for the Washington Post on Tuesday , the influential conservative George Will provided intellectual fodder for the campaign among some Republicans to hang the Afghanistan war around the Obama administration 's neck .
Washington , he wrote , should " keep faith " with our fighting men and women by " rapidly reversing the trajectory of America 's involvement in Afghanistan . "
" Obama 's war , " a locution one is now beginning to hear from other conservatives , is an expression of discontent that has been smoldering beneath the surface for several months .
Many Democrats were also uneasy with or outright hostile to the policies of President George H.W. Bush .
That included strong criticisms of the U.S. liberation of Panama and widespread Democratic opposition to the first Gulf War , which only 10 Senate Democrats voted to authorize .
WASHINGTON 
Not long after he was rousted from bed and seized in a predawn raid in Pakistan in March 2003 , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed gave his captors two demands :
He wanted a lawyer , and he wanted to be taken to New York .
After a nearly seven - year odyssey that took him to secret Central Intelligence Agency jails in Europe and an American military prison in Cuba , Mr. Mohammed is finally likely to get his wish .
He will be the most senior leader of Al Qaeda to date held to account for the mass murder of nearly 3,000 Americans , facing trial in Manhattan while his boss , Osama bin Laden , continues to elude a worldwide dragnet .
Yet the boastful , calculating and fiercely independent Mr. Mohammed has never neatly fit the mold of Qaeda chieftain .
He has little use for the high - minded moralizing of some of his associates , and for years before the Sept. 11 attacks , he refused to swear an oath of loyalty to Mr. bin Laden  figuring that if the Qaeda leader canceled the Sept. 11 plot , he would not have to obey the order .
I have n't commented on Michael 's much - talked - about piece in The New Republic , in which he argues -- and I have n't read it closely - enough yet , so pardon any possible misinterpretation -- that the mission of the Goldstone report is to essentially deny Israel the right to self - defense -- because I 'm so effing busy with actual journalism right now .
But I thought this reaction from Andrew is interesting , and I 'll try to write about the whole thing later .
Israel , Andrew writes , should try to " get some perspective and to see , for a moment , how things might look from the outside . "
I can see why they may feel encircled and alone .
But they 're not .
Even those of us who have been made angry by their recent actions and seeming unconcern for the needs of their most powerful friend , want to help .
God knows I love Israel and its people ; and I understand that some of the extremism among neocons is really an excess of passion and love rather than mere belligerence and orneriness .
But , seriously guys , get a grip .
Help the US help you .
And try to see the wider picture .
I remember once in Beirut an American diplomat complaining to me about Israel , as American diplomats will often do , especially in places like Beirut .
She said , in essence , " I do n't understand why Israel behaves the way it does .
It has the support of the most powerful country in the world , a powerful military , an educated population , and nuclear bombs .
If I had that , I would n't feel so lonely . "
What she was doing was mirror - imaging , not seeing the world through the eyes of the people she was ostensibly trying to understand .
In other words , she was seeing Israel 's world through the eyes of a Christian American .
The point is , the past can be used to predict Israel 's behavior , just as it can be used to predict most anyone 's behavior , and the Jewish past was very often a bitch .
But while the world has an obligation to understand Israel and its motivations ( or , at least , an abiding interest in gaining such an understanding )
Israel has an interest in understanding why the world might see some of its actions as excessive .
I 'm not referring here to Israel 's reaction to the Goldstone report , which was a pre-cooked travesty , but to more legitimate criticism about its settlements and its actions in Gaza .
I 'm not arguing that Israel must agree with every criticism , but I am arguing that not every single criticism of Israel is motivated by a desire to exterminate the Jewish state .
Secret CCTV cameras fitted INSIDE people 's homes to spy on neighbours outside
CCTV cameras are being fitted inside family homes by council ' snoopers ' to spy on neighbours in the street outside , it was revealed today .
The £ 1,000 security cameras have been placed inside properties but are trained on the streets to gather evidence of anti-social behaviour .
Each device is linked to a laptop computer and accessible online by police and council officials 24 hours a day .
But the trial inside two homes by Croydon council in south London has sparked new fears about invasion of privacy and Britain 's ‘ surveillance society ’ .
The high street in Addington , Croydon .
The London borough has become the first to test out placing CCTV cameras inside homes
And critics said the extra surveillance was only needed because police had failed to tackle the problem .
A council spokesman said the cameras would allow the authorities to respond quickly to anti-social behaviour and gather evidence for criminal prosecutions .
He denied they would be used to spy on neighbours and said more cameras could be installed if the pilot proves a success .
But critics say the scheme has echoes of the East German Stasi secret police , which recruited members of the public as spies .
Charles Farrier , of No- CTV , said that the move was ‘ a step further in our Big Brother society ’ .
He said : ‘ There is no evidence they act as a deterrent and we should be concentrating on the root problem anyway and working to gel our communities .
Alex Deane , director of Big Brother Watch , warned the cameras would create a ' culture of fear and mistrust ' .
The cameras are used to look for anti-social behaviour ( file picture )
He said : ' People accept these cameras into their homes because they are afraid .
' The council might be installing them with the best intentions , but the end result is a culture of fear and mistrust driven by a failure on the part of the borough and the police to have proper law enforcement in this area .
' Better to have real action from the failing authorities than to extend once more our surveillance society . '
A Croydon spokeswoman confirmed that the cameras cannot be seen from the street and refused to say in which areas they had been installed .
Residents taking part did not want their families or locations identified for fear of reprisals .
Images can be viewed on a computer and accessed remotely and the evidence used to take people to court .
The trials have been running for the past week .
But some local residents have backed the idea .
Kirenna Chin , 30 , said : ‘ Louts use my hedge as a bouncy castle and urinate in my front garden .
It 's very intimidating .
‘ It 's a fantastic idea to fit hidden CCTV .
If they offered me one I would definitely take it . ’
Gavin Barwell , Croydon 's cabinet member for community safety , said : ‘ This is good news for residents .
‘ These CCTV kits give us another weapon to fight anti-social behaviour quickly .
We 'll be working together with the police to put them to best use . ’
Croydon has one of London 's most advanced CCTV networks .
The control room is open 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and there are 77 fixed cameras , a rapid - response mobile unit , and three wireless units .
When the hostess agency put out the call for attractive , well - dressed women , under the age of 35 and over 1.7 metres ( 5ft 7in ) tall , it was inundated with responses from hundreds of Roman women .
Most seemed to think they would be bringing a little glamour to a gala dinner with the Libyan leader , Muammar Gaddafi .
Instead , they found themselves being lectured by him for two hours on the role of women and invited to convert to Islam .
" We were at least expecting a snack " , grumbled Silvia Figliozzi afterwards .
An engineering graduate , Figliozzi was among more than 100 young Italian women who were today recovering their equilibrium after a characteristically bizarre encounter with the " guide of the first of September great revolution of the socialist people 's Libyan Arab jamahiriya " .
The women at Sunday 's event were promised € 50 ( £ 45 ) and told not to arrive in miniskirts or low - cut tops .
They assembled outside a hotel in the centre , where several were rejected because they were either too short or revealingly dressed .
The rest – most teetering on stilettos and some wrapped in furs – boarded buses and were driven to the Libyan ambassador 's residence .
According to the Italian news agency Ansa , about 200 filed through the heavily protected gates , where a security guard insisted to reporters that they were assembling for a " medical conference " .
After a delay of an hour , Gaddafi appeared , in a black uniform with a black beret .
As he launched into his address , female members of his entourage distributed embossed copies of the Qu'ran and the colonel 's own great work , The Green Book .
Gaddafi , who arrived in Rome on Sunday for a summit of the UN's food and agricultural organisation , also told his audience he had it on good authority Jesus was not crucified .
" God in heaven took him .
They crucified someone who looked like him , " the Libyan leader was quoted as saying by an Ansa reporter who posed as a hostess .
Claiming he was " for and alongside women " , Gaddafi criticised the way they were treated in eastern countries .
" They are often used like bits of furniture , changed whenever the man wants .
And that is an injustice , " said Gaddafi .
When it comes to surrounding himself with women , Libya 's leader can outshine even Italy 's prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi .
On his last visit to Rome , in June , he prevailed upon Berlusconi 's government to gather several hundred women for a not dissimilar lecture .
Further encounters with selected representatives of Italian womanhood are due to take place tonight and tomorrow .
At least one of the women who crammed into the Libyan ambassador 's home on Sunday left feeling " offended " by Gaddafi 's view of Christianity .
But for another , Rea Beko , it turned out to be a life - changing experience .
" He convinced me , " she said .
" I shall be converting to Islam . "
A science writer who is being sued for libel by the British Chiropractic Association is to fight on after a preliminary judgment against him was opened up to appeal today .
Simon Singh was sued by the BCA after he wrote an article in the Guardian criticising the association for supporting members who claim that chiropractic treatments – which involve manipulation of the spine – can treat children 's colic , sleeping and feeding problems , frequent ear infections , asthma and prolonged crying .
Singh described the treatments , for which he said there is no evidence , as " bogus " and criticised the BCA for " happily promoting " them .
In May , Mr Justice Eady in the high court ruled on the meaning of the words , saying they implied the association was being deliberately dishonest .
Singh said that interpretation would make it difficult for him to defend himself at a full trial .
Singh was initially refused leave to appeal , but Eady 's interpretation was deemed to be open to argument by Lord Justice Laws , who said Eady had risked swinging the balance of rights too far in favour of the right to reputation and against the right to free expression .
It was arguable , he said , that Eady 's judgment on what constituted comment had been wrong in law : " It is arguable that his approach to the issue of whether something that was objectively verifiable could be a comment was legally erroneous ... I give no finding as to the end result .
I only give reasons why the appeal ought to be allowed to go forward . "
Many scientists and science writers have rallied to Singh 's support , claiming that the freedom of scientific opinion is at stake .
Speaking after the judgment , Singh said this was the " best possible result " .
" Simon Singh 's battle in this libel case is not only a glaring example of how the law and its interpretation are stifling free expression , it shows how urgent the case for reform has become , " said Jo Glanville , editor of Index on Censorship .
• This article was amended on 20 and 22 October 2009 .
The original reported Simon Singh 's contested Guardian piece as having said there was " not a lot of evidence " for the claims made for certain chiropractic treatments .
A heading said that the latest appeal court ruling had overturned the high court 's preliminary judgment .
The text also described the appeal court as having rejected the high court ruling and termed it " legally erroneous " .
This has been corrected .
It is often asserted that climate change will affect women the most in the developing world .
That 's because most women will have to walk farther for drinking water , work harder to grow food , pull daughters out of school to help with family chores , and fuss more about family hygiene as the world – and particularly the developing world – becomes a hotter , drier place to live .
But women could also be the key agents of change that help countries to do a better job of preparing for climate change , and mitigating the damage .
That is the intriguing idea that comes out of a new report , issued Tuesday by the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , at an Arab League summit held in Cairo this week .
" We cannot successfully confront climate change if we neglect the needs , rights , and potential of half the people on our planet , " said Thoraya Ahmed Obaid , executive director of the UNFPA , last week at the launch of the UN's State of World Population 2009 report , which is getting a second push at the Arab League summit in Cairo .
" Women should be part of any agreement on climate change – not as an afterthought or because it 's politically correct , but because it 's the right thing to do , " Ms. Obaid said .
" Our future as humanity depends on unleashing the full potential of all human beings , and the full capacity of women , to bring about change . "
What women do now
Women in the developing world do n't need to be told that 10 of the warmest years since 1880 have occurred in the past 15 years .
That the world 's climate is changing rapidly is not a matter of debate for women in the developing world , especially in the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East .
From Senegal to Sudan and down to the Persian Gulf , traditional roles still assign men the task of earning wages , and women the task of scratching out an existence cooking food , gathering firewood , fetching water , raising food crops , as well as giving birth to , raising , cleaning , and feeding children :
• Women are behind 80 percent of all food production in sub-Saharan Africa , including the rapidly drying region of the Sahel , from Senegal to Sudan .
• In 56 developing countries , the poorest fifth of women still give birth to an average of six children , compared with 3.2 births for the wealthiest fifth .
• More than 200 million women say they want to delay or prevent pregnancies , but do not use contraception .
• There is a strong link between smaller families and greater prosperity .
Researchers attribute a large portion of East Asia 's phenomenal postwar growth to the fact that the region had relatively slow population growth , with more productive workers and fewer dependants
• Studies suggest that investing in women 's education and expanding their numbers in the workforce can boost per capita income in some countries by 14 percent by 2020 .
Step for women equals leap for mankind
Improving education and healthcare choices for women , and even access to clean fuels , would have profound effects not just on the prosperity and health of individual families , but more broadly on the developing countries they live in .
Keeping a lid on population growth , in particular , would also allow developing nations – which make up 80 percent of the world 's overall population – but which consume only 20 percent of the world 's energy resources and contribute only 30 percent of the world 's greenhouse gases .
" Women can be more affected by climate change , but they can also be agents of change in their communities and in their families , " says Hafedh Chekir , regional office director of UNFPA , speaking by phone between sessions at the Arab League summit .
" Women can push to be more organized in their community around common issues , like in Darfur about water issues or about wood for cooking , about desertification , about forced migration . "
In Djibouti , for instance , women in rural areas organized a collective bus service for pregnant women to travel into urban areas for checkups and to give birth at maternity hospitals .
The initiative has spread to 40 communities , where women collect money from residents , thereby ensuring that any prospective mother will be able to have a safe birth .
" Women 's participation can ensure that problems are solved more creatively , " says Mr. Chekir .
Not an easy sell
Selling a more women - friendly policy on climate change is hard enough in developed countries of the West , so it will certainly not be easy at the Arab League summit .
Even so , UN officials are hoping that moderate regimes will act in their own enlightened self - interest .
Desertification is expanding rapidly in north Africa and the rest of the Arab world , and with some 5 percent of the world 's population , but 1 percent of the world 's fresh water resources , the Arab world is rapidly approaching a water crisis .
" We have to do this step by step , and it's a long - term work , " says Chekir .
" But we have to be optimistic , or else nothing will change in the Arab region .
We believe we can do small changes , and the Arab League wants our help to do development issues . "

They are rarely reported to police , the young women preferring instead to carry on with their university life , or worse , leave defeated by the cult of college , fearing retribution should they disclose the crime .
Of course , not everyone experiences college life in this way .
Many thrive on it and love the social life , the instant family that residential living creates .
'' Friends for life '' is often used to describe the most valuable , tangible thing many get out of college .
Many more will experience outrage and disbelief reading this article , such is the faith in the inherent goodness of college .
Yet behind the scenes there is deep concern about a culture that at times appears out of control .
As the outgoing master of Wesley College , David Russell , says : '' These places generate and perpetuate a form of tribalism , which could be and is probably well described as sexist . ''
Of his eight years in the role , Russell says : '' Hindsight is a good thing .
I would have done some things differently . ''
Such as ?
'' Acted against a certain student earlier .
There was a boys ' club mentality - I have seen it twice in the eight years I have been here , and the thing that I learnt is that you can never take your hands off the steering wheel otherwise the car just hurtles out of control . ''
He says binge drinking is a big problem for colleges , and the fact that there are 13 licensed premises around the perimeter of the university often creates concerns .
'' I have had a couple of incidents where the girls have reported an unwanted assault … and usually the girl decides not to proceed [ with the report ] because they perceive they would have to leave the college . ''
If the assailant is a Wesley boy , he is not invited back to the college next semester , Russell says .
'' In 2007 there were a number of boys who were not invited back …
They sit in front of me and lie to my face about certain behaviours , and I hear from police reports and other sources completely different stories and I say , ' Sorry you are not coming back . ' ''
The new master of Wesley College - its first female master - Lisa Sutherland , says she plans to tackle the problem head on .
'' That is what I will be doing from day one .
It is hard …
You can be winning the battle and you have a whole new group come in and you almost have to start again . ''
Russell says there is disagreement between colleges about the inter - college harassment policy , and that one college in particular is quick to reach for a legal team to get its boys out of trouble rather than force them to face the consequences .
Indeed , the only college to respond to the Herald 's inquiries via a letter from its lawyers was St Paul 's College .
It is also worth noting that the problem is no more or less acute at Wesley College - it 's just that the leaders of Wesley were prepared to openly discuss the problem of sexual violence with the Herald much more frankly than other college leaders .
The principal of the Women 's College , Jane Williamson , and the principal of St Andrew 's College , Wayne Erickson , also acknowledge there are problems .
Of the pro-rape Facebook page established by past and present St Paul 's College students , Williamson says : '' These are shocking allegations and it is a matter of deep concern . ''
She says some students had expressed concerns regarding an Orientation Week party , hosted by another college , known as the Rubik 's Cube , which involves going to a party dressed in one colour and ending up dressed in another .
'' We obviously want our students to have fun … but it should never turn into the sort of behaviour that is demeaning of women , if not illegal .
'' There is a lot of alcohol involved at some of these parties , and we need to ensure that young women are properly protected in those situations .
At the Women 's College we have sought to encourage alternative activities during O - week which are not based on getting drunk - the events we host will be dry events . ''
Williamson says she will be meeting the inter - college group organising O - week to talk about '' what we wo n't be tolerating here ' ' .
Is this about drawing a line in the sand ?
'' I believe so , yes , '' she says .
For Erikson from St Andrew 's College , a so - called '' chalking ' ' incident drew his attention to the potential for social events to go very wrong .
'' I … share your horror and disgust at the blatantly sexist scrawlings which have passed for promotion of the student club's informal , '' he wrote in September last year in response to a letter from a concerned tutor over the ' ' deflowering a virgin : priceless ' ' chalking campaign .
He believes his immediate response and the high - level involvement of the leadership of the college 's student club ensured there had not been a repeat of such obvious sexist messages associated with his college .
Like Wesley College , St Andrew 's is co-ed , but it has only been so since 2002 .
Erikson says the college has sought to '' modify the environment in St Andrew 's to make it a more welcoming place , to address some of the harsher edges caused by laddish behaviour ' ' .
For those who have never lived the college life , it may be difficult to understand the attraction of existing in close quarters with 200 to 300 of your peers .
The St Paul 's website does provide some guidance : '' All the facilities of the college are designed to ensure that men have the greatest possible amenity and can spend as little of their life as possible dwelling on mundane , domestic arrangements .
'' St Paul 's allows the university experience to grow beyond the purely academic routine of lectures and tutorials , and to become true renaissance men in a modern setting . ''
The 200 students dress for a formal dinner Monday to Friday in jacket , tie and academic gown .
It is the only one of six residential colleges within Sydney University to have its own fully licensed bar .
Cecilia ( not her real name ) has worked in residential colleges over the past three years and says she has been '' shocked and horrified by what I saw - I made a conscious effort to avoid the inter - college events because it made me feel so uncomfortable '' .
She is aware of at least two incidents of rape in the colleges and many more times where young women have been put at terrible risk .
'' In one incident , girls in the college could hear the rape going on in the next room and called the resident assistant , who used the master key to get into the room .
'' The girl left college as a consequence .
I do n't know whether or not she went to police , and there did n't seem to be any consequences for the guy , '' Cecilia says .
It is a culture that permeates every fibre of residential life , from the college revues that feature storylines of the date - rape drug Rohypnol being used to help a male student get laid , to breakfasts where the students all wear white baseball caps inscribed with nicknames such as ' ' date rape ' ' and ' ' sloppy seconds ' ' .
That it is able to be played out so openly - on stage , in the large , ornate dining rooms , in publications and event advertising - is difficult to understand .
Another woman remembers : '' I was grabbed in O - Week and held up against a wall as a joke .
My boyfriend found the guy … and … threatened him not to touch me again .
Their response was to leave drunken messages on my phone calling me a slut and a whore and trying to freak me out .
I took it to the principal and they nearly got kicked out , but it pretty much tarnished my reputation there . ''
Annie Cossins is a senior lecturer in the school of law at the University of NSW .
She says consent is very easily eroded '' when you start throwing things in like ' she was drunk ' , ' she was dressed this way ' , ' she came on to me '' ' .
'' It is very easy for men to throw this back at women … and girls do not tend to report because these men are acquaintances …
It is much easier to report stranger rape .
'' There is no recognition of the problem in colleges and there are no solutions put in place to help girls report . ''
Only real leadership will change men's behaviour , Cossins says .
As the young feminist author Emily Macguire noted in her book Princesses and Pornstars , rape - prevention education is possibly better targeted at boys and men than women .
All the self - defence classes in the world wo n't help in the face of a culture that permits such behaviour .
'' Am I arguing that girls and women should n't be held responsible for their behaviour ?
Not at all .
If a woman drinks to excess , then falls over in the street , loses her wallet and vomits all over her shirt , she has only herself to blame , '' she wrote .
'' But rape is not a consequence of getting drunk .
It 's a consequence of a man deciding to rape someone . ''
IN HER OWN WORDS
Elicia , a final - year student at the University of Sydney and a former college resident , writes about the night she was raped in her room on campus .
'' He came home with me … and once we were in my room , things began to get out of my control .
" Making it to my college and to my room gave him a real sense of entitlement , which scared me .
Obviously he thought once we were there , he could do whatever he liked - and it took me a long time to realise how unacceptable that was .
' ' I was saying ' no ' .
At various points I was in and out of consciousness .
It was aggressive enough to leave marks on me .
I had marks all down my legs and knees .
It was a really , really demeaning experience .
It was very violent .
'' I never understood girls who kept quiet about rape .
I always imagined that if I were in that situation I would march straight to the police station .
But having something so invasive and awful happen in the intimacy of my own room , the place I felt safe , just knocked that sense of strength and self assurance out of me .
'' A friend of mine , some time after that , said she had gone home with the same guy and implied that a similar thing had happened to her , and that it was a terrifying experience .
'' I stopped feeling safe in my own college and my own room … and it did take me a long time after that to be comfortable with the idea of being close to guys .
'' Certainly I did n't ever invite anyone back into that room ever again , and I was very wary and conscious of being on my own with any [ St ] Paul 's boy . ''
Of the pro-rape Facebook page , Elicia says : '' It is just so atrocious , but it was n't surprising .
It is part of the whole brotherhood thing where they think it is OK to share these awful things , as long as you do it together .
'' So many people at various stages have tried to talk about this culture in a public forum but it is never allowed .
When I spoke out about the culture of sexual violence … friends and colleagues turned against me and tried to stop me from saying what had happened .
I lost friends over it .
Loading '' It is a culture of cover - up .
That is the most devastating thing .
When you are trying to get people to understand the situation , people in college band together and it is cultish .
It is this weird mentality that if you implicate one of them , you implicate them all .
'' What goes on in Paul 's stays in Paul 's … Boys who are intelligent , rational and lovely to women in their own personal life will still step up and protect one of their own in order not to be excluded . ''
Serious Eater Michael Natkin of the vegetarian blog Herbivoracious drops by every Wednesday to share a delicious recipe to expand our vegetarian repertoire .
Keftes de prasa are de rigeur at most holiday celebrations on the Sephardic side of my family .
Rosh Hashanah , Passover , Hannukah - - it does n't matter .
Any excuse is good enough reason to enjoy these simple leek fritters .
Not much more than leeks , eggs , and breadcrumbs , they are deceptively delicious and addictive .
Almost like latkes but with leeks instead of potatoes .
Like latkes , they are great fun at a celebration , but after sitting out for too long , they lose that perfect crispness that makes fried food really special .
If you make them for a small group and serve them fresh from the pan , I guarantee your guests will be begging for a return invitation .
In this recipe , I 've actually synthesized a couple different traditions .
In my family , the leeks are boiled .
I found a very similar Syrian - Jewish recipe for Ejjeh b'Kerrateh in the superb Aromas of Aleppo by Poopa Dweck , where she sautees the leeks , producing a stronger , better oniony flavor .
The Syrian version also adds subtle flavors of allspice , cinnamon , and hot pepper , which I 've listed as optional ingredients .
I like them , but my wife found them distracting .
On the other hand , the Syrian version does n't use any breadcrumbs , which I think are an important textural element .
If you are nice , maybe someday I 'll tell you about serving keftes de prasa in a sandwich , like falafel .
( By the way , you may find keftes called kyeftes , keftedes , or kifticas .
Our family pronounces them koof - teek - az . )
Keftes De Prasa ( Leek Fritters )
A team of scientists at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ( CSHL ) reports on Thursday their success in solving the molecular structure of a key portion of a cellular receptor implicated in Alzheimer 's , Parkinson's , and other serious illnesses .
Assistant Professor Hiro Furukawa , Ph.D. , and colleagues at CSHL , in cooperation with the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory , obtained crystal structures for one of several " subunits " of the NMDA receptor .
This receptor , formally called the N - methyl - D- aspartate receptor , belongs to a family of cellular receptors that mediate excitatory nerve transmission in the brain .
Excitatory signals represent the majority of nerve signals in most regions of the human brain .
One theory of causation in Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and multiple sclerosis posits that excessive amounts of the excitatory neurotransmitter , glutamate , can cause an overstimulation of glutamate receptors , including the NMDA receptor .
Such excitotoxicity , the theory holds , can cause nerve - cell death and subsequent neurological dysfunction .
A class of inhibitors of the NMDA receptor under the generic name Memantine has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in moderate and severe cases of Alzheimer's .
Memantine is a non-specific inhibitor of the NMDA receptor and is neither a cure nor an agent that can halt progression of the disease .
The search is well under way for molecules that can shut down the NMDA receptor with much greater specificity .
The CSHL team 's work pertains directly to that effort .
The NMDA receptor is modular , composed of multiple domains with distinct functional roles .
Part of the receptor is lodged in the membrane of nerve cells and part juts out from the membrane .
Furukawa 's CSHL team focused on a portion of the so - called extracellular domain of the receptor , a subunit called NR2B , which includes a domain of particular interest called the ATD ( the amino terminal domain ) .
" This part is of great interest to us because it has very little in common with ATDs in other kinds of glutamate receptors involved in nerve transmission , " says Furukawa .
Its uniqueness makes it a potentially interesting target for future drugs .
" Our interest is even keener because we already know there are a rich spectrum of small molecules that can bind the ATD of NMDA receptors . "
Without a highly detailed molecular picture of the ATD , however , efforts to rationally design inhibitors cannot proceed .
Hence the importance of Furukawa 's achievement : a crystal structure revealed by the powerful light source at Brookhaven National Laboratory , that shows the ATD to have a " clamshell " - like appearance that is important for its function .
The results are published in a paper appearing online Thursday ahead of print in The EMBO Journal , the publication of the European Molecular Biology Organization .
The team obtained structures of the ATD domain with and without zinc binding to it .
Zinc is a natural ligand that docks at a spot within the " clamshell " in routine functioning of the NMDA receptor .
Of much greater interest is the location and nature of a suspected binding site of a small molecule type that is known to bind the ATD and inhibit the action of the NMDA receptor .
These inhibitor molecules are members of a class of compounds called phenylethanolamines which " have high efficacy and specificity and show some promise as neuroprotective agents without side effects seen in compounds that bind at the extracellular domain of other receptors , " Furukawa explains .
Now that his team has solved the structure of the ATD domain of the NR2B subunit , it becomes possible to proceed with rational design of a phenylethanolamine - like compound that can precisely bind the ATD within what Furukawa and colleagues call its " clamshell cleft , " based on the crystal structure they have obtained .
The eco-pawprint of a pet dog is twice that of a 4.6 - litre Land Cruiser driven 10,000 kilometres a year , researchers have found .
Victoria University professors Brenda and Robert Vale , architects who specialise in sustainable living , say pet owners should swap cats and dogs for creatures they can eat , such as chickens or rabbits , in their provocative new book Time to Eat the Dog :
The real guide to sustainable living .
The couple have assessed the carbon emissions created by popular pets , taking into account the ingredients of pet food and the land needed to create them .
" If you have a German shepherd or similar - sized dog , for example , its impact every year is exactly the same as driving a large car around , " Brenda Vale said .
" A lot of people worry about having SUVs but they do n't worry about having Alsatians and what we are saying is , well , maybe you should be because the environmental impact ... is comparable . "
In a study published in New Scientist , they calculated a medium dog eats 164 kilograms of meat and 95kg of cereals every year .
It takes 43.3 square metres of land to produce 1 kg of chicken a year .
This means it takes 0.84 hectares to feed Fido .
They compared this with the footprint of a Toyota Land Cruiser , driven 10,000 km a year , which uses 55.1 gigajoules ( the energy used to build and fuel it ) .
One hectare of land can produce 135 gigajoules a year , which means the vehicle 's eco-footprint is 0.41 ha – less than half of the dog's .
They found cats have an eco-footprint of 0.15 ha – slightly less than a Volkswagen Golf .
Hamsters have a footprint of 0.014 ha – keeping two of them is equivalent to owning a plasma TV .
Professor
Vale says the title of the book is meant to shock , but the couple , who do not have a cat or dog , believe the reintroduction of non-carnivorous pets into urban areas would help slow down global warming .
" The title of the book is a little bit of a shock tactic , I think , but though we are not advocating eating anyone 's pet cat or dog there is certainly some truth in the fact that if we have edible pets like chickens for their eggs and meat , and rabbits and pigs , we will be compensating for the impact of other things on our environment . "
Professor Vale took her message to Wellington City Council last year , but councillors said banning traditional pets or letting people keep food animals in their homes were not acceptable options .
Kelly Jeffery , a Paraparaumu german shepherd breeder who once owned a large SUV , said eliminating traditional pets was " over the top " .
" I think we need animals because they are a positive in our society .
We can all make little changes to reduce carbon footprints but without pointing the finger at pets , which are part of family networks . "
Owning rabbits is legal anywhere .
Local bodies allow chickens , with some restrictions .
YOUR PET'S MARK
The eco-footprints of the family pet each year as calculated by the Vales :
German shepherds : 1.1 hectares , compared with 0.41 ha for a large SUV .
Cats : 0.15 ha ( slightly less than a Volkswagen Golf ) .
Hamsters : 0.014 ha ( two of them equate to a medium - sized plasma TV ) .
Goldfish : 0.00034 ha ( an eco- finprint equal to two cellphones ) .
So what ’s been happening with Wolfram| Alpha this summer ?
A lot !
At a first glance , the website looks pretty much as it did when it first launched — with the straightforward input field .
But inside that simple exterior an incredible amount has happened .
Our development organization has been buzzing with activity all summer .
In fact , it ’s clear from the metrics that the intensity is steadily rising , with things being added at an ever - increasing rate .
Wolfram|Alpha was always planned to be a very long - term project , and paced accordingly .
We pushed very hard to get it launched before the summer so that we could spend the “ quiet time ” of our first summer steadily enhancing it , before more people start using it more intently in the fall .
Two really great things have happened as a result of actually getting Wolfram| Alpha launched .
The first is that we ’ve discovered that there ’s a huge community of people out there who want to help the mission of Wolfram| Alpha .
And we ’re steadily ramping up our mechanisms for those people to contribute to the project .
The second thing is that we ’ve now got actual examples of what people want to do with Wolfram| Alpha — hundreds of millions of them .
And it ’s terrific to see that so many of them work so nicely .
But for us now the most valuable thing is seeing what does n’t work yet .
Because that shows us what we need to add to Wolfram| Alpha .
There are several components .
One is knowledge domains .
Things people want that Wolfram| Alpha does n’t yet know .
The good news is that there ’s been very little that ’s come through that was n’t already somewhere on our to - do lists .
They ’re long lists .
But we can now be confident that they ’re good lists .
A second big component is linguistics .
Close to half the time that Wolfram| Alpha does n’t give a result , it ’s not because it does n’t have the necessary knowledge , or ca n’t do the necessary computation .
It ’s because it does n’t understand what ’s being asked .
It ’s very interesting to see the kinds of queries that come into Wolfram| Alpha , and how they ’re phrased .
We ’re really seeing a new human language .
Based on ordinary language , but without a lot of its niceties .
Probably closer to the way people think internally .
Wolfram|Alpha is a bit like a child : it ’s being exposed to a new language , and it ’s got to learn from examples how to understand it .
The good news , though , is that Wolfram| Alpha is getting a lot of examples .
Already a couple of orders of magnitude more than a child ever gets .
One of our big activities this summer has been inventing new techniques to take advantage of all this .
It ’s very interesting science .
Much of it based on NKS .
We ’ve made some great advances , which we ’re steadily implementing in the Wolfram| Alpha system .
The results so far are quite encouraging .
In just a couple of months , we ’ve reduced the “ fall - through rate ” of queries we do n’t understand by 10 % .
And this is just the beginning .
The techniques we ’ve invented can clearly go a lot further .
And we have all sorts of ideas for completely new techniques .
One of the fascinating things for me about the Wolfram| Alpha project is the way it mixes deep theoretical ideas with very practical implementation .
And one of the great achievements this summer has been streamlining the implementation .
New data comes into Wolfram| Alpha all the time .
But we had a plan that once a week we would update the underlying code of Wolfram| Alpha .
Some people in our development team thought this was impossible .
But working on Mathematica for the past 20 + years , we ’ve come up with some pretty good software engineering techniques — particularly making use of Mathematica itself to do system building , testing , and deployment .
Well , I ’m happy to report that we have indeed managed to make the idea of one code update per week for Wolfram| Alpha work .
In fact , it ’s been working every week for the past 13 weeks !
So what ’s been in all those updates ?
I should explain that through the course of the summer we ’ve been steadily expanding the Wolfram| Alpha development team , adding a lot of very talented people from around the world .
But in writing this blog post , I just looked up what ’s actually happened to the Wolfram| Alpha codebase since launch .
And I have to say that I ’m quite astonished : it ’s grown by a staggering 52 % — adding well over 2 million lines of Mathematica code .
There have also been nearly 50,000 manual groups of changes to our data repositories over the past 3 months .
It ’s hard to have a good metric for how many completely new knowledge domains we ’ve added .
But based on new source files , and new underlying databases , I think it ’s been between 10 % and 15 % .
( There ’ll be other blog posts talking about the specifics — though we tend to be a bit bashful about new domains when they ’re first added ; they usually take a little while to reach maturity , and by then they do n’t seem as new to us . )
One of the most difficult things about keeping our weekly update schedule is getting testing done .
We test Wolfram| Alpha at many levels .
Its data , both static and real - time .
Its underlying computation .
Its linguistic processing .
Its presentation layer .
And its web operation .
Continually through each day we ’re building new versions of the Wolfram| Alpha system , and doing automated tests .
Over the course of the summer , we ’ve dramatically increased the number and types of tests we have , both custom - built and derived from actual query streams .
Of course these tests find bugs , which we ’re continually fixing .
( Each week , Monday and Tuesday are bug - fixing days for all our developers . )
But what ’s really great is how many users of Wolfram| Alpha send in helpful bug reports and suggestions .
In fact , it ’s been a big effort just to keep up with all of them .
As of now , of all the feedbacks we ’ve received , we ’ve classified 54,233 of them as bugs or suggestions .
Of these , 31,006 are now in our implementation queue , boiled down to about 5800 to - do items .
At the beginning of the summer , we were taking care of about 250 to - do items from all sources per week .
Now it ’s up to nearly 600 per week .
And so far we ’ve been able to tell 3907 people that the bugs they reported have been fixed .
It ’s really very exciting watching Wolfram| Alpha develop .
Every day there are zillions of little changes and fixes that get made ( “ add an extra name for a type of spider ” ; “ fix the timezone for an outlying settlement ” ; etc. ) , while major new domains and frameworks are getting built up .
There ’s also infrastructure development .
Making Wolfram|Alpha run well on more web browsers .
Optimizing performance .
People may have noticed recently that there are no longer URLs like www12.wolframalpha.com ; it ’s always just www.wolframalpha.com.
That seemingly minor change reflects a large engineering effort to optimize load balancing between our colocation facilities .
In addition to new content , we ’ve been working very hard on new delivery and interface mechanisms for Wolfram| Alpha , which we expect to be able to announce quite soon .
It ’s been a great first summer for Wolfram| Alpha .
It was a mad dash to launch Wolfram| Alpha when we did .
But we ’ve actually built up over the summer to an even greater development intensity , though now with a progressively larger team and increasingly streamlined development systems .
These are exciting times .
The vision of Wolfram| Alpha is really working !
With every day bringing new advances .
Progressively building up the largest coherent repository of human knowledge ever assembled .
Which we ’re now getting ready for its “ fall traffic ” …
2 September 2009
The commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , has issued a dire assessment of the state of military operations there .
The classified report sets the stage for an expansion of US troop levels in Afghanistan by as many as 45,000 .
McChrystal�s report , which was immediately endorsed by the chief of the US Central Command , Gen. David Petraeus , is to be handed over to President Barack Obama today .
According to press reports , McChrystal�s review makes no specific request for additional troops .
However , according to Tuesday�s New York Times , American officials said " it effectively lays the groundwork for such a request in the coming weeks . "
After sending his report to Gen. Petraeus , McChrystal issued a statement declaring , " The situation in Afghanistan is serious , but success is achievable and demands a revised implementation strategy , commitment and resolve , and increased unity of effort . "
An adviser to McChrystal , speaking to the McClatchy News Service on condition of anonymity , was more blunt .
" It says that this could get much worse unless we invest ourselves in this now , " he said .
The report , which is just over ten pages long , admits that it will take a number of years before the US can create a functional Afghan security force .
Congressional leaders are to be briefed on the report , once it is approved by Defense Secretary Robert Gates , but they will not be given copies of the document .
The Obama White House immediately signaled its inclination to approve an increase in US troop levels above the 21,000 additional troops Obama approved last February .
Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , said Monday , " There �s broad agreement that for many years our effort in Afghanistan has been under - resourced politically , militarily and economically . "
The Times noted that Gibbs used the term " under - resourced " six times in the course of his daily briefing .
According to press reports , the substance of discussions within the Obama administration is whether to increase troop levels by 20,000 or 40,000 - 45,000 .
The escalation already approved by the Obama administration will bring US troops levels to 68,000 and combined NATO military forces to 100,000 by the end of this year .
There are also reports that McChrystal and Petraeus are demanding greater operational independence for military commanders in Afghanistan from civilian control .
The McClatchy article summarized the thoughts of McChrystal�s aide , referring to a " streamlining of the military �s command structure [ because ] too much bureaucracy is making it difficult for commanders to make decisions on the ground . "
In an opinion piece published Monday in the Washington Post , Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a leading Washington military / security think tank , wrote that McChrystal and US Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry ( himself a former military commander in Afghanistan ) " can win only if they are allowed to manage both the civil and military sides of the conflict without constant micromanagement from Washington or traveling envoys . "
The Guardian notes that officers such as McChrystal view " the effort of the last eight years [ as ] wasted . "
Cordesman shares this view , asserting that Washington " never provided the forces , money or leadership necessary to win , effectively wasting more than half a decade . "
This amounts to the demand for a carte blanche for the US military to intensify the killing in Afghanistan in order to drown popular opposition to the US - led occupation in blood .
It is also an implicit challenge to the Obama administration and Congress and to the constitutional principle of civilian control of the military .
Highlighting the growing independence of the military from civilian control , an anonymous " senior military official " told the McClatchy News Service that McChrystal and Petraeus have been " pressuring " Obama to commit additional troops .
" The official said that retired Marine Gen. James Jones , Obama�s national security adviser , told McChrystal last month not to ask for more troops , but that McChrystal went ahead anyway and indicated in interviews that he may need more , " McClatchy reported .
The security situation for the US in both Afghanistan and Pakistan is indeed in a perilous state .
August was the bloodiest month for the US and NATO since the war began .
The US lost 49 soldiers in August and US and NATO forces overall suffered 77 deaths .
August�s death toll has already made 2009 the worst year for US and NATO military casualties since the onset of the war in October of 2001 .
The Afghan war is now the second longest in US history .
Despite a US offensive against Taliban strongholds in the South of Afghanistan , press reports cite military officials who acknowledge that the Taliban is gaining strength in the North and West of the country .
There are no reliable statistics for the number of Afghans who have been killed as a result of the US - led invasion and occupation .
But civilian deaths have soared in recent months , according to the United Nations , and the death toll is undoubtedly in the tens of thousands .
Media commentators assert that the thrust of McChrystal�s report is about " protecting the Afghan people against the Taliban , " as Britain�s Guardian put it .
The New York Times wrote that " the overriding goal of American and NATO forces would not be so much to kill Taliban insurgents as to make ordinary Afghans feel secure . "
These are contemptible lies .
The report presages an intensification of US military violence , increasingly directed against popular opposition to the US - led colonial occupation .
Recent polls taken in Afghanistan show massive opposition to the foreign occupiers and their puppet government in Kabul .
McChrystal is associated with the " unconventional " methods of imperialist counterinsurgency warfare , including the use of assassinations and torture .
He was long the commander of what Newsweek called " the most secretive force in the US military , " the Joint Special Operations Command , whose unit in Iraq has been accused of abuse of prisoners at Camp Nama .
The unit is believed to have played a critical role in the assassination program that targeted Iraqi tribal leaders supportive of the anti-US insurgency .
McChrystal�s report is being considered in the context of the recent Afghan election , which Obama hailed as a major " milestone " for the nation , but which is now widely acknowledged to be mired in vote - rigging and fraud by incumbent President Hamid Karzai .
The American press is rife with commentaries warning that the election debacle will further inflame ethnic and regional tensions and increase the power of the Taliban - led insurgency against a puppet regime seen to be illegitimate by large sections of the Afghan population .
There are mounting indications that Washington is preparing to dispense with Karzai .
The New York Times warned on Tuesday of " Mr. Obama�s entanglement with an Afghan government widely viewed as corrupt and illegitimate . "
Ominously for Karzai , the Times wrote that the election farce has left the US " with little hope for a credible partner in the war once the results are final . "
A senior advisor to McChrystal , David Kilcullen , recently pinned the blame for the crisis confronting the occupation squarely on Karzai .
" A government that is losing to a counter - insurgency is n�t being outfought , it is being out - governed .
And that �s what�s happening in Afghanistan , " Kilcullen said in an interview with Australia�s National Press Club .
Karzai could be jettisoned through a second round of elections , which will be held sometime later this year if no candidate is credited with winning 50 percent of the vote in the initial poll .
With just under half of the ballots tallied , Karzai has been allocated about 46 percent of the vote .
He would face Abdullah Abdullah , a former government minister under Karzai , in a runoff .
Karzai might also be sidelined by the US installing a new executive officer to oversee the day - to - day operations of the government in Kabul .
But the incumbent president , despite his pliant service to Washington since he was installed in 2002 , might meet a worse end .
Over the past several months , media commentators and figures close to the US military occupation have compared Karzai to the US stooge dictator of South Vietnam , Ngo Dinh Diem .
President John F. Kennedy approved Diem�s removal and assassination in November of 1963 , less than three weeks before Kennedy was himself assassinated .
The CIA coup against Diem set the stage for the massive military escalation and full - scale war that was launched by Kennedy�s successor , Lyndon B. Johnson .
Whatever Karzai�s fate , Obama�s Afghanistan policy is bringing it into conflict with the US population , which increasingly opposes the war .
A CBS News poll released Tuesday reveals a dramatic decline in public support for Obama�s war policy .
Forty - eight percent of Americans approve of Obama�s handling of the war , a decline from 56 percent in April .
More than four in ten Americans want to see US troops start coming home , up from only 24 percent in February .
The CBS poll substantiates findings of a Washington Post / ABC News poll released August 20 , which showed majority opposition to the war and an even larger percentage opposed to any increase in US troop levels .
Opposition to the Afghanistan war has mounted in spite of unanimous support for the war within the political establishment .
Moreover , unlike the war in Iraq , popular opposition to the Afghanistan war has mounted despite the absence of any organized opposition by the so - called " anti-war " groups which campaigned for Obama�s election and continue to back his administration .
Some voices within the ruling elite fear the political implications of the emergence of an anti-war movement independent of the Democratic Party and its middle - class front groups , and entertain doubts about the feasibility of subjugating Afghanistan .
According to media accounts citing anonymous White House sources , Vice President Joseph Biden has argued against substantial troop increases in Afghanistan on these grounds .
Defense Secretary Gates expressed concerns to Bloomberg News over " the implications of significant additional forces in terms of the foreign footprint in Afghanistan , whether the Afghans will see this as us becoming more of an occupier � "
There can be little doubt , however , that Obama will accede to McChrystal�s demands .
In his presidential campaign , Obama staked his entire foreign policy on expanding the US military presence in Afghanistan and defeating the anti-US insurgency .
Obama , no less than his predecessor Bush , is an instrument of the American ruling elite , which is conducting wars of aggression in Iraq and Afghanistan and intervening militarily in Pakistan in order to secure its imperialist aims in the Middle East and Central Asia .
These center on gaining control over the regions � vast energy resources and establishing military and geo-political dominance over these strategic areas .
The prospect of endless war , untold death and destruction for populations targeted by the US and a further tragic loss of American lives can be ended only through the independent mobilization of the working class in the US and internationally against the Obama administration and both parties of American imperialism .

Never before has this country seen so many women paralyzed by the psychological scars of combat .
As of June 2008 , 19,084 female veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan had received diagnoses of mental disorders from the Department of Veterans Affairs , including 8,454 women with a diagnosis of post - traumatic stress  and this number does not include troops still enlisted , or those who have never used the V.A. system .
Their mental anguish , from mortar attacks , the deaths of friends , or traumas that are harder to categorize , is a result of a historic shift .
In Iraq and Afghanistan , the military has quietly sidestepped regulations that bar women from jobs in ground combat .
With commanders needing resources in wars without front lines , women have found themselves fighting on dusty roads and darkened outposts in ways that were never imagined by their parents or publicly authorized by Congress .
And they have distinguished themselves in the field .
Psychologically , it seems , they are emerging as equals .
Officials with the Department of Defense said that initial studies of male and female veterans with similar time outside the relative security of bases in Iraq showed that mental health issues arose in roughly the same proportion for members of each sex , though research continues .
“ Female soldiers are actually handling and dealing with the stress of combat as well as male soldiers are , ” said Col. Carl Castro , director of the Military Operational Research Program at the Department of Defense .
“ When I look at the data , I see nothing to counter that point . ”
And yet , experts and veterans say , the circumstances of military life and the way women are received when they return home have created differences in how they cope .
A man , for instance , may come home and drink to oblivion with his war buddies while a woman  often after having been the only woman in her unit  is more likely to suffer alone .
A new peer - reviewed paper published in the September 2009 issue of Ecological Restoration concludes “ climate change makes riparian restoration more important than ever . ”
Â
This logical conclusion is backed by research , and the authors make recommendations for practice implementation .
Â
Once again , we are reminded of the far reaching ramifications of climate change and how we need to prepare now .
Traditionally , river restoration has focused on habitat loss , species invasion , and pollution ; however , Ecological Restoration supports a shift in riparian rehabilitation to include prepartion for climate change in addition to these other concerns .
Â
Riparian ecosystems need to be made resilient , as climate change will cause them to “ face increases in air and surface water temperatures , alterations in the magnitude and seasonality of precipitation and run-off , and shifts in reproductive phenology and distribution of plants and animals ” .
World Wire reports on the article :
In the paper , the scientists discuss the importance of replanting riparian vegetation and ensuring that rivers have sufficient water to maintain flows that benefit birds , fish and other wildlife , and human communities .
Based on these and other benefits of riparian restoration , the authors recommend that river restoration activities continue and expand as the climate changes …
The authors also discuss the need to modify restoration strategies to prepare for the uncertain conditions predicted to accompany climate change , and for ongoing research and monitoring to evaluate and improve restoration practices .
Recommendations include planting a mix of riparian plants that are both drought and flood tolerant , ensuring that rivers have sufficient water to provide for periodic flooding of natural areas , and increasing habitat restoration on private lands .
Seven organizations contributed to the research and recommendations , including PRBO Conservation Science , Environmental Defense Fund , Audubon California , River Partners , The Nature Conservancy , and the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) .
Â
The authors conclude :
Given that many riparian systems are highly degraded from a long history of anthropogenic activities ( Tockner and Stanford 2002 , Zedler and Kercher 2005 ) , we are now faced with a decision about whether to continue investing resources to treat these ecosystems .
Functional riparian systems have tremendous potential to reduce the adverse effects of climate change by enhancing ecosystem resilience .
To benefit from this capacity , we urgently need riparian restoration and the science that guides it .
The sense of urgency surrounding climate change will hopefully translate into action for our rivers .
Â
It ’s important we protect our rivers from the inevitable impact of climate change .
HISTORY OF DRUG USE AND DRUG USERS IN THE UNITED STATES by Elaine Casey From Facts About Drug Abuse - Participant Manual - The National Drug Abuse Center for Training Resource and Development 656 Quince Orchard Road Room 607 Gaithersburg , Maryland , 20760 Publication No. 79 - FADA - 041P
Printed : November , 1978 American opinion has always included some opposition to the non-medical use of any drug , including alcohol and tobacco .
From colonial times through the Civil War , abstentionist outcries against alcohol and tobacco sporadically provoked prohibitory legislation .
One 18th century pamphleteer advised against the use of any drink " which is liable to steal away a man 's senses and render him foolish , irascible , uncontrollable and dangerous . "
Similarly , one nineteenth century observer attributed delirium tremens , perverted sexuality , impotency , insanity and cancer to the smoking and chewing of tobacco .
Despite such warnings , alcohol and tobacco use took deep root in American society .
De Tocqueville noted what hard drinkers the Americans were , and Dickens was compelled to report that " in all the public places of America , this filthy custom [ tobacco chewing ] is recognized . "
Nevertheless , the strain in our culture opposed to all non-medical drug use persisted ( National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse , 1972 ) .
INTRODUCTION
All manner of substances have been used by Americans throughout our history .
Colonial residents and their predecessors relied on derivatives of natural substances to cure ailments , increase sexual potency , relieve pain -- and to provide pure old fashioned pleasure .
Until the late 1800s , abstentionists and prohibitionists had a relatively easy task in identifying their targets for attack : Tobacco users were conspicuous in their enjoyment .
Alcoholic beverage drinkers could be found in every saloon , and alcohol was served openly in homes and at social gatherings .
Even opium dens of the west coast were well known , and opium could be purchased readily , free from state or federal government controls .
Early prohibitionists may be the envy of the " anti- drug " movements of the twentieth century .
Until the Controlled Substance
Act was passed by Congress in 1970 , anti-substance legislation was hard put to keep pace with ( or even to categorize ) the endless variety of natural substances and preparations , multisubstance compounds , synthetic derivatives and " improvements " upon the natural that were adopted by different subcultures in the search for a new high or an intensified religious experience .
Physician - prescribed medications , once used for legitimate treatment , came into use as alternatives to " illicit " substances .
Children inhaled glue and aerosols .
Students , housewives , and truck drivers found a new way of life through consumption of prescribed and black - market sedatives and amphetamines .
Even LSD was no longer just " acid . " LSD - 25 was joined by DMT , psyilocybin mushrooms , nutmeg , morning glory seeds , peyote , mescaline , animal tranquilizers ( PCP ) , and sundry combination capsules and tablets , as descendents of the Haight - Ashbury counterculture looked for new hallucinogens not yet outlawed by state and federal legislatures .
In short , the variety of twentieth century substances with potent for abuse confounded every abolitionist / prohibitionist effort .
And the crazy - quilt patterns of new legislation reflected that confusion .
The resourcefulness of those determined to get high was remarkable .
When one hallucinogen was outlawed , another took its place .
With law enforcement agencies concentrating on dealers of marihuana and hashish , and putting more energy into locating users and sources of heroin , the " weekend " alcohol drinker soon had an opportunity to try smoking marihuana , found that he liked it , and often substituted it for alcohol at social occasions .
Younger Americans came to have increasingly easier access to " black market " marihuana , cocaine , prescription drugs , and animal tranquilizers .
EARLY SUBSTANCE HABITS
For Americans , the past 15 - year period is not the first experience with a resourceful multi-drug culture .
Our European forebears , fifteenth , sixteenth , and seventeenth century explorers , traders , and conquerors , were open to the pleasures and products of the new worlds .
The European explorers from Columbus on found other [ in addition to alcohol ] mind - affecting drugs , and brought them with them .
Tobacco was discovered on Columbus ' first voyage .
Cocaine was found in large areas of South America .
Caffeine and LSD - like drugs were found scattered all over the world ... the Europeans not only adopted nicotine and caffeine but spread them everywhere .
They also imported opium .
In a remarkably short space of time , western Europe was converted from an alcohol - only culture to a multi- drug culture ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Tobacco was first introduced to Europeans by American Indians .
Sailors tried and adopted the practice , both smoking the leaf and chewing it , and brought tobacco home to England .
But where a habit could be found , a prohibitionist was not far behind .
In 1575 , the Catholic Church in Mexico passed a regulation forbidding smoking in church .
In 1642 and 1650 , Papal edicts against the use of tobacco were issued .
The European states , Constantinople , Japan , and Russia all had anti-tobacco laws , but the practice continued against all opposition .
Russia 's Czar Michael Feodorovitch , first of the Romanoffs , in 1634 pronounced a penalty that tends toward overkill : " ' Offenders are usually sentenced to slitting of the nostrils , the bastinado , or the knout , " ' a visitor to Moscow reported .
However , the visitor noted , tobacco was a premium commodity in Moscow , and smokers would pay any price for the precious leaf ( Brecher 1972 ) Among other new habits the early explorers introduced into European culture were the many ways to enjoy caffeine : coffee from Arabia and Turkey ; tea from China ; the West African Kola nut , later used as a source of caffeine in cola drinks in nine teenth and twentieth century United States ; drinks from the bean of Mexico 's cocoa tree ; Brazil 's ilex plant , from which mate is brewed ; and cassina , early used in a caffeine beverage by Indians living in the ( now ) Virginia to Florida region , and as far west along the Gulf coast as the Rio Grande .
European settlers in America soon adopted the cassina plant to their own uses , preparing a tea they called " Black Drink , " " Black Drought , " or " dahoon , " and later letting the leaves ferment to produce a brew containing both caffeine and alcohol ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Spanish conquerors of Mexico found peyote in ritual use by the Incas who also had the habit of chewing leaves from the Erythroxylon coca plant .
The practice of coca leaf use was encouraged by Spanish rulers as a means of controlling the Indian natives ; but the Europeans had strong doubts about the habit , and refrained from using it themselves .
They did , however , try to curtail use of peyote and other indigenous herbal hallucinogens by the Aztecs , who had kept substance use as part of their religious practices since pre-Columbian times .
Indian tribal use of peyote continued in spite of Spanish opposition , and the practice is still found in some areas today .
Cannabis sativa , too , was available in the early days of the new world .
This plant was not indigenous to the Americas , but brought to the area by the Spaniards , with cannabis first appearing in Chile , where the Spanish introduced it in 1545 ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
The plant became a staple crop for colonial farmers , who reportedly grew it for its fiber .
Along with tobacco , hemp became a major export crop for pre-Revolutionary American farmers .
The Jamestown settlers [ brought ] the plant [ cannabis ] to Virqinia in 1611 and cultivated it for its fiber .
Marihuana was introduced into New England in 1629 .
From then until after the Civil War , the marihuana plant was a major crop in North America , and played an important role in both colonial and national economic policy ... George Washington was growing hemp lin 1765 _7 at mount Vernon ... presumably for its fiber , though it has been argued that Washington was also concerned to increase the medicinal or intoxicating potency of his marihuana plants ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
In 1775 , hemp culture was introduced into Kentucky and large hemp plantations flourished in Mississippi , Georgia , California , South Carolina , and Nebraska until well into the 1800s .
For the majority , however , alcohol and tobacco were the popular American substances of habit until the Civil War era .
For the minor " caffeine vice , " residents in Confederate states returned to beverages made from cassina .
Civil
War blockades on southern ports curtailed imports of tea and coffee , so cassina drinks , abandoned since the " Black Drought " days of early settlers , became popular for the duration of the war . *
OPIATES : THE NEW NINETEENTH CENTURY HABIT
One of the first " exotic , " non-indigenous substances to become a part of the nineteenth century culture was opium .
Immigrant Chinese laborers building the trans - continental railroad migrated across the United States , bringing their opiumsmoking habit with them to the west .
In the early to mid-1800s the practice was open and opium and its preparations were easily obtainable , subject to no controls or regulations .
Also , the use of opium became fashionable among some of the Litepati in Europe , and their various letters and books extolle its virtues .
Thomas DeQuincey 's Confessions of an Opium Eatl - ep , published in 1822 , received wide notice , giving heretofore naive readers some second - hand taste of the pleasures of the drug .
... I do not readily believe that any man , having once tasted the divine luxuries of opium , will afterwards descend to the gross and mortal enjoyments of alcohol .
I take it for granted " That those eat now who never ate before , and those who always ate now eat the more . " ...
What I contemplated in these Confessions was to emblazon the power of opium -- not over bodily disease and pain , but over the grander and more shadowy world of dreams .
* Similarly , when coffee prices rose substantially during and after World War I , Congress and the United States Department of Agriculture persuaded Americans to adopt temporarily cassina teas and soft drinks as a substitute caffeine source .

A man who is inebriated , or tending to inebriation , is , and feels that he is , in a condition which calls up into supremacy the merely human , too often the brutal part of his nature ; but the opium - eater ... feels that the diviner part of his nature is paramount -- that is , the moral affections are in a state of cloudless serenity , and high over all the great light of majestic intellect ( DeQuincey , 1822 ) .
But DeQuincey 's subsequent Miseries of Opium , detailing his own agonies of addiction , was generally ignored , as were the scattered medical warnings against habitual use of the substance .
Opium and Medical Practices
Use of opium was predominantly medicinal at this time , although in 1832 a physician wrote this summary of the drug 's effects :
" There is scarcely a disease in which opium may not , during some of its states , be brought to bear by the judicious physician with advantage . "
[ But he cautioned against its indiscriminate use when other drugs are available : ] " when it is thus used , it seldom fails to lay the foundation for a long train of morbid symptoms , which sooner or later terminate in all wretchedness , which disease is capable of inflicting .
Yet , this drug is in use every day , particularly among the better circles of society , and the softer sex " ( Levine , 1974 ) .
There was at this time a vigorous patent medicine industry growing in the United States , with widespread advertising of preparations containing large quantities of opium .
These " medicines " claimed to cure just about anything from " nerves " to marital problems , but what they amounted to were a source of opium , uncut and available to anyone with the nominal price of a bottle of the elixir .
Morphine : The Universal Cure Morphine was first separated from opium by European chemists in the early 1800s , and was found soon after in the United States , where it began to take the place of opium in patent medicines .
Physicians believed the new opium derivative to be non-addicting , and hoped that it could actually cure opium addiction in patients .
Doctors prescribed the new opiate often .
Prevalent medical opinion held that the addiction process occurred in the individual 's stomach , and that ingestion of an opiate was responsible for addiction .
The hypodermic needle and syringe were introduced in 1850 - - greeted as a boon by physicians who hoped to use morphine injections to kill pain and believed that the injection process itself would eliminate the addiction problem ( Levine , 1974 ) .
Morphine was used commonly as a pain killer during the Civil War .
So large a number of soldiers became addicted as a result of the opiate given them for battle injuries that the post - war morphine addiction prevalent among veterans came to be known as " Soldier 's Disease . "
Late in the 1800s , morphine was prescribed commonly as a sub- stitute for " alcohol addiction " ; the practice continued until late in the 1930s .
Dr. J. R. Black , in a paper entitled " Advantages of Substituting the Morphia Habit for the Incurably Alcoholic , " published in the Cincinnati Lancet - Clinic in 1889 , had the following praise for morphine in the alcoholic treatment regimen : [ Morphine ] " is less inimical to healthy life than alcohol ... [ It ] calms in place of exciting the baser passions , and hence is less productive of acts of violence and crime ; in short - the use of morphine in place of alcohol is but a choice of evils , and by far the lesser - On the score of economy the morphine habit is by far the better .
The regular whisky drinker can be made content in his craving for stimulation , at least for quite a long time , on two or three grains of morphine a day , divided into appropriate portions , and given at regular intervals .
If purchased by the drach at fifty cents this will last him twenty days " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Women : The Opiate Addicts Throughout the late 1800s , the opiates ( morphine and opium ) continued to be distributed widely in patent medicines .
There was also a widespread physicians ' practice of prescribing opiates for menstrual and menopausal disorders .
Too , there was extravagant advertising of the opiate patent medicines as able to relieve " female troubles . "
Women , it seemed , had become the prevalent class of opiate users .
Prescription and patent medicines containing the substances were advertised and accepted without question .
Also , this was a convenient , gentile drug for a dependent lady who would never be seen drinking in public .
" The extent to which alcohol - drinking by women was frowned upon may also [ in addition to opiate medicines ] have contributed to the excess of women among opiate users .
Husbands drank alcohol in the saloon ; wives took opium at home " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
EARLY COCAINE USE Medical practice also helped contribute to a new class of cocaine users .
In 1844 , the alkaloid cocaine was first isolated in pure form from coca leaves .
However , this discovery received little attention until 1883 , when Dr. Theodor Aschenbrandt , a German army physician , issued a supply of pure cocaine to Bavarian soldiers during maneuvers .
Dr. Aschenbrandt later reported positive results , including beneficial effects on the soldiers ' ability to endure fatigue during battle - like conditions ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
An Addicted Physician
At about the same time in the United States , Dr. William Halsted ( 1852-1922 ) , prominent surgeon and later one of the founders of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine , discovered that cocaine injected near a nerve produces a local anesthesia in the area served by that nerve .
The discoverer of the first local anesthetic continued to experiment with cocaine , and soon found himself dependent on cocaine use .
His subsequent efforts to rid himself of the dependence led Dr. Halsted to " cure " his cocaine habit by switching to morphine injections .
At one time , his habit was reported to be a quantity of 180 milligrams daily .
Eventually , he reduced this to a maintenance dose of 90 milligrams , which continued for most of his life ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Freud and Cocaine
In 1884 , Sigmund Freud is reported to have experimented on himself with 50 milligrams of cocaine .
He prescribed cocaine to relieve the pain of a chronically ill friend who was at that time addicted to morphine , and wrote glowing reports of the drug 's success , even to the point of sending cocaine to his fiance to " make her more lively '.'
In the July , 1884 , issue of the medical journal Centralblatt fur die gesammte Therapie , Freud published an essay praising cocaine as a " magical drug , " and continued to use it periodically to relieve depression in himself ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
In 1885 , a German named Erlenmeyer published the first attacks on cocaine as a possibly addicting drug , and two years later Freud himself discontinued use and prescription of the drug , partially due to cocaine 's harmful effects on the friend for whom he had originally prescribed it for pain ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Coca -Cola
In 1885 , John Styth Pemberton of Atlanta , Georgia , who had manufactured previously such patent medicines as Triplex Liver Pills and Globe of Flower Cough Syrup , introduced " French Wine Coca -- Ideal Nerve and Tonic Stumulant . "
The product relied heavily on extract of coca leaves .
The next year , Pemberton introduced a syrup called " Coca - Cola . "
The " Cola " in the name indicated the presence of an extract of the kola nut -- an African product that contains about two percent caffeine .
That year , Pemberton is said to have sold 25 gallons of the syrup .
At various times it was advertised as " a remarkable therapeutic agent " and as a " sovereign remedy " for a long list of ailments , including melancholy and ( curiously ) insomnia ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
( In 1906 a federal pure food and drug law was enacted , and Pemberton 's successors , who were still making Coca - Cola , switched from using unadulterated coca leaves to decocainized leaves .
The product still included caffeine , as it does today . )
MARIHUANA AND HASHISH
During the mid-1800s , cannabis sativa , whose use dates back to the second millenium B.C. in China , was considered a legitimate ( and wholly licit ) medication .
From 1850 until 1942 , the United States Pharmacopeia , which lists most widely - accepted drugs , recognized marihuana as a legitimate medicine , under the name " Extractum Cannabis . "
Too , the United States Dispensory in 1851 reported the use of hemp extract : " The complaints in which it has been specially recommended are neuralgia , gout , rheumatism , tetanus , hydrophobia , epidemic cholera , convulsions , chorea , hemorrhage " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Limited non-medical use of cannabis , however , was reported in an 1869 issue of the Scientific American : " The drug hashish , the cannabis indica of the U.S. Pharmacopeia , the resinous product of hemp , grown in the East Indies and other parts of Asia , is used in those countries to a large extent for its intoxicating properties and is doubtless used in this country for the same purpose to a limited extent " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Non-Medical Cannabis Use Use of cannabis products for recreation grew gradually .
The December 2 , 1876 , issue of the Illustrated Police News featured a drawing of five exotically - attired young ladies supposedly indulging their " hasheesh " habit in a room where hookahs were conspicuous .
The News captioned the drawing : " ' Secret Dissipation of New York Belles : Interior of a Hasheesh Hell on Fifth Avenue " ' ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Popular magazines and newspapers began to feature stories about the newly - discovered hashish users and their lurid habitats .
The November , 1883 , issue of Harper 's New Monthly Magazine featured an article by an anonymous explorer of the " hasheesh dens " : " There is a large community of hashish smokers in this city [ New York ] , who are daily forced to indulge their morbid appetites , and I can take you to a house up - town where hemp is used in every conceivable form , and where the lights , sounds , odors , and surroundings are all arranged so as to intensify and enhance the effects ... [ The hashish smokers ] are about evenly divided between Americans and foreigners ; indeed , the place is kept by a Greek , who has invested a great deal of money in it .
All the visitors , both male and female , are of the better classes , and absolute secrecy is the rule .
The house has been opened about two years , I believe , and the number of regular habitues is daily on the increase ...
Smokers from different cities , Boston , Philadelphia , Chicago , and especially New Orleans , tell me that each city has its hemp retreat , but none so elegant as this " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
A number of physicians reported ingesting hashish during this era--some for " experimental " purposes , others admitting frank curiosity , and occasionally supplying fluid extract of cannabis to their friends .
Hashish candy , too , was available in post - Civil War sweet shops .
Dr. George Wheelock Grover , in his book Shadows Lifted or Sunshine Restored in the Horizon of Human Lives : A Treatise on the Morphine , opium , Cocaine , Chloral and Hashish Habits , admitted purchasing a box of the candy in Baltimore .
Determined to test the product on himself , Dr. Grover took " 'a full dose ... ( then the drug ) manifested its peculiar witchery with scarcely prelude or warning " ' ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
At the time , he was dining with several friends , and felt compelled to tell them of the peculiar sense of well being which had come over him :
' It is undoubtedly here a day of jubilation or of something in the way of celebration .
You perceive that the tables are set with golden plate , that the waiters all seem to be dressed in velvet costumes , and that hundreds of canary birds are singing in gilded cages .
It must be a celebration of a good deal of magnitude , as the many bands of martial and orchestral music seem all to be playing at once " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Cannabis , it seems , possessed considerably more useful properties than those first attributed to it in the early Pharmaco , peia listing .
However , the contemporary prohibitionist movement was focusing its attention on the opium problem , and left cannabis products and their users to themselves for the next several decades .
EARLY ANTI - SUBSTANCE LEGISLATION
In 1872 , California passed the first anti-opium law .
This held that " ' the administration of laudunum , an opium preparation , or any other narcotic to any person with the intent thereby to facilitate the commission of a felony " ' now constituted a felony ( Levine , 1974 ) .
However , this first awkward attempt failed to control unlawful use of opium in the state .
In 1881 , the California legislature passed a law making it a misdemeanor to maintain a place where opium was sold , given away , or smoked .
The bill applied only to commercial places , presumably the opium dens frequented by immigrant Chinese laborers and their fellow habitues .
Smoking opium alone , or with friends in a private residence , was not covered by the legislation .
The practice continued .
In the same year , California became the first state to establish a separate bureau to enforce narcotic laws , and one of the first states to treat addicts .
Connecticut , in 1874 , became the first state to have a law whereby the " narcotic addict " was declared incompetent to attend to his personal affairs .
The law required that he be committed to a state insane asylum for " medical care and treatment " until he was " cured " of his " addiction " ( Levine , 1974 ) .
The Opium Prohibitions During the last quarter of the nineteenth century , the western states continued to pass legislation restricting use of opium .
Nevada 's 1877 law was the first actually to prohibit opium smoking ; this made it illegal to sell or dispense opium without a physician 's prescription , and prohibited the maintenance of any place used for smoking or otherwise " illegally using " opium .
Other western states soon had similar laws , with most legislation directed at outlawing opium smoking , rather than curtailing use of other substances .
Controlling Opiate and Cocaine Distribution
In 1887 , the Territory of Oregon passed the first comprehensive anti-substance law , providing :
That licenses would be issued to physicians and pharmacists for sale of narcotics ; that no person could sell , give away , or possess opium , " smoking opium , " morphine , cocaine , or chloral hydrate , except by prescription of a licensed physician ( Levine , 1974 ) .
Similar laws were adopted by other states , but with no uniformity as to which drugs were controlled , which controls were actually enforced , and the type of penalties to which offenders would be subject .
In 1905 , Connecticut passed a law whereby cocaine could be sold and possessed only with a physician 's prescription ; this remained in force until 1913 , when the law was amended to include opium , morphine , and heroin .
In general , early laws restricted or prohibited possession of opium derivatives and cocaine without considering whether the substances could have significant medical use .
Laws were concerned with the manner in which drugs were to be sold , not with setting standards for determining their legitimate use by physicians .
In their limited knowledge , doctors continued to prescribe opium derivatives for a variety of ailments .
Many over - the - counter preparations containing quantities of morphine , heroin , and opium were still available to anyone complaining of an illness those opiates were believed able to cure .
Peyote During the 1870s , American Indians had begun ritual use of peyote , as had the Aztecs before them .
For the Comanches , Cheyennes , Arapahoes , and other tribes , the peyote cult was entirely religious , requiring total abstinence from alcohol - which , after being introduced to Indians by white settlers and soldiers , had become a substance of considerable abuse .
White land speculators , desiring Indian tribal lands , united with Christian missionaries in seeking to have peyote outlawed ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
In 1899 , Oklahoma became the first state to outlaw peyote .
The legislation was repealed in 1908 , following the pattern of it's legal / it 's illicit again peyote laws enacted by legislatures in several western states .
In 1929 , New Mexico outlawed peyote , but the law was rarely enforce As recently as 1959 , that law was amended to permit ritual peyote use .
A major factor in maintaining the legal status of peyote has been the Native American Church of North America , an organization that claims some 250,000 Indian members from tribes throughout the United States and Canada .
In addition to successfully opposing Congressional action against peyote and securing the repeal of state laws , the Native American Church has succeeded in several states in having such laws declared unconstitutional as a violation of freedom of religion ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
As ritual peyote use continued , mail - order companies were established to meet the demand , as with patent medicines . *
In spite of erratic legislative attempts at control , an indigenous American herbal hallucinogen was gradually moving from tribal rituals into the culture at large .
* Dried mescal buttons could be purchased , legally , for as little as $ 8.00 for 100 buttons , until as recently as the 1950s ; and mail - order companies advertised freely in college newspapers and other publications during the late 1950s and early 1960s ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Heroin : The Last Legal Opiate Heroin , the newest opium derivative , was first produced commercially by Germany 's Bayer Company in 1898 .
" It was widely advertised as being at least ten times as potent a painkiller as morphine with none of the addicting properties .... one claim was made that the use of heroin could and would cure opium and morphine addiction " ( Levine , 1974 ) .
General opinion held that heroin was the ultimate cure for morphine and opium addiction , and physicians made use of heroin in treating varied ailments .
It was not until 1925 that import of opium for the manufacture of heroin finally was banned in this country .
The 1900s : Summary Throughout the nineteenth century , the United States continued as a multi-substance society .
Frequent users of opium - derivative medications continued their habits .
Cannabis smokers enjoyed their diversion with little harassment .
And while other subcultures were finding other substances to use , opposition groups tried to keep pace .
THE FIRST FEDERAL LEGISLATION
While the medical community was prescribing heroin to cure fever and morphine / opium addiction alike , prohibitionists were finally succeeding in their battle against opium .
The federal Pure Food and Drug Act was passed in 1906 .
Irrespective - of opposition by manufacturers of patent medicines , the Act required that medicines containing opiates , among other substances , must be so labeled .
After the Act was passed , the manufacturers of Coca - Cola switched from using unprocessed coca leaves to decocainized leaves , but caffeine remained in the beverage . *
* Currently , Maywood Chemical Company is the only United States firm licensed to import coca leaves ; the majority of those are subjected to a decocainizing process before shipment to the CocaCola Bottling Company .
Cocaine extracted by Maywood is sold to licensed chemical and pharmaceutical companies for manufacture of medical products .
Subsequent amendments to the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act required that the quantity of each drug contained be stated on medicine labels , and that drugs meet official standards of purity .
Subsequent public service campaigns urging people not to use patent medicines containing opiates " ... no doubt helped curb the making of new addicts .
Indeed , there is evidence of a modest decline in opiate addiction from the peak in the 1890s until 1914 " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
THE HARRISON NARCOTIC ACT
The federal Harrison Narcotic
Act was passed in 1914 .
Official title of the Harrison bill had been " An Act to provide for the registration of , with collectors of internal revenuer and to impose a special tax upon all persons who produce , import , manufacture , compound , deal in , dispense , sell , distribute , or give away opium or coca Leaves , * their salts , derivatives or preparations , and for other purposes . "
The law specifically provided that manufacturers , importers , pharmacists , and physicians prescribing narcotics should be licensed to do so , at a moderate fee .
The patent - medicine manufacturers were exempted even from the licensing and tax provisions , provided that they limited themselves to " preparations and remedies which do not contain more than two grains of opium , or more than one - fourth of a grain of morphine , or more than one - eighth of a grain of heroin ... in one avoirdupois ounce . "
Far from appearing to be a prohibition law , the Harrison Narcotic
Act on its face was merely a law for the orderly marketing of opium , morphine , heroin , and other drugs -- in small quantities on a physician 's prescription .
Indeed , the right of a physician to prescribe was spelled out in apparently unambiguous terms : " Nothing contained in this section shall apply ... to the dispensing or distribution of any of the aforesaid drugs to a patient by a physician , dentist , or veterinary surgeon registered under this Act in the course of his professional practice only . "
Registered physicians were required only to keep records of drugs dispensed or prescribed .
It is unlikely that a single legislator realized in 1914 that the law Congress was passing would later be deemed a prohibition law .
... After passage of the law , this clause [ " in the course of his professional practice only " ] was interpreted by law - enforcement officers to mean that a doctor could not prescribe opiates to an addict to maintain his addiction .
Since addiction was not a disease , the argument went , an addict was not a patient , and opiates dispensed to or prescribed for him by a physician were therefore not being supplied " in the course of his professional practice . "
Thus a law apparently intended to ensure the orderly marketing of narcotics was converted into a law prohibiting the supplying of narcotics to addicts , even on a physician 's prescription .
Many physicians were arrested under this interpretation , and some were convicted and imprisoned .
Even those who escaped conviction had their careers ruined by the publicity .
The medical profession quickly learned that to supply opiates to addicts was to court disaster ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
For all purposes , opium and cocaine could no longer be gotten legally , in quantity , by the user on the street .
As licit sources became more controlled , new illicit channels opened to supply users .
Use of " narcotics " ( the true opium derivatives , and also cocaine , mistakenly labeled a narcotic by Congress in the 1914 act ) continued at relatively the same level as prior to the Act 's passage .
By fixing severe limits on the amount of opiate a patent medicine could contain , and by otherwise prohibiting the traffic in opiates except for medicinal purposes , the [ Harrison Act ] abolished the legitimate traffic .
When the Supreme count ruled in the early 1920s that prescriptions for addictions were not legitimately medical practice , the interpretation meant simply that addiction thereby became a federal crime ...
The court thus lowered narcotics use into the underworld , forcing addicts to migrate to the urban centers of illicit supply .
It also forced formerly decent and responsible citizens who had acquired an unfortunate habit to become aggressive and violent criminals .
It made addicts conform to the image of nonscience ; as they robbed or cheated or prostituted themselves to support the illicit price , they did indeed become debauched , corrupt , and depraved .
In 1923 , as many as 75 percent of the women in federal penitentiaries were Harrison Act prisoners ( Clark , 1976 ) .
In 1918 , just three years after the Harrison Act went into effect , a study by a Congressional committee ( which members included Dr. A. G. Du Mez , Secretary of the United States Public Health Service ) released these findings : o Opium and other narcotic drugs [ including cocaine ] ... were being used by about a million people .

The " underground " traffic in narcotic drugs was about equal to the legitimate medical traffic .

The " dope peddlers " appeared to have established a national organization , smuggling the drugs in through seaports or across the Canadian or Mexican borders ... 
The wrongful use of narcotic drugs had increased since passage of the Harrison Act .
Twenty cities , including New York and San Francisco , had reported such increases ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
As a result of those findings , Congress responded with measures to strengthen the Harrison Act .
In 1924 , a law was enacted prohibiting importation of heroin for any purpose , including medical use .
Still , the nation was finding that ridding itself of heroin would require considerably more than legislation .
" The 1924 ban on heroin did not deter the conversion of morphine addicts to heroin .
On the contrary , heroin ousted morphine almost completely from the black market after the law was passed " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
PROHIBITION (S ) IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY
The opiates and cocaine were not the only targets of the early twentieth century prohibitionists .
Alcohol and tobacco , traditionally respectable American habits , were beginning to feel the abolitionists ' attacks .
Tobacco
Until the first decade of the twentieth century , tobacco use was usually confined to smoking in pipes and cigars , chewing , and inhaling snuff .
Cigarettes as we know them today began to appear in the late nineteenth century , gaining wide popularity some twenty years later .
The new cigarettes were made of a mild , Virginia tobacco ; they were smaller , paper - wrapped , and generally more attractive to more people , especially women .
People tried them , liked them , adopted the habit .
This new fondness , aided by public outcries against the foul cuspidor , helped confirm Americans in the tobacco - smoking habit .
The explosive increase in cigarette smoking after 1910 can ... be attributed in part to the public - health campaigns of that era against the chewing of tobacco and its inevitable accompaniment , the cuspidor .
The sputum of tobacco chewers , according to repeated public - health warnings , spreads tuberculosis and perhaps other diseases .
Most of those who gave up tobacco chewing no doubt turned instead to cigarette smoking .
The ashtray replaced the cuspidor , and lung cancer replaced tuberculosis as the major lung disease ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Anti-cigarette leagues flourished .
Patterning their efforts on the anti-saloon leagues then lobbying throughout the country , tobacco prohibitionists had some measure of success .
By 1921 , the year after alcohol prohibition , 14 states had laws prohibitin cigarettes , and 92 anti-cigarette bills were under consioeration in 28 more state legislatures ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
But people continued to smoke , and the last statewide cigarette prohibition law was repealed in 1927 .
Only laws concerned with cigarette sales to minors were retained .
Not only did most states prohibit sale of cigarettes to minors , they also set penalties sometimes so severe as to make the whole tobacco prohibition approach a source of ridicule for the decades of the future .
A Florida law made it illegal for anyone under the age of twenty - one to smoke cigarettes .
It was also illegal in Florida to provide anyone under 21 with a cigarette , a cigarette wrapper , or a substitute ; a twenty - year - old caught in possession of a cigarette could be hauled into court and compelled to testify concerning its source ...
In Maine an offer to sell cigarettes to a minor was punishable ... Xn Massachusetts snuff and cigars were forbidden to young people under sixteen ; the ban against cigarettes continued until eighteen ...
In Pennsylvania , a minor who refused to divulge the source of cigarettes or cigarette paper could be fined , imprisoned , or certified to the juvenile court ; refusal to serve as an informer against his cigarette supplier also made a child a criminal in South Carolina .
These laws led , of course , to ridicule and contempt on the part of law - defying young people ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Alcohol
The second decade of the twentieth century marked the culmination of alcohol prohibitionist efforts .
During the previous two centuries , abstentionists had been gathering supporters , and by 1900 , they were a force to be reckoned with .
The Woments Christian Temperance Union , anti-saloon leagues , and allied anti-alcohol crusaders convinced America that her downfall lay in continued use of alcohol .
The Eighteenth or " Prohibition " Amendment passed both houses of Congress in December 1917 , and was ratified by three - fourths of the 48 state legislatures 13 months later .
From 1920 until 1933 , the manufacture , sale , and consumption of alcohol was prohibited in the United States .
As with tobacco , the opiates , and cocaine , legislation failed to create a general climate of abstention .
And where there was a populace of willing consumers , supply was still able to keep pace with demand .
Alcohol remained available during Prohibition .
People still got drunk , still became alcoholics , still suffered delirium tremens .
Drunken drivers remained a frequent menace on the highways ...
The courts , jails , hospitals , and mental hospitals were still filled with drunks ...
Instead of consuming alcoholic beverages manufactured under the safeguards of state and federal standards ... people now drank " rotgut , " some of it adulterated , some of it contaminated .
The use of methyl alcohol , a poison , because ethyl alcohol was unavailable or too costly , led to blindness and death ; " ginger jake ,11 an adulterant found in bootleg beverages , produced paralysis and death .
The disreputable saloon was replaced by the even less savory speakeasy .
There was a shift from relatively mild light wines and beers to hard liquors -- less bulky and therefore less hazardous to manufacture , transport , and sell on the black market .
Young people -- and especially respectable young women , who rarely got drunk in public before 1920 - - now staggered out of speakeasies and reeled down the streets .
There were legal closing hours for saloons ; the speakeasies stayed open night and day .
organized crime syndicates took control of alcohol distribution , establishing power bases that ( it is alleged ) still survive .
Marihuana , a drug previously little used in the United States , was first popularized during the period of alcohol Prohibition ... and ether was also imbibed ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
In spite of vigorous federal efforts to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment , the alcohol prohibition concept proved unenforceable .
Americans and their European forebears had been drinking for centuries and were not ready to stop .
The Twentieth Amendment repealing prohibition passed Congress in February 1933 .
It was ratified by the requisite number of states in less than ten months .
The Twenty - first Amendment returned to individual states the power to retain statewide alcohol prohibition , and made it a federal offense to ship alcoholic beverages into a dry state .
But the states , too , had learned how impossible it was to keep citizens from drinking .
One by one , each repealed its local anti-alcohol legislation , with Mississippi the last state to surrender -- in 1966 .
Prohibitionists had little difficulty in finding a new substance to oppose .
America had returned alcohol to stores and taverns .
So be it .
If Americans chose to destroy their bodies and pickle their livers by consuming alcohol - - let them .
But a new evil had begun to gain popularity during the alcohol prohibition era , and the country had to be protected from this newest path to degradation .
Marihuana During the years of alcohol prohibition , marihuana use had gained in popularity .
[ In New York City ] marihuana " tea pads " were established about 1920 .
They resembled opium dens or speakeasies except that prices were very low ; a man could get high for a quarter on marihuana smoked in the pad , or for even less if he bought the marihuana at the door and took it away to smoke .
Most of the marihuana , it was said , was harvested from supplies growing wild on Staten Island or in New Jersey and other nearby states ; marihuana and hashish imported from North Africa were more potent and cost more .
These tea pads were tolerated by the city , much as alcohol speakeasies were tolerated .
By the 1930s there were said to be 500 of them in New York City alone ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
In 1926 , two New Orleans newspapers , the item and morning Tribune , published a series of " exposes " of the marihuana menace .
The papers reported that sailors from Cuba and the South American countries were importing large quantities of cannabis into New Orleans , and that marihuana smoking had become widespread , even among children " ' The Waif 's Home , at this time was reputedly full of children , both white and colored , who had been brought in under the influence of the drug .
Marihuana cigarettes could be bought almost as readily as sandwiches " '
Brecher , 1972 .
In 1927 , Louisiana passed a law providing for a $ 500 fine or six months ' imprisonment for sale or possession of marihuana .
Numerous arrests and a subsequent curbing of imports resulted but , as with alcohol , use continued .
Resourceful Louisiana residents stopped buying retail and started growing their own .
The first large growing crop in the city [ New Orleans ] was found in 1930 and its value estimated at $ 35,000 to $ 50,000 ...
One 1936 about 1,200 pounds of bulk weed were seized along with considerable quantities of cigarettes .
On one farm , 5 1/ 2 tons were destroyed and other farms yielded cultivated areas of about 10 acres ... one resident of the city was found growing 100 large plants in his backyard " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
As with alcohol prohibition , the determination of users to continue use of a substance subverted the efforts of law enforcement officials to put a stop to the practice .
However , marihuana prohibitionists continued their campaign .
In 1929 , Colorado passed anti-marihuana legislation , likely aimed at curtailing the habits of Mexican laborers who , being imported to work in the state 's beet sugar fields , brought cannabis supplies north with them ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
The federal government soon adopted an anti-marihuana posture .
On January 1 , 1932 , the Treasury Department 's newly - formed Federal Bureau of Narcotics took over enforcement of federal anti-opiate and anti-cocaine laws .
The fact that the Bureau had no actual legal jurisdiction over marihuana failed to deter Commissioner Harry J. Anslinger from lobbying to include cannabis in future federal legislation .
Shortly after Commissioner Anslinger 's appointment , the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Drug Laws submitted a draft of a " Uniform Anti-Narcotics Act " which the Conference suggested for adoption by individual state legislatures .
In actuality , the text of the model law did not mention inclusion of a ban on marihuana , but did offer states an optional supplementary provision restricting traffic in " Indian hemp " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
By 1937 , the District of Columbia and 46 states had adopted some form of legislation against marihuana .
In most of those states , marihuana was subject to the same rigorous penalties applicable to morphine , heroin , and cocaine , and was often erroneously designated a narcotic " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Encouraged by the zeal of Anslinger and his colleagues , newspapers and magazines gave marihuana scare stories front page coverage .
One horror tale appearing in the July 1937 issue of American Magazine ( and co-authored by Commissioner Anslinger and Courtney Ryley Cooper ) described this atrocity : " An entire family was murdered by a youthful [ marihuana ] addict in Florida .
When officers arrived at the home they found the youth staggering about in a human slaughterhouse .
With an ax he had killed his father , mother , two brothers , and a sister .
He seemed to be in a daze ...
He had no recollection of having committed the multiple crime .
The officers knew him ordinarily as a sane , rather quiet young man ; now he was pitifully crazed .
They sought the reason .
The boy said he had been in the habit of smoking something with youthful friends called ' muggles , ' a childish name for marihuana " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Commissioner Anslinger was not satisfied .
Reacting in large part to his vigorous lobbying efforts , Treasury Department officials submitted to Congress a proposal which was eventually passed as the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 .
The Act did not actually ban marihuana but , like the Harrison Narcotic
Act of 1914 , did recognize the potential medical uses of the substance , while imposing a tax on those involved in distribution .
members of the medical community , including physicians , dentists , veterinarians , were required to pay a licensing fee of $ 1.00 per year , which granted them the right to prescribe cannabis to patients .
Druggists dispensing the substance would pay a $ 15.00 annual licensing fee , with marihuana growers taxed at $ 25.00 per year , and importers , manufacturers , and compounders required to pay $ 50.00 annually to continue in business .
Only nonmedical and untaxed sale or possession of the substance was made illicit .
At this time , the only patent medicine use for cannabis was in preparations of corn plasters or corn removers .
In general , manufacturers elected not to register under the tax , and stopped including the substance in their formulae .
SCARE TACTICS AND TIGHTER LAWS
At the same time the Marihuana Tax Law was passed , Congress also approved a schedule of increased penalties for second , third , and subsequent offenses against existing " narcotic " laws .
Penalties to previous offenders for selling , importing , or exporting narcotics were a maximum of 20 years in prison or $ 10,000 in fines ( Levine , 1974 ) .
In 1939 , the federal government again tightened restrictions via a vehicle seizure law , which provided for confiscation of any vehicles used to transport illicit drugs in violation of federal laws .
Marihuana Narcotic prohibition was on the rise and cannabis was included with the opiates and cocaine in anti-substance legislation .
Since 1937 , restrictive legislation on marihuana has increased in quantity and severity .
Most state marihuana laws specified that marihuana penalties should be the same as heroin penalties .
Thus , as heroin penalties were escalated through the decades , marihuana penalties rose automatically .
Nineteen states , moreover , made no distinction between mere possession of one marihuana cigarette and the sale of large quantities of heroin .
Under both federal law and the laws of many states ... the giving or furnishing of a narcotic drug or of marihuana was included in the definition of " sale " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
State legislatures did not take lightly the threat of multiple ax murders by crazed marihuana smokers .
Evils of the opiates had been publicized widely .
Physicians and laymen alike warned the public of the curse of " addiction . "
Marihuana was less well known than the opiates , but that did n't mean it was less deadly .
The states were taking no chances .
As recently as 1970 , these state penalties were in force :
In Georgia , sale of marihuana to a minor was punishable by life imprisonment , even if it was a first offense ...
A second such offense was punishable by death ... ·
In Illinois , the penalty for a first - sale offense was not less than ten years and as much as life .
A mandatory life sentence was in effect for a second - sale offense .
These penalties remained in effect after a 1968 amendment to the law reduced the penalties for possession of - small amounts .
In Louisiana , anyone over twenty - one years of age possessin marihuana was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years at hard labor for a first offense ...
An adult selling marihuana to another adult was subject to a minimum mandatory sentence of ten years at hard labor and a maximum sentence of thirty years at hard labor and could draw a death sentence .
No suspended sentence or probation was permitted for any sale offenses or for second - possession offenses .
· In Massachusetts , it was a felony punishable by not more than five years in prison to be in a place where marihuana was kept or deposited , or to be in the company of anyone known to be in illegal possession of marihuana .
·
In Missouri , the judge could hand down a life sentence for a second - possession offense or a first - sale offense ... If the buyer were a minor , a death sentence was possible for a first - sale offense ... ·
In Utah a life sentence was possible for a first marihuana sale offense or for a second possession - with - intent - tosell offense ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
The federal government , too , was determined to protect citizens from recreational use of the hemp plant .
In 1951 , fixed mandatory minimum sentences were established for all marihuana ( now classified with the " narcotics " ) offenses .
In 1956 , mandatory federal penalty minimums were raised :
At least two years for first - term possession ; five years for secondoffense possession ( with no parole , probation , suspended sentence possible ) ; five years , minimum , for first offense sale ; and ten years for second sale offense .
Under this law , penalties were identical with respect to marihuana and opiates .
Controlling the Opiates The 1956 Narcotic Control
Act was not restricted to marihuana controls .
It also augmented previous regulations regarding the opiates .
In 1942 , a federal opium poppy control act had required a license for anyone growing opium poppies within the United States , and a 1944 synthetic opiates law had included isonipecaine ( Demerol ( D ) under previous classifications and definitions of narcotic drugs .
In 1946 , legislation controlling other synthetic drugs went into effect .
This defined a new comprehensive class of drugs , the to opiates , " which has since been expanded to deal with a number of synthetic substances , including methadone , under narcotic control laws .
For purposes of this particular act , " opiates " were defined as " any drugs found by the Secretary of the Treasury , after due notice and opportunity for public hearings , to have an addiction - forming or addiction - sustaining liability similar to morphine or cocaine . "
In addition to the mandatory minimum marihuana / narcotic penalties discussed previously , the 1956 Narcotic Control Act also placed travel restrictions on " narcotic addicts . "
Anyone convicted of violating a state or federal law related to marihuana or narcotics , for which the penalty was more than one year 's imprisonment , could neither leave from nor enter the United States unless he registered with U.S. Customs .
The act also provided for surrender of all existing heroin to the federal government ( actual import of opium for heroin manufacturing had been banned in 1924 ) , irrespective of whether that he - roin had been manufactured prior to 1924 .
With the 1956 Narcotic Control
Act in force , prohibitionists should have been able to rest .
But again Americans were finding new drugs to use and to domesticate .
While the abolitionists had been warring against opium derivatives , alcohol , marihuana , and synthetic opiates , other members of the culture were adopting new , licit substances to take the place of those that were being made illicit .
BARBITURATES AND AMPHETAMINES
Gradually , barbiturates and amphetamines became a part of American life .
During the nineteenth century , opiates had been used frequently for their sedative benefits .
However , these were soon found to be addictive and physicians often prescribed bromide salts as an alternative .
Bromides , however , never gained great popularity , largely due to the risk of chronic bromide poisoning .
Until the first years of the twentieth century , physicians continued to prescribe alcohol ( against all threats from temperance unions ) as the most common sedative ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Barbiturates
In 1903 ' barbital , a derivative of barbituric acid , came into medical use as a tranquilizer and sedative .
Trade name for the product was Veronal ( R Nine years later , LuminalO ( phenobarbital ) came on the market .
Apparently , a great many Americans had trouble sleeping .
Demand for the new sedatives increased with alarming speed , and the laboratories were hard pressed to make supply meet demand .
More than 2,500 other barbiturates were subsequently synthesized , and some 50 of them were accepted for medical use -- as sedatives , as sleeping pills , and for other purposes .
Long - acting barbiturates were developed for daytime sedation ; short - acting barbiturates followed for prompt sedation and for inducing sleep without delay ... the end of the 1930s an estimated bMion grains [ of barbiturates ] were being taken each year in the United States alone ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
As with substances before them , the barbiturates were subject to increasing non-medical " abuse . "
In 1942 , a magazine called Hygeia ( later re-named Today 's Health ) , published by the American Medical Association , ran the first article warning against use of barbiturates except by people under a physician 's care . '
That article , titled " 1,250,000,000 Doses a Year , " was followed by a 1945 Hygeia feature called " Waco Was a Barbiturate Hotspot . "
Collier 's followed with it 's April , 1949 . , article , " Thrill Pills Can Ruin You . "
The scare was on .
Barbiturates , once represented as medicallysafe sedative / tranquilizers , had become " thrill pills . "
Sleeping pills had a new image .
They were a new high , a new drunk -- and the scare was on .
Agents of the United States Food and Drug Administration worked to cut down available supplies of non-prescription barbiturates .
States passed laws .
Citizens were arrested .
Headlines ensued .
And a black market developed .
Warnings and scare tactics had literally created the " thrill pill " reputation and the American public was firmly convinced it could become more than calm by taking barbiturates .
One medical result of the barbiturate panic was a trend toward prescrilainq non-bar_biturate datives and sleeping pills ( i.e. , DoridenqO , Placidyl (@ , NoludaA in increasing quantities .
Too , the " minor tranquilizers " came to be used with greater frequency .
The first of these was meprobamate ( marketed as Miltown ( S ) ) and followed by chlordiazepoxide ( Librium and diazepam ( Valiulrg@ The " minor tranquilizers , " particularly , have since gained a reputation as substances of common use and physicians prescribe them for everything from pre-vacation jitters to post - auto accident muscle spasms .
Amphetamines Amphetamines were first synthesized in 1887 , but little use for them was found until 1927 , when laboratory experiments discovered their usefulness in raising blood pressure and stimulating the central nervous system .
During the later part of the 1930s , amphetamines were used to treat both narcolepsy and , curiously , hyperactive children .
During World War II , army physicians issued amphetamines to American , British , German , and Japanese armed forces for alleviation of battle fatigue ( as cocaine had earlier been used for Bavarian soldiers ) .
Following the war , physicians routinely prescribed amphetamines for depression .
During the Korean War era , the earliest intravenous use of amphetamines by United States servicemen was reported .
Some soldiers stationed in Korea and Japan during the early 1950s had the habit of mixing heroin with amphetamine and injecting the combination ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
( This was a variation of the traditional " speedball , " which combined heroin and cocaine . )
A number of returning service men brought the custom back to the United States .
During the late 1950s , some San Francisco area physicians prescribed amphetamine injections as treatment for heroin addiction , often using Methedrine@ .
Availability increased .
As recently as 1960 , it was reportedly common practice in the San Francisco area for injectable amphetamines to be sold without prescription , or via forged prescriptions .
Such practices eventually became known , and the resultant scandals during 1962 and 1963 caused the bulk of injectable amphetamines to be withdrawn from pharmacy shelves .
With injectable amphetamines available legally only to hospitals , the inevitable black market suppliers appeared .
" Speed " went underground and illicit laboratories specializing in the amphetamine business were reported in the San Francisco area as early as 1962 ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
THE 1960s : HALLUCINOGENS
Amphetamines were not the only chemicals being channeled from the laboratory to the streets .
LSD - 25 In 1938 , Drs. Albert Hofmann and W. A. Stoll of Sandoz Laboratories in Basel , Switzerland , discovered the ergot derivative d-lysergic acid diethylamide .
Since this was the twenty - fifth lysergic compound the scientists had discovered , they called the substance LSD - 25 .
When initial testing on animals showed no interesting properties of the drug , the substance was put away for the next five years .
In 1943 , Dr. Hofmann took the first acid trip .
On April 16 , 1943 , Dr. Albert Hofmann ... was working in his lab at Sandoz ... was working with the derivatives of ergot , a fungus that grows on grains .
Sandoz had successfully marketed ergot derivative for use in obstetrics and in treating migraine headaches .
Midway through Friday afternoon Hofmann decided to go home .
He felt restless and dizzy .
At home , " I lay down and immediately fell into a peculiar state similar to a drunkenness , characterized by an exaggerated imagination .
With my eyes closed , fantastic pictures of extraordinary plasticity and intensive color seemed to surge towards me .
After about two hours this condition disappeared . " ...
Hofmann went back to the lab the next week and took what he thought was a very small amount of his new chemical .
He began taking notes : " mild dizziness ... inability to concentrate ... uncontrollable laughter . "
Because of the war there were no cars , so Hofmann got on his bicycle to ride the four miles home , probably the last time anybody has tried to ride a bicycle four miles on LSD .
" My field vision swayed before me and was distorted like the reflections in an amusement park mirror .
The faces of those around me appeared as grostesque , colored masks ; marked motoric unrest . '
He also had " a clear recognition of my condition , in which state I shouted half insanely or babbled incoherent words .
Sounds were transposed into visual sensations so that from each tone or noise a comparable colored picture was evoked , changing in form and color kaleidoscopically . "
That was the second acid trip .
Sandoz sent the new drug off to the University of lurich , and Hofmann 's associate , W. A. Stoll , wrote up the results of the testing .
LSD was not toxic and was not addicting , but an extremely small dosage had profound results .
Most drugs are measured in milligrams , or thousandths of a gram ; LSD was measured in micrograms , or millionths of a gram .
Five grains , an aspirin - sized tablet , could produce effects in 3,000 people .
The United States Army began to stockpile LSD .
Therapists around the world began to use it with patients .
it allowed , they said , repressed memories to come forth , and the material that came up could be better understood because it took the form of visual symbols .
Yet , with all the imagery , the patient kept a state of awareness , and retained his insights after the experience .
Originally , LSD was called a hallucinogen , that is , an agent that causes hallucination .
But the LSD ingester was not quite like , for example , an alcoholic with delirium tremens , who sees snakes and green elephants .
The alcoholic thinks the snakes and green elephants are real ; the LSD subject " does not ordinarily accept them as real .
He remains aware that what he is experiencing is a drug - induced phenomenon . "
So LSD was not a hallucinogen .
Dr. Humphrey Osmond , one of the first psychiatrists to use the drug , called it psychedelic , mind - manifesting or mind - expanding ... and he hoped LSD would be an aid to curing schizophrenia in his Saskatchewan hospital ( Smith , 1975 ) .
Research During the next two decades , LSD - 25 was tested as a possible cure or treatment aide for a variety of medical conditions .
The Maryland Psychiatric Research Center , among other facilities , had success in using the drug for treating chronic alcoholics .
The Cook County Hospital in Chicago and Sinai Hospital in Baltimore reported good results when using LSD to treat pain in terminal cancer patients ( Smith , 1975 ) .
In 1950 , Drs. Anthony K. Busch and Warren C. Johnson published the first report on the use of LSD in psychotherapy treatment .
The doctors , after using the drug on 21 hospitalized psychotic patients , offered the conclusion that LSD - 25 was a promising means of dealing with chronically - withdrawn patients , and that it might serve as a method for shortening the duration of psychotherapy treatment in general .
In Poland , Dr. M. Rostafinski used the drug to treat a small group of epileptic patients .
In the United States , Dr. Charles Savage reported a particular lack of success in using LSD to treat 15 patients suffering from depression .
In 1954 , a German physician named Federking proposed that LSD was more effective than mescaline in treating neurotic patients " refractory to psychotherapy " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
International research continued .
Hallucinogens : One Author 's Trip In The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell , published in the early 1950s , Aldous Huxley described some of his experiences with hallucinogens .
Following is his account of one day 's diversion with mescaline .
Most takers of mescaline experience only the heavenly part of schizophrenia .
The drug brinqs hell and purgatory only to those who have had a recent case of jaundice , or who suffer from periodical depressions or a chronic anxiety ...
But the reasonably healthy person knows in advance that - mescaline is completely innocuous , that its effects will pass off after eight or ten hours , leaving no hangover and consequently no craving for a renewal of the dose ...
We walked out into the street .
A large pale blue automobile was standing at the curb .
At the sight of it , I was suddenly overcome by enormous merriment .
What complacency , what an absurd self - satisfaction beamed from those bulging surfaces of glossiest enamel !
Man had created the thing in his own image -- or rather in the image of his favorite character in fiction .
laughed till the tears ran down my cheeks .
We reentered the house .
A meal had been prepared .
Somebody , who was not yet identical with myself , fell to with ravenous appetite .
From a considerable distance and without much interest , I looked on .
When the meal had been eaten , we got into the car and went for a drive .
The effects of the mescaline were already on the decline : but the flowers in the gardens still trembled on the brink of being supernatural , the pepper trees and carobs along the side streets still manifestly belonged to some sacred grove ...
And then , abruptly , we were at an intersection , waiting to cross Sunset Boulevard .
Before us the cars were rolling by in a steady stream -- thousands of them , all bright and shiny like an advertiser 's dream and each more ludicrous than the last .
Once again I was convulsed with laughter ...
The Red Sea of traffic parted ...
An hour later - we were back at home , and I had returned to that reassuring but profoundly unsatisfactory state known as " being in one 's right mind " ( 1954 ) .
Legislation : Hallucinogens Prior to 1962 , almost all the LSD - 25 and psilocybin available in the United States and Canada was produced by Switzerland 's Sandoz Laboratories .
The chemicals could be purchased , legally , by physicians , psychiatrists , psychologists , and other mental - health professionals who could certify legitimate use for the substances ,
The only major restriction was a United States Food and Drug Administration label on each LSD container : " Caution : New drug - - limited by federal law to investigational use . "
During 1962 and the years immediately following , the Food and Drug Administration issued more stringent regulations pertaining to investigational new drugs ( IND ) , including LSD - 25 .
In consequence , many states passed legislation outlawing LSD and a new federal law further restricting use of investigational drugs , including LSD , went into effect .
Sandoz virtually curtailed production of LSD - 25 .
However , the formula for making LSD could be gotten from the U.S. Patent Office for fifty cents , and precursor chemicals were still relatively easy to acquire .
Underground laboratories began production .
Far from limiting seriously the availability of LSD , the new federal regulations only served to give the drug wider publicity .
Both supply of and demand for " acid " were higher than ever before .
The Sixties took over , the psychedelics became a subcult , the partisans said it brought Utopia , the antagonists said it brought the plague ; LSD became a terror symbol , which made it attractive to children who ... knew that the Establishment and the law and their parents were all lying .
" The anti-LSD publicity , the scare campaigns , and the laws , " said Consumer Reports , " helped to convert what had been ( for twenty years ) a relatively unknown and innocuous drug into a quite damaging one . " ...
The laws were passed , the police were alerted , raids began , the generation gap widened , and the epidemic spread ( Smith , 1975 ) .
LSD and Soci2lz
Two men who helped spread the epidemic and widen the cultural gap were Drs. Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert , instructors at Harvard University 's Center for Research in Human Personality .
During the summer of 1960 , Leary had tried the Mexican psilocybin mushroom -- and liked what he found .
He and Alpert began experimental work with LSD and synthetic psilocybin -- which , by the way , was first synthesized by Sandoz 's Dr. Hofmann , some 15 years after his psychedelic bicycle ride .
In the fall of 1960 , Leary and Alpert purchased some psilocybin from Sandoz for an experiment they planned with prisoners at the Massachusetts Correctional Institute in nearby Concord .
Initial results were promising : Prisoners who had taken a psilocybin trip prior to release from Concord were found less likely to be returned for parole violation than those who had not had an Alpert / Leary trip ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Drs. Leary and Alpert continued to take recreational / experimental acid trips themselves .
Being teachers by profession and generous men by nature , they spread the word of LSD to anyone who would listen :
There was a revolution about to start .
The mind would at last be freed from the bondage of proletarian concerns .
" ' You are never the same after you 've had that one flash glimpse down the cellular time tunnel , ' [ Leary ] said .
' Turn on " ' ( Smith , 1975 ) .
Leary turned on .
So did Alpert , their graduate students , and a conspicuous percentage of those living on the Harvard campus .
In 1962 , the FDA , Massachusetts law enforcement officials , and the Harvard board of trustees caught up with Leary .
Harvard 's Crimson warned students against using LSD .
National media spread the alarm .
While FDA and state officials were investigating Leary , the professor took advantage of this new celebrity stature to campaign nationally for LSD .
At the request of the university , Leary and Alpert left Harvard in spring 1963 .
But this was just the beginning for the two professors .
Rather than sneaking off to find tenure at some small university in the midwest , they did what they could to become cult heroes .
It was their cult .
Their acid .
They had taken the first trips , the first risks .
They were the first dropouts .
They made the rules .
Leary and Alpert preached " set and setting . "
Everything in taking LSD , in having a fruitful - freakout - free LSD experience , depended on set and setting .
You should take it in some serene and attractive setting , a house or apartment decorated with objects of the honest sort , Turkoman tapestries , Greek goatskin rugs , Cost Plus blue jugs , soft light -- not Japanese paper globe light , however , but untasselated Chinese textile shades -- in short , an Uptown Bohemian country retreat of the $ 60,000 - a- year sort , ideally ...
The " set " was the set of your mind .
You should prepare for the experience by meditating upon the state of your being and deciding what you hope to discover and achieve on this voyage into the self .
You should also have a guide who has taken LSD himself and is familiar with the various stages of the experience and whom you know and trust ( Wolfe , 1968 ) .
Their mystique grew .
Followers arrived .
Professors became gurus and America found itself possessed of a subculture that would change its music , life styles , attitudes toward marriage , beliefs in salvation , conception of divinity , the content of its university courses and cookbooks , and the substances it used for recreation and enjoyment .
Post expulsion ... [ Alpert and Leary ] landed in a fiftyfive - room mansion in Millbrook , New York , owned by a Mellon Heir , Billy Hitchcock , with the local cops peering through the bushes .
The local cops were led by G. Gordon Liddy , later known as a Watergate burglar ... ... [ Eventually ] G. Gordon Liddy went to prison for burglarizing the Watergate ...
Leary went to prison for possessing a fingernail 's worth of marihuana ... and Richard Alpert went to India and became Baba Ram Dass , the very symbol of the seeker ( Smith , 1975 ) .
In retreating to Millbrook , Leary and Alpert had hoped to minimize their difficulties with the law .
But , they still had to contend with opposition groups .
Did they bring it on themselves by publicizing the pleasures of psychedelic - heightened consciousness ?
If LSD - 25 had stayed in the laboratory and the parlors of a few university scholars , would it still be legal , available , and pure ?
Academic questions -- and Alpert and Leary were no longer academicians .
They were gurus and the substance of their cult , d-lysergic acid diethylamide , was the newest target of American prohibitionists .
LSD : Prohibition
In 1965 , federal drug abuse control regulations were passed .
Based on its power to regulate interstate commerce , Congress now regulated the sale and use of depressant , stimulant , and hallucinogenic drugs .
The Drug Abuse Control Amendments required the registration of every person who engaged in the manufacture , preparation , compounding , wholesaling , jobbing , and distribution of depressants or stimulants .
Penalties were provided for anyone who sold , gave away , or otherwise distributed any substance in violation of the law , but no stipulation was made regarding someone who possessed depressant or stimulant drugs for use by members of his own household .*
* 1968 amendments to the legislation granted more strict penalties for any convicted of selling or distribution .
For the first time , the 1968 amendments also provided for penalties ( not more than one year in prison , a fine of not more than $ 1,000 , or both , for a first conviction ) for anyone found guilty of illegally possessing a depressant or stimulant drug .
Not to be caught napping , most state legislatures responded to the early - to - mid 1960s attacks on LSD with prohibitive legislation of their own .
In 1965 , New York state passed a law providing for a maximum of two years in prison for anyone convicted of possessing , selling , giving away , or otherwise distributing LSD or " LSD - like drugs . "
Subsequent panic by New York citizenry caused penalties to be increased to a maximum of 20 years in 1966 .
In 1966 , California passed the Grunsky bill , which prohibited possession , sale , manufacture , or importation of LSD and dimethyltryptamine ( DMT ) into the state .
One notable result of the California legislation was to raise the average price of an acid trip from $ 3 to $ 10 ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
Publicity surrounding the legislation did n't hurt LSD 's popularity , either .
Prior to 1962 , the Food and Drug Administration had labeled LSD an " investigational new drug . "
By 1966 , it was almost as well known as aspirin .
For twenty years , from 1943 to 1963 , the dissolving boundaries and unleashed memories and flowing feelings produced by the interaction of Dr. Hofmann 's chemicals and minds brought no talk of revolution .
The subjects and the therapists both had short hair , and society paid them no attention ...
The Freudians found Freudian symbols .
The Jungians found Jungian archetypes and the collective unconscious , the Rankians found separation anxiety , the Sullivanians found oral dynamism ...
Then came : Free Speech , birth control pills , long hair , brotherly love , Flower Children , predators on the Flower Children , cops , narcotics , speed , laws , judges , politicians campaigning , busts , riots , Vietnam , war resisters , the Mafia , Richard Nixon , Woodstock .
Confrontation .
Psychedelics were no longer experimental substances used by researchers to peel back the layers of the mind , they were a social issue -- and a divisive one at that .
LSD ADDICTS STARE AT SUN , the newspapers report ; no point in detailing the hoax , newspapers print what they believe sells .
Someone at the Saturday Evening
Post must have known that picture was thalidomide babies , not " LSD babies , " but they gave it the LSD caption ; more proof that the Establishment lies , said the counter - culture .
Were there some chromosome breaks in the lab experiments ?
Why was that front - page , said the counter - culture , when the same breaks for caffeine and aspirin go unreported ?
Could it be because coffee and tea and aspirin are major advertisers ?
( Smith , 1975 ) .
SUMMER , 1967 Came the summer of 1967 .
The students who heard Leary and Alpert 's promises of universal love , freed consciousness , enlightenment , inner peace , general good times , and LSD all got together in San Francisco for the summer .
The media loved it .
They called it the Summer of Love , called the LSD takers Flower Children .
Communal living , " free " love , gentle , stoned people passing out flowers in the parks .
Marihuana , LSD , and brotherly love were there for the taking .
musicians , journalists , poets , cultural an - IL -.hropoligists , and earnest undergraduates came to Haight - Ashbury to study the phenomenon .
For a very short while , it was phenomenal .
All the revelations that Alpert and Leary promised were there .
Right
Now there are two ways it can go in HaightAshbury .
One is the Buddhist direction , the Leary thing .
There are good heads like Michael Bowen and Gary Goldhill who want to start the League for Spiritual Discovery here and pull the whole movement together in - to one church and give it a focus and even legal respectability .
And they have given up much for this dream .
Goldhill is a beautiful head !
He is an Englishman who was writing this experimental stuff for TV in England and the BBC sent him to the U.S ... and he took a vacation in Mexico and ran into some American heads in San Miguel de Allende who said , Man , you got to come back here when the rainy season start and take some magic mushrooms , and damned if they did n't send him a telegram in Guadalajara or wherever -- RAINS CAME MUSHROOMS UP -- and he returned out of curiosity and took the mushrooms , just as Leary had , and discovered the Management and gave up all , all the TV BBC game and dedicated himself to The Life - for , as Leary has said , a home should be a place of purity that the Gautama Buddha himself could walk into from 485 B.C. and feel at home .
For some day grass must grow again in the streets , in pastoral purity , for life is shit , a duress of bad karmas , endless fight against catastrophe , which is to be warded off finally only by utter purification of the soul , utter passivity in which one becomes nothing ... but a vessel of the All . - the All - one ... ... as against the Yesey direction , whict@ has became the prevailing life style of Haight - Ashbury ... beyond catastrop ; Le .... like , picking up on anything that works and moves , every hot wire , every tube , ray , volt , decibel , beam , floodlight and combustion of American flag - flying neon Day - Glo America and winding it up to some mystical extreme carrying to the western - most edge of experience - ( Wolfe , 1968 ) .
Owsley ( August Owsley Stanley III , sound man for the Grateful Dead rock group ) was home - brewing the very finest LSD and everybody 's trip was beautiful .
The Haight - Ashbury heads held the first big " be-in , " the Love Festival on October 7 , on the occasion of the California law against LSD going into effect .
Thousands of heads piled in , in high costume , ringing bells , chanting , dancing ecstatically , blowing their minds one way and another and making their favorite satiric gesture to the cops , handing them flowers , burying the bastids in tender fruity petals of love ... the thina was fantastic , a freaking mind - blower , thousands of high - loving heads out there messing up the minds of the cops and everybody else in a fiesta of love and euphoria ( Wolfe , 19G8 ) .
Orange Sunshine , a combinsation of lysergic acid and ergotamine tartrate , was reportedly Owsley 's best product .
To the buyer on the street , just the word " Sunshine " was enough to ensure quality in LSD .
Soon , due to federal restrictions and penalties , chemically - pure LSD - 25 was no longer available .
Owsley and his chemists kept trying to improve their product , but Sandoz they were not .
Searching for the ultimate ' acid , " they mixed Orange Sunshine with strychnine , amphetamines , other chemicals .
They called them Clear - Lite , Window Pane , Purple Pie , Yellow Smash , but with no FDA to control production , " acid " was n't only LSD - 25 any longer .
The flower children were uncritical consumers .
They believed in trust , and they often trusted people who should n't have been .
" Mescaline " was rarely pure -- or even partially - - mescaline .
" Psilocybin " was sometimes the dried magic mushroom , sometimes its synthetic equivalent , sometimes canned grocery store mushrooms soaked in phencyclidine ( PCPJ , an animal tranquilizer producing a chemical reaction close to alcohol intoxication .
Amphetamines were n't pure .
Most every substance was cut with strychnine or arsenic -- or even rat poison or baby powder .
Even the cannabis was often treated with something to make it " better " than nature intended .
When the children took the strychnine , or the arsenic , or the atropine , or the Methedrine , or even LSD -- sometimes there really was a college chemist just cooking for his friends -- they sometimes had adverse reactions , whereupon their friends dumped them into the emergency room of a hospital , an environment that can produce a bad trip in people who are stone cold sober and just passing through ( Smith , 1975 ) .
LEGACY OF THE SUMMER
Before long the summer of love was corrupted .
Police started raiding the children 's homes and carting them off to jail on charges varying from illegal possession of drugs to cohabitation .
Chemicals bought on the street were increasingly unreliable .
" Speed freaks " and " junkies " moved in , bringing their amphetamines and heroin with them .
The flower people moved to the country - , the heroin and amphetamine users stayed .
Amphetamines " Speed kills , " the LSD users warned .
Maybe it did n't often ( technically ) kill those who used it , but speed did help end the fragile climate of brotherhood ( Haight - Ashbury ) in the counter - culture .
As early as 1965 , the underground press had tried to warn cannabis and LSD users away from amphetamines .
Poet Allen Ginsberg said it best , in his December , 1965 , interview in the Los Angeles Free Press : " Let 's issue a general declaration to all the underground community , contra speedamos ex cathedra .
Speed is antisocial , paranoid making , it 's a drag , bad for your body , bad for your mind , generally speaking , in the long run uncreative and it's a plague on the whole dope industry .
All the nice gentle dope fiends are getting screwed up by the real horror monster Frankenstein speed freaks who are going around stealing and bad mouthing everybody ' ( B7 Lecher , 1972 ) .
The 1970 Interim Report of Canada 's ( Le Dain ) Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs analyzed the phenomenon of amphetamine use in the counter culture : " Som ' speed ' users who inject almost suicidal doses of methamphetamine into their veins without any regard for their safety and health , may actually be trying to test the truth of the youth slogan ' Speed Kills . '
The role of the doomed person who is at once a martyr sacrificing himself , a hero braving the confrontation with certain destruction and a gambler playing dice with death , is a role which seems to have a strong seductive pull for some young people who are morbidly hungry for compassion , admiration and excitement .
For these individuals the slogan ' Speed Kills , ' may , paradoxically , carry more attractive than deterrent power -- and thus may not serve the purpose for which it is being promoted " ( Brecher , 1972 ) .
The federal government increased efforts to curb increasing black market amphetamine traffic .
Underground speed labs were busted , as illegal stills had been during alcohol prohibition .
Speed became harder to come by .
Legal stimulants were controlled closely .
Prices went up .
Black market merchants began importing increased amounts of cocaine to meet the stimulant demand .
HEROIN AND THE MIDDLE CLASS
The descendents of Haight - Ashbury turned increasingly to heroin .
Use was no longer centered mainly in the non-white ghettos ; the heroin habit was finding a place in the lives of children from white , middle income homes .
In an article in the Spring , 1971 , issue of the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs , three medical staff members of the Haight - Ashbury Medical Clinic traced the changing patterns of heroin use :
Within the last two years L`1969 to 1971, 7 there has evolved a new style of heroin addict consisting largely of alienated white youth suffering from disillusionment , disaffiliation , frustration , and despair ...
1970 is becoming recognized as the " year of the middle class junkie , ' a reflection of the changing socioeconomic background of today 's heroin extraction .
They have begun using heroin ( the perfect tranquilizer ) only within the last few years and are now beginning to seek medical help in rapidly increasing numbers .
The " middle class Junkie " is ... composed of two rather distinct types : the " New Junkie " ( who began using heroin after January , 1967 ) and the " Transition Junkie " ( who began using heroin between January , 1964 and January , 1967 ) .
The TJ is characterized by a similar family and social background to the " New Junkie " and differs mainly in the effects of the social atmosphere of the drug subculture that existed when he came onto the scene .
He passed through a period of optimism and hope , and reflects this in the drugs he used heavily prior to heroin ( the psychedelics and amphetamines ) .
He is a self - medicator and a drug experimenter ; he has " tried all drugs . "
The newer addict entered the drug subculture at a time of beginning frustration and despair , and therefore , engaged in less experimentation before " settling " on heroin .
He is more aware of the dangers of the " street drugs " ( havinq seen some of the effects on the Transition Junkie 's contemporaries ) .
and less of a self - treater than his Transition Junkie counterpart .
These two groups together lNJ and TJ ./ make up the " middle class junkies " and are distinguished from the older ghetto - bred addicts ... by many factors other than background , family status , percentage of females , and race .
They are also separated by therapeutic response , with the older addict being a more " faithful " patient and less likely ... to get " clean " than his newer counterparts ( Sheppard e t a l. , 19 72 ) .
The Haight - Ashbury Free Medical Clinic study on which the above report was based uses January , 1964 , as the approximate time when heroin use began to spread from non-white ghetto areas into segments of America 's white , middle class community .
As Sheppard , Gay , and Smith stipulate in the article , the San Francisco area has proven to be a place where drug use trends begin some six to 18 months before they are evident in the rest of the country .
An Addicted Author : Heroin vs. Hallucinogens
When I speak of drug addiction I do not refer to keif , marijuana , or any preparation of hashish , mescaline , Bannisteria Caapi , LSD6 , Sacred Mushrooms or other drug of the hallucinogen group ...
There is no evidence that the use of any hallucinogen results in physical dependence .
The action of these drugs is physiologically opposite to the action of junk .
A lamentable confusion between t two classes of drugs has arisen owing to the zeal of the US and other narcotic departments ... ...
All the hallucinogen drugs are considered sacred by those who use them -- there are peyote cults and Bannisteria cults , hashish cults and mushroom cults -" The Sacred Mushrooms of Mexico enable a man to see God " -- but no one ever suggested that Junk is sacred .
There are no opium cults .
opium is profane ...
Junk is the ideal product ... the ultimate merchandise .
No sales talk necessary .
The client will crawl through a sewer and beg to buy ...
The junk merchant does not sell his product to the consumer , he sells the consumer to his product .
He degrades and simplifies the client ...
I awoke from The Sickness at the age of forty - five , calm and sane , and in reasonably good health except for a weakened liver and the look of borrowed flesh common to all who survive The Sickness ... Most survivors do not remember the delirium in detail .
I @Lpparently took detailed notes on sickness and delirium .
I have no precise memory of writing the notes which have now been published under the title Naked Lunch ... ... I lived in one room in the native quarter of Tangier .
I had not taken a bath in a year nor changed my clothes or removed them except to stick a needle every day in the fibrous grey wooden flesh of terminal addiction .
I never cleaned or dusted the room .
Empty ampule boxes and garbage piled to the ceiling .
Light and water long since turned off for nonpayment .
I did absolutely nothing .
I could look at the end of my shoe for eight hours .
I was only roused to action when the hourglass of junk ran out ... And suddenly my habit began to jump and jump .
Forty , sixty grains a day .
And still it was not enough .
And I could not pay ( Burroughs , 1960 ) .
Federal Response to Heroin Use
By 1966 it was apparent that heroin use by whites was increasing .
That same year , the federal government passed the Narcotic Addiction Rehabilitation Act , which provided treatment and rehabilitation for both convicted and volunteer heroin addicts .
The Act specified conditions for short - term , in - patient care in medical facilities , and for long - term , continued out - patient care in the community .
The United States Surgeon General was mandated to assist states and municipalities in developing treatment programs and facilities for addicted " narcotic " users .
As defined in the law , " treatment " was to include " ' confinement and treatment in an institution , and supervised after - care in the community ... designed to protect the public and benefit the addict by correcting his anti-social tendencies and ending his dependence on addictive drugs and his susceptibility to addiction " ' ( Levine , 1974 ) .
In 1968 the Department of Justice 's Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs was created .
The Bureau , charged with enforcing federal laws having the goal of suppressing illicit drug traffic , replaced the two agencies previously concerned with drug- rrelated activities : the Treasury 's Federal Bureau of Narcotics and HEW 's Bureau of Drug Abuse Control .
Irrespective of federal control efforts , heroin use continued to increase .
Young people had heard too many scare tactics and warnings they knew were false : " Marihuana is habit forming , " " LSD causes insanity , leads to deformed babies . "
People were familiar with different drugs -- had tried them , used them occasionally ( or frequently ) , believed that government and medical indictments against the substances came from ignorance , fear , hostility toward the youth culture .
Heroin was just another drug , something they could try , and could stop using whenever they became bored with it .
HEROIN : THE VIETNAM WAR Vietnam brought many white young people who would otherwise never have seen an opium poppy into contact with heroin .
Young whites and blacks , just graduated from high school or university , were drafted and sent to fight a guerrilla war in a small Asian country they had never studied in geography class .
Heroin , marihuana , amphetamines , and barbiturates were available .
Since cannabis and opium poppies were common agricultural crops in southeastern Asia , marihuana and heroin were particularly inexpensive .
The combination of war , substance availability , boredom , the sense of futility in fighting a war nobody seemed to be winning , and a general scepticism about anti-heroin warnings from the government that " got us into this mess in the first place " all combined to turn a number of American soldiers on to heroin .
Like their Korean War predecessors , many United States military men in Vietnam had some variety of heroin habit .
Some brought the habit with them to Vietnam ; others learned not long after they arrived .
The Military 's Response Military officials turned their heads , discharged some soldiers for use of marihuana , and ignored the heroin problem as long , as they could .
Shortly after the United States began military support to South Vietnam , high incidence of drug abuse , particularly of marihuana and dangerous drugs such as the amphetamines and barbiturates occurred among the military stationed there .
The Department of Defense appointed several Task Forces to inquire into ... the problem ...
Early reports from one of the Task Forces stated that there was a relatively low rate of drug abuse in the services ...
The report concluded that there was virtually no drug addiction in the military ...
In contrast ... in 1969 the military conducted about 36,000 investigations of drug abuse and in 1970 , about twice that many ( Levine , 1974 ) .
Addicted Soldiers
One survey by two army physicians conducted on GI 's returning from Vietnam showed that more than 16 percent admitted using heroin during their final thirty days in Vietnam .
But about 6 percent of those GI 's interviewed admitted using heroin before going to Vietnam .
A congressional Committee , in early 1971 , found that a significant portion of the drug users were inducted into the services because of inadequate pre-induction screening .
During early 1971 , as a result of an amnesty program , the Pentagon reported that nearly sixteen thousand servicemen voluntarily identified themselves as heroin users and sought treatment .
The majority of those servicemen who sought treatment ( 14,736 ) were from the Army .
The remainder ( 977 ) included servicemen from the Navy , Marines , and Air Force .
There is no estimate of how many servicemen qualified for treatment but did not identify themselves as heroin users .
...
Whatever estimated figure one chooses to accept , there were anywhere from 25,000 to 50,000 American troops in Vietnam who were heroin users by mid-1971 , and this estimate does not include addicted servicemen who had previously served in Vietnam and returned to civilian life .
Perhaps the most alarming statistics show that the death toll from heroin overdose 21rose , 7 in Vietnam despite the reduction in the number of men stationed there .
In 1970 , the quarterly average reported was 26 deaths from heroin overdose ; in the first quarter of 1971 , the figure rose to 35 deaths ( Levine , 1974 ) .
In early 1971 , the Veterans Administration set up a treatment program for discharged heroin addicts .
By June , 32 clinics treating 6,000 people were in operation .
Treatment was primarily by methadone maintenance .
Also in June , 1971 , President Nixon appointed Dr. Jerome H. Jaffe to head the new White House Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention , which was to have overall responsibility for major federal drug abuse prevention , education , treatment , rehabilitation , training , and research programs .
The only area that Dr. Jaffe 's office did not oversee was the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs , under the control of the State Department and the Department of Defense .
COMPREHENSIVE FEDERAL LEGISLATION
In 1970 , the federal government passed the Controlled Substances Act ; it provided , for the first time , a comprehensive , integrated set of regulations governing substance use and control .
Briefly , these are the main areas covered by the act : e Five separate substance schedules are set down , according to the " potential for abuse " and current accepted medical use attributed to each substance group .
- Schedule I : heroin ; marihuana* ; LSD ; THC ; hallucinogens .
* Like earlier legislation , the 1970 Act includes marihuana with heroin as substances whose users receive the most severe category of penalties .
- Schedule II : Opium ; morphine Dilaudide ; Demerol ; Methadone ; cocaine ; liquid amphetamine .
- Schedule III : amphetamines ; Nallineq shortacting barbiturates ; and DoridenR , Noludalo , RitalenP , paregoric .
- Schedule IV : minor tranquilizers ; long - acting barbiturates .
- Schedule V : substances that can be sold over the counter , without prescriptions -- primarily cough syrups , such as terpin hydrate with codeine .

Separate penalty scales are provided for violations within each substance schedule . 
The act differentiates between " addict , " " user , " and " trafficker " when setting penalties .

The jurisdictions for controlling drugs as they pass from manufacturer to distributer to consumer are specified .

Provision is made for including any new substances or drugs under the five schedules of the existing act . 
The act calls for increased research regarding prevention of drug abuse , and for continued research on treatment and rehabilitation methods .
Also in 1970 , the National Conference of Commissioners approved a Uniform Controlled Substances Act. Provisions outlined in the Act were to be adopted separately by each state .
Like the federal Controlled Substances
Act of 1970 , this was an attempt to create a codified system of drug control , classifying all narcotics , " the " dangerous drugs , " and marihuana into five separate penalty scales .
Particular penalties were left to the determination of individual states .
TRANSITIONS : 1970 TO 1977
Drug use in recent years has meant neither the social stigmas nor the revolutionary political convictions that were partners of the drug culture in the 1960s .
One of the most significant patterns to emerge during the 1970s is that there are no longer set stereotypes of drug users and drug use patterns .
Ghetto junkies are n't the only heroin addicts .
Student radicals are n't the only people smoking marihuana and trying cocaine .
Long - distance truckers are not the exclusive users of amphetamines .
At one time in the twentieth century , the statement " minorities are the heroin addicts " might have been largely true .
Use of opiates once implied images of alien , ghetto - based " misfits . "
Vietnam challenged the preconceptions .
The country saw a significant percentage of its white , middle - class young people return from the Vietnam War with the heroin habit .
For the first time , the ghetto junkie stereotype was n't adequate to describe the problem .
Use of other substances -- marihuana , LSD , cocaine , mescaline , peyote , amphetamines -- during the 1960s implied the user 's belief in social revolution and his search for the cosmic knowledge Leary had promised .
When Vietnam , Kent State , the marches on the Pentagon were over , the student radicals and the seekers began to disappear .
They became professionals , parents , members of the community .
To some extent , most still used some of the drugs they had been turned on to during the decade before .
Younger students kept their elders ' patterns of drug use -- but without the implicit social / revolutionary convictions that had been an integral part of what media liked to call " the youth drug culture . "
Again , the old stereotypes would n't work .
The Polydrug Phenomenon
Use of a particular substance can no longer be attributed to a single subculture .
The pharmacological and street names of drugs , their effects and side effects , have received good press ; society as a whole is more knowledgeable than it was .
Sometimes , the knowledge has resulted in a greater tolerance toward use of a substance , such as with marihuana .
Sometimes , the information has helped create a more knowledgeable drug user - someone who uses , even mixes , many kinds of drugs openly without the fear of societal and legal reprisals he once would have had .
The New York Times , in a March 25 , 1973 , article titled " Mixing of Mind - Altering Drugs Rises as Spread of Heroin Addiction Slows , " attempted to analyze what has been called " polydrug use " : " Allowing for variations of region , age and class , cocaine , methadone and alcohol , and a variety of barbiturates and other ' downersl - - most notably a sedative - hypnotic known as methaqualone -- appear to be increasingly popular street drugs .
" And , while it is difficult to gauge the extent of the phenomenon , a considerable number of people appear to be casually using and abusing several drugs in often dangerous combinations -- methaqualone and alcohol , or methadone and alcohol ...
Vvin San Franci a narcotics police officer notes :
Three years ago , it was common to have five or six young people collapse in school every day from an overdose of barbiturates .
We do n't get that any more ; the kids are becoming more sophisticated about drugs . '
" As for heroin , a Chicago drug counselor observes : ' Word has gone out to the black community that smack is part of their oppression , and they are sticking to grass and psychedelics and pills , uppers and downers , for their highs . '
" Polydrug abuse , as the drug - mixing phenomenon is known , appears to be characteristic of both school - age dabblers and old - time junkies , who are finding it almost impossible to ' cop ' ( buy ) good - quality heroin " ( Markham , 1975 ) .
Same Drugs , Different Campus
In the September , 1977 , issue of Esquire magazine , a 1975 Yale University graduate talks about drug use when he was on campus .
It was , he says , a time of many drugs and few politics .
The trappings of rebellion hung loosely on us , like older siblings ' clothes .
We espoused hand - me - down politics and tripped on hand - me - down LSD ...
We saw the drop outs of older classes crawling off to communes or hanging about the college ...
They were exhausted -- refugees from themselves -- politicall
As a sports gamer , often I find myself coming under fire for my choice of gaming purchases .
Each year we see the same litany of games hit the store shelves and each year , I like millions of other , buy each and every one of them .
Like many gamers I enjoy playing these games against friends online and off , the same exact way I enjoy playing Call of Duty or Gears Of War .
Yet when I play those games I hear no sarcastic sneers and receive no pointed questions heaved in my direction .
Yet when I buy Madden or Smackdown or MLB The Show I get bombarded with the likes of …
Why did you buy that when _____ is coming out next week ?
Why do you waste your money on the same game year after year ?
Why do you pay $ 60 for a roster update ?
Why not buy last year ’s , it ’s half the price ?
Why , why , why ???
Well , that ’s an easy answer .
Because I want to play that particular game and I like that particular franchise .
It ’s a fairly simple concept .
Funny is n’t it how we all buy the same FPS ’s year after year yet no one says boo about that .
Really is Left 4 Dead 2 going to be anymore different from Left For Dead as this years NBA 2 K was from last years ?
Nope .
Yet we all will buy that without pause .
I feel however you ’re not going to leave this subject alone until I really prove the validity of these games and prove without a doubt my justification for lining EA ’s pockets with gold .
For the sake of argument I will use Madden as my example .
It ’s the most prominent and played sports game so it will work well as my point of thesis .
Yes we do get a roster upgrade , you are correct there but we get quite a plethora more .
I feel most of this animosity comes from folks who are n’t avid fans of the sports in question or are n’t well versed in the nuances of the particular leagues so they do n’t notice the little things that make huge differences to those of us who follow the game and thirst for realism .
Playbooks are the biggest upgrade from year to year .
Take the wildcat formation .
It has taken over the NFL by storm when two years ago no team even ran it .
Now it ’s in Madden and the teams that run it in real life each have their own specific wildcat plays .
That ’s just one instance .
On a larger scale teams fire and hire coaches each year .
These coaches then implement their own offensive and defensive schemes which in most cases are completely different than their predecessors , thus changing completely the way a team plays and operates .
A teams playbook in 2008 is n’t the same as in 2009 .
A small thing you might say , but it ’s rather big in actuality .
Beyond the playbook we get animation upgrades on both sides of the ball which change the way the game is played .
Gang tackles can now take place .
Quarterbacks can now release the ball mid sack .
Fumbles no longer appear magically in the hands of a player .
Blocking improvements completely changed the way we Madden players approached the game .
Michael Vick is back and better than before .
Online franchise mode has so much user control that you can do any pregame task with your cell phone or computer .
Exploits were fixed , other were found .
New stadiums were introduced as well as new jerseys and effects which mirrored things exclusive to this years NFL season .
A half time show was added on .
Referee animations and cut scenes added a level of realism never present in the previous installments .
A new injury system was implemented giving the user the choice to put your player back in and risk further injury or have him sit it out .
That ’s just to name a few and I mean it when I say I could go on quite a bit longer but I think you get my point .
The same game as last year ?
I think not .
While you might not be able to tell the difference , that does n’t change the fact that there are differences .
Are the games remarkably similar year to year ?
Sure they are .
So is every Halo or God Of War .
Each successful series refines rather than reinvents .
That ’s why we love them so .
They perfect what needs to be perfected and keep in tact what already worked .
Now I ’m not saying every sports game is good .
Lord knows MLB 2K9 was just awful .
I ’m not defending every title either .
Tiger Woods PGA
Tour Golf stands out as the one exception to the rule that does n’t change enough year to year to warrant the price tag , but the same could be said for many non-sports titles as well , and like I said , it ’s clearly the exception to the rule .
So there ’s your answer .
That ’s why I buy the same sports games every year .
I fork over my $ 60 for the same reasons you did or will for Halo 3 : ODST , Modern Warfare 2 and Uncharted 2 .
I ’m a gamer and that ’s what I love to play .
So when a new installment come out I buy it , simple and plain .
So maybe now we can put this little question to bed once and for all and stop all the jabs .
We ’re all gamers .
Belittling what I choose to play does n’t make your 360 or ps3 perform any better than mine does .
It does n’t make you any better at the games you play .
It does n’t even damage my credibility as a gamer .
My library of titles likely mirrors your own .
So let ’s just stop and realize that we are all gamers .
No matter the genre , we all simply play what we like because we think that it ’s good .
On the Losing Side of a Credit Battle
Where have all the jobs gone
long time passing
Where have all the jobs gone
long time ago
Where have all the jobs gone
Gone to graveyards everyone
When will they ever return
Oh when will they ever return
– Sung to the tune of “ Where Have All the Flowers Gone ? ”
“ Many lost jobs in US will never come back … ” says The Wall Street Journal .
Need we explain why ?
Because they ’re not lost , waiting to be rediscovered .
They ’re not missing in action , to be repatriated after the fighting stops .
Instead , they ’re dead .
Gone forever .
There have been 7.2 million jobs lost since recession began .
Many of these jobs were Bubble Age jobs .
Millions of people , for example , earned their money in ‘ housing . ’
They were putting up houses in the sand states … or building granite countertops … or selling , flipping , financing the houses .
Those jobs are gone forever .
Never again in our lifetimes are we likely to see such an explosion in the housing industry .
Sure , people will still build houses … and do all the other work involved in the traditional housing industry .
But it will be only a fraction of the industry it was in the 2002 - 2007 period .
There were also all the jobs involved in selling things to people who did n’t need them and could n’t afford them .
Labor was needed at every step of the way – manufacturing ( perhaps in China ) , shipping , stocking , retailing , fixing , and financing the stuff .
And do n’t forget all that mall space … and all the trucks …and all the other things that supported the over - consumption of the Bubble Age .
And now the Bubble Age is over .
It will not come back , no matter how much cash and credit the feds pump into the system .
( Not that they ca n’t make things worse … in a BIGGER bubble … but that is not yet in sight . )
In The Wall Street Journal yesterday was an item about Las Vegas .
The casinos are folding up their expansion plans , says the WSJ .
But the big news yesterday was that the service industries are growing again …at least that ’s what the latest figures show .
This news so delighted investors that they bid up Dow stocks 112 points .
Oil rose above $ 70 .
Gold posted a $ 13 gain .
Do n’t get too excited about that rise in the service sector .
Everything bounces …even dead jobs .
Dead jobs bounce ; they still do n’t get up .
After months of decline , it may be true that the service industries have had a rebound , but do n’t expect them to begin recovering the stamina and strength of the bubble years .
A few more people may have gotten jobs serving drinks in Detroit ’s bars last month , but it is not likely to turn into a durable recovery of the job market ,
In the 1990s , the US economy added 2.15 million new jobs every year .
It needed to add at least 1.5 million or so just to remain at full employment – that is , with about 5 % of the workforce unemployed at any time .
To put that number in perspective , this year the economy as LOST 2.5 million jobs , just in the last six months .
Those jobs are n’t coming back .
As we keep saying , this is a depression .
It is a major correction , in which the economy needs to find new jobs … because it ca n’t continue to do what it has been doing .
New jobs are typically created by new businesses – small businesses that are growing .
Big businesses already have all the market share they ’re going to get .
They also typically have all the employees they need .
Then , when hard times come , they discover that they do n’t need all that they have , so they cut back .
Job cuts from large businesses is what you expect in a recession .
But this time it is different .
This time , big businesses have let people go by the million .
But small business has not been hiring them either .
So not only is unemployment growing … the trend shows no signs of coming to an end .
Economists are reconciled to high unemployment levels for a long time .
The head of the IMF says unemployment might peak out in 8 to 12 months .
Even if that were true , it will be a very long time before the job market recovers .
Just do the math .
We ’ll keep it simple .
The economy needs , say , 1.5 million new jobs per year .
Instead , over the last two years , it lost 7.5 million .
Now , it has to stop losing jobs … let ’s just say that happens a year from now .
By then , the total of jobs lost may be near 10 million .
Plus , there are the new jobs it needed – but never got – over that 3 year period .
That ’s another 4.5 million .
So , the total will be about 14.5 million jobs down .
Then , let us say , because we are in a generous and optimistic mood , that the economy then begins creating jobs again … at the rate it did during the ’90s .
What ho !
After five years , that still leaves the economy more than 10 million jobs short , does n’t it ?
In order to get back to full employment , the economy has to surprise us on the upside .
It has not merely to return to the growth levels of the ’90 s … it has to surpass them .
It needs to grow so fast it creates 3 million jobs per year .
And even then , it would take nearly 10 years to get back to full employment .
Pretty grim , huh ?
Well , do n’t worry about it .
It wo n’t be like that .
It will be worse .
Keep reading …
“ Uh … Bill … what do you mean , ‘ worse ’ ? ”
Glad you asked .
In the typical post - war recession , jobs are lost … then they are recovered when the economy gets on its feet again .
But this happened in the credit expansion of the ’ 45 - ’07 period .
Each recession was just a pause , when the economy was catching its breath .
Then , it was off again … in the same direction – up the mountain of credit .
This time , it ’s not a typical post - war recession .
It ’s something different .
Now , we ’ve reached the peak .
We ’re coming down the other side … wheee !
Look out below !
Now we do n’t need all those people building houses , stocking the shelves and selling things .
We do n’t need such a big financial industry either .
Now , people want to get rid of credit , not get more .
And the businesses that were goosed up in the credit bubble are now deflating fast .
They ’re not just taking a break .
They ’re lining up the jobs and shooting them in the back of the head .
Those jobs are gone .
( See below … )
In a ‘ normal ’ recession , jobs reappear because the economy continues in the same direction .
In a depression , it changes course .
Debts are paid off .
Spending goes down , more or less permanently .
The economy actually contracts … until consumer debt is once again down at an acceptable level …or a new model for growth can be found .
The Wall Street Journal mentions a statistician who was making $ 100,000 a year .
He too is a victim of depression .
His job has been outsourced to India .
Businesses , with less revenue coming in the door , must cut costs in whatever way they can .
Labor is the single biggest item on most firms ’ ledgers .
They will reduce it however they can .
And once the change is made , there is little chance that the job will come back .
It is a little like a battle .
In an attack , troops often get separated .
They are ‘ lost ’ – for a while .
Then , the winning side is able to recover its missing troops as it advances .
But the losing side gives up its troops forever .
They are stuck behind enemy lines and cannot rejoin their units .
We are now on the losing side of a credit battle .
Having gained so much ground , and so many jobs , in the advance , the United States is now giving them up .
“ I expect over the next several months , mainstream pundits and forecasters will start worrying about tepid hiring , even as the pace of job losses slows , ” Strategic Short Report ’s Dan Amoss chimes in .
“ As we ‘ lap ’ the 2009 corporate cost cutting by early 2010 , and top lines fail to rebound , earnings estimates will have to come back down .
I ’m amazed at how many sell - side analysts are modeling V - shaped recoveries in 2010 earnings .
Most stock prices are disconnected from reality . ”
And here is a story we foretold years ago .
Private equity was mostly a fraud , we said .
Sharp operators bought companies for more than they were worth , loaded them with debt , collected huge fees , and then sold them back to the public or to other private equity firms .
Come the revolution , we mused , these deals would go bad .
Well , the revolution has come .
The deals have gone bad .
The New York Times reports :
“ Simmons [ the mattress company ] says it will soon file for bankruptcy protection , as part of an agreement by its current owners to sell the company – the seventh time it has been sold in a little more than two decades – all after being owned for short periods by a parade of different investment groups , known as private equity firms , which try to buy undervalued companies , mostly with borrowed money .
“ For many of the company ’s investors , the sale will be a disaster .
Its bondholders alone stand to lose more than $ 575 million .
The company ’s downfall has also devastated employees like Noble Rogers , who worked for 22 years at Simmons , most of that time at a factory outside Atlanta .

The Daily Reckoning
Horrifying moment a man jumped into a bear 's enclosure .
Incredibly , BOTH survived
A man hangs in the jaws of a bear , seemingly about to endure a most horrendous death by being ripped apart by massive jaws and razor - sharp claws .
But in the end it was the bear who ended up fighting for his life - shot with a police bullet in order to save the man 's life .
These dramatic photographs were taken by a visitor to the Berne Bear Park , Switzerland , at the weekend when European brown bear Finn , aged four , suddenly realised he had an uninvited human guest - said yesterday to be mentally handicapped - in his enclosure .
The unidentified man is said to be doing well after the brutal bear attack
The man perched for ten minutes on a 20ft wall above Finn 's pit before he jumped in .
That allowed worried park officials time to call police .
They arrived , armed with 9 mm ' fragmentation ' ammunition which splinters on impact , just seconds before the man jumped down into the danger zone .
The bear quickly grabbed him .
Finn picked up the intruder as if he were a rag doll , carting him to the other side of his enclosure , which opened last month .
Finn can be seen almost playing with his victim before he is finally taken down by a police marksman
And as his massive jaws and teeth - capable of crushing steel - sank into his prey , police had to act fast .
They were left with no option but to open fire , they said .
Finn was hit with a single bullet to the chest .
Police , ambulancemen and zoo - keepers rushed in .
The man , who has not been named , was quickly taken away on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance .
He was treated in hospital for severe head and leg injuries , and his condition yesterday was said to be comfortable .
Finn is photographed wandering off after leaving his prey seriously injured
Paramedics move into the enclosure to rescue the injured man
Finn , lying tranquillised under medical observation in his enclosure in Bern
Finn meanwhile was treated at the bear park by vets who decided not to operate to remove the bullet splinters , treating him with antibiotics , to which he was said to be responding well .
Bears are special for the people of Berne , being the city 's symbol since the Middle Ages .
Briton Sam Brookes , who was visiting the park with his girlfriend when the attack happened , said : ' I looked in after I heard people screaming .
' The bear was standing over him and throwing him back and forth .
' Some yelled , " Get stones " to throw at the bear .
I think most people had an awful shock .
I can still see it when I close my eyes . '
Police and zoo officials say there has been an outpouring of public sympathy - for the bear .

South Korean authorities on Wednesday halved the daily limit on text messages sent out by mobile phones as part of a campaign against spam , officials said .
The number of text messages that a mobile user can send out a day was restricted to 500 , down from 1,000 , beginning Wednesday , the Korea Communications Commission said .
The commission said the previous ceiling had been abused by spammers and was ineffective in cutting down on the junk mail .
The spreading of spam to people without consent is banned and subject to a heavy fine in South Korea , but the practice dies hard .
South Korea had 47.7 million mobiles registered for use as of October , accounting for 98 percent of the total population .

A serving soldier facing a court martial for refusing to return to Afghanistan called on Britain to withdraw all troops from the country at an anti-war demonstration in London yesterday that attracted 5,000 protesters .
Lance Corporal Joe Glenton , 27 , of the Royal Logistic Corps , said the presence of British forces in one of the world 's poorest countries was making the situation worse .
" It is distressing to disobey orders , but when Britain follows America in continuing to wage war against one of the world 's poorest countries , I feel I have no choice , " he told anti-war protesters at Speakers ' Corner in Hyde Park .
" Politicians have abused the trust of the army and the soldiers who serve .
That 's why I am compelled and proud to march with the Stop the War Coalition . "
The father of a soldier killed in Iraq , who recently refused to shake hands with Tony Blair , also attended the march .
Peter Brierley , 59 , whose son , Lance Corporal Shaun Brierley , was killed in Iraq in 2003 , recounted how he told the former prime minister at a memorial at St Paul 's Cathedral , London , that he had blood on his hands and that one day he would have to answer for what he had done .
His son was 28 when he was killed .
" They are not doing any good while they are over there .
They need to leave the country to sort itself out , " said Brierley .
" While the British troops are there they are actually attracting more insurgents who are coming in to fight . "
The country 's oldest anti-war demonstrator also joined the march .
Londoner Hetty Bowyer , 104 , told the crowd : " I march because I can see no reason for further killing .
I have walked on every march against us going to war .
At my age there is not very much I can do , but while my legs can carry me I am going to march . "
Central London was brought to a temporary standstill as the protesters made their way to Trafalgar Square .
Glenton , from Norwich , led thousands of protesters as they snaked through the capital .
Meanwhile , the battalion that lost more men than any other during the most recent deployment to Helmand province arrived back home yesterday .
Troops from 2nd Battalion
The Rifles returned to Northern Ireland after losing 13 men and having dozens injured during their six - month tour in and around Sangin , the deadliest place for British soldiers in Helmand .
The battalion 's commanding officer , Lieutenant - Colonel Rob Thomson , described how the Taliban had encircled Sangin with roadside bombs and improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) , making movement fraught .
Thomson said : " The enemy has planted IEDs in a greater number than ever before .
It has been a hard battle , but the riflemen have found hundreds of IEDs across the area of operations .
It is difficult to describe accurately the intensity of this fight . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
There will be no cost - of - living increase for 57 million Social Security beneficiaries next year because consumer prices have fallen , the Social Security Administration announced on Thursday .
It marks the first time that Social Security benefits have not been increased year over year since the cost - of - living adjustment was put into effect in 1975 .
To help counterbalance the hit , President Obama is calling on Congress to send another $ 250 relief payment to seniors and other Americans to stem the economic strain .
" Even as we seek to bring about recovery , we must act on behalf of those hardest hit by this recession , " Obama said in a statement Wednesday .
" That is why I am announcing my support for an additional $ 250 in emergency recovery assistance to seniors , veterans , and people with disabilities to help them make it through these difficult times . "
Last year , Social Security beneficiaries got a 5.8 % cost - of - living adjustment , the largest since 1982 , largely because of the spike in energy prices .
" This year , in light of the human need , we need to support President Obama 's call for us to make another $ 250 recovery payment for 57 million Americans , " said Commissioner of Social Security Michael J. Astrue in a written statement .
Since there will be no COLA for benefits , the law also prohibits the Social Security Administration from increasing the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax .
This year and next , the first $ 106,800 of a worker 's earnings is subject to the 12.4 % Social Security tax .
Workers typically pay half of that and their employers pay the other half .
It 's still not clear yet what if any changes will be made to seniors ' Medicare Part B premiums for hospital care next year .
The Social Security Administration said in its announcement that if there is an increase that a " hold harmless " provision in the law would protect 93 % of Social Security beneficiaries from the increase .
New emergency payment similar to COLA
Obama 's proposed $ 250 payment is roughly equal to a 2 % increase in benefits for the average Social Security beneficiary .
Congress approved a similar payment as part of the $ 787 billion economic recovery act enacted in February .
As with the first $ 250 recovery payment , the second one would be exempt from income tax , a senior administration official said in a call with reporters on Wednesday .
If approved by Congress , the payments would be sent out in 2010 , most likely in the first half .
" It would n't be late in 2010 , " the administration official said .
The measure would cost $ 13 billion over 10 years , according to White House estimates .
The call for increased benefits for seniors is one of several proposals to expand stimulus benefits .
Lawmakers are also considering extending unemployment benefits and the homebuyer tax credit , both of which were included in the economic stimulus bill passed in February .
In addition to the $ 250 emergency payments , the White House has also publicly supported the extension of jobless benefits as well as the extension of subsidies to help the unemployed purchase health insurance under Cobra .
The president has not said yet whether he supports the expansion of the homebuyer tax credit .
Where the money will come from
The original $ 250 relief payment was paid out of general revenue .
That would likely be the case for the second payment as well .
Obama specified that he " is committed to ensuring that the $ 13 billion cost of the proposal does not reduce the solvency of Social Security or other social insurance programs . "
That means the $ 13 billion would n't be deducted -- on the balance sheet anyway -- from the payroll taxes collected to pay for Social Security .
But it also wo n't be paid for by reducing spending or raising revenue in other parts of the budget .
Typically economic stimulus is exempt from rules requiring that new measures be paid for .
So if the proposal passes , it will add to the country 's annual deficit , which in 2009 was estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to have hit a record high of $ 1.4 trillion .
Compost with a Kick : Bokashicycle Brews First Large - Scale Food Waste Fermentation Operation
November 4th , 2009 by Tina Casey
Bokashi is a centuries - old Japanese method of recycling household food waste into all - natural compost .
By employing a special culture of yeast and other microorganisms , bokashi is a compact , odorless process that takes only days instead of weeks or months .
Now the Bokashicycle company is breaking the process out of the kitchen and into a commercial - scale food waste recycling operation , in partnership with New Earth Farm in Hillsboro , Oregon .
[ social_buttons ]
New Earth Farm takes in food scraps from Bon Appetit cafeterias on the nearby Intel Hawthorn Farm campus , which provides a significant waste disposal savings compared to disposing the scraps in landfills .
Waste reduction is one goal , and in an even more sustainable twist the composted soil is used to grow crops for Abundant Harvest , a local consumer - supported agriculture ( CSA ) store .
The Trick is in the Yeast for Superfast Compost
Conventional composting uses oxygen - fed organisms to break down organic matter .
In contrast , bokashi uses a special mix of organisms that thrive without oxyge to ferment the food scraps .
The process is similar to that of wine or pickle making .
It takes place in a sealed container and it ’s practically odorless , making it suitable for small dwellings .
Companies like Bokashicycle sell prepared mixes that also contain starter nutrients such as wheat bran and molasses , but do - it - yourself instructions are also available online .
Bokashi on a Grand Scale
New Earth Farm spreads Bokashicycle ’s mix on the food scraps it collects , and lets it ferment in a barrel for a week to ten days ( to help the process run smoothly , large bones and other big food scraps are first shredded ) .
The contents are then poured onto the ground and covered with soil for another two weeks , during which time organisms that are naturally present go to work .
Then the enriched soil is ready to go , either for use on the farm or to be sold elsewhere .
If this large - scale bokashi project proves successful over time , it could soon have plenty of company .
Prisons and other institutions are rapidly adopting food waste recycling , and the entire city of San Francisco has just committed to a mandatory mega - scale food scrap recycling program .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A federal judge rejected on Monday a U.S. government request to keep secret the unclassified evidence that it says justifies the continued imprisonment of more than 100 Guantanamo Bay prisoners .
In this photo of a sketch by courtroom artist Janet Hamlin , reviewed by the U.S. military , a sketch of Canadian defendant Omar Khadr is pinned inside a hangar used by the media , following Omar Khadr 's hearing in the U.S. war crimes commission at the Camp Justice compound , at Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base , Cuba , June 1 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Brennan Linsley / Pool
U.S. District Judge Thomas
Hogan ruled the government cannot keep the documents known as factual returns from public disclosure and must seek court approval to keep specific information secret .
“ Public interest in Guantanamo Bay generally and these proceedings specifically has been unwavering , ” Hogan wrote .
“ Publicly disclosing the factual returns would enlighten the citizenry and improve perceptions of the proceedings ’ fairness . ”
U.S. President Barack Obama had vowed to close the detention center set up at the U.S. Naval Base in Cuba by his predecessor George W. Bush to hold foreign terrorism suspects after the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
But closing the center has proved difficult as the White House grapples with where to place the remaining prisoners .
The sealed court documents outlined the government ’s case for the continued holding of the detainees .
The documents were filed in response to petitions by the detainees seeking their court - ordered release .
The ruling was a victory for detainee lawyers and a coalition of news organizations .
They argued the news media and the public have a constitutional right of access to the documents .
The judge ordered the U.S. Justice Department to publicly file its unclassified records or show the court what specific information it wants to keep secret by the end of next month .
Jonathan Hafetz , an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union , hailed the ruling .
“ For far too long , the government has succeeded in keeping information about Guantanamo secret and used secrecy to cover - up illegal detention and abuse , ” he said .
“ The decision marks an important step toward restoring America ’s open court tradition that is essential to both accountability and the rule of law . ”
The Justice Department was reviewing the ruling , spokesman Dean Boyd said .
He said the government never sought to keep the information sealed indefinitely but only until the completion of an appropriate classification review .

I rarely check site visits and logs so I have no idea if anyone still visits this site .
For those of you reading this , you may have noticed I have changed the look .
I wish I could say that this was done out of some motivation to get things going again , but truth be told , the WordPress theme I was using no longer worked .
So , I switched to the default theme * .
This site had a good run from 1997 to around 2012 / 13 when life got a bit too hectic for me .
With the rise of social media and sites like Reddit , who foster communities and fans much better than I ever did , it felt like this site no longer served a purpose .
So I stopped updating and it ’s been sitting frozen ever since .
I periodically would think about updating , especially when Radiohead would release an album .
The OK Computer mini disc hack earlier this year sent me into a spiral of nostalgia .
I started this site in the months prior to OK Computer ’s release and can still remember the excitement and build up .
I even had thoughts of bringing the site back in some new form , but just as before , life got in the way .
So , as we begin a new decade , I wanted to start thinking about a new way of pumping some life back into this dormant place .
I ’m not interested in trying be a source for the latest Radiohead news .
There are plenty of other places for that .
But I would like to find some way to honor the history of this site while still being an active member and contributor to the Radiohead community .
If you have any suggestions , I ’m open to hearing them .

Derry City Council 's Hallowe 'en carnival encourages Satanism and has brought a curse on the city , according to a Methodist minister .
Rev Jonathan Campbell , from Newbuildings Independent Methodist Church , has launched an online petition to stop this year 's event .
He said Hallowe 'en celebrations " make evil look innocent " , and has appealed for families to boycott the festival .
The Hallowe 'en Carnival will take place on the Foyle on 30 and 31 October .
Rev Campbell said his church was opposed to Hallowe 'en because it was " one of the two major days for Satanists " , and " God 's word clearly condemns and warns people about celebrating or glorifying Hallowe 'en or the occult " .
" One of the main reasons we as a church are opposed to the carnival is that children are being disturbed .
" People are being deceived - they look on it as harmless fun , but it is n't .
" We are doing this because we care for the people of Londonderry and this is harming parents , children , families in Londonderry , " he said .
The two - day festival includes family fun days , magic shows , movies and live music , and culminates in a firework display on the river .

In the 1930s comic strip " Popeye , " Olive Oil was portrayed as a skinny weakling , a perpetual damsel in distress who could n't survive without her Popeye coming to the rescue .
But in the health world , olive oil is no nutritional weakling .
Besides being one of the best sources to go to for a healthy dose of monounsaturated fat - a key nutrient for lowering cholesterol levels - olive oil is something of a medical marvel .
It 's always been known as a healthy oil , but only recently have we come to know just what it is specifically about olive oil that makes it so darn healthy .
For starters , olive oil - particularly extra virgin olive oil - is very high in antioxidants , one in particular called DHPEA - EDA .
When researchers exposed red blood cells under oxidative stress to this and other antioxidants , they found that the DHPEA - EDA provided the best " stress - alleviation , " if you will , fighting off the free radicals to a greater extent than the three other antioxidant compounds used in the study .
Writing in the journal , the researchers say their findings give nutritionists the first glimpse of what makes olive oil so medically marvelous .
But a new study linking extra virgin olive oil to Alzheimer 's disease prevention suggests there 's even more to olive oil than meets the eye .
It 's called oleocanthal , and it's a natural compound found in rich supply in extra virgin olive oil .
Some say oleocanthal is what gives olive oil its " peppery bite , " but the only bite researchers were recently concerned with was whether it could take a bite out of Alzheimer 's disease .
The answer ?
You bet it can !
Writing in the journal , researchers said the oleocanthal in olive oil binds to toxic proteins that clog the synapses on the hippocampus , which is the first sign of Alzheimer 's disease onset .
The hippocampus is the section of the brain that 's most adversely affected by Alzheimer 's disease .
Now , this study was not clinical , but researchers believe that future studies investigating olive oil 's ties to Alzheimer 's prevention will include humans .
In the meantime , if history is any guide , it would n't be at all surprising if yet another study comes out pointing to yet another aspect of olive oil that makes it so medically marvelous .
It is generally recommended that people consume about two tablespoons worth of olive oil for maximum health benefit .
And to reap the benefits of as many antioxidants as possible , purchase extra virgin olive oil , being sure to store it in an area that 's not well lit .
A study published infound that extra virgin olive oils lost at least 30 percent of their antioxidant content after one year of storage in a well - lit area .

Conservative Republican Party activists want to withhold money from GOP candidates who stray too far from party orthodoxy .
Ten Republican National Committee members are distributing a plan to impose a purity test – calling for money to be withheld from anyone who disagrees with conservative principles on more than two of 10 core issues .
Among the required stances : oppose President Barack Obama ’s health care and cap - and - trade proposals as well as his stimulus plan ; reject government funding for abortion ; vote “ no ” on legislation to help unions organize ; and support keeping the Defense of Marriage Act .
“ The problem is that conservatives have lost trust in the Republican Party that we will govern as conservatives , ” said James Bopp Jr. , an Indiana lawyer and one of 168 RNC members who will debate the idea during the party ’s winter meeting in January .
“ And I think that loss of trust is warranted to a certain extent because of the fact that we in the final several years of the Bush administration were supporting increased government , earmarks and , ultimately , bailouts . ” …

Just one year ago , would you have believed that an unelected government official , not even a Cabinet member confirmed by the Senate but simply one of the many " czars " appointed by the President , could arbitrarily cut the pay of executives in private businesses by 50 percent or 90 percent ?
Did you think that another " czar " would be talking about restricting talk radio ?
That there would be plans afloat to subsidize newspapers -- that is , to create a situation where some newspapers ' survival would depend on the government liking what they publish ?
Did you imagine that anyone would even be talking about having a panel of so - called " experts " deciding who could and could not get life - saving medical treatments ?
Scary as that is from a medical standpoint , it is also chilling from the standpoint of freedom .
If you have a mother who needs a heart operation or a child with some dire medical condition , how free would you feel to speak out against an administration that has the power to make life and death decisions about your loved ones ?
Does any of this sound like America ?
How about a federal agency giving school children material to enlist them on the side of the president ?
Merely being assigned to sing his praises in class is apparently not enough .
How much of America would be left if the federal government continued on this path ?
President Obama has already floated the idea of a national police force , something we have done without for more than two centuries .
We already have local police forces all across the country and military forces for national defense , as well as the FBI for federal crimes and the National Guard for local emergencies .
What would be the role of a national police force created by Barack Obama , with all its leaders appointed by him ?
It would seem more like the brown shirts of dictators than like anything American .
How far the President will go depends of course on how much resistance he meets .
But the direction in which he is trying to go tells us more than all his rhetoric or media spin .
Barack Obama has not only said that he is out to " change the United States of America , " the people he has been associated with for years have expressed in words and deeds their hostility to the values , the principles and the people of this country .
Jeremiah Wright said it with words : " God damn America ! " Bill Ayers said it with bombs that he planted .
Community activist goons have said it with their contempt for the rights of other people .
Among the people appointed as czars by President Obama have been people who have praised enemy dictators like Mao , who have seen the public schools as places to promote sexual practices contrary to the values of most Americans , to a captive audience of children .
Those who say that the Obama administration should have investigated those people more thoroughly before appointing them are missing the point completely .
Why should we assume that Barack Obama did n't know what such people were like , when he has been associating with precisely these kinds of people for decades before he reached the White House ?
Nothing is more consistent with his lifelong patterns than putting such people in government -- people who reject American values , resent Americans in general and successful Americans in particular , as well as resenting America 's influence in the world .
Any miscalculation on his part would be in not thinking that others would discover what these stealth appointees were like .
Had it not been for the Fox News Channel , these stealth appointees might have remained unexposed for what they are .
Fox News is now high on the administration 's enemies list .
Nothing so epitomizes President Obama 's own contempt for American values and traditions like trying to ram two bills through Congress in his first year -- each bill more than a thousand pages long -- too fast for either of them to be read , much less discussed .
That he succeeded only the first time says that some people are starting to wake up .
Whether enough people will wake up in time to keep America from being dismantled , piece by piece , is another question -- and the biggest question for this generation .
Paul Krugman writes :
Freshwater Rage : I ’m still on the road , with only sporadic internet access .
So I ’ve missed out on much of the outpouring of rage over my magazine article .
I gather , though , that the usual suspects are utterly outraged at my suggestion that freshwater macro has spent several decades heading down the wrong path .
They ’re smart !
They work hard , using hard math !
How dare I say such a thing ?
And all of this , of course , without a hint of irony ....
When freshwater macro came in , there was an active purge of competing views : students were not exposed , at all , to any alternatives .
People like Prescott boasted that Keynes was never mentioned in their graduate programs .
And what has become clear in the recent debate — for example , in the assertion that Ricardian equivalence rules out any effect from government spending changes , which is just wrong — is that the freshwater side not only turned Keynes into an unperson , but systematically ignored the work being done in the New Keynesian vein .
Nobody who had read , say , Obstfeld and Rogoff would have been as clueless about the logic of temporary fiscal expansion as these guys have been ...
I would put it slightly differently .
I do object to the fact that Chicago macro has not read Obstfeld and Rogoff .
But what I object to much more is that they have not read anything at all .
For example , consider :
Most of all , Krugman likes fiscal stimulus .
In this quest , he accuses us and the rest of the economics profession of “ mistaking beauty for truth . ” [ 1 ]
He ’s not that clear on what the “ beauty ” is that we all fell in love with , and why one should shun it .
And for good reason .
The first siren of beauty is simple logical consistency .
Paul ’s Keynesian economics requires that people make plans to consume more , invest more , and pay more taxes with the same income ...
It is not just Keynesian economics that concludes that there are times when people in aggregate make plans to spend more than their incomes .
It is Milton Friedman 's monetarist economics too .
It is Knut Wicksell 's Swedish school .
It is Irving Fisher 's quantity theory of money .
Indeed , it is David Hume writing the first article in economic theory ever --" On the Balance of Trade . "
In it , he supposes " all the money of Great Britain were multiplied fivefold in a night . "
The immediate consequence is that planned expenditure rises high above income as people try to shed their excess money balances .
Planned expenditure continues to run ahead of income until the flow of nominal spending has risen fivefold .
Yet we are told that that chain of events violates " simple logical consistency . "
There is nothing illogical or inconsistent about the economy being in a state in which aggregate planned expenditure is greater or less than income .
Today 's Chicago school would know this , had it not forgotten all of monetary economics from David Hume on .
But if you have never understood David Hume , and if you try to think about the issues on the fly , you are bound to make large , embarrassing , and elementary mistakes .
Even this is not necessarily a bad thing .
As Nick Rowe says : " we need to encourage finance people to do macro , and macro people to do finance , and part of the price of doing that is we will make mistakes . "
But it becomes a bad thing when you think you have something to say about policy -- for then you say pointless and destructive things .
[ 1 ] I actually do n't mind that people spend their time developing real business cycle models or investigating the consequences of the efficient market hypothesis .
I do , however , wish that they would n't write things like :
It is true and very well documented that asset prices move more than reasonable expectations of future cashflows .
This might be because people are prey to bursts of irrational optimism and pessimism .
It might also be because people ’s willingness to take on risk varies over time , and is sharply lower in bad economic times .
As Gene Fama pointed out in 1972 , these are observationally equivalent explanations at the superficial level of staring at prices and writing magazine articles and opeds ...
because such things are simply not true .
They are not observationally equivalent .
When major rises in stock prices -- like that of 1995 - 2000 -- are due to increases in market risk tolerance or decreases in risk , then at their end investors and commentators tend to think that future returns are likely to be low by historical benchmarks , but that stocks are nevertheless worth holding because ( a ) their risks are small or ( b ) we have lowered the covariance between stock returns and our consumption .
When major rises in stock prices are due to a wave of optimism , then at their end we find that investors and commentators are thinking that future returns are likely to be high by historical standards -- Dow 36000 anyone ?-- but that risks are not especially low .
And to that I object , because they would be better finance economists if they did not write things that were n't true .
Today , the American Constitution Society 's blog , ACSblog , was gracious enough to let EFF 's Kevin Bankston guest blog about the current debate over renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act .
Kevin took the opportunity to highlight the need for Congress to revisit the broad surveillance authority granted by last year 's FISA Amendments Act ( FAA ) when it considers reforming the PATRIOT Act .
Kevin argues that " from a civil liberties perspective , focusing on reforming the PATRIOT
Act without also considering FAA reform is like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic . "
The entire blog post is here .
The Senate Judiciary Committee is planning to consider PATRIOT renewal and reform Thursday .
It 's important to let your Senators know that you support both PATRIOT reform and FAA reform , including repeal of the immunity for telcos like AT&T that assisted in the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program .
If you have n't already , please visit our action center and contact your Senators now !
I spent my adolescence and teenage years obsessing about this question :
Am I depressed or just deep ?
When I was nine , I figured that I was a young Christian mystic because I related much more to the saints who lived centuries ago than to other nine - year - old girls who had crushes on boys .
I could n’t understand how my sisters could waste quarters on a stupid video game when there were starving kids in Cambodia .
Hello ?
Give them to UNICEF !
Now I look back with tenderness to the hurting girl I was and wished somebody had been able to recognize that I was very depressed .
Not that I would have accepted the help .
I believed , along with all the other adults in my life , that my melancholy and sensitivity were part of my “ special ” make - up , that they were gifts to celebrate , not neuroses to treat .
And should I take meds that helped me laugh and play and design cool barrettes like the other girls , well , then I would lose my depth .
On the PBS website “ This Emotional Life ” –a multi- platform project centered on a three - part series documentary to be broadcast in early 2010 hosted by Harvard psychologist and bestselling author Daniel Gilbert–psychologist Paula Bloom discusses the topic of being deep versus being depressed .
On her blog post “ Am I Depressed or Just Deep ? , ” she writes :
Sometimes , people confuse being depressed with being philosophical .
If I had a dollar ( well , maybe $ 2 ) for every time I hear “ I am not depressed , I am just realistic ” , “ Anyone who is n’t depressed is n’t paying attention ” , or “ Life has no meaning and I am going to die , how can I be happy ? ” I could likely support a hardcore latte habit .
Depression can have such an effect on your worldview .
There are a few basic existential realities we all confront : mortality , aloneness and meaninglessness .
Most people are aware of these things .
A friend dies suddenly , a coworker commits suicide or some planes fly into tall buildings - these events shake most of us up and remind of us of the basic realities .
We deal , we grieve , we hold our kids tighter , remind ourselves that life is short and therefore to be enjoyed , and then we move on .
Persistently not being able to put the existential realities aside to live and enjoy life , engage those around us or take care of ourselves just might be a sign of depression .
We all get sad sometimes , struggle to fall asleep , lose our appetite or have a hard time focusing .
Does this mean we are depressed ?
Not necessarily .
So how do you know the difference ?
The answer , as with most psychological diagnoses comes down to one word : functioning .
How are you sleeping and eating ?
Are you isolating yourself from others ?
Have you stopped enjoying the things you used to enjoy ?
Difficulty focusing and concentrating ?
Irritable ?
Tired ?
Lack of motivation ?
Do you feel hopeless ?
Feel excessively guilty or worthless ?
Experiencing some of these things may be a sign of depression .
Peter Kramer , clinical professor of psychiatry at Brown University , devotes an entire book to this question .
He wrote “ Against Depression ” in response to his frustration of repeatedly being asked the same question : “ What if Prozac had been available in van Gogh ’s time ? ”
In a New York Times essay , “ There ’s Nothing Deep About Depression , ” which was adapted from “ Against Depression , ” Kramer writes :
Depression is not a perspective .
It is a disease .
Resisting that claim , we may ask :
Seeing cruelty , suffering and death — should n’t a person be depressed ?
There are circumstances , like the Holocaust , in which depression might seem justified for every victim or observer .
Awareness of the ubiquity of horror is the modern condition , our condition .
But then , depression is not universal , even in terrible times .
Though prone to mood disorder , the great Italian writer Primo Levi was not depressed in his months at Auschwitz .
I have treated a handful of patients who survived horrors arising from war or political repression .
They came to depression years after enduring extreme privation .
Typically , such a person will say : ” I do n’t understand it .
I went through — ” and here he will name one of the shameful events of our time .
” I lived through that , and in all those months , I never felt this . ”
This refers to the relentless bleakness of depression , the self as hollow shell .
To see the worst things a person can see is one experience ; to suffer mood disorder is another .
It is depression — and not resistance to it or recovery from it — that diminishes the self .
Beset by great evil , a person can be wise , observant and disillusioned and yet not depressed .
Resilience confers its own measure of insight .
We should have no trouble admiring what we do admire — depth , complexity , aesthetic brilliance — and standing foursquare against depression .
Kramer ’s words are consoling to a depressive who spends 90 percent of her energy a day combating thoughts saying she is depressed because she lacks the stamina to be optimistic .
In fact , the first time I read Kramer , I experienced profound relief .
However , I still maintain that some of my depth caused by depression is a good thing .
Not on the days where I ’m in excruciating pain , of course .
But should I have been one of those nine - year - olds who got excited about which color ribbon I could use to make my barrettes and wasted her quarters on Pacman … well , I would n’t be writing this blog .
Am I Depressed or Just Deep ?

While it is hard to rank rivers and lakes around the world in terms of who is THE worst , there are a few that stand out in the crowd .
Pollutants like industrial waste , sewage runoff , overpopulation and agriculture discharges all make for quite a toxic brew .
When you count in the fact that many of these major rivers and lakes supply food to nearby major population centers then they are having an even greater effect than as simply some polluted body of water in the middle of nowhere .
Below are a few of the worst offenders that you should watch out for .
Lake Victoria borders three countries in East Africa – Kenya , Tanzania and Uganda – making it extra difficult to negotiate cleanup and pollution prevention .
As there are few enforced regulations , residents wash cars in the same lake water that sewage water is regularly released in and that they also end up bathing in .
Even worse , people who come in contact with the water are susceptible to coming away with several diseases including , schistosomiasis , bilharzia , cholera , pneumonia , diarrhea , and several skin diseases .
The 200 - mile long Citarum River in Indonesia hosts more than 500 factories along its banks and is quite possibly the most polluted river in the world .
There is so much garbage coating the surface that in many places you ca n’t see the water , and it is more profitable to forage for garbage than making a living fishing the river , though you do risk catching a nasty disease by spending any time in it .
The Great Lakes ( US / Canada ) have taken a beating over the years thanks to pollution from the auto industry , oil refineries , steel plants , agricultural runoff and pollution , chemical plants and transportation runoff .
While not the worst on this list , the lakes have accumulated a toxic soup that we have yet to deal with .
This 3,400 mile - long Yellow River in China is frequently contaminated by chemical spills , and frequent diversions and damming , which causes the Yellow to often run dry and sometimes even turn red .
1/3 of the river is unusable , but this does n’t seem to be slowing things down as the river is used to provide water for millions of people in China , whose expanding cities are another reason the river is contaminated .
While small compared to the others on this list ( only 65 miles ) , the Riachuela River , running through the heart of Buenos Aires , is referred to as the largest open pit toilet in the world , absorbing over 325,000 tons of sewage each day .
Lead , mercury , cadmium , nitrates and copper all pollute this river and affect drinking water supplies for the over 5 million people living in the area .
Lake Onondaga ( US ) is so polluted it was designated a hazardous waste site by the US Environmental Protection Agency .
Phosphorous , ammonia , nitrite , mercury , bacterial contaminants , from a long history of industrial activity in the area , along with non-point source pollutants , combine to make this lake one toxic soup .
The Sarno River is regarded as the most polluted river in Italy and possibly all of Europe .
Agricultural and sewage runoff frequently contaminates the river and treatment methods are inadequate to handle the pollution .
The Sarno River frequently overflows its banks and therefore puts the local population at repeated risk for exposure .
Believe it or not , Lake Karachay ( Russia ) is completely contaminated with radioactive ( and other types of ) waste , that was dumped into the lake from the Mayak Nuclear Waste Storage Facility , starting in the 1950′s .
The waste is currently seeping out into area soils and rockbeds , threatening other rivers and even the Arctic .
Scientists predict that if it makes it to the Arctic , it could spread around the world .
The Yumana River may be the site of historic and holy rituals , but it ’s also got its share of crap – literally .
Over 3.5 billion litres of sewage pass through the river daily ( making it over 100,000 times higher than limits safe for bathing ) , and the city removes another 1.1 billion litres of river water each day .
No fish or plants can live in the river and holy leaders have threatened to boycott annual pilgrimages to the area due to the high contamination levels .
More than 2,800 factories line the shores of Lake Tai , the 3rd largest lake in China , contributing to its title as one of the largest and most polluted in the country .
Officials have estimated a hefty $ 14.4 billion price tag to clean up all of the industrial dumping and sewage that contaminates these waters .
Currently the waters have a green tint from all of the algae flourishing thanks to their ample source of industrial pollution in the lake .
The damage done to the Yangtze River due to pollution is so bad its been described as irreversible .
Over 360 miles of the 3,860 - mile long Yangtze River are polluted due to damming , inadequate sewage , industrial pollution and rapid population growth .
Currently the river is responsible for 35 % of the country ’s fresh water fish supply , while construction of the Three Gorges Dam along the river displaced over 1 million people .
The King River ( Australia ) is the most polluted river in all of Australia , principally due to mining activities along the river dating back to the 1880′s .
1.5 million tons of mining tailings entered the river every year until 1995 , while the fumes from the smelter created acid rain in the area .
Today the mining operations continue to make the river highly toxic to marine life thanks to the leftover dissolved metals and tailings still in the river .
The Mississippi River ( US ) .
How could we forget this mammoth river that crosses 10 states and carries millions of metric tons of pollutants with it to its mouth in the Gulf of Mexico each year , creating a the notorious “ deadzone . ”
During the 1990s , this river discharged over 100 million pounds of toxics downriver each year .
The Dead Zone is aptly named due to the low levels of oxygen , causing no aquatic life to survive in this area .

Passare in rassegna le notizie locali ci si accorge di quanto sia cambiata la nostra società in tema di libertà di espressione .
Contestazione e satira , strumenti di democrazia , in Italia si impediscono non soltanto in tivù , ma anche per strada .
Soprattutto se riguardano un fantoccio come Silvio Berlusconi .
Chi manifesta in libertà la propria contrarietà a qualsivoglia forma di politica del suo governo , deve fare i conti con la prepotenza dei militanti di partito locali , che hanno il compito di censurare senza pudore ogni forma di espressione politica .
Di esempi ce ne sono tanti , ne elenco solo alcuni .
A Castiglione della Pescaia ( Gr ) i vincitori dell ’ ultima edizione del Palio remiero sono stati radiati dalla kermesse e si sono visti tagliare i fondi di otto mila euro .
Si tratta della famiglia Giovannelli e alcuni vicini del rione vincitore “ Portaccia ” , tutti vogatori , che avrebbero vinto la kermesse stimolati dal retro delle loro magliette raffiguranti una beffarda caricatura di Berlusconi col simbolo del divieto .
La sindaca di Castiglione Monica Faenzi , deputata incompatibile del Pdl nota per aver dato del maleducato a Romano Prodi quando si recò in vacanza nel suo paesello senza averla salutata , ha detto che quei ragazzi “ sono profanatori del Palio , che non é solo una gara , ma é una tradizione religiosa benedetta dal vescovo “ .
I vincitori sono simpatizzanti del Pd. Uno di loro , Mauro , 27 anni , idraulico neosposo e ideatore della beffa , motivando la mossa come una goliardata esterna alla politica , ha detto di temere di vivere in un regime .
Sua madre Ilaria ha aggiunto che se su quelle magliette ci fosse stata la faccia di Prodi la sindaca avrebbe offerto una cena a tutti .
Il puttaniere “ mascarato ” non si può toccare nemmeno in maschera .
All ’edizione 2010 del carnevale di Viareggio non potranno sfilare i carri su Berlusconi , le veline e suoi rapporti con le prostitute .
La commissione direttrice della sfilata ha con giustificato “ motivi tecnici ” il blocco di due bozzetti di carri chiedendo all ’autore Enrico Vannucci di rivedere i progetti .
Per la stessa manifestazione la coppia francese Gilbert Lebigre e Corinne Roger , non ha avuto l’ok al bozzetto che irride la politica anti immigrazione della Lega prendendo di mira Roberto Calderoli , Roberto Maroni , Mario Borghezio e Matteo Salvini .
Nella civilissima Milano in questi giorni é stato emesso un comunicato così : “ Si delibera l’interdizione perpetua dell ’ associazione dalla sagra annuale e la sua cancellazione per indegnità dall ’ albo zonale “ .
Firmato consiglio di zona 7 di Milano Baggio , a maggioranza di centrodestra , che ha così cancellato dall ’Albo l’associazione “ Dimensioni Diverse ” col divieto di partecipare alle sagre di quartiere .
“ L’interdizione per indegnità ” dopo aver esposto uno striscione che raffigura Bossi , Berlusconi e altri politici su una barca che affonda , “ come critica ai respingimenti e alle campagne contro gli stranieri ” e per aver contestato i progetti connessi a Expo 2015 .
Niente più spazi comunali gratuiti e niente più fondi per l’associazione , che scompare dopo vent ’anni .
Tra le sue colpe quella di aver esposto uno striscione con scritto “ Crisi , mafia , corruzione , il solo reato é l’immigrazione .
Questa sicurezza é un pacco , mandiamola a picco “ .
Le illazioni su Expo 2015 , secondo la delibera del consiglio zonale milanese , stanno nel fatto che non si può portare la politica nelle feste di quartiere , tantopiù offendendo il presidente Berlusconi .
Censurato anche uno striscione dedicato alla sindaca Moratti con scritto : “ Il Parco agricolo Sud , tra speculazione e bene comune “ .
In compenso in Italia si portano in palmo di mano corruttori , latitanti e truffatori .
Bottino Crac( si ) é stato insignito “ alla memoria ” del Premio Salvador Allende durante il recente festival del cinema latino americano di Trieste , che ogni anno assegna il premio a quanti , con il proprio impegno culturale o sociale si siano distinti nel “ riscattare la memoria e la storia dei popoli latinoamericani “ .
Nelle motivazioni spiegate dal direttore del festival Rodrigo Diaz , si dice che “ prima come segretario del Psi e poi come premier , Craxi operò a supporto del Cile e della grande esperienza democratica avviata da Allende “ .
Tutto ciò in un paese normale farebbe ridere .
In Italia guai a chi lo manifesta !
Everyone who 's been complaining that Dollhouse pulled a bait - and - switch , showing us a post - apocalyptic world at the end of season one , then failing to revisit it in season two : quitcher bitchin ' .
We saw the roots of that dystopia last night .
Oh , and this is your spoiler warning : I 'm going to assume you saw last night 's episode already .
If you have n't , go and watch it .
Twice .
Dollhouse must have been testing our faith on purpose .
I went into season two convinced this was one of the all - time great TV shows , exploring thorny issues of gender , power and identity in a way that few other shows ever manage to hint at .
And then the season 's first two episodes left me wondering if I 'd just been hallucinating .
Last week 's serial killer / Chaucer mash - up was a huge leap in the right direction — but last night 's episode , " Belonging , " was the real thing .
I totally apologize for saying Glee is better than Dollhouse .
Advertisement
So yes , this was definitely a prequel to the unaired " mindwiped Mad Max " episode , " Epitaph One , " which is on the Dollhouse DVD set , and which must be watched multiple times to appreciate its awesomeness .
Watch " Belonging " and " Epitaph One " back to back , and you 'll see many of the same strands uniting them both , including Topher 's remorse , Adelle 's despair , and Rossum Corp .'s determination to treat all the Dolls like property .
This is a major step forward on the road that leads to everyone on Earth being stripped of his or her identity at the whims of a few wealthy psychos .
Advertisement
But last night 's episode did n't just give us a bit more insight into how our merry band of mind - erasers turned into basket cases in a world of shit .
" Belonging " also answered one of the big questions lingering on from season one : Just how complicit were Adelle , Topher and the rest in the unspeakable violation of Sierra ?
Last year , we saw that the psycho - freak Nolan Kinnard had propositioned Sierra , and she 'd repeatedly turned him down .
So Kinnard had the Dollhouse erase her brain and program her to be in love with him — and now he ( and anyone else with money ) can have her whenever he wants .
It was one of the creepiest episodes of this supremely creepy show , and it made us wonder just what monsters these Dollhouse people are .
And now we know .
It turns out that Adelle and her crew did n't know about Kinnard 's scheme to get the ultimate revenge on the woman who rejected him .
Instead , Kinnard fooled them into thinking that she was a crazy lady who'd be better off as a Doll — he 'd pumped her full of drugs to make her appear psychotic .
( Because , I guess , mind - wiping actually changes your brain chemistry and can erase chemical problems in the brain ? )
And they just thought Kinnard was an especially avid client .
Advertisement
But last night , everyone learned the truth — and it's because Sierra 's mind - wiping could n't erase how she really feels about Kinnard .
After every one of her lovey - dovey engagements with the man who enslaved and destroyed her , she paints black horrible shapes .
Echo , who 's rapidly gaining awareness , notices this and brings it to Topher , who starts poking around .
And then we get the scene above , where the Rossum Corp. scumbag played by Keith Carradine basically tells Adelle that they 're already slave - merchants , and she should get over herself .
You can see how this leads directly to the notion that Carradine 's character , or someone similar , should live in Victor 's body full - time , which gets raised in " Epitaph One . "
( When I demanded a Sue Sylvester - like villain on Dollhouse the other day , I had in the back of my mind that Carradine was joining the show as a Rossum scumbag , but could n't remember the details .
He 's pretty much just what I was hoping for though . )
So , there you have it : Dollhouse is pretty much admitting it's a show about rape .
Sierra never consented to any of this , and whatever bleach Topher is pouring into her synapses is n't strong enough to erase her true feelings on the matter .
And the repeated , systematic violation of Sierra is one of the early - arriving horse - people of the apocalypse .
This kind of shit is what 's going to bring the whole world down .
Advertisement
And just like Joss Whedon promised , we 're starting to see the people in charge make defining choices .
This time around , Adelle makes the wrong choice , and Topher kinda , sorta makes the right one — although , what exactly did he think would happen if he sent Sierra with her original personality , Priya Tsetsang , to confront Nolan Kinnard ?
How exactly was that going to turn out well ?
The slow emergence of Topher 's conscience is one of the great marvels of the show , especially since we know how it 's going to turn out .
Last week , it was " Topher has ethical problems !
Topher ! " and this week , Topher finds out his great mitzvah , helping the crazy woman , was all wrong .
Whiskey started the ball rolling , of course , and I 'm actually perversely glad we get to see Topher stew over this without Whiskey / Claire there to torment him actively .
It would be so much more clear - cut if Whiskey could stand over him and tell him how bad he is .

And of course , Dichen Lachman absolutely rocked out as Sierra / Priya — after Enver Gjokaj 's standout episode last week , this was Lachman 's turn to prove her mettle and she totally rocked .
Both Fran Kranz and Lachman were amazing .
Check out this scene from the end of the episode , the little pauses and gestures .
You can see that Sierra really wants Topher to mind - wipe her , and Topher really does n't want to do it .
The way she sits back , like she 's ready for her treatment .
The way he closes his eyes .
Great stuff .
And yes , Jonathan " Riker " Frakes did a great job directing this — it half makes me forgive him for the abomination that was Clockstoppers .
The weird bit where we 're seeing Topher 's eye through a funny lens was flashy and neat , but a lot of the rest of the episode was understated and awesome .

And Eliza Dushku was great as Echo this time around , with the story of Echo 's awakening taking some huge leaps forward .
And her speech to Boyd about the coming storm was some nifty foreshadowing of the apocalyptic chaos we 've already glimpsed .
And Dushku had one of the most important speeches in the episode , about the nature of power , towards the beginning .
It 's easy to miss , but her beautifully delivered speech sets up a lot of the episode 's themes :
No , sweetie .
It 's about the power .
There 's a ton of money in this room , but that 's not power .
Nolan 's a medical genius , shortlisted for the Nobel —
That 's power .
Art is power , because they ( meaning the wealthy idiots ) can't make it .
So what if you make Nolan all cute and nervous ?
Why not ride that a little ?
Make them think they have the power .
Our time will come .

There are so many ideas in there , it 's hard to know where to start — Echo has been programmed by the Dollhouse to convince Priya that sleeping with Nolan is a good idea , and she does this by trying to convince Priya that she 's the powerful one in this situation .
She 's powerful because she 's the only one who can create her art , which is a limited commodity .
And she 's powerful because she 's beautiful and can use her wiles to get Nolan to help her career .
( It 's a very " Wife Of Bath " notion . )
Money is n't power , says the mindless plaything who 's been programmed — at great expense — to say that .
Advertisement
Because , of course , money is power , or at least one of the manifestations of power .
And the moment Priya tries to assert her actual power — simply by leaving the room — she gets cockblocked , and shortly afterwards , she no longer even exists as a person .
And the whole rest of the episode proves , more or less , that people like Nolan really do have all the power .
Unless you stab them repeatedly in the chest , and are lucky enough to know someone with amazing " cleaner " skills , like Boyd .

I think all along , I 've championed Dollhouse not just because of its many moments of greatness , but also because of its potential — which is much greater than almost any other television show possesses .
Dollhouse 's concept , and its dark , complex characters , open up so many possibilities for storytelling about the stuff that we 're all dealing with in our lives — the people who want to turn us into what they want us to be , the compromises we all make to get along — that if this show lives up to even a fraction of its potential , it will be legendary .
So when an episode actually delivers on the show 's wealth of possibility , I get frightfully excited .
My one quibble about this episode is , once again , the Dollhouse being awfully slack .
Boyd spends a lot of time piecing together the signs that Echo is becoming way too sentient ... and then does nothing about it .
Meanwhile , Victor and Sierra are practically humping each other in the main spa concourse , and people just think it 's cute .
Were n't the dolls supposed to be ... I dunno ... kind of empty - headed when they 're in their mindwiped state ?
A mere erection on Victor 's part was cause for a red alert a year ago , and now it 's " everything goes . "

New filings to the court , he said , " state for the record that the AP is correct about which photo I used ... and that I was mistaken .
While I initially believed that the photo I referenced was a different one , I discovered early on in the case that I was wrong .
In an attempt to conceal my mistake I submitted false images and deleted other images . "
" Throughout the case , there has been a question as to which Mannie Garcia photo I used as a reference to design the HOPE image , " Fairey said .
" The AP claimed it was one photo , and I claimed it was another . "
Fairey said in a statement issued late Friday that he knowingly submitted false images and deleted others in the legal proceedings , in an attempt to conceal the fact that the AP had correctly identified the photo that Fairey had used as a reference for his " Hope " poster of then - Sen .
Barack Obama .
In a strange twist to an already complicated legal situation , artist Shepard Fairey admitted today to legal wrongdoing in his ongoing battle with the Associated Press .
In February , the AP claimed that Fairey violated copyright laws when he used one of their images as the basis for the poster .
In response , the artist filed a lawsuit against the AP , claiming that he was protected under fair use .
Fairey also claimed that he used a different photo as the inspiration for his poster .
After Fairey 's admission , a spokesman for the Associated Press issued a statement saying that Fairey " sued the AP under false pretenses by lying about which AP photograph he used . "
Fairey said that his lawyers have taken the steps to amend his court pleadings to reflect the fact that " the AP is correct about which photo I used as a reference and that I was mistaken . "
The artist expressed his remorse in his statement , saying that he is taking " full responsibility for my actions which were mine alone .
I am taking every step to correct the information and I regret I did not come forward sooner . "
He added : " I am very sorry to have hurt and disappointed colleagues , friends , and family who have supported me in this difficult case and trying time in my life . "
Fairey 's statement said he regretted that his actions would distract from the issue of fair use for artists .
" Regardless of which of the two images was used , the fair use issue should be the same , " he said .

Well , look at that .
Last week it was just a silly suggestion from some netheads , and now come reports that Rupert Murdoch is at least in the early stages of considering opting out of Google , with Microsoft paying it to be " exclusive " on Bing .
Apparently , Microsoft has actually approached a few publications about doing similar deals .
It 's no surprise that Microsoft and Murdoch would explore this .
Microsoft has experimented for years with programs to bribe people to use its search engine over Google 's -- but it has n't done much to help .
Meanwhile , Murdoch continues to not actually understand how the internet or copyright law works , and has some oddly misplaced dislike for Google ( despite the fact that Google alone is pretty much what kept Murdoch - owned MySpace alive for years , and Murdoch owns a bunch of sites that aggregate info just like Google ) .
Still , if this does go forward , it will signal incredibly short - sighted thinking on the parts of everyone who participates .
The initial reaction would be significantly less traffic to any site that agrees to participate , considering that Google still drives a ton of traffic to most major sites .
Simply giving that up for a chunk of cash is a very risky proposition .
Second , in factionalizing the web , it harms everyone .
No one wants to have to think about which sites are included in which search engine , and if the battle begins in earnest , then you have a situation where you end up in an inevitable stalemate , with certain sites in Google 's search engine , but not in Microsoft's , and others in just Microsoft 's but not Google 's -- and no one wins .
Third , the cost of this program to a company like Microsoft to make itis huge .
It 's much bigger than the numbers that were being tossed out before .
Finally , all this would really do is open up new opportunities for one of three things ( or a combination ) to happen ( 1 ) a new meta search engine shows up that aggregates both Microsoft and Google results ( 2 ) technology hacks that will allow you to combine the two results in one or ( 3 )
Google realizes that it has copyright law fair use on its site and keeps indexing sites anyways .
I 'm not sure Google would take that last step , but if things go nuclear , it might make the most sense .
But the key thing is thatdoes .
And that 's the problem .
It 's not adding even the tiniest sliver of additional benefit to users .
And these days , that 's a strategic error .
If your business is focused on making life more difficult for a competitor , rather than adding more value to users , you 're doing the wrong thing .
Microsoft and News Corp. should be trying to provide more value to users , and instead , they seem to be plotting ways to make consumers ' lives more annoying and more difficult .
They may think that 's smart , but in the long term , such strategies always backfire .

The destruction one nuclear bomb can wreak is more than horrifying , says megachurch pastor Rob Bell of Grandville , Mich .
It 's an insult to God .
" Nuclear weapons are a direct affront to God 's dream of shalom for the world , " Bell said Tuesday .
" Life is beautiful , and nuclear weapons are ugly . "
FAITH & REASON : Why are evangelicals losing ground in U.S. culture ?
FULL COVERAGE : Latest religion news at faith.usatoday.com
Bell , the pastor of Mars Hill Bible Church and an up - and - coming voice among young evangelicals , has joined other evangelicals to issue an impassioned call for the elimination of nuclear weapons .
The new Two Futures Project is a coalition of prominent Christians who assert that multilateral disarmament is a biblical imperative .
Christians should be in the no-nukes vanguard , Bell and others said , as they face the choice of " a world without nuclear weapons or a world ruined by them . "
" We must eliminate these weapons , and we can eliminate these weapons , " said Tyler Wigg - Stevenson , 31 , a Baptist minister who founded the project .
" Who do we think we are to claim authority over life itself and the welfare of future generations ?
That power belongs to God alone . "
The project aims to help eliminate nuclear weapons through education and political pressure .
Younger evangelicals are leading the way with support from older activists such as former Nixon lawyer Chuck Colson and Ron Sider , president of Evangelicals for Social Action .
" I 'm part of a generation that believes things can actually change , " said Bell , 38 .
" Ideas that sound far - fetched and naive can actually become reality . "
The group has strong support from George Shultz , secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan .
He recalled being present when Reagan and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev agreed that nuclear weapons ought to be eliminated .
" Maybe an idea that has staying power because of the ' ought ' is an idea whose time has come , " Shultz said .
Noting the United States and Russia own more than 90 % of nuclear weapons , Shultz said he 's encouraged that President Obama recently agreed with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to negotiate a reduction .
In a Palm Sunday speech , Obama called for " a world without nuclear weapons . "
The group is not calling for unilateral disarmament but a " multilateral process where the United States takes leadership , " Wigg - Stevenson said .

The state Attorney General ’s Office believes we have to getoff the streets .
He was caught growing marijuana behind his Franklin Township home — enough to make him , in the eyes of the law , a pot producer , a drug distributor .
Heck , some of the plants were taller than an NBA point guard , cops say .
After a helicopter spotted the weed , police swarmed Wilson ’s neighborhood and arrested him .
He was charged with maintaining or operating a drug- production facility , a first - degree crime , along with other offenses , and could face up to 20 years in prison .
Whew !
Another hard - core drug offender swept from New Jersey ’s streets with help from the National Guard .
We can all sleep soundly tonight .
Except that Wilson has multiple sclerosis and was growing the marijuana , he says , to treat his condition .
He ’s hardly the Gotti of Ganja , the Dillinger of Dope , the Cannabis Kid .
Wilson was caught growing 17 plants .
That makes him subject to prosecution as if he were dealing , but attorney James Wronko insists " there ’s no evidence of that whatsoever . "
Wilson , he says , is a novice and " had no idea " how many plants he needed to make enough pot for personal use .
Sens. Nicholas Scutari and Raymond Lesniak ( both D - Union ) have asked Gov. Jon Corzine to pardon Wilson , who declined an offer to plead guilty in return for a three - to nine - year sentence and is scheduled to go on trial Dec. 14 .
The senators want Corzine to throw out the first - degree charge , so Wilson can enter pretrial intervention on the lesser offenses .
They have called the charges " inappropriate " and an " inhumane application " of the law .
Dude , they ’re right , this is totally bogus .
With the Legislature probably close to passing a bill that permits medical marijuana use , pardoning Wilson from the serious charge makes sense .
Otherwise , the state could spend tens of thousands of dollars to try this case and possibly throw this guy in prison , where it will cost us even more money .
What are we , high ?
This would be an input - output audit .
It would include accounting for every penny of the trillions of dollars spent in any aspect of the bailout .
It would involve accounting for how the bailout money was spent , who received the bailout money and how recipient banks and Wall Street firms used the bailout money .
For example , if banks were given zero - interest capital from the Fed , and loaned that capital through credit cards at 30 percent interest , taxpayers have a right to know this .
If banks were given huge sums of zero or low - interest capital , and did not loan that money as intended , and then used that money for speculation or excessive compensation , taxpayers have a right to know this , too .
In this input - output audit , we take the Ron Paul idea and apply it to those portions of Federal Reserve , FDIC and other agency policies directly tied to the bailout , and then we apply it to the recipients of that money , to determine how it was spent .
Financially this is rational and sound .
Politically this should gain bipartisan support , especially uniting legitimate conservative and progressive populists and guardians of the taxpayers ’ money .
This is a reasonable and manageable proposal that would have a sweeping impact assuring transparency , integrity and fairness to taxpayers .

Phil Hellmuth Signed to Coach Jeff Shulman
After decades of trying , Phil Hellmuth has found a way to get himself back to the final table of the World Series of Poker Main Event .
How did the multiple - bracelet holder wind up snagging the heretofore non-existent slot of the November Tenth ?
By reportedly signing on to coach Jeff Shulman .
Shulman , who ’s made WSOP news in the past few months with his vociferous criticism of the WSOP ( specifically of how Harrah ’s runs the event ) , including a pledge to throw the Main Event bracelet into the garbage if he won , made the announcement yesterday in an article on CardPlayer .
“ Phil just has such a way of thinking about winning that I knew he would be a great resource , ” said Shulman .
“ We ’re going to talk about final - table strategy , analyze the tapes , and work on my own play . ”
“ I turned on the TV and I was watching Tiger Woods or something , and I realized — every single player has a coach , ” said Shulman .
“ No matter how good or bad my game is , it can always get better . ”
The deal with Hellmuth is no doubt a good one for Shulman , who for the record is no tournament slouch , with career winnings that exceed 99 % of the poker - playing population and a deep well of WSOP experience – in fact , he ’s the only person at the table with WSOP final table experience ( he took 7th in 2000 ) .
No word on the terms of the deal .
Also likely pleased with the deal : ESPN , who just had a new story line dropped neatly into their laps , something they ’ll no doubt be grateful for when frantically assembling the final table episodes of the WSOP .
Possibly pleased : Ultimate Bet , assuming
Phil gets some jersey time snuck into the broadcast .

After being banned from Sony 's PlayStation Network during a game of Resistance : Fall of Man , a San Jose , California gamer sued the electronics giant , alleging a violation of his First Amendment rights .
That case was dismissed in September , but the plaintiff was undeterred .
In addition to filing in an appeal in that case , earlier this month he filed a new suit against Microsoft and Nintendo .
In that case , he alleged that a broken Xbox 360 caused him undue stress , and that a Wii system update blocking access to the Homebrew Channel third - party program interfered with his inalienable right to pursue happiness .
Are the normal World of Warcraft fees any worse than those of the World of Warcraft Visa card ?
With the big - three platform holders accounted for , the same plaintiff is now turning his attention to largest third - party publisher .
The gamer , Erik Estavillo , provided GameSpot with copies of his latest civil suit , a case against Activision Blizzard filed this morning in the Santa Clara County Superior Court of California .
A court clerk confirmed for GameSpot that the suit had been filed .
The suit comprises a handful of complaints against Activision Blizzard , specifically relating to the company 's successful massively multiplayer online role - playing game , World of Warcraft .
Specifically , the gamer accuses the publisher of maintaining a " harmful virtual environment " with " sneaky and deceitful practices . "
He first takes exception to the game 's $ 14.99 monthly subscription fee , calling it the highest of any MMORPG .
He contends the fee is aggravated by the game requiring players to travel great distances at a slow walking or running pace , with fast travel options like teleportation stones and mounts only available to gamers who rise to an advanced level or purchase the game 's expansion packs .
He also cited the game 's resurrection process , in which players travel in spirit from cemeteries back to the spots where they died in order to revive themselves , as an unnecessary part of the game designed to cost gamers money .
Other fees at issue include the charges ( up to $ 25 ) Blizzard levies to change their characters ' names , races , factions , or servers .
Beyond the monetary complaints , the suit also references the 2001 suicide of an EverQuest player , attributing it to a sense of alienation related to the game and mental health problems .
The suit goes on to say the plaintiff has suffered from similar problems , including major depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , panic disorder , and Crohn 's disease , and he " does n't want to end up like [ the EverQuest player ] did as he relies on video games heavily for the little ongoing happiness he can achieve in this life , via the gaming medium . "
In addition to the suit , the plaintiff also wants a pair of celebrities to attest to the effects of alienation .
The gamer is subpoenaing Depeche Mode 's Martin Lee Gore " since he himself has been known to be sad , lonely , and alienated , as can be seen in the songs he writes . "
He is also calling Winona Ryder to testify , saying the actress ' appreciation for Catcher in the Rye will make her a relevant witness " to how alienation in the book can tie to alienation in real live [ sic ] / video games such as World of Warcraft . "
The gamer is asking for $ 1 million in punitive damages and a court order forcing Activision Blizzard to address the problems alleged in the suit .
As of press time , representatives with Activision and Blizzard had not returned GameSpot 's requests for comment .

LLJVM
LLJVM provides a set of tools and libraries for running comparatively low level languages ( such as C ) on the JVM .
The C to JVM bytecode compilation provided by LLJVM involves several steps .
Source code is first compiled to LLVM intermediate representation ( IR ) by a frontend such as llvm - gcc or clang .
LLVM IR is then translated to Jasmin assembly code , linked against other Java classes , and then assembled to JVM bytecode .
The use of LLVM IR as the intermediate representation allows more information about the source program to be preserved , compared to other methods which use MIPS binary as the intermediate representation ( such as NestedVM and Cibyl ) .
For example , functions are mapped to individual JVM methods , and all function calls are made with native JVM invocation instructions .
This allows compiled code to be linked against arbitrary Java classes , and Java programs to natively call individual functions in the compiled code .
It also allows programs to be split across multiple classes ( comparable to dynamic linking ) , rather than statically linking everything into a single class .
Also note that while C is currently the only supported input language , any language with a compiler targeting LLVM IR could potentially be supported .
This project is currently unmaintained .
You may be interested in :
QUICKSTART
For a quick demonstration of some pre-compiled classes , download the runtime library and the demo package to a directory on your machine , and run java - jar lljvm - demo - 0.2.jar .
To quickly start translating your own programs you might want to use Docker .
Getting LLJVM to run on modern machines ( and keeping it running ) can be quite tricky as it depends heavily on an old version of LLVM .
As an alternative , Martin Haye has set up a virtual machine image here that is pre-configured for and includes LLJVM .
Install Docker ( you may need Boot2 Docker ) and start it this way : docker run - i - v / your / project / dir : / project -t mhaye / lljvm / bin / bash
To compile LLJVM from source , follow the instructions below .
If you have problems compiling from source and are running Linux on an i386 - compatible platform , download the binary release , extract it , and download the runtime library into the resulting directory .
INSTALLATION
LLVM 2.7 must be installed to compile and run LLJVM .
Jasmin is needed for assembling JVM bytecode .
To compile LLJVM , simply call make in the project root directory , and call make check to run the testsuite .
To generate the the documentation for the java packages and the backend , call make doc , which will generate HTML documentation in doc / java / and doc / backend / respectively .
PDF documentation for the backend can be obtained by calling make doc-pdf ( requires PDFLaTeX ) , which will generate doc/ backend.pdf .
A zip archive containing all of the documentation can be created by calling make doc-zip .
C COMPILER
The lljvm -cc frontend ties together several components to provide a C source code to JVM class file compiler .
In order to use the frontend , either llvm - gcc or clang must be installed .
llvm - gcc is recommended , and is used instead of clang if both are available .
It is also required that the classpath contain jasmin.jar .
To compile a small number of source files to a class file , the following style of command can be used :
lljvm - cc foo .c bar.c -o foo
This will generate foo.class , as well as a shell script foo , which sets the classpath appropriately and executes the classfile with the arguments passed to it .
This allows the class to be called in the same way as any other executable .
If calling the class without the shell script , note that the entire list of arguments must be passed to the class , including argument 0 ( the name of the command ) .
For a larger number of source files , it is often more efficient to separately compile each file to an object file as needed :
lljvm-cc -c foo.c
then link the object files together into a class file :
lljvm - cc - link foo . o bar .o baz .o -o foo
Note that the - link flag must be used if object files are being supplied instead of source files .
To link the object files together as a library instead of an executable , - link - as - library can be passed instead of - link .
In this case the shell script will not be generated .
To link against a library generated by lljvm - cc , the - l < name > flag can be used .
This will search for a library in the classpath called lib< name >.class .
Additional directories can be added to the classpath with the - L < path > flag .
Such additions to the classpath will also be added to the shell script , so when linking an executable , the - L flag must be passed for each directory containing libraries needed by the executable ( except the current directory and directories in the system classpath ) .
An exception to the above is the - lm flag .
This will not search for libm.class , but will rather link against java.lang .
Math and lljvm.runtime .
Math .
Also , - lc should not be used as libc is linked by default .
If this is not desired , then the - nostdlib flag can be used .
By default all classes generated are placed in the default package .
To assign the class to a specific package , the - classname flag can be used .
For example , the following command :
lljvm-cc ... - classname=com.example.foo -o bar/baz
will create a class named foo , in the package com.example , placing it in the directory bar / com / example / .
The shell script will be output to bar / baz .
If the - g3 flag is used , then Jasmin assembly with full debugging information will be output to < output >.j .
In addition to the above flags , any flag accepted by gcc or ld can also be used .
However , sometimes these flags may not be passed to the correct component ( this is a bug with lljvm - cc and should be reported ) .
The frontend can also be used to compile autoconf - based projects relatively easily ( although sometimes some changes to the project 's build system may be required ) :
./configure CC=lljvm-cc LD=' lljvm-cc - link ' make CCLD=' lljvm-cc - link '
DEMO
To demonstrate the capabilities of LLJVM , several common software packages can be compiled with lljvm - cc by entering the demo / subdirectory and calling make .
To verify that all of these compiled correctly , call make check .
A JAR archive containing all of the demo programs can be created by calling make demo in the project root directory .
For usage information , execute the JAR in the project root directory with no arguments :
java - jar lljvm - demo.jar
BACKEND
The LLJVM Backend transforms LLVM IR into Jasmin assembly code .
It can be invoked by :
lljvm - backend foo.bc > foo.j
There are two flags that are accepted by the backend : - classname and - g .
Run lljvm - backend -- help for more information .
The output file should then be linked by the LLJVM Linker ( see below ) , and assembled into a class file by Jasmin :
java - jar jasmin.jar foo.j
RUNTIME
The LLVJM Runtime has three components , the Core Runtime ( lljvm.runtime ) , the I/ O Support Library ( lljvm.io ) , and the C Standard Library ( lljvm.lib.c ) .
See the JavaDoc documentation for further details on the former two .
The latter is Newlib compiled to JVM bytecode by lljvm -cc .
TOOLS
There are two command - line tools available : the linker , and the info utility .
There are several ways to invoke these tools .
The simplest way is to call them directly from the jar archive :
java - jar lljvm .jar < cmd > args ...
Alternatively , if lljvm . jar is already in the classpath , one of the following can be used :
java lljvm.tools .
Main < cmd > args ... java lljvm.tools .<cmd >.
Main args ...
LINKER
The LLJVM Linker qualifies references to external methods and fields in Jasmin assembly code .
At the top of the code ( before any .method directives ) , external references should be specified through the .extern pseudo - directive , such as :
. extern field foo I .extern method bar( I ) V
Then the linker can be invoked by :
java - jar lljvm .jar ld LIBRARY ... < INPUT .j > OUTPUT.j
For example , the following assembly code :
. extern method cos(D ) D .extern field NULL I ... invokestatic cos(D ) D getstatic NULL I CLASSFORMETHOD cos(D ) D
linked with the command :
java - jar lljvm .jar ld java.lang .Math lljvm.runtime .
Memory
would produce :
... invokestatic java / lang / Math / cos( D ) D getstatic lljvm / runtime / Memory / NULL I ldc " java/lang / Math "
INFO
The info utility lists the type signatures of the public static fields and methods provided by a class .
For example , to list those provided by libc :
java - jar lljvm .jar info lljvm.lib.c
By default , any identifiers beginning with an underscore are omitted .
To disable this behaviour , pass the -v flag :
By Larry Kudlow - November 5 , 2009
Against the backdrop of high unemployment and a public revolt against a Democratic health - care bill -- which would significantly increase taxes , slash Medicare spending , and massively raise health - care spending elsewhere in a government takeover of our leading growth sector -- the Republicans swept the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races .
It 's interesting that early signs of economic recovery are not helping the Obama Democrats .
This is largely because of the 9.8 percent unemployment rate , which is expected to move higher .
Even the crazy jobs - saved - or - created campaign is having no discernable impact while the Obamacons try to fight the unemployment rate .
If you go to recovery.gov , the official stimulus website , you 'll find that there has been $ 207 billion in stimulus spending through Oct. 30 , 2009 -- including $ 84 billion in tax benefits , $ 52 billion in contract grants and loans , and $ 71 billion in entitlements .
So even if we give my friend Jared Bernstein his highly flawed " 1 million jobs saved or created , " that 's $ 207,000 per job in an economy where the average wage is about $ 46,000 .
Not good .
Wasteful and ineffectual spending .
( In reality , tax credits are spending .
For incentivizing , you need marginal tax - rate cuts . )
Mike Flynn of Breitbart 's biggovernment.com notes that the government pumped $ 170 billion into the third - quarter economy .
But gross domestic product grew by only $ 150 billion .
As I said , ineffectual spending .
That does n't meant the economy is n't rebounding .
It is .
Glitches and all , third - quarter GDP popped up 3.5 percent at an annual rate after inflation .
Statistically , the recession is over .
That 's good .
And it corroborates the big stock market rally over the past seven months .
This is going to be a business - led recovery as self - correcting firms build profits on top of huge cash flows .
Yesterday 's ISM manufacturing report for October also confirms the growth trend with a recovery reading of 55.7 , the strongest since April 2006 .
And this morning 's factory orders for September also show a stronger - than - expected gain .
Even car sales are expected to rise in October by more than 10 million , at least 1 million better than September .
Ford , which refused to take TARP bailout money , reported a surprise increase in profits .
But the depreciating dollar remains a storm cloud over recovery .
So are scheduled tax - rate increases and health care legislation that will slam individuals and firms with higher tax burdens and higher tax costs for job creation .
And then there 's the Federal Reserve .
With gold up another $ 25 -- setting a new nominal record of $ 1,079 -- the Fed released a policy statement Wednesday that continues a program of massive money - pumping and a zero interest rate .
This whole Obama policy mix of huge government spending and a depreciating greenback is all wrong .
It 's pro-inflation , not pro-growth .
For a true economic recovery , we need a stable King Dollar and lower marginal tax rates to incentivize job creation .
Jimmy Pethokoukis and others have noted that the first recovery quarter under Ronald Reagan was better than 8 percent , not 3.5 percent .
In fact , the average real GDP growth rate for the first quarter of the 10 postwar recoveries is 7.3 percent .
So the economic - recovery story , and even the stock market rally , wo n't bail out the Obamacons today , although it remains to be seen whether a free - market , anti-tax - and - spend message will emerge from the election sweep by the GOP .
If so , it could doom the so - called health care reform that has become a symbol of the leftward - tilting , big - government , economic - control policies emanating from Washington .
TEGUCIGALPA ( Reuters ) - Honduras ’ de facto leaders blasted loud music outside the embassy where Manuel Zelaya is sheltering on Wednesday and refused to buckle under increased pressure from Washington for the ousted president ’s return .
Talks to resolve the political crisis in Honduras sparked by a June 28 coup are deadlocked over whether leftist Zelaya can be reinstated to power .
“ One side of the dialogue has all the privileges and advantages and the other legitimately elected side is totally repressed , ” Zelaya told local radio station from inside the Brazilian Embassy where he took refuge last month after returning from exile .
Police said they found two unexploded grenades in a shopping center near the hotel in Tegucigalpa where the crisis talks are being held .
The grenades were safely removed and no one was injured .
Overnight , the caretaker government sent the army to play loud rock music , military band tunes , church bells and recordings of pig grunts over loudspeakers outside the embassy , a Reuters photographer inside the embassy said .
Zelaya called it “ torture . ”
The crisis in Honduras has become a headache for President Barack Obama , who had pledged better relations with Latin America .
Regional governments worry Obama is not doing enough to pressure Honduras ’ de facto leader Roberto Micheletti , appointed by Congress after the coup .
The Supreme Court ordered Zelaya ’s ouster , saying he violated the constitution by seeking support for re-election .
Zelaya denies the charge .
VISAS PULLED
The U.S. State Department suspended the visas of more senior figures that backed the coup on Wednesday .
It marked the second time Washington pulled diplomatic and tourist visas over the crisis .
“ We just urge the two sides to stick to it .
We urge the de facto regime in particular to help open a pathway for international support of the election by concluding the agreement , ” State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said .
But both sides were far from a deal on Wednesday .
The United States has warned it might not recognize the results of the November 29 elections if Zelaya is not allowed to return to power first , but Micheletti continued to resist .
“ We obviously believe that ( Zelaya ’s return ) is not possible .
We believe he violated the law , ” Arturo Corrales , a lead negotiator for Micheletti , said .
The team said they had heard nothing from Zelaya ’s camp in 48 hours .
Zelaya angered Honduras ’ business leaders by moving the country closer to Venezuela ’s socialist president , Hugo Chavez .
Micheletti’s government accused Chavez and Nicaragua ’s President Daniel Ortega of fomenting violence in Honduras with inflammatory rhetoric .
On Wednesday , Honduran police announced further restrictions on protests , saying they must be authorized by the government 24 hours in advance with a request detailing the people in charge and the time and route the march will take , in an effort to quell near daily rallies in favor of Zelaya .

WASHINGTON -- A new Internal Revenue Service enforcement unit targeting the very wealthy will help the tax agency decode partnerships , offshore trusts and other complex techniques used to hide income , IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman said Monday .
Dubbed the Global High Wealth Industry group , the unit will launch " a small number " of audits of individuals with assets or income in the tens of millions of dollars , Mr. Shulman told an accountants ' trade group .
An IRS official said the group would begin work on these initial audits in the next month .
The high - wealth group , housed in the IRS 's large - and medium - sized business division , marks a sharpening of the IRS approach to auditing the very wealthy .
Its creation is a response to the complex web of entities and transactions many high - net - worth individuals use to manage their financial affairs .
" You cannot assess compliance among the nation 's wealthiest individuals by looking only at their 1040s [ tax returns ] , " Mr. Shulman said .
" Our goal is to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual and to assess the tax compliance of that overall enterprise . "
Wealth advisers questioned how much the new IRS approach adds , since in some cases , even under the old structure , an audit of a high - net - worth person may have looked across multiple income sources and asset classes .

One of the types of personal injury cases is a wrongful death lawsuit .
This is a type of case that is filed when one individual believes that another individual or organization caused the death of someone and wants compensation .
They will use a lawyer to file a lawsuit against that party and look to make them liable for the person ’s death .
An example would be an individual dies in a car accident after a collision with a truck .
The truck is the vehicle of a company .
The parents of the accident victim then file a suit against that company for monetary compensation and liability .
There are many steps involved in a wrongful death lawsuit so it is important to keep this in mind when using the services of a Austin personal injury lawyer .
Whenever you are looking to file a wrongful death lawsuit , the first step that a Austin personal injury lawyer will take is to file documents .
This consists of drafting papers that state that the plaintiff is seeking compensation and wants a settlement .
The papers will be filed to the local court as well as the defendant .
If the defendant decides to provide a settlement , then the case will be over as compensation is awarded right away .
However , there are many times when a defendant will not provide compensation and will seek to contest the lawsuit .
When this occurs , a deposition and trial will be the next steps in the process .
The next step in a wrongful death lawsuit is the deposition .
This consists of summoning the defendant to come to a hearing and answer questions about the nature of the accident .
If represented by a Austin personal injury lawyer , you will have a legal professional who will ask the questions for you .
During the deposition , the lawyer will look to get information that they can use to their advantage if the case goes to trial .
A deposition will not only consist of interviews with the defendant but also other witnesses who are associated with the defendant as well .
After the deposition , the wrongful death lawsuit will proceed to trial .
During the trial both sides will begin arguing their case .
The plaintiff lawyer will try to convince the jury that the defendant was liable for the death of the individual associated with the plaintiff .
At the same time , the defendant ’s lawyer will then look to present to the jury that the defendant had no liability of the death and should not be ordered to provide compensation to the plaintiff .
This will usually go on for up to two weeks and a jury will then need to decide on who to favor in the case .
If the plaintiff wins the wrongful death lawsuit , then they will be awarded compensation in the form of a judgement .
This is ruling where the plaintiff is entitled to compensation and will have the authority to collect the awarded compensation from the defendant .
However , if the plaintiff loses , then the case is over and the defendant does n’t owe any compensation to the plaintiff .

We 'll tell you exactly why , because it 's a lot of fun .
We know , because we had a similar experience in late adolescence , but we used GI Joe vehicles ( even the awesome hovercraft ) and firecrackers .
But what we did n't have back then was a 600 fps camera , but lucky for us , people do now ... and they have YouTube to share it with the rest of us .
After the jump is video of diecast cars getting blown sky high with what appears to be some relatively large explosive .
What makes this little experiment so much fun is that our mini pyrotechnician friend captured the carnage 20 times slower than conventional video , giving us a crystal clear picture of every blast .
And to make the one minute video that much more entertaining , the creator cut his masterpiece to one of the best pieces of music any aspiring video editor can use in a disaster sequence ; Ode To Joy .
Hit the jump to watch the video for yourself , and keep in mind that blowing things up can lead to blowing off fingers and shrapnel in the eye , so do n't try this at home !

With the new iPhone OS 3.0 now available for download , AT&T support for MMS and data - tethering remains conspicuously absent .
While some might attribute this to greed or laziness on AT&T ’s part , the reality is that AT&T ’s network still is n’t capable of supporting millions of iPhone users sending large volumes of video and photo MMS messages .
Add in data - tethering , and AT&T likely has a very real fear that its network might collapse under the weight of Internet savvy iPhone users .
Compared to other smartphone owners , iPhone users not only go on the Internet more often , but tend to browse for longer periods of time and download more mobile content in the process .
According to Roger Entner , a telecom research analyst for Nielsen , AT&T ’s network still is n’t prepared for an onslaught in data consumption .
In an interview with the USA Today , Entner points out that the average iPhone user consumes upwards of 400 MB of data every month .
In comparison , most smartphone users only consume around 40 - 80 MB of data every month .
It ’s important to remember that the iPhone is n’t the only smartphone AT&T supports .
That being the case , it ’s very likely that AT&T views the iPhone as already eating up more than its fair share of resources , and is reluctant to add support for new features that would only increase that data consumption .
At the same time , iPhone users pay a pretty penny to AT&T every month , with the average bill coming in at somewhere around $ 90 a month .
Moreover , the iPhone attracted a large number of new AT&T customers , and though AT&T subsidizes every iPhone sold , it ’s able to make up that difference in only a matter of months .
You would think that with all of that moolah , AT&T would have been busy upgrading its network infrastructure to prepare for new iPhone models that it undoubtedly knew were in the pipeline .
AT&T has more iPhone customers than any other carrier , so it ’s not necessarily fair to compare it to all the other carriers that will provide immediate support for MMS and data - tethering .
Some have even suggested that perhaps AT&T is n’t moving too slow , but that the iPhone is growing at a faster rate than AT&T could have ever anticipated .
While that might sound nice , the iPhone has been out for almost 2 years now , so the excuse that “ AT&T is n’t ready ” is kind of played out at this point .
As a final point , data tethering is already supported by AT&T on a host of other phones , but the iPhone remains the odd man out .
What ’s confusing about AT&T ’s silence on the matter is that iPhone customers are more than willing to pay a few extra bucks a month for the feature .
Perhaps after the debacle that was the iPhone 3G launch last summer , AT&T is indeed keen on implementing MMS and tethering , but wants to make sure its network is more than capable of handling an insane amount of data before it makes any promises it can’t keep , and subjects itself to even more lawsuits .
Still , it was less than a month ago that AT&T released a press release touting all of the upgrades it was making to its network .
If by summer ’s end , AT&T support for MMS and tethering work flawlessly , we might look back and see that we were too hard on AT&T .
But if MMS and tethering support are riddled with bandwidth problems , well then Apple will be counting down the days until its exclusive contract with AT&T expires .
The Belarussian paid tribute to former boss Arsene Wenger .
Aliaksandr Hleb has admitted his regret over leaving Arsenal , ahead of Belarus ' World Cup qualifier against England on Wednesday .
The 28 - year - old left the Emirates in the summer of 2008 to realize what he thought would be a dream move to Barcelona .
However , struggled to break into Pep Guardiola 's first team , watching mostly from the bench as the Catalan giants claimed the Champions League , Primera Division and Cope del Rey titles last term .
The Belarussian has since moved on and rejoined Stuttgart on loan in search of regular first - team football .
Back in London for international duty , the former Gunners favorite admitted he never should have left .
“ I regret leaving Arsenal , " Hleb lamented , according to The Daily Express .
" I was playing every week for one of the most exciting sides in Europe .
I was being guided by one of the best coaches in the world in Arsene Wenger .
I owe him a great deal .
“ No player ever gets worse under Wenger .
I developed a better all - round game under him .
I became more robust physically . ”

Sajátos tünetek – gyomortáji bizser , enyhe tikkelés , vad asszociációzuhatag – kíséretében észleltem a minap , hogy az egyik , nem éppen acélos helyesírásáról nevezetes kollégám hírszerkesztés közben folyamatosan használja az Osiris - féle helyesírás - kézikönyvet .
Monitoralátétnek .
Azt az egy példányt , amit munka közben négy - öt másik hírfaragó munkatársával kellene cafrangosra nyálazzanak – mármint rózsaszín szerkesztői álmaimban .
De hát ki a fenének kell – valójában – egy helyesírási szótár ?
És minek ?
Azt leszámítva , persze , ha véletlenül épp megfelelő vastagságú ahhoz , hogy szemmagasságba emeljen egy számítógép - monitort .
Érthetetlen , miért adnak ki újabb és újabb helyesírási szótárakat .
Pedig kiadnak .
Levél jött csütörtökön :
„ Tisztelt Szerkesztőség !
Az Akadémiai Kiadó egyre hevesebben , és egyre reménytelenebbül harcol a gagyi szótárak ellen .
Ennek jegyében , és az új Magyar Helyesírási Szótár megjelenése alkalmából egy rendhagyó , a helyesírás népszer űsítését szolgáló akciót szerveznek .
Helyesírásból vizsgáznak ismert és népszerű újságírók , közönség előtt .
A résztvevők : Vágó István műsorvezető , a versenyzők : Bárdos András , Máté Krisztina , Rózsa Péter és Selmeczi Tibor .
A helyszín : Szabó Ervin könyvtár ( VIII .
kerület , Szabó Ervin tér 1 . ) ,
az időpont : november 6 - a , péntek , délután , 15:30 .
Az eseményre szeretettel várjuk !
Üdvözlettel :
Akadémiai Kiadó Sajtó ”
Mii ? Mit ?
Hogy ?
Mér ?
Néztem bambán és tupán .
Beletelt némi nyomozásba , mire leesett : át vagyok verve .
Először csak azon görcsöltem , mennyire jellemző kies hazánkra , hogy egy akadémiainak nevezett kiadónál – és éppen egy helyesírási kiadványról szólva – nem tudják a (z egyébként általuk kiadott ) hatályos helyesírási szabályzatnak megfelelően leírni a (z általuk kiadott )
Magyar helyesírási szótár címét .
Aztán kiderült , hogy nem az új Magyar helyesírási szótárról van szó , hanem egy új magyar helyesírási szótárról .
Beindult az agyam :
ez a tuti rövidesen változásokon esik át
Ha én magánkiadó lennék egy olyan névvel , amelyről a piacomon majdnem mindenki azt hiszi , hogy 1828 óta töretlenül a magyar szakkönyvkiadás már-már állami monopolistája ( az Akadémiai Kiadó 1996 óta részvénytársaság , többségi tulajdonosa a nemzetközi tudományos könyvkiadás egyik óriása , a Wolters Kluwer ) , olyan kiadványok örökletes jogaival , amelyekről a piacomon majdnem mindenki azt hiszi , hogy azok tartalmazzák helyesírási ügyekben a nagyon - nagyon hivatalos tutit , és tudnám – márpedig tudnám , hiszen közreműködnék benne – , hogy ez a tuti rövidesen változásokon esik át , valahogy így profitmaximalizálnék :
Igyekeznék nem nagyon kidobolni , hogy készül az új helyesírási szabályzat .
Közben kiadnék mindenféle , a régi szabályzaton alapuló segédkönyvet , szótárat .
Ügyesen kavarnék a címükkel és a tálalásukkal .
Ha például a Magyar helyesírási szótár című kiadványomat – amit szinte mindenki a hivatalos helyesírási szótárnak hisz – úgy hívnák a népek , hogy az akadémiai helyesírási szótár , kiadnék mellé egy másikat – mondjuk , vastagabbat , de kevéssé szerkesztettet – , és azt a címet adnám neki , hogy Akadémiai helyesírási szótár .
Kiadnám persze a szabályzatot is , arra mindig szükség van .
A munkatársaim a népszerűsítő rendezvényeken – megint csak : persze – új kiadásnak neveznék a huszonöt éve nem új kiadás új – példaanyagában átdolgozott – lenyomatát .
Régi és új helyesírási kiadványaimból intenzív marketingmunkával igyekeznék minél többet eladni .
Addig , amíg elkészül A magyar helyesírás szabályainak új kiadása .
Amennyire erőmből és lehet őségeimből telik , megpróbálnék hatni az új kiadásra is .
Azt szeretném elérni , hogy az akadémia illetékes bizottsága a lehető legkevesebbet változtasson a szabályzaton , a struktúrájához például véletlenül se nyúljanak hozzá , a szemléletmódjáról , szövegezési normáiról , kivétellistáiról , példáiról stb.
nem is beszélve .
Viszont arra ösztönözném őket , hogy nyilvánítsák a megesett szabálypiszkálgatást mélyreható helyesírási reformnak .
ha felvonul négy - öt bulvárfelfújt médiaszemélyiség
Aztán amikor elfogadják a reformszabályzatot , nemcsak a szabályzat – most már tényleg – új kiadását készíthetném el csekély ráfordítással – és teríthetném be vele a reformra hivatkozva az iskolákat , könyvtárakat , szerkeszt őségeket , intézményeket – , hanem pikpakk jöhetnék a fölélénkített piacra különböző szótáraimnak az új szabályzathoz igazított változataival is .
Egy beetetés , két lehalászás .
Fogalmam sincs – honnan is lehetne ?
– , fölmerült -e az Akadémiai Kiadónál bárkiben akárcsak hasonló .
Rosszindulatú vagyok , mert földühített a gagyi .
„ Az Akadémiai Kiadó egyre hevesebben , és [ hevesebben és ] egyre reménytelenebbül harcol a gagyi szótárak ellen . ”
Ez dicséretes .
Magunk is szót emeltünk már öt éve is az ellen , hogy a „ szótárpiac tele van hígvelejű , pofátlan senkik okádék szemetével ” .
Na de gagyi ellen gagyival ?
Tapasztalataim szerint , ha felvonul négy - öt bulvárfelfújt médiaszemélyiség , az többnyire valami gagyit eredményez .
Hogy a tragikomikumra rátoljunk még egy lapáttal , a felvonultatott új szótárról azt írta egyik nyelvész informátorom , hogy az „ maga a gagyi ” .
Elmentem hát a rendezvényre .
Nagy , ronda lebőgés volt .
És ezt a négy unottan mosolygó – majd sietve távozó – alany mintha észre se vette volna .
Jó , Bárdos András , Máté Krisztina , Rózsa Péter , Selmeczi Tibor jobbára szájalós műfajokban működnek , de azért mégis az újságírás krémjébe számítanak ( úgy viselkednek mindenestre ) .
Újságírók , vagyis szöveggyártó iparosok .
Régi , mániákusan szajkózott analógiám : a lakatostanoncba legelőször is beleverik , hogyan kell a satu mellé állni , hogyan fogja a reszelőt , a kalapácsot .
Az a szövegiparos , aki nem ismeri a helyesírási normát , rosszul fogja a reszelőt .
A magyar szövegiparos többnyire rosszul fogja .
A húsz , átlagosan genya tesztkérdésből alig akadt néhány , amit mind a négy híresség jól tudott vagy tippelt volna meg .
Az olyanok jobbára megvannak , hogy a Magyar Tudományos Akadémia nevének betűszó változata MTA ( és nem M.T.A. vagy Mta ) , hogy a csengetty ű hosszú tty , hosszú ű , vagy hogy Rimbaud -val ( és nem - dal ) .
De már a sakk - kör , a nefelejcscsokor , a dzsessz - szám , a talpalávaló , a gejzír , a negyvenhétezer - ötszázhatvanhárom nem nagyon megy , vagy nagyon nem megy .
neves újságíróink derűs önlejáratással demonstrálták , hogy az egész el van cseszve
Ami engem illet , a beseggelős helyesírási csapdákba való belelépést ( gejzír ; lakáj , lakályos , karvalybagoly ; kávésnénike ; stb. ) nem veszem zokon , az ilyesmit az ember – ha hibátlan szöveget akar elereszteni – megnézi a szótárban , illetve ezeket a mai szövegszerkesztők jobbára úgyis kilövik ( bár , mondjuk , hogy a dz a mai szabálok szerint egy betű – tehát ma-dzag , és nem mad-zag – , ezeknek az embereknek azért szerintem gáz nem tudni ) .
Csak azt nem értem , miért demonstrálja egy celebritás nyilvánosan ilyesfajta tudatlanságát .
Mi a jó neki ebben ?
A honorárium ?
Mit akar üzenni vele ?
Ne szarozz te se ezzel a helyesírás nevű marhasággal , lám , én is mekkora jani lettem nélküle ?
Lehet , de akkor a kiadó nagyon mellétrafált ezzel a rendezvénnyel .
Vannak aztán mai helyesírási rendszerünknek olyan részterületei , amik bombabiztosan jelzik , hogy azt a valamit , amit a magyar közoktatásban nyelvtannak hívnak , úgy kéne kivágni a hóra , ahogy van .
Az első feladat így szólt : melyik a helyes , A ) adóvevő készülék , B ) adó - vevő - készülék , C ) adóvevőkészülék vagy D ) adó-vevő készülék ?
Nem jött össze .
Máté Krisztina végül megnézte a szótárban .
És nem értették , miért adó -vevő készülék .
Teljes értetlenséget sugárzó arccal meredtek Vágóra , akinek nem sikerült szabatosan , pláne nem érthetően elővezetni a harmadik mozgószabályt , pedig próbálta becsülettel .
A hatodik feladatban három karaktersorból – kerekasztal konferencia , kerekasztalkonferencia - rendezés , kerekasztal - konferencia – kellett volna kiválasztani az egy hibásat .
Teljes csőd .
A beálló technikai szünetben – elromlott Vágó mikrofonja – keményen összevitatkoztak .
Vágó próbálta felvezetni nekik a hat - hármas szabályt meg az első mozgószabályt ( ráadásul egy sikerületlen példával belezagyválta a harmadik mozgót is , meg azt mondta , hogy a második szó a kerekasztal és a konferenciarendezés összetétele , pedig nem ) , csakhogy reménytelenül , mert celebritásainknak nem volt világos , hogy a kerekasztal - konferencia , az egy szó .
Meg a kerekasztalkonferencia - rendezés is .
Először ugyanis azt kell eldönteni , hogy amit látok – helyesírási szempontból – egy szó-e , vagy több .
Utána jönnek a segédszabályok , a hat - hármas meg a mozgók , meg a többi marhaság .
Ez nincs meg , a legkisebb értelmes izé .
A szó .
A tanító néni cseszte el .
És neves újságíróink derűs önlejáratással demonstrálták , hogy az egész el van cseszve .
De kinek jó ez ?
A szabályzat - és szótárszerkeszt őket meg a kiadókat leszámítva .
A reform - helyesírásiszabályzatról egyébként semmi megbízható hír .
Állítólag menthetetlenül meg fog jelenni .

September Walleye - Transition Time By Ben Leal
Ask any fresh water angler what is one of the most sought after fish for table fare and you ’ll get a resounding response , “ walleye ” .
Sure , crappie and bluegill will come up in that conversation as well , but walleye by far will always be in that list .
The common name , " walleye " , comes from the fact that their eyes , like those of lions , reflect white light .
This " eyeshine " is the result of a light - gathering [... ]

Rainseeker :
Hey everybody , welcome to Dwarf Fortress Talk .
I'm Rainseeker and this is Capntastic .
Capntastic : Hello .
Rainseeker : And Toady One .
Toady : Hey .
Rainseeker : Hey .
Great intro !
Toady :
That 's right , I 'm on top of it .
Capntastic :
Feel the power !
Rainseeker :
We are back with you guys , and we enjoyed your comments and questions over the last month .
We 're going to be doing questions over the second half of the show . [ 1]
First half we 're going to be talking about the underground ; mysteries of the underground : animal man kingdoms , or to be PC animal people kingdoms .
Toady :
They really are the animal peoples , that 's true .
Capntastic :
It 's animal people - smash the patriarchy .
Toady : Yeah , I mean there 's hardly any antmen in an antman kingdom .
They 've got wings too , probably , if they 're like regular ants .
Rainseeker :
That 's a good question ; [ 1a ] are your animal people going to be like animals - behave like animals - or are they going to be like they are know , kind of tribal ?
Toady :
They 're going to be even more advanced really , than they were before .
There was this 2D level of advancement back in the old versions where you had batmen flying on tame giant bats with blowguns that were made out of cave spider legs that had cave spider venom on little darts and stuff , and then we moved into the 3D version and I lost some of my ties to the underground there and so I had to drop all that .
Then they just became these savage , rarely encountered monsters , and it was kind of boring .
Now we 're going back to having the animal peoples ; at least the underground animal peoples like batmen and the snakemen and lizardmen and ratmen and ... is that it ?
Rats bats snakes and lizards ?
Olms , that 's right olmmen .
Capntastic : I think there are slugmen too .
Toady : Yeah , are slugmen in the savage swamps ?
There 's slugmen , tigermen , leechmen and snailmen outside , and there 's going to be more animal peoples outside over time and they 're probably going to use slightly different rules that the underground ones .
The underground ones just because they 're underground are going to be more evil in a sense and at least a little more civilized also with their little weapons and things .
The aboveground ones were supposed to be a bit more at harmony with the overall nature and forest spirits and so on .
Although this is one of those things that has n't quite gelled yet .
In any case for the underground this time around there 's going to be little groups of creatures : they can attack your fortress , you can bump into them in adventure mode with their little crude weapons and they 're probably going to be riding various cave critters and so on .
So it should hearken back a bit to when the underground was more challenging for that reason , for having to deal with ...
I remember back in the 2D version you'd have ratmen pour out of the chasm and snakemen come up out of your wells and stuff ; that was a lot more entertaining than digging into the mountain and finding a really packed river that just has a bunch of garbage in it , which is how it works in the current 3D version ; it 's very tragic .
But now that the underground is world - spanning you have edges of the map , and once you 've got edges of the map to work with then it is n't a problem that you do n't have these infinite bottomless squares that I was able to exploit in the 2D version .
In the 3D version you can't exploit them in the same way - in the 2D version if you had a bottomless pit it would have access to floor squares next to it so you could have a ratman just jump out - but in the 3D version you'd have an actual deep pit with some infinite tiles at the bottom and you can't really have a ratman jump out of those because he'd just fall back , and be dead .
So now we 've got edges of the map for them to walk in on a floor , and once we 've got these floors plus access off map suddenly it 's a lot easier to make legitimate spawning that does n't just feel like ' hey , here 's a random creature ' ; which is something that we do n't ever do .
Right now every creature comes from somewhere ; it comes from some edge or comes from some place .
If you 're suddenly attacked by a monster , even in the current version it means that it made it there , it did n't just pop up ; it made it on an actual path from some edge of the map .
Even if it 's deep inside your fortress it means that you left some hole open for it to get in ; it 's going to be the same in this one except they 're going to have a lot more access points once you break into a cave underground .
Rainseeker : [ 1 b ]
So once you break into a cave , what is their goal going to be ?
Toady :
It depends on what you 've got .
So if we 're talking about animal peoples , the animal peoples do n't really have much more of a brain than they used to , and they 're just bent on causing as much trouble as they can , violently , to your poor critters .
I do n't have a notion of them coming in there as kind of a raiding party , but it 's possible that could happen , like the ratmen , if they 're converted into food and item raiders - which would be kind of fitting their personality , although then they 'd end up a lot like the kobalds - that 's quite possible .
Right now it 's all about just killing as many dwarves as they can before they sneak back off .
But we 'll also have the return of gremlins for instance , if nobody remembers the gremlin it 's because their profile in 3D shrank down to basically nothing whereas in 2D they were a lot more fun , coming in and - if you do n't remember them you should block out your ears for about fifteen seconds - but the gremlin would come in and it would pull levers , jump on pressure plates , release animals from chains and release animals from cages , and it would be hidden , so you would n't notice it until it announced that something horrible happened .
It 's another problem that can sneak in from below that 's a lot of fun to deal with .
Rainseeker :
Do n't monkeys and other primates do that as well ?
Like use levers and stuff ?
Toady :
Not in our game , I do n't know if they can be trained to do that in labs and things ; I 'm sure they can .
But no monster but the gremlin has the mischievous tag on it ; monkeys right now they 'll come and steal your stuff from you , they 'll steal your food , they 'll steal your items and they 'll generally harass you and surround your camp , especially in the beginning when they 're most troublesome , but the gremlin is particularly set up to case mechanical chaos in your fortress .
Rainseeker : Especially if you have a flood mechanism , boy .
Toady : Yeah , there are important levers , and you used to have to care about that ; you used to have to station guards at levers or something like that to prevent trouble , but that just has n't been the case for more than a year now ... or a couple of years , and that 's not good , we need to bring trouble back to the fortress .
Because it was always one of my greatest kicks , looking at the forum and someone was like ' It said someone has pulled a lever !
Then my whole fortress was flooded ! ' or whatever ; and I enjoy that kind of thing , I enjoy it when that happens , because it 's not a bug it 's just something horrible that happened .
Rainseeker : [ 1c ]
So do you enjoy it when people lose tragically ?
Toady : Yeah !
It 's great fun ...
Capntastic : Yeah , that 's the point of the game .
Toady : Yeah , I mean if it 's a bug or something , that 's another story ; that 's always miserable , but if there 's actual trouble that came about through some series of game mechanics and player mistakes or even a random event ; that 's good , I like that , and I do n't think ...
I mean , it 's just part of the idea of the game is losing to further the richness of the world ; we 're only getting started on actually having that matter , but I always want to have that be a centrepiece , so adding more ways for people to die and to have fun losing is going to be a continued theme here , even after this release .
I mean I 'm going to get right to improved sieges after this and that 's going to have ... we talked about those before .
It 's just the same thing again , right ?
From within and from without your fortress is going to be squeezed , I mean you can shut it all off in the init if you just want to have a peaceful time making your mega - constructions and so on , but if you want to play something that feels more like an active universe , or an active fantasy world or whatever , where there 's a bit of torment and a bit of trouble , then there 's going to be plenty , even in this next release , and then continuing on after that even more .
Rainseeker :
So we 're going to have dwarves now saying ' Ach !
You !
Stay away from that lever !'?
Toady :
Well they usually do n't notice before it 's too late , but I think that would surprise gremlin , it might pause a few turns .
Rainseeker : [ 1d ]
Can you have these gremlins be noticed by dwarves if they have skill high enough ?
Toady : Yeah , there 's actually a new skill for that .
Before spotting a sneaking creature was difficult and you pretty much had to have them in the same square .
But now as they 're on duty looking out for people more and as they spot people like this they practice their situational awareness which will increase their range and ability to spot little critters .
Of course the gremlin is pretty good at sneaking around , so having some passive defences like locked doors and so on protecting the levers [ might ] help although it 's quite possible that the gremlin can pick locks .
Oh we have Mr Scamps , [ he ] came down from his tree to visit .
Hopefully he will be peaceful , we 're going with the not locking him out method this time so that he does n't add his meow soundtrack , but that means that he's an ever - present danger lurking in the room .
Capntastic : Jumping up on your levers and such .
Toady : Yeah , jumping up on me and scratching me and so on .
He 's generally friendly but he likes to scratch from behind when you 're sitting in a chair , he likes to go up and just whack you and run away .
Ollieh : ( musical interlude )
Rainseeker : [ 1e ]
So Tarn let 's talk about some about of those titans that are going to be coming in through the underground .
Capntastic : Forgotten beasts .
Toady :
That 's right .
Rainseeker : I like your vomit creature .
Toady :
The vomit wambler .
It 's got a round shell !
Someone called it an oyster .
I personally am of that opinion as well , I do n't like oysters that much .
The thing about a vomit creature is ... you have to wonder who ate the food that made it but it 's kind of a frightening thing .
I 've expressed reservations about it but as of now it is still a creature in the game .
Anything can be composed of vomit , or glass , [ or ] mud ; and it also dips into the raw files and picks out any of your rocks or metals .
Right now it leaves out the super metals like adamantine or whatever , just for the sake of not making the creatures impossible .
But it 's still there .
Rainseeker :
So an alligator without its skin on as opposed to a lobster with iron skin ; those would be different difficulties basically is what you 're saying .
Toady :
Right now it does n't even bother trying to assess the difficulty because it assumes that these megabeasts ; they are classed with the megabeasts that come from underground .
They 're supposed to be the ultimate challenges of the game , so it just tosses them at you .
Especially when we start getting to random creatures that are n't individual megabeasts but are supposed to be a whole species of creatures in a population - which is not going in for this time , but it 's where we 're heading - then we 'll have to probably gauge a little bit if they should be a little deeper or if they should be way out in the savage wilderness or something like that , rather than just wandering the plains with a giant steel twenty foot tall monster .
That kind of makes the place savage by definition ; there should n't be a lot of cities there .
We 're slowly easing our way into this process , but it 's yet another thing to make the underground difficult , or more interesting , as it were .
Rainseeker : [ 1e.1 ] Are these guys going to have histories and stuff ?
Like ' this guy was born under a cursed moon in the year four ' ...
Toady :
They are created at the beginning of world generation , and as we mentioned last time I think , you have the titans aboveground , which are randomly generated , aboveground creatures which are oriented towards a particular region .
So right now as it stands in the code if you 've got a titan in a neutral region it just makes a new big monster that is n't particularly disgusting - it keeps its skin on and so on , it does n't strip its skin off and strip its nose off or whatever and do sick things to it - but it 's just like a large creature ; and then in the evil regions it does more twisted stuff to them ; and then in the good regions right now all it does is avoid making it a carrion animal or something , so it 's not like the big happy vulture of love , but it avoids carrion animal which is sort of a biased thing but I thought it was okay , and scary venomous animals , and it also gives them a sentence that has no meaning in their description that makes them sound like they 're a contemplative or good creature .
The last good titan I looked at was a giant shrimp with hair , it had purple hair or maroon hair , and a long swinging trunk - so it was like a shrimp version of Snuffleupagus or something - and it said that it emenated an aura of giving and kindness , so even more like Snuffy .
Capntastic :
Ah what a cute ...
Toady : Yeah , so it 's just a happy big shrimp that 's lovable and lived in a good ocean or something .
Capntastic :
Does it kill you on sight or are they neutral yet ?
Toady :
There is a thing in the note that says that they should n't kill you on sight .
But right now ...
Capntastic :
It generates an aura of kindness and it will snip your head off ...
Toady :
But right now it kills you .
There 's a note to take that out ...
Capntastic : [ 1e .2 ]
Will they have lairs and habitats , like 'oh , here 's a ring of rocks and this is where it makes its nest ' ?
Toady :
Right now they would all just be stuck in caves like regular megabeasts - the ones on the outside - and we of course want to do more with that , especially for the good ones ; because just putting Snuffleupagus in a cave is kind of cruel , like some kind of cave mammoth .
But right now they 're the same as ever , I 'm not sure if we 'll change that this time or not ; it 's going to be one of those things where it 's time - based and we 're out of time .
But we 're thought about that a little bit , like what kind of homes each of the megabeasts should have .
Even [ with ] the regular stock megabeasts , putting them all in caves is a little weird .
Things like giants ... I guess giants live in caves , but maybe they should n't live in caves .
And those are the above ground ones , I do n't even remember what the original point was but I was also going to talk about the underground ones , but they all get ... there 's the kind of good / evil / normal titans above ground and all of the ones that live underground ... yeah we were talking about histories .
So the ones that live aboveground are treated like regular megabeasts , so if you have an evil or normal titan they will occasionally go on the rampage like they do during regular world generation and so in that way they can build up a history for themselves .
There is n't an explanation of why they 're there , we have n't gotten to mythologies to so on and whether or not gods exist and when the religions popped up and so on .
We do have those religions popping up for the megabeasts but as for the normal pantheons and so on , they do n't have any explanation , and the beasts are the same way .
Right now the forgotten beasts , the reason we named them forgotten beasts is so that we could not give them histories ... they 're forgotten you know ?
They do n't have histories .
But they 're generated at the beginning of world generation and just sit there , so theoretically they could be given histories as well in the future .
Rainseeker :
When you say they sit there , do they generate more of themselves ?
Or are they just like , you 've got a certain number and that 's it .
Toady :
Yeah it 's just like megabeasts , there 's a certain number ...
Like there 's a certain number of titans in the world , there 's a certain number of forgotten beasts .
There 's many more forgotten beasts because you 'll clear them out not super fast , but not give them histories ... they 're forgotten you know ?
They do n't have histories .
But they 're generated at the beginning of world generation and just sit there , so theoretically they could be given histories as well in the future .
Rainseeker : [ 1e .3 ]
When you say they sit there , do they generate more of themselves ?
Or are they just like , you 've got a certain number and that 's it .
Toady :
Yeah it 's just like megabeasts , there 's a certain number ...
Like there 's a certain number of titans in the world , there 's a certain number of forgotten beasts .
There 's many more forgotten beasts because you 'll clear them out not super fast , but you 'll clear them out fairly quickly as you dig fortresses throughout your world and bump into the layers .
There 's a forgotten beast per layer right now .
That 's quite a few layers because the underground is huge so I think a smaller world which is thirty three by thirty three would have a couple dozen forgotten beasts and ...
I can give you the exact number in a second ... twenty seven .
So there 's quite a few , but they do n't really have histories , whereas a world that size would only have , say , a single titan in it because there 's just not a lot of space for them .
And there would also be the standard four megabeasts as well , you have a dragon and that kind of thing .
So there 're plenty of little critters running around and if you 're in the largest worlds there 're hundreds and hundreds of forgotten beasts and dozens of titans and then on top of that is the even more Hidden Fun Stuff which I 'm not really going to spoil .
But the actual Hidden Fun Stuff people talk about - the kind of game ending stuff when you dig down to the bottom - that 's all changed as well ; there are some random elements down there as well in terms of critters .
It should be cool , lots of new little random critters and pain and suffering when you go down below .
Stuff you guys deserve .
Ollieh : ( musical interlude )
Capntastic : [ 1 f ]
Concerning cave entrances like for the megabeasts - I just know this from adventure mode - when you 're sent to go kill a dragon or something you go to the area where the cave is and the entrance is just like a hole in the ground , is that going to be changed eventually / soon ?
Where it 's like it 's actually a cave ?
I mean I 'm sure it 's going to be eventually ...
Toady :
When cliffs come back - when we get a notion of a cliff as an external feature - the problem with cliffs coming back was that you did n't have a way to climb , they were everywhere and you did n't have a way to climb in adventure mode .
But cliffs can start to come back first probably as external features , just like the lava and so on , like lava and bottomless pits used to be these features underground , there are going to be special features above ground where you have a bit more interesting things that it also can have a handle on so it does n't just put them everywhere and at that time you can start to think about a cave entrance that looks more interesting .
The problem was that there 's no real sheer faces to make a cave entrance look more like you 'd expect a cave entrance to look like , so it just has to dig down , right ?
It has to dig in the dirt until it gets a cave entrance for you , which is really disappointing because you go and they all look like these little pits .
So it 's something we want to change but it 's something that has an intermediate step that needs to go in first and I 'm not sure when the aboveground thing ... when we put in things like canyons and mesas and other interesting constructions aboveground .
Ollieh : ( musical interlude )
Rainseeker : [ 1e .4 ]
So there 's no poo creatures either ?
Toady :
It was a close thing !
Because it was literally a decision I had to make , going down this list , because in the Hidden Fun Stuff of course if you get the tentacle demons then you get a layer scattered with various filth on the ground ; and there 's brown filth and yellow filth and so on and it's not clearly stated but it's a material that I had to put in properties for right ?
So there 's these hard - coded filth materials , and when I was going down the list , you know ' Do I want creatures made out of mud ?
Do I want creatures made out of vomit ?
Do I want creatures made out of glass ? ' , there 's all these hard - coded materials , and I was just like ' Yeah , yeah , yeah ... No ... No ... ' on the filth .
But there are creatures made out of the grime , and the grime material is the material that collects on your body slowly over time , and it's also the material that 's used in swamp water , so there 's this ...
I just needed this material called ' grime ' for these miscellaneous purposes , it 's just crap , just stuff that collects over time and when a creature is made out of that it just says ' composed of grime and filth ' .
So if you want to call that ' poo ' even though it 's not it 's possible for you to extend your imagination .
Rainseeker :
What about an infection ?
Can you get infection material ?
Toady :
There 's no actual microbes at this time , the grime is the closest you can get to that because as your grime increases on your body - it slowly collects over time , and you can wash it off most of the way with water and the rest of the way if you use soap - and the grime material highly increases your chance of infection ; it 's just the filth and so on that collects on your body .
That 's the closest we 've got to actually being ...
I mean like having a giant blob of bacteria or something that 's currently supported although you could have a blob of like slime that could use the slime tissue template , and in the same way you could have generic blobs of muscles or whatever ; I do n't think I have that but these are possibilities for exploration .
Capntastic :
So you could have something made of bone , just describe it as ' something made of bone ' .
Toady : Yeah , using the templates , that 's right .
You can use bone , skin , fat ... a big fat blob with a tail or something .
It 's always interesting when it puts things like shells on the blob ; it 's always cute when it 's like ' this is a big mass of coal ... and it has a tail !'
Sounds very cute having these little ...
I mean they 're all huge monsters , but they can have little tails , or little wings .
Rainseeker :
It 's here to avenge the death of thousands and thousands of little pieces of coal .
Toady :
That 's right , that 's right ; and the trees and so on that were burned to make them ; so it 's like a big elf ... big , dirty elf .
Rainseeker :
Well elves are dirty too , right ?
They do n't use soap .
Capntastic :
Are they magically immune to grime ?
Toady :
Right now they would just get kind of nasty ; they can wash themselves with water to get their grime level from seven to three , but to get down below they'd have to break all of their principles and so on , unless they can find some kind of material that has the soap tags on it that is n't actually made out of an animal .
Rainseeker : Can you use sand , maybe ?
I mean that 's what we used to do .
Toady :
You can't do it now , but you 're welcome to explore these kinds of things .
I do n't know much about historical uses of sand like that , all I can see is the animals like elephants dusting themselves and so on ; taking baths like that .
I do n't know much about the mechanics there .
Because they seem to always come out dirtier , maybe it 's useful for them ... of course it is , but I do n't know quite what 's going on there .
Ollieh : ( musical interlude )
Toady :
Oh god I 've got a little baby cat in my lap now .
He 's wandered over here , he jumped down from the cat tree and wandered over to my lap , he managed to put the mouse on the ground .
Rainseeker : [ 2a ]
So , Tarn , what 's going to happen with the aquifer layer , with the new underground caves ?
Toady :
So , the aquifer 's still there , much to people 's eternal disgust .
I have n't quite knocked the geology out of me yet to get rid of the aquifer .
But it 's just like the regular features in the current version - you 've got bottomless pits and so on in the currently released version - and those , at least if things are working correctly , wo n't interact with the aquifer when you start the map , it puts this dead zone around them so that the aquifer does n't immediately start pouring into those and mess up your CPU and so on .
In the same way if you 've got an aquifer running through the soil layers on a map when you start it will be separated from the underground caverns .
Now that still means that you'd have a really hard time punching through it and once you punch through it you 'd probably start flooding the underground , but the flooding of the underground ... if it lands in some water and so on - and there 's quite a bit of water underground - it should n't flood the entire cavern .
And because there are things like underground lakes and so on ...
Flooding the underground 's always going to be this lingering or looming threat anyway , aquifer or not .
I 'm not quite sure how that should be handled in the end , because people definitely want to have water underground , things like lakes and rivers and so on but as you can always channel that down and flood the deeper areas there 's sort of a problem with that , in terms of thinking attacking from below and so on .
We 've thought a bit of it through in terms of the really deep underground stuff being able to work around that a bit , and with the siege improvements we 'll probably be working with that a bit more but right now it 's still going to be a problem but not really more of a problem than it already was .
Capntastic : [ 2 b ]
What do you think is the most exciting thing about the new underground stuff ?
Toady :
For me , I kind of like exploration and things , I like that a lot , and I think just the fact that - especially if you have n't played the game before , but even if you have - when you break into the underground , the fact that it 's not like it was before where it suddenly breaks out and reveals the entire area so you 'd suddenly see the entire cave when you break into a hidden area .
Now that there 's this - I guess you 'd call it a fog of war thing , it 's kind of like that - it 's just this area around each dwarf as it walks that 's ... it 's not really CPU expensive , so it 's not giving a perfectly accurate picture ... but it 's just when a dwarf gets near to the boundary of the unexplored area it explores a bit more of it for you ; but just being able to explore out through the cave like that 's pretty exciting for me , especially as we add more and more underground features so you can actually find a new place and it's something that you 're bumping into and then the monsters will be able to flow in from places you can't see , through the boundaries of the explored area and so on .
I think that 's all going to be really cool .
I really like the random creatures too , that 's another thing that 's really a lot of fun for me to work on .
But those kind of things I guess .
Rainseeker : I 'm trying to come up with a strategy to actually be able to go down and get minerals without being destroyed .
Capntastic : Use magma and traps .
Toady : Traps are still cheap , it 's true .
There 's always going to be these problems , like if you 're digging down and you break into a new area , if your first inclination is to go in with wall - building dwarves and just wall it off , that might be safe but it's a problem from an overall design perspective if when you hit the exciting areas the first reaction is just like ' AAARGH !' and just bottling yourself up and so in , instead of a risk vs reward system ; there should be reasons to go in there and right now we 've got things like mushroom forests and so on which would be easily accessible wood , if you 're going to attacked by ...
Capntastic : [ inaudible ]
Toady :
That 's the kind of thing where we 're eventually going to need to bring in some more of this fantasy crap , right like utter crap , like ' here 's a big buried underground temple with some ghosts and stuff and it's got golden swords and giant chests ' and it 's just there .
It would be preferable to have reasons for it to be there but there are plenty of reasons you can come up with , right ?
So it 's not like it 's breaking the fact that we have this holistic world thing going on if we throw in some crap , as long as the crap has a reason to be there ; and it would make it more fun to dig underground .
But right now it still has a sort of naturalistic type of feel to it where there 's ... it 's like new biomes and things ; there 's not a lot of super - weird - unless you count a blob of vomit with a shell as super weird , which you probably should - there 's not a lot of super - weird stuff down there in terms of forgotten civilised stuff .
We 're not against that by any means , it 's just harder to add .
( aside to Scamps )
What are you doing Mr. Cat ? ( singing ) Mr. Cat likes to chew on the finger , Mr. Cat 's got claws and teeth .
( end aside )
Rainseeker : [ 2 c ] I do n't know if this has been answered yet , I 've probably asked it and I 'm sure other people have asked it ; but will an adventurer be able to go into the underground realms and rampage across the underworld ?
Toady : Adventure mode gets shafted all the time , right ?
Adventure mode just gets worse and worse , basically .
Adventure mode 's basically unplayable now .
It was slightly playable in 2D I think ; more so than it is now .
So we 're going to take some time - next month most likely - to rectify that situation somewhat .
The idea is that the caves - whereas a cave used to be an annoying place disconnected from everything else that was just like winding tunnels where you try and search for a giant and not find it , that used to be what a cave was ...
Capntastic :
And you 'd get messages of it crushing your friend 's heads ...
Toady : Yeah , it 's really bad .
While it still will probably be difficult to find individuals , the caves will at least more than likely connect into the underground layers , and when they connect down into the underground layers then that gives your adventurer more to do down there - Aargh !
That was the cat , by the way , causing trouble - especially if the new entities associated to the animal peoples are realised with little things .
Now we 're kind of in between on deciding the properties of the animal people entities in terms of , you know ' Do they rove around with camps ?
Do they have permanent settlements ? '
So mostly they 'll be attacking you from the edge when you 're in dwarf mode ; in adventure mode you might find a few more things that we throw in around and about down there .
That should add some more for you to do ; without the amazing forgotten temples and so on there 's not going to be a lot of looting for adventurers to do .
But it leaves something to do down there , and also we 're going to tie caves into the actual Super Hidden Fun Stuff in terms of allowing an adventurer to go down and encounter troubles that are beyond their ability to handle ; with some interesting fun and good times ... and restarting your game after you get wasted .
Rainseeker :
So the way I understand it is that you can dig down into a cavern ; [ 2d ] how many tiles is it below the initial surface ?
Is there a set , or is it [ a ] random number ?
Toady :
It 's a bit randomised ; I think it 's in general - after you account for the soil layers and so on - below the soil you might have two to five ; something like that .
So you can pretty much count on , if you want to make a shallow fort , you can count on being able to do that without a lot of difficulty if there 's no caves around .
Once you dig below that then as the settings are currently set , and what will probably be the default setting , is [ that ] you 'll pretty much always hit something after that .
You 'll have room to build your fort but you 'll have to explore the caves around it a little bit to see which directions you might have to turn and so on .
Whereas if you 're more of an architect type of player that does n't really want to deal with that crap messing up your perfect designs and so on , I know a lot of people are like that ; there will be at least generation parameters available to - not necessarily , I mean you can shut it off entirely if you want , if you just want to have nothing down there and just dig around and so on that 's fine - or you can just dial it back a bit so there 's not huge huge open caverns everywhere and so on .
I think it 's good for the default settings to have a lot of encounters with the underground because it just makes the game more lively , and I think lively default settings are good .
Rainseeker : [ 2e ]
And are there multiple layers of undergrounds ?
Toady : Right now it 's set so that you 've always got three ; you 've got a couple [ of ] regular layers and then you 've got down at the bottom you can pretty much be assured to find some magma and stuff down there .
You do n't have to fish around for the perfect magma map in general , or always start out next to a volcano .
The benefit of starting out next to a volcano would be immediate access to magma , instead of magma that you have to ward off three layers worth of underground creatures to set up a single workshop .
Rainseeker :
That 's awesome , though .
Toady :
Yeah there should be cool stuff down there , and even more of course as you get down at the very bottom .
Rainseeker : I would n't mind - I 'm kind of a conservative player myself - but I would n't mind dealing with first levels of critters attacking me if it progressed like the top being easier then the middle being a little harder and the bottom being the hardest .
Toady :
Yeah there 's going to be some progression , which is a concept we lost almost entirely in the move from 2 to 3D .
It 'll be coming back , a notion of progression .
It should n't be entirely artificial because there are some in - universe reasons for going down to [ the ] bad , which people are more or less aware of right ?
[ That ] there 's bad things down there ?
And that that has a corrupting influence on your animal peoples and so on .
So you 'll find worse things down ...
So you can kind of control your level of threat ; it 's not going to quite as stark as it was in 2D where you knew that you had ; ' this vertical strip , I can dig out my fortress ; this vertical strip has the river ; this vertical strip , I can dig out my fortress ; this vertical strip has the chasm ; this vertical strip , I can dig out my fortress ; this vertical strip has the lava ' and so on .
It 's not quite that straightforward but there is a feeling of ... you 'll kind of get a feel for the places where you can dig out your fortress I think .
You 'll have a notion of that ; it'll occasionally be interrupted but mostly okay .
Which is probably how it should be , you should kind of be able to spread out how you want , but occasionally have little hiccups in your plan .
The overall variability of the features right now is basically ' How mushroom jungle -y is it ?
How wet is it ? ' and I 'm going to be throwing in some more features like stalactite -y [ and ] stalagmite -y curtain -y type things down there to make the caves seem a little more cave like .
Overall I think the proponents of the underground diversity thread where they went crazy with all kinds of different things that you might expect in a fantasy underground ... overall it 's not going to be a very heavy coverage of that , there 's just not enough time to do that yet but we 're going to be slowly adding more and more things over time ; it 's not like this is the end of the story by any means .
Rainseeker : Okay so let 's take a break , we 'll play some cleansing music here and we will come back with some questions from the forums .
Mwahahaha ...
Unattrib. : ( musical interlude )
Capntastic : Welcome back to Dwarf [ Fortress ]
Talk .
We 're going to answer some of the community 's most burning questions .
First up , Darkerson [ 3 ]
' What are the specs of your own computer ( Operating system , RAM , CPU etcetera ) and how well does the game perform for yourself ?
Toady :
Eh it performs alright .
I 'm on a quad - core - I do n't remember if it 's like 3 [ Gigahertz ] or something - I got it recently , it was $ 400 .
It 's pretty good , it 's got one of those ... what are the crappy video cards called ?
What is it when you 're ... you 've got a ...
Rainseeker : Integrated ?
Toady : Integrated .
I have an integrated video card so it 's not ...
Actually that seems to be a good thing because I 'm not running into the problems that people have when they have good video cards and the game suddenly slows down to ten frames per second because the OpenGL is outmoded .
So I do n't need to use the 40d16 or whatever number we 're up to releases to get the full frame rate ... so I managed luckily to get a computer that actually runs Dwarf Fortress pretty well .
When you get up to a lot of dwarves of course I have the same speed problems that other people do when you have two hundred dwarves running around and so on .
Which is good because that means that I have a chance of speeding those up and seeing that it 's happening and so on , the same way as everyone else does .
But it 's alright , I do n't have a totally crummy computer anyway , it works .
Rainseeker : Fieari asks : [ 4 ]
' You 've previously stated that all the animal men have at the very least friendly diplomatic relations with each other , if not actually being the same nation .
What is the relation of the underground animal men to the aboveground animal men ? '
Toady :
We 're still working some of the political considerations of the animal peoples out .
We always ... Zach and I are always : ' let 's talk about this more ' and then we fail to talk about it that day but right now the idea is that the underground animal peoples , being that they 're [...] closer to the bad things that are down there , are a bit twisted and do n't relate well with the aboveground animal people , and they 're basically hostile .
The aboveground animal people have that kind of tense relationship with the elves and they work well with each other to some extent although we 've had this back and forth when we 're discussing the stories about ...
The key question here - what almost all of it comes down to is - does a tigerman eat a deerman ?
I think the latest answer to that question was that ' Yeah , yeah a tigerman probably eats a deerman ' except in the situation where you have the elves working as a glue between the animal peoples in areas with forest spirits and so on , there might be less predation going on with the actual animal peoples .
But left to their own devices they 'll act more or less like the animals that they are humanoid versions of , except they 're more intelligent .
Down below , as I think we mentioned before , they 're going to be more civilised in a sense , but they 're also all at war with each other and with your guys .
I mean war in the sense of just mindless violence right now .
Rainseeker :
So if you see two different groups coming on the screen at the same time , they 're going to be fighting each other ?
Toady :
It 's quite possible , it 's quite possible that that 'll happen .
I have yet to finalise the group variables for them , but this would be the idea , yeah .
Capntastic : Granite 26 wants to know ; [ 5 ]
' How do you see the balance of simulation versus game play playing out in adventure mode ?
Specifically , what sorts of ' cheats ' to make things more interesting are there going to be ? '
If you remember there was a thread and he suggested that the game should make events happen to fit the player a bit more , like if you 're a warrior then you go into a town and suddenly a bandit will rob someone so you get hooked into the plot that way ...
Toady : Overall my gut instinct is to avoid any kind of plot aspect like that where a plot is generated then somehow based on your character , but your character should also be able to integrate in the world and then they should be able to react to who you are .
That 's not something that ... if that sounds difficult or pie in the sky it 's really not ; just if you 've affiliated yourself with certain groups or you 've killed certain people on the road , they should respond to you in that way .
Whatever the groups are going to be doing ... with the improved sieges coming up we 're going to have to start working on AI for individual leaders and so on , and whatever they do on behalf of their groups or for themselves , those are the kind of actions that you'd be getting tied into , and that is a plot .
I do n't think simulation and game play are separate aspects ; whatever game play is I 'm not really sure .
As far as artificially creating something , it should n't be necessary when things are working well , once we have the entities as actors .
Hopefully , that 's the idea , we 're putting everything on that idea right now , if it 's a failure , we 'll have to adjust .
But right now I feel pretty good about where it 's going to end up , even though adventure mode is admittedly not fun to play right now .
I think we have to give that a chance before I think about scripting strange encounters and things like that just for game play purposes or whatever .
Now at the same time there 's the notion of your starting situation , and the starting situation is ... it 's difficult to simulate that depending on how the timeline works and so on , so there might be ... certainly at first , that might be a bit more canned .
Right now it 's just like ' you 're in the town ' or whatever , there 's no history for your character at all , and if we change that it 's going to be difficult to simulate , so it 'll probably be a bit hacked up , even if it 's just like ' you 're starting because you 've been tossed in a cave and sacrificed ' .
If it 's something like that , that 's fine with me , as long as it does n't randomly happen later then I still feel good about what we 've got .
That 's the idea , anyway .
Rainseeker : I have a question from guyinthecrowd : [ 6 ]
' Will the environment a dwarf is raised in affect what they like / dislike ?
For example , if a dwarf is unhappy as a child being raised in a fortress made entirely out of mined Orthoclase , will said dwarf dislike Orthoclase as an adult ?
Or as a counter - example , if a dwarf is happy whilst being raised in a room of Kaolinite , will said dwarf like Kaolinite when they become an adult ? '
Toady :
That 's kind of a specific example , and I guess that 's what it comes down to though .
We 've had discussions in the past about how the babies pop out right now with fully formed personalities and likes and dislikes and so on , and how that 's silly .
So then you 've got to answer some nature versus nurture questions yourself and then decide what is it that influences these things ?
I have n't thought about that deeply what 's going in the game and what 's not for that , it 's just recognized as one of those third - tier problems that eventually needs to be dealt with in terms of future development .
So I do n't have specific opinions on the things put there , but certainly children should acknowledge their parents ' professions and if they 're given toys as a child that should be able to influence them and so on .
It 's not difficult to do any specific example of that , especially if you add things like kids playing with toys which obviously has to happen sometime - we have these toys that no - one ever uses ; right now they 're just trade goods which is kind of silly , the same thing for musical instruments - and once they can use those things then adding a specific influence there is something that 's pretty trivial .
You just need to have enough of those things that the process seems natural .
Like I said it 's not a high priority thing , but it 's something we'd like to do , vaguely along those lines .
Capntastic : Aqizzar asks : [ 7 ]
' Considering other changes in the ways bodies work , will creatures age and will that affect their abilities ?'
Toady : Creatures age now in a few ways .
They age numerically and then they die of old age if they in fact have an old age parameter , and the first thing we 've done that is n't just a number - or a single number representative of their age , anyway - is wrinkles , hair greying , and stuff like that .
As for actual , say your attributes fading and eventually accumulating illnesses and so on , I think that stuff should definitely go in the game .
I think that adds a lot of - aside from just being a simulation , when you look at the storylines of a bunch of fantasies and myths and so on , having an infirm character or a character suffering some kind of disability or so on as they get older - it can add a lot to a story .
So I think that kind of thing , just putting it in the game would lead to a lot of positive aspects in terms of storytelling and so on , so I 'm definitely all for that .
It 's just a matter of doing it , I do n't think it 's that difficult to do .
When we get to things like diseases and so on we have fair game for even getting rid of ...
Right now there 's just this silly ' you die at this time ' , it 's like every character , say the dwarf - I do n't remember what the numbers are anymore - but for a human I think it 's from sixty to one [ hundred ] twenty in the game , so it just picks a number right at the beginning of the game when the creature is created , it says ' you 're going to live to be eighty seven years old ' and it looks at another creature and is like ' you 're going to be sixty three when you die ' and so you 've got this death clock hanging over each of the characters , and it would be the ideal situation I think is to just rather use our overall health variables , and maybe their previous injuries and all that kind of thing - whatever factors figure in to diseases - and use that to come up with a more realistic aging system to that they ...
In a sense it 's going to be kind of depressing if you have a fortress that runs for a long time and you can see these diseases accumulating and so on , but I think it would be a good change overall and we 're definitely going to do that sometime .
Rainseeker : [ 7 a ]
How old do elves live right now ?
Toady : Right now they are immortal .
'e 'mmortal ? ' Im ' ' Im ' ... ' e ' ... 'e 'mmortal .
I do n't know how to pronounce stuff .
Rainseeker :
Does that mean that we 're going to have tons of populations of elves ?
Toady :
Well that 's kind of what happens .
People talk about the elf zerg rush ; they do become populated .
It 's a question you have to answer anytime you ...
People - including ourselves - flippantly include immortal races in their fantasy settings and a lot of questions go unanswered ; like ' How often do they breed ? '
' What does it mean when you have someone working really hard at learning a skill for a thousand years ? '
Those quests generally just get ignored , and there 's nothing that special about immortal races .
Or they answer those questions but only in really specific ways for specific parts of the story or whatever .
But with a larger simulation then all of the side effects also kind of rear their heads , like we 've got these giant elven armies making the forests not safe to be near .
So right now just the fact that the elves do n't expand outside of their forests is the thing that saves you from having a world full of elves .
Goblins are the same way , goblins are also immortal .
We 're going to keep them that way , though , and we 're just going to try and make the necessary adjustments ; they 'll either be cultural adjustments or physiological adjustments so that the immortality can stay . [...]
We want to have immortal races because it raises a lot of interesting questions and plot points and so on ; it 's good to have them in there I think .
Right now they have n't been answered to satisfaction because the elves are breeding machines , they 're just kind of locked in their forests .
The forests are very dangerous to get near if you 've seen those world generation battles where it's like four thousand versus one hundred , as the elves have just been stocking up .
There are artificial caps right now on populations , that 's just supposed to simulate food or something but it's not wholly satisfactory , especially when we get to the pre-caravan arc resources stuff where it 's actually tracking more closely how much food there is and so on ; the problems are only going to escalate I think .
Although it could just end up self - correcting as well , which would be nice .
Ollieh : ( musical interlude )
Rainseeker : Okay , XSI asks : [ 8 ]
' Dwarven strongholds seem to have tunnels between them , would it be possible to eventually make one of those in fortress mode ; probably useful to get migrants and dwarf caravans while being sieged ?'
Toady : I think there 's a dev item on that , I do n't know if it was called ' deep outposts ' or something like that , and I think it originally sprang forth from a suggestion someone posted so there 's probably a few posts on it as well .
We 're definitely for that ; the issues that arise are the same issues that always arise when you have off - site sites .
How do you connect it up ?
How does digging commence off map ?
And the same thing would go to like building an aboveground wall , or aboveground roads and that kind of thing ; how do you build that site when your view is restricted to a single fortress ?
But I think those questions are just a matter of making a good decision about it ; I do n't think that they 're super hard and we 're definitely planning to do that , especially because those tunnels are there .
The fact that the tunnels are there is one of those things that kind of demands satisfaction in terms of actually being able to do it yourself or getting rid of them .
So it 's just a matter of ...
Right now you can't designate digging on the edge of your map , and if you can designate ' I want to dig there , I want to dig a tunnel ' then that 's got to be some kind of special requirement or you have to have say five or six miners leave the map and do that digging for you and it 's going to tie into a number of things .
It 's going to tie into having little - like when you become a capital - having outposts outside of your map and sending armies off the map , having those larger populations that we talked about last time ; all of it ties in again to that kind of thing so I imagine those questions will start to be answered around that time .
Capntastic : Flaming Dorf and PMantix ask : [ 9 ]
' How do you motivate yourself to get working ?'
Toady : I like what I 'm doing so it 's mostly just something that I want to do , but sometimes when I 'm tired or so on ... coffee , now .
I did n't used to be on caffeine , I 'm trying to get off it again , but yeah ... drinking coffee , and [ eating ] sugary foods and so on .
It 's not a matter of ... I always want to work on the game , it 's always something I want to do , but just if I 'm in a physically bad state I further mess up my body for short term gain to drive myself on a little bit harder .
But just having a project that you really want to work on is enough motivation ; if you have something that you really want to do then , at least for me , getting up and working on it for a long time is something that 's kind of a joy .
I like the fact that I get to work on it now and , mostly it 's just intermittent grumpiness and so on , and distractions like forum stuff or certain emails ; that kind of thing that pull [s ] me away from it .
But otherwise it 's kind of my default activity , is to be working on the game now .
Rainseeker : Cool .
I have a question from Zantan , he says : [ 10 ]
'
In the first talk you mentioned that sometime soon the interactions between different religious , family , and guild factions would become important to game play .
Could you give more specifics on the game effects of these interactions and how you would be able to affect them , other than managing room quality and changing the happiness of various people ?'
Toady :
If we 're talking about - just for specific examples - say in dwarf mode you have - because it would apply to all of the modes , but if you 're talking about a fortress here - and you have say , a miner 's guild and a couple competing religions and a few other things you could imagine I guess that tie into that - your family groups and so on - then in terms of management right now the powers you have are the official powers of your dwarf site .
So right now I think the mayor makes decisions when he meets with people - or at least it was this way in the 2D version - when people are meeting with him , it might happen still to some extent .
For instance he'd get a bunch of requests from the miner 's guild to go ahead and add more mining jobs and he might mandate something ; mandate a certain number of jobs be completed , or change the wages , that kind of thing .
Those sorts of actions , because they do have a really official air about them , putting more of those actions in the control of the player I think just kind of ...
I mean it 's sort of a legislative matter but it's also taking requests from those groups .
What do they want and what are they fighting about ?
If it 's something that 's related to the economy like with guilds I think it 's a lot more manageable .
If you have two religions competing with each other then digging out the temples and things they request would make them happy , keeping those things roughly the same size , [ and ] proportional to the populations and so on might be what 's required there .
I do n't think it would descend into total randomness and misery except in those ...
I guess sometimes it always does , but it should be manageable .
So what you 're going to need is more control through the official actions of the nobles of the site - nobles / appointments / elected officials , whatever you want to call them ; nobles is the shorthand because they used to all be nobles - I think that 's going to be the main method of player control over the situation , and as well as just being able to read their requests and see what kind of strife is going on ; there should be more feedback if you 've got something that 's really messing with you like that .
But other than that I think when certain conflicts break out in the fortress then ...
It 's almost like one of those prison games where you have to put them on lockdown or something ; I 'm not quite sure how you 'd deal with an actual something that erupted if it's a little too late , if you just have to keep them in different burrows or something .
It reminds me of those things where you have to keep the prison gangs in different cell blocks or whatever ... different parts of the main yard .
I wonder ... it 's not something that 's fully thought out obviously , it should be interesting .
Rainseeker : [ 11 ]
What board games do you like ?
Toady :
What board games do I like ?
I have n't played a board game for a long time pretty much , except for chess and go I guess .
I stopped playing a couple of years ago , and before that it was just stuff [ I ] played as a kid .
I remember someone asked me about German board games a couple of months ago and I 've seen a German board game played - I think at our get together ... were they playing one of those ?
Like Settlers [ of Catan ] or something ?
- but I 've never played one , so not a whole lot of experience there , especially with the new stuff that really seems to be taking off .
Rainseeker :
Well thank you Tarn for joining us and for programming Dwarf Fortress , we all appreciate it , and hey everybody !
While you are listening and if you could , why do n't you throw a couple of dollars in the tip jar over on his site there .
Capntastic :
Do it , it 'll make you feel good .
Toady :
That 's right .
Capntastic : Give him all of your money !
Rainseeker :
Or at least a couple of bucks , you know , enough to buy a latte or something .
Toady :
That 's right , we 'll feed the cat .
The cat needs a lot , he 's a growing kitty .
Rainseeker :
So everybody that 's for joining us on our third podcast on Dwarf Fortress Talk .
This is Rainseeker and I 've been joined by Capntastic and Tarn Adams , and Tarn has agreed to read the credits , but Tarn you have to read the credits ... while talking to your cat .
Toady : Alright ... Mr. Scamps , where 'd you go ?
See if he leaves ... no there he is !
He 's up on the tree .
It 's hard to find him now , he 's always ... the tree is about as tall as I am , so he 's way up there .
Alright Mr. Scamps .
So Mr. Scamps this time this time the music , as usual , was brought to us by the lovely and talented Ollieh ... someone will have to tell me how to pronounce that ... and the transcript will be transcribed by the talented and hardworking mallocks , and of course this is Scamps .
Is he sleeping ?
He 's not even listening .
( sighs )
I try really hard to teach this animal to do the right thing , but he never pays attention .
Constant violence !
And I think it might be time for Ritalin .
Scamps .
Scamps !
No he 's not even paying attention .

The flag was flown from one of Nelson 's warships , HMS Spartiate
The only surviving union jack from the Battle of Trafalgar has sold for more than 20 times its predicted price .
The flag , which was flown from one of Nelson 's warships during the battle off the Spanish coast in 1805 , was only expected to fetch up to £ 15,000 .
But it sold at auction for £ 384,000 , including a buyer 's premium of 20 % , at the Trafalgar Day Sale in London .
The flag was presented by the crew of HMS Spartiate to Fife - born Lieutenant James Clephan after the conflict .
Charles Miller , of auction house Charles Miller Ltd , said he was " lost for words " by the amount the flag went for .
He said : " I was absolutely delighted with the result .
This demonstrates that this is a unique and charismatic artefact linked to the greatest naval battle of all time and Nelson 's greatest triumph which took place 204 years ago today . "
The lot was bought by a bidder on a telephone at the auction .
Lt Clephan , who later went on to command his own ship , was one of the few men to have risen through the ranks and was highly admired by his crew .
The presentation of the flag by the 540 - strong crew was considered to be one of the highest honours to be bestowed upon an officer by his men .
The flag , measuring 7ft 4in by 11ft 7in , is made of 31 panels sewn together by the crew on board the ship .
It also bears a number of " battle scars " - holes caused by shot and shell splinter damage sustained during the conflict .
The union jack was put up for sale by one of the sailor 's descendants , living in Australia .
It was treasured by his family , who kept it in a drawer to preserve it .
Mr Clephan , from Scoonie near Leven in Fife , spent his early years as an apprentice weaver and went on to join the Merchant Navy .
He was forced to join the Royal Navy in July 1794 at the age of 26 and rose to the ranks of midshipman and lieutenant .
At the Battle of Trafalgar , his courage was recognised and he was promoted to first lieutenant immediately afterwards .
In 1811 , Mr Clephan was promoted to commander .
He retired in 1840 with the rank of captain and lived in Edinburgh for 11 years until his death at the age of 83 .

DUBAI / LONDON ( Reuters ) - The United Arab Emirates ’ huge nuclear power programme could trigger a race among Gulf Arab states for limited atomic energy resources to meet surging electricity demand and free up more oil for export .
The UAE hopes to open the first nuclear reactor in the Gulf Arab countries in 2017 as part of a $ 40 - billion nuclear programme that would compete for engineers and nuclear equipment for decades and set a precedent for cash - rich members of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) .
A contract to build reactors is expected to be awarded soon .
“ The major impact will be felt if other countries in the region , particularly Saudi Arabia , follow the UAE model and adopt nuclear power , ” Eurasia Group analysts said in an email .
“ We believe this will happen and that the GCC represents a very positive growth market for nuclear power -- if not as big a market as China and India . ”
Rising concern over climate - warming gases produced from burning oil , gas and coal , combined with volatile fuel prices , has sparked renewed interest in nuclear power across the globe .
The six members of the GCC -- Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , the UAE , Qatar and Oman -- have shown interest in nuclear power to meet soaring domestic demand for electricity and free more oil and gas for export .
But decades of stagnant growth have limited the nuclear energy industry ’s capacity to meet the resurgent demand for expertise and equipment , so competition between countries with big nuclear ambitions could be fierce .
“ Your first generation of nuclear professionals is getting a bit grey , ” Ian Hore - Lacy of the World Nuclear Association said .
“ Of course there is always competition for resources and for manufacturing capacity but it ’s by no means an impossible ask . ”
SECURITY CONCERNS
Iran ’s refusal to halt uranium enrichment , despite agreeing to buy the fuel needed for its new power plant from Russia , has made major powers suspicious of Tehran ’s nuclear programme .
The UAE has already pledged to buy the nuclear fuel it would need to allay Western concerns about uranium enrichment facilities being used for making weapons - grade material .
“ So long as there is sufficent transparency and monitoring and the fuel is imported , I think the UAE ’s plan is more likely to spur a regional race for nuclear energy than for nuclear weapons , ” said Daniel Freifeld , a fellow for energy at New York University ’s Center of Law and Security .
International backing for the UAE ’s plan , especially from strategic ally the United States , would provide a counterpoint to Tehran ’s programme .
Western powers could point to the UAE , across the Strait of Hormuz from Iran , as an example of how to pursue nuclear power without being seen as a military threat .
“ The UAE is trying to present itself as a model for how Middle East countries can develop nuclear power -- in contrast to Iran , ” the Eurasia analysts said .
Some of the UAE ’s neighbours have suffered attacks from Islamic militants , so concerns over safeguarding nuclear plants will probably linger , despite industry assurances .
“ Nuclear plants are a very difficult terrorist target , to put it mildly , and in respect to proliferation concerns I think those will be fully addressed , ” the World Nuclear Association ’s Hore - Lacy said .
“ A country which is simply equipped with light water reactors can’t really misuse that in any way . ”
CASH
Abu Dhabi appears to have both the cash and motivation to move ahead with the $ 40 billion programme .
The UAE , the world ’s third largest oil exporter , expects to see its power demand grow from around 15,000 megawatts in 2008 to 40,000 MW in 2020 as oil wealth drives population and economic growth in a region where round the clock air - conditioning is seen as a necessity .
But gas supplies could only supply 20,000 - 25,000 MW , leaving a big gap to fill .
“ The bottom line is that without nuclear , sufficient fuel supply may not be available to the power sector , and this will hinder economic development , ” said Jennifer Evans , energy markets analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie .
Burning oil in power plants would reduce the UAE ’s oil exports , on which it depends for nearly 80 percent of state revenues .
“ Heavy future reliance on liquids ( for power ) would entail extremely high economic costs , ” the UAE said in a nuclear policy paper last year .
The UAE is expected to build three or four reactors in the first stage , a boon to both local and international firms that would look to supply and build them .
The plants would start up one at a time around 18 months apart , depending on power demand .
Any excess power could be fed into a grid linking the GCC .
The three consortia vying for the contract are the French group of Areva , GdF Suez and Total , a South Korean trio of Korea Electric Power Corp. , Hyundai Engineering and Construction and Samsung C&T Corporation , and a joint bid by U.S. - based General Electric and Japan ’s Hitachi .
Underwater archaeologists said Monday that they have found a virtual time capsule of life during Canada ’s Klondike Gold Rush : a sunken Yukon River stern - wheeler so well - preserved that researchers can document the last minutes of the five - man crew as well as their life aboard the primitive cargo - hauler .
The door of the steam boiler on the A.J. Goddard was open , and slightly charred wood found inside suggested the crew was trying to build up a head of steam , perhaps to break loose from an ice jam .
An ax remained on the deck after one crew member hefted it to chop the rope used to tow a barge , a sign of their frantic attempts to escape the ice floe .
Three men perished in the 1901 sinking , according to news reports at the time , and two were found clinging to the ship ’s wheelhouse in the icy lake .
The bodies of Capt . Charles McDonald , cook Fay Ransome and fireman John Thompson washed ashore .
Engineer Stockfedt and crewman Snyder , whose first names are unknown , were rescued by a trapper camping nearby .
The Goddard , which had been disassembled and laboriously carried over mountain passes to be reassembled on the shores of Lake Bennett at the headwaters of the Yukon , foundered in a winter storm , sinking in 40 feet of frigid water in Lake Laberge , about 40 miles north of Whitehorse .
Its precise location had been a mystery until it was discovered last summer in a survey of gold - rush - era wrecks in the lake .
The ship “ is literally a frozen moment in time , ” with nearly everything on board in the same place it was when the ship went down , said underwater archaeologist James P. Delgado , president of Texas A&M University ’s Institute of Nautical Archaeology and a member of the team that found the Goddard .
“ The Goddard is a very important reminder that ordinary people get caught up in events that are bigger than themselves .
It ’s a rare window into the past where we can truly connect with these five guys , the reality of the gold rush and trying to make a go of it in difficult times , ” Delgado said .
The Klondike Gold Rush was triggered in 1896 when members of the Tagish First Nations tribe discovered gold in the Yukon River valley in northern Canada .
The remote location made it difficult for potential miners to reach the site .
The most common route was to travel by rail to the Alaskan towns of Skagway and Dyea , cross the Coast Mountains through the Chilkoot Pass to Lake Bennett on foot , then build a craft to journey more than 500 miles downstream to Dawson City , near the gold strike .
Ultimately , about 30,000 miners made it -- out of about 100,000 who started the trip -- and an estimated 12.5 million ounces of gold have since been mined in the region .
A.J. Goddard , an engine designer from Iowa , saw a different way to make money from the gold rush .
He commissioned the construction of two flat - bottomed stern - wheelers ( required because of the shallowness of the river and its rapid flow ) in San Francisco and Seattle .
The crafts were carried in bits and pieces through the narrow White Pass in the winter of 1897 , a task that took Goddard and his wife the entire season .
But that spring , the couple established the first steamboat link between the gold fields and the Pacific coast via the railway to Skagway .
Eventually , hundreds of small ships and boats were servicing the route , but most of them were eventually abandoned and destroyed .
Doug Davidge , an amateur archaeologist at the Yukon Transportation Museum in Whitehorse , had been searching for the Goddard for two decades and recently had been participating in the gold rush survey .
Last summer , the survey team was performing a side - scan sonar survey of Lake Laberge when , on the last day of the trip and the last scan of the lake , they saw a promising image in the corner of the screen .
Davidge went back the next day in a motorized canoe and dropped a camera over the side .
He discovered a stern - wheeler that he suspected was the Goddard .
This spring , not 48 hours after the lake ice melted , the team began diving to the wreck .
Davidge was the first to see it and the first to place his gloved hand on the rail .
“ The ship is upright .
It pretty much sank straight down , ” Delgado said .
A canvas hose running to a pump suggests that the ship was taking on water .
The framework of the canvas tent the crew lived in on deck remains .
Their stove was on deck as well , and a cook pot was lying in the mud alongside the wreck .
They had a forge on deck for repairs -- the tongs were still on it .
Their tools had spilled out of a canvas bag across the deck and into the mud .
A running light on the side of the ship that would have been lighted by a candle was still in place .
A crew member ’s coat and shoes were left on the deck , perhaps shed as he attempted to swim for his life .
The forward hold was full of firewood , while the rear hold was full of bags , maybe of coal , Delgado said .
What appears to be one of the men ’s carpetbags was in the hold , but the team has not yet retrieved it .
The team hopes it will contain letters or other identifying materials .
The team is working with the Canadian and provincial governments to preserve the site .
They will return next spring as soon as the ice clears again to retrieve some objects for display in the Yukon museum .
The project was funded by the Yukon government and the National Geographic Society .

" The Twilight Zone ' " creator Rod Serling wrote 92 of the show 's 156 scripts and hosted them all .
A HALF CENTURY AGO , a young writer walked across an empty set and pitched a new idea to television advertisers .
" What you 're about to see , gentlemen , is a series called ' The Twilight Zone ' , " the young man said .
" We think it 's a rather special kind of series .
The thing we 're concerned with , the thing we 're aiming for , the thing we 're working toward is entertainment .
This is a series for the storyteller . "
Serling 's Classic ' Twilight Zone ' Intro
http://audio.wbur.org/storage/2009/10/news_1002_twilight-zone-top.mp3
One storyteller in particular .
Fifty years ago on Friday , " The Twilight Zone " debuted on CBS .
Creator Rod Serling wrote 92 of the 156 " Twilight Zone " scripts and hosted them all — from the very first show .
A man wanders a deserted town , there 's no one to talk to because — in the last second , we find out — there is no town , he 's hallucinating .
He 's an astronaut , confined in isolation to see if he can stand it .
He can't :

Serling Hosts ' Nightmare At 20,000 Feet '
http://audio.wbur.org/storage/2009/10/news_1002_twilight-zone-b.mp3
" Nightmare at 20,000 Feet " and other " Twilight Zone " classics were screened two years ago at the Rod Serling Conference at Ithaca College in Ithaca , N.Y. , where Serling lived and taught and where , after his untimely death at age 50 , in 1975 , his memorabilia was archived .
Rod Serling pauses for a cigarette and coffee during filming of " The Twilight Zone " in 1961 .
( AP )
The conference was attended by film scholars , family members , fans and former students — like myself .
I was privileged to have been in one of Rod Serling 's writing classes at Ithaca , years ago .
On the 50 - year anniversary of the show 's debut , and as the school gets ready to hold another conference , I wanted to look again at Serling 's impact and how much television has grown — or maybe has n't — since he was such a part of it .
Fears Of Communists , Aliens And Corporate America
When the show debuted in the '50s , Americans feared Communists — real and imagined — body - snatching space aliens , soul - sapping corporate America .
And " The Twilight Zone " was a place for them to feel these fears .
For Serling , it became the only place to write about them .
He railed against McCarthyism and modern - day alienation .
His widow , Carol , speaking to me at the conference , said that made him radioactive to advertisers .
" Very definitely , " she said .
" It was a very serious problem .
You know , the sacred cows of advertisers and the network executives made a very difficult time for him . "
Serling adapted the screenplay for the movie " Requiem for a Heavyweight " from his Emmy - winning TV drama for CBS ' " Playhouse 90 . "
Serling was a driving - force in this new medium of TV , but the censorship became too much .
The breaking point : his planned teleplay about Emmett Till , the 14 - year - old black boy murdered in 1955 .
Letters of protest poured into the sponsor , United States Steel Co. , and then the script was watered down .
Serling took the news with anger , Carol said .
" He was called the angry young man for a long time , " she said , laughing .
" After a while he said , ' I am not the young man anymore . ' "
A scene from " Monsters Are Due on Maple Street , " which is often used to teach schoolchildren about the dangers of prejudice .
" Things he wanted to say , he really felt that television had this responsibility to hopefully inform and educate , " Carol continued .
" When he was trying to tell a story , they emasculated it .
The Emmett Till story , which was called , at one point , ' Town Is Turned To Dust , ' he said by the time they got through with it , the script had turned to dust . "
The script had been so changed , Carol said , that it was n't even a black child who was killed , it was a foreigner .
" They ruined the script , and that made him very upset and angry , " Carol said .
But there was always " The Twilight Zone . "
Serling was n’t writing about men in spacesuits just because he loved science fiction , said Marc Scott Zicree , an established television director and writer and author of the bestselling “ The Twilight Zone Companion . "
“ He was writing about the real world and using science fiction to hide his message and get it past the censors , " Zicree told me .
Carol agreed .
" He escaped into ' The Twilight Zone ' , " she said .
" Because there he could say what he wanted to and nobody really bothered him . "
Maybe that 's because they did n't get the thinly veiled commentaries .
Take , for example , " Monsters Are Due On Maple Street , " in which paranoia strikes the residents of a neighborhood , and they all turn on one another , after they come to believe that human - looking aliens have invaded .
Carol said this is the episode that 's in " so many of the high - school and junior - high textbooks " because of its themes of scapegoating and prejudice .
I asked Carol if " Monsters Are Due On Maple Street " is really about Emmett Till .
" In a sense , " she said .
Carol said Serling 's lasting impact — made evident by the Star Trek convention - like passion of his fans , 50 years later — comes from the universal themes of his work .
" They have n't gone away , " she said .
" Bigotry , nuclear war , man 's inhumanity to man .
All of these things are still right up on top . "
And there was also a spiritual aspect to it all — the question :
Are we alone ?
So , I asked her , could " The Twilight Zone " make it on the air today ?
" I doubt it , " she said .
What Would Rod Do ?
“ Born - again Christians often say , ‘ What would Jesus do ? ’ in any given situation , ” said Marc Scott Zicree , the keynote speaker at the conference .
“ In television , we say , ‘ What would Rod do ? ’ ”
“ ' The Twilight Zone , ' one of the things that was emblematic of it was the twist ending , the surprise , " Zicree said .
" One of his favorite writers was O . Henry , who was well - known for the twist ending at the early part of the 20th century .
And so Rod loved those kinds of stories . ”
Zicree is n’t surprised to be at the conference with people who know Serling ’s episodes inside and out .
" He was really the first of his kind , " Zicree said .
" Because prior to Rod , it was the producers who ran the show , not writers .
And when Rod created ' Twilight Zone , ' he was the boss , and he was the first writer to really become a TV star .
But he kept his artistic sensibility all the way through his life . ”
Zicree may not be surprised , but Carol said she knows one person who would be .
" I think it would be most surprising to Rod , " she said , " to realize that people can recite chapter and verse — entire scripts . "
Jodi Serling , one of Rod and Carol 's two daughters , echoed her mother 's sentiment .
" When he was facing his own mortality , " Jodi said of her father , " the biggest honor would be just that someone recognized his name and that he was a writer .
If he had known what 's happening now — it 's just amazing what 's happening . "
Jodi was surrounded by fans as we spoke .
One , a fast talker , broke in .
“ Do you feel like , when he passed away , he did have a sense ?
Like he must have known at that point how influential he had been and how many people loved his work . ”
“ No .
I do n’t think he knew , ” Jodi said .
“ He was before his time .
I mean he was writing about computers taking over and controlling our lives before we even had a computer .
Where does that come from ?
It ’s almost like he lived another life and he knew it was going to happen . ”
Homage To The Master
Contemporary shows , like " The Simpsons , " regularly pay homage to Serling .
Here 's Serling 's talking doll :
http://audio.wbur.org/storage/2009/10/news_1002_twilight-zone-doll.mp3
Here 's " The Simpsons " :
http://audio.wbur.org/storage/2009/10/news_1002_twilight-zone-krusty.mp3
And then there is Serling 's " Time Enough At Last , " with Burgess Meredith playing book - loving bank clerk Henry Bemis after a nuclear holocaust .
All that 's left are books , but at least he can read .
Until ... he drops his glasses :
Scene : ' That 's Not Fair '
http://audio.wbur.org/storage/2009/10/news_1002_twilight-zone-c.mp3
Burgess Meredith as Henry Bemis
A painful commentary on human folly and nuclear ambitions .
And fodder for another spoof — this time not by " The Simpsons , " but by another of Matt Groening 's animated sitcoms , " Futurama . "
A fan at the conference gave me the " Futurama " take on poor Henry :
" Not only did he lose his glasses , but after he lost his glasses he said , ' Well , my eyesight is n't so bad , ' " the fan explained .
A " Futurama " spoof of the episode
" And so then after that , his eyes then fall out .
After his eyes fall out , he 's like , ' That 's OK , I can read Braille . '
And then his hands fall out .
It 's very famous .
It 's an icon in television . "
But why ?
The shows were clever , but why do " The Twilight Zone " episodes remain so profoundly popular ?
“ This is our common mythology , " Zicree told me .
" We ’ve all grown up watching these episodes . "
' This Is A Wonderful Time For You '
Rod Serling was very clear about what propelled him into writing , Zicree said .
It was the war .
“ He was a paratrooper in World War II , and jumping out of airplanes into jungles full of men trying to kill him , " Zicree said .
" He was wounded , he had a shrapnel wound and was hospitalized .
He came out of World War II with this burning need to get something off his chest .
He needed to expunge that . ”
But as furious as Serling often was , as angry as he was , he carried around in his heart , it would seem , this place that was Binghamton , N.Y. , his hometown , that was America as it should be .
“ I think he always had a longing for and an appreciation of the small - town life , ” Zicree said .
“ Balanced , balanced man in that way — he had a good life , and a good working life . ”
We heard that in a very intimate way at the conference 's close .
" I 'll tell you something that not too many people know about Rod during his final days on earth , " said John Keshishoglou , who was dean of Ithaca 's school of communications when Serling was a faculty member .
" When he was in the intensive care unit at the hospital , he asked for his audio recorder and he began dictating and reflecting on his mortality . "
In a hushed auditorium , we listened to Serling 's last recorded words .
After his first heart attack , just before his death .
In them , you hear his character :
http://audio.wbur.org/storage/2009/10/news_1002_twilight-zone-tapes.mp3
I do n't really have a fear of death that I thought .
What I do have is a terrible awareness of how little time there is to accomplish so many of the things that you want to accomplish .
What seemed to be the most predominant in my fears is that it was a relationship that was going to end .
It would end .
It would n't be with Carol .
It would n't be kids .
It would n't be Jodi and Anne .
There would n't be any opportunity to watch their growth .
To see the good things happen to them .
Who knows what Serling might have accomplished had his life not been cut so short .
I posed that question to Zicree .
“ It ’s fascinating , " he said .
" I ’m sure he’d be writing about what ’s going on with people being held without trial , people being tortured .
He would definitely be taking a stand . ”
In Rod Serling 's voice on those recordings , you heard his many characters .
The evening closed with a screening of " Walking Distance , " the story of Martin Sloan , the ad executive who goes back in time to try to confront his younger self .
http://audio.wbur.org/storage/2009/10/news_1002_twilight-zone-martin.mp3
" I only wanted to tell you that this is a wonderful time of life for you .
Do n't let any of it go by without enjoying it .
Wo n't be any more merry - go - rounds , no more cotton candy , no more band concerts .
I only wanted to tell you that this is a wonderful time for you .
Now , here , that 's all Martin . "

The Defibrillator File
Begun on July 15 , 1996
Latest Defib - Flubs from the Guild
While doing research for a novel that I 've been working on for six years and I came across a piece of information that absolutely stunned me .
I was discussing emergency room procedures with Darla Neff - - an emergency room nurse -- and we eventually got around to the " defibrillator . "
You seen it in action hundreds of times on television .
The doctor or nurse grabs these paddles , slaps them on a patient and jolts the patient to get their heart started when the patient goes flatline .
Except . . .
That 's not how a defibrillator works !!
According to Darla , a defibrilator " de-fibrillates . "
When the heart is fibrillating , it is fluttering .
The heart monitor looks like a series of " V"s .
The defibrillator jolts the heart back into a normal rhythm so it can actually pump blood to the body .
If a person is flatline , Darla says that the defibrillator wo n't do any good !
This piece of information was absolutely amazing to me .
How many times have we seen this on television ?
I 've seen it so many times that I think I could operate the machine .
Darla tells me that if you have a person who is flatline , you either have to do chest compressions or use an external pacemaker or use drugs .
I mentioned this little tidbit in one of my " This Week At NitCentral " updates and promptly received the following comments from Robert J. Woolley , a medical doctor , " You 're completely correct about defibrillators .
What 's a little scary is that I 've watched a fair number of my fellow doctors ( not just TV docs ! ) shock a flatline heart , which , as your consultant pointed out , does no good .
I suspect that this is not because of television portrayals , but because the image of jump - starting cars is so deeply ingrained .
The correct procedure is to administer epinephrine and / or atropine , and hope that these produce an irregular rhythm that you can then shock back to a regular one . "
Then Lee Lorenz came up with a great idea .
He suggested that I start a file to see how many instances we can find of incorrect usage of a defibrillator .
Since I had just seen several on an avalanche of American Gothic episodes , I thought this would be fun !
Here 's the rules for submission :
The scene must show a heart that is flatline on a monitor .
While the heart is flatline , the scene must show someone attempting to shock the heart back to life using the defibrillator .
When you submit , please include the name of the series , the name of the episode ( if possible , if not just include a line saying what the episode was about ) , a short description of the scene and , if possible , the date you saw it .
I wo n't have time to double - check them so let 's try to be accurate out there !
ADDITION TO THE RULES ( April 27 , 1997 ) : Some have said that it is possible that the monitor might not be calibrated correctly and therefor show a flatline when in fact there 's fibrillations .
So . . . we will make this allowance .
If the code blue team administers a drug intercardially ( sticks it in their heart ) before they shock the patient the first time , we 'll let that one pass .
( As was done in a recent X - File episode , " Synchrony . " )
This also means that with this additional rule , some of the defib - flubs a listed here may actually not be defib - flubs if they were sent in prior to April 27 , 1997 because members of the Nitpickers Guild did n't know to check for the injection !
( Always need to cover our bases ! )
I 'll start us off with the ones I saw in the last six episodes of American Gothic .
American Gothic : To Hell and Back ( 7/3/96 ) .
A woman goes flatline .
The monitor shows it and the nurse substatiates it .
The doctor calls for the paddles .
The scene cuts away .
When we come back , the doctor is using chest compressions .
Then , the crash cart rolls in .
The doctor start hallucinating and the nurse steps in with the paddles to administer the jolt .
( This one is a bit twitchy since it is possible that a drug was administered when we were n't look but the doctor appears to be busy doing chest compressions . )
American Gothic : Learning to Crawl ( 7/4/96 ) .
At the beginning of the episode , Caleb is electrocuted .
After the opening credits , Caleb sees Merlyn and realizes he 's dead .
In the background you can hear a nurse say , " still flatline , doctor . "
The doctor yells , " Clear , " and hits Caleb 's body with the paddles .
American Gothic : The Buck Stops Here ( 7/10/96 ) .
Two - thirds of the way through the episode , Lucas Buck has a siezure .
The doctor hits him with the defibrillator .
The monitor shows flatline .
The doctor hits him again .
The Outer Limits : Mind Over Matter ( 7/9/96 ) .
" The story involved Mark Hamill as a scientist using cyberspace to keep his new love alive .
She goes flatline while hooked up , and they use a defibrilator on her lifeless body . "
Lee Lorenz of Fenton , MI
Short Circuit II : " The robot is dead .
They defib the robot .
( Since he was alive , he must have a heart -- at least , I think that this was their logic . )
It was bizarre , to say the least . "
Laura Jacquez Valentine of Pittsburgh , PA
Renegade : Val's Song ( 7/26/96 ) .
" In the first scene , Valerie Prentice is in a hospital bed on life support .
The camera cuts to the heart monitor , which goes flat and emits the famous high - pitched whine associated with it .
Then the nurses rush in and , without administering any heart starting drugs , put the pads to her a few times before giving up .
Oddly enough , they got it right without even trying . "
Josef Hughson of Ft. Leavenworth , KS
Flatliners : " Sorry about this one , but it has been awhile since I 've seen the movie and do n't currently have a copy .
But do n't they use a defribulator each time to bring the person back from the ' dead ' ? "
E. Haughton Dansforth of Tempe , AZ
Eraser : " The actor who plays Eldon the painter on Murphy Brown is helping the Eraser ( Arnold ) break into some secret HQ by pretending to have some sort of seizure .
In the HQ 's emergency ward , he pulls out the plug on the heart monitor they have put on him , and he appears to go flatline .
Seeing the flatline , the attendants grab the paddles and start shocking him .
Even though he is flopping around and screaming , they keep looking at the flatline on the monitor and repeatedly shock him . "
Steve Mack of Berkeley , CA
ER : Fire In The Belly " This nit breaks every rule of submission , but I thought I 'd give it a shot anyway .
Dr. Benton is doing an appendectomy when all of a sudden you here the high - pitched squel of a flatline .
They never show the monitor , but Benton begins to do chest compressions ( which seems to support the flatline theory ) .
Anyway , Benton 's doing chest compressions and although they never show the heart being shocked you very clearly , without a doubt , see a nurse pull a pair of paddles out before the scene cuts . "
Matt McDonough of Virginia Beach , VA ( Note from Phil : Well . . . ER is suppose to have medical consultants .
If the doctor called for epinephrine and / or atropine then the paddles would make sense .
I do n't know .
This one 's twitchy . )
Touched By an Angel : Interview With an Angel ( 8/10/96 ) " I 'm not sure if this counts or not , but a doctor had just performed a heart transplant on a man .
The moniter was flatline , and the doctor held electrodes or something on his heart , said " Clear " and there was a shocking sound .
Of course , nothing happened .
( Also , my stepfather is an EMT - I ( Emergency Medical Technician - Intermediate ) and I asked him about defibrillators .
He confirmed the fact that you can't use paddles on a flatline heart .
He 's surprised that something intelligent is on the Net. ; ) "
JoAnna Walsvik ( Note from Phil : We aim to please ! )
Taken from Sunday 's entry in " This Week At NitCentral " ( 9/15/96 ) . . .
**********************
In the continuing saga of the general populace 's misunderstanding of defibrillators , Cliff Cerce alerted me to a series of news reports that spoke of a new , compact , computerized defibrillator receiving federal approval .
( Note that the spokesperson for Heart Stream , Inc. does sound like he knows what he is talking about but the news media obviously does n't !
I 've emphasized the appropriate passages . )
TRANSCRIBED FROM AN ABC RADIO NEWSBREAK ON 9/12/96
The smallest , lightest and cheapest device to restart stopped hearts now has federal approval and cardiologists hope that will make defibrillators as common as first - aid kits .
" This is a device that 's been designed for fire departments , for ambulance service personnel , uh , for the police departments of many communities which will make it practical , uh , for them to carry this equipment and deliver this therapy in those first critical minutes , " John Harris of Heart Stream Incorporated , the Seattle developer of the portable defibrillator .
More than 300,000 Americans die from cardiac arrest each year .
Experts say a third of them might have been saved if they got an electrical shock to restart their heart right away .
TRANSCRIBED FROM THE LOCAL NEWS REPORT BROADCAST ON KY3 - THE NBC AFFILIATE IN SPRINGFIELD MO .
It 's cheap , it 's small and it could save your life .
The nation 's smallest device to restart stopped hearts now has federal approval .
Cardiologists hope the FDA approval will make defibrillators as common as fire extinguishers .
The new small defibs could become standard gear for security guards , police , even flight attendants .
They are the size of a book and weigh just four pounds .
They cost three to four thousand dollars .
Also , Cliff Cerce advised that Tom Brokaw actually used the term " jump - start " when referring to the service that these devices performed .
I asked Robert J. Wooley about this .
His reponse follows .
( I had commented that it sounded like the reporters simply did n't know what they were talking about ! )
" I think you 're exactly right -- the reporter missed that day of physiology class .
Again I maintain that it is the prevalent image of jump - starting a car that has caused all the misunderstanding by false analogy . "
In my message to Robert , I also worried that having defibrillators as common as first aid kits might lead to Nellie jolting Bert every time he slumped over on the couch !
Robert responded , " These automatic things are actually an improvement in that they will * not* deliver a shock to a flatline heart , or one with a regular beat .
They must sense fibrillation before they will defibrillate .
This makes it less likely that an uninformed operator will try the jump - start theory of cardiology .
I have n't seen the new tiny ones , but the standard size automatic ones that some fire and police departments now carry are tres cool .
You just slap two electrodes on the chest and it does the rest .
Before it delivers the shock it loudly warns bystanders , in a Robby the Robot voice , " STAND BACK !
STAND BACK ! STAND BACK ! "
And so it goes , and so on , our technology saves us in spite of our ignorance !
( There 's a scary thought .
I used to create expert system technology .
Granted it was only in the field of music notation but what happens if there is a manufacturing error in the chip sets for one of these computerized defibrillators ?
Will the hapless patient start doing a bad version of the Macarena ?
Sorry , sorry .
That was totally uncalled for . )
**********************
Emergency : " Almost every episode of would qualify for this .
They certainly used the defibrillator often enough ( something like 2 out of every 3 episodes ) .
I can't give any specifics , because it 's been years since the program was on the air .
( Also , you have listed Short Circuit II but in this case , they were using the defibrillator to attempt to rechage his batteries ) " Troy Risher of Vista , CA
A further note from Robert J. Woolley : " This is only tangentially related to your specific request for defibrillator misuse on TV , but I think you 'll find it interesting anyway .
A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine checked out how realistic the use of CPR is on medically - oriented TV shows .
But the really interesting part is the reponse of one of the medical writers for ' ER ' , who was invited to write an editorial about this research .
What is interesting is his frank admission that realism gets sacrificed to what is dramatic and will pull in viewers .
Of course , we all * knew * that , but to have the industry admit it publicly is unusual , I think . "
( Note from Phil : Robert did send along the article and it was interesting but a bit too long for inclusion here . )
New York Undercover : Season Premiere , " At the end of last season , Det. Nina Moreno was in critical condition after taking a bullet for her fellow cop and boyfriend Det. Eddie Torres .
The show faded out with her going into flatline ( the monitor made that high - pitched whine and then we saw it ) and the paddles came out , but it appeared that she had died .
Then , last week , in this season 's premiere , the same scene was repeated , and the paddles came out again and the crash cart came out and ... her heart started beating again !
Ta-dah ! " Daniel B. Case
Mad TV : ( not the most reliable source at the best of times ) Rerun September 14 , 1996 " There was a scene with two woman doctors who spoke in ' girl ' cliches .
At the end , the patient is flatline .
After the defibrillator did n't work ( no surprises there ) , one of them yells ' Get your funky *** up , ' or something like that , and then the heart starts going again . "
Murray J.D. Leeder
The Outer Limits : Afterlife ( 9/30/96 )
" The doctor - lady , named Ellen , I believe , is talking with somebody , when all of a sudden the sargeant [ who has been infected with alien DNA ] in the containment chamber goes flatline .
The shot switches to the monitor of the flatline heart .
Ellen rushes in with what I can only assume were her nurses , and begins to give him adrenaline .
When this does n't work , She whips out the defibrilator , with the steady tone still audible in the background . "
Ryan Hunter
Reanimator : " In the first scene after the opening credits of the movie , they clearly show asystole ( flatline ) on the monitor , yet shock the female patient anyway .
In the same movie in the last scene another women is also flatlined , but is defibrilated . "
Scott Fleischer of Gainesville , FL ( Note from Phil :
By the way , Scott is a pre-med student at the University of Florida and has worked in emergency rooms for 5 years . )
Bride of the Reanimator : " [ In this movie as well , ] a women just slumps into cardiac arrest shown on the monitor and the first thing the doctor calls for are the paddles . "
Scott Fleischer of Gainesville , FL
Scott Fleischer comments ,
" The other nitpicky flub you can look into is the sound the defibrilator seems to make on TV .
In real life there is little or no sound .
The other thing to laugh at is how the patient always pops up or flails their arms like they are being hit with a severe amount of joules ( unit of electrical energy ) .
I could go on about how many times I 've seen it done wrong . "
Outer Limits : Mind Over Matter ( 10/4/96 )
" At the end of an episode , a woman dies .
Some calls out ' Flatline ! ' and we hear what I believe is supposed to be the sound of a defibrillator .
The camera cuts to the woman and we see her get another jolt from the paddles .
In the seconds that follow , we are told that the woman 's heart stopped , she gets another jolt .
We see the flat line on the monitor . "
( Note from Phil : Lee Lorenz had already spotted this one but this description has a bit more detail . )
ER : Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ( 10/10/96 )
" Blatant Defrib last night on E.R. Lawrence Tierny ( who played Elaine 's dad on ' Seinfeld , ' and was in ' Resevoir Dogs ' ) went flatline , and sure enough , they jump - started him three or four times .
Did n't see anyone inject him first , either .
And as always , the ever - reliable defrib worked ! "
Bob Canada
Sliders : The Dream Masters ( Date Unknown ) " Wade is having a very bad dream and goes into arrest about halfway through the show .
Her heart stops and there is the familiar monotone sound of the flatline .
The doctor tells someone to something to 100 , and that something looks like a defibrulater .
Then they use the paddles on her . "
John Latchem and Joe Hughson both submitted this one on the same day !
DS9 : Nor the Battle to the Strong ( Date Unknown ) " Well , this is n't a nit , but I like to give the creators of a show credit when they do something RIGHT !
In last week 's DS9 episode , where Jake and Bashir are performing emergency field medicine , early on in the episode , Bashir is faced with a woman who IS fibrillating , NOT flatlined and he defibs her with a nifty Trek paddle .
I was thrilled , but of course , we all know that Trek is SOO accurate with its science .
( snort , snort ) " Matt Nelson
New York Undercover : ( Title Unknown ) ( 10/31/96 )
" A young rap star is in a hospital recovering from a bullet wound when , suddenly , we see the monitor go flatline and the paddles come out and are used . "
Dan Case
CNN : " I was searching through their website , and came upon this URL : ' http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9611/19/airplane.heart/'
It mentions that American Airlines will carry defibrillators on their planes , ' to " jump start a stopped heart " ' " David McGrath
LEVI JEANS : " Okay , this is n't a TV show , it 's a commercial , so you might be able to see it .
The commercial is for Levi 's jeans .
There 's a guy on an operating table surrounded by doctors .
He 's pretty beat up .
He starts to sing a bad 80's song ( think British , I ca n't remember the name of it ) , and the doctors start to sing .
They ignore this person and he goes flatline , and they use a defib to start his heart .
There you go ! " Eric Brasure ( Note from Phil : I love this commercial !
It 's for wide - legged jeans .
I believe the song is " Tainted Love " and it's older than the 80's -- I think ! )
ER : Hell and High Water ( 11/28/96 )
" A young girl who had been hit by a car was having internal bleeding while in surgery to repair a laceration on her face .
She was taken to the ER and Dr. Benton was doing a thorocotomy when Dr. Greene came in and traded places with him .
The girl then went flatline .
There were a few shots of the monitor clearly illustrating this .
At that time , Dr. Greene called for the internal paddles and proceeded to shock her several times . "
Jim Cadwell of Minneapolis , MN ( Note from Phil :
Under the new rules , this may or may not qualify .
I 'd be surprised if someone did n't call for a shot before they used the paddles .
After all , they do have a doctor on writing staff ! )
Chicago Hope : Women on the Verge ( Date Unknown ) : Boy is having a bypass operation .
Boy 's heart stops , monitor shows flatline .
Surgeon " Kate Austin " uses defibrillator .
Monitor still shows flatline .
Surgeon ( doubtless repressing the urge to say " Duh ! " ) injects something into his heart .
Monitor still shows flatline .
Surgeon uses the defibrillator again .
Boy 's heart starts .
I think this can be explained if a very weak fibrillation that can be treated with electrical shock still shows up as a flat line .
The injection probably started the heart up .
My father is very sceptical about defibrillators being useless for " dead " people , and when I saw Austin injecting the heart I tried to tell him this was the correct way to do it . "
Gareth Wilson of Christchurch , New Zealand ( Note from Phil :
This thing of defibrillators starting a heart is so deeply ingrained in us from seeing it on television that it 's really hard to convince people that it 's not true ! )
Diagnosis Murder : ( Episode Title Unknown ) ( 1/16/97 ) " Dr. Sloan ( Van Dyke ) tries to save his friend when he starts fibrillating .
The scene showed the monitor flatlining ( as required for submission ) , and then Sloan applied the machine .
Fun to watch once you know it 's a WHIRL :) " Michael Teplitsky
The Abyss : " I 'm not sure if it shows the flatline on a monitor , but how about this one .
The movie shows the use of a defibrillator on Lindsey Brigman ( played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ) after she willingly drowns herself so that she and her ex ( Ed Harris ) can both possibly get back to Deepcore .
Not only had she been drowned for some time when they used the defibrillator on her , but she was lying in about 3 inches of saltwater , the same water everyone around was standing in .
Not sure if that makes a difference , but it sure seems dangerous to me . "
A. Neal Crandell of Louisville Kentucky
ER : ( 4/24/97 ) " Tonight on ER , Dr. Green told a troop of Brownies ( Girl Scouts ) that the ' paddles ' were used to restart someone 's heart .
But , I feel I must add that he DID say that they were also used to steady irregular heartbeats . "
Michael Apple
( Note from Phil :
And now for a truly interesting tidbit of information . . .)
" In your Defibrillator Files , someone said that the writers of ER would have the doctors using a crash cart on flatline patients because it looks dramatic .
Well , it 's not only on television that they do this .
When my father died last year , they ' shocked ' him for fifteen minutes after his heart stopped .
My sister , a longtime registered nurse , later said ' They just do that for the family . '
In other words , some doctors will use the crash cart in hopeless situations just so the family can see a dramatic lifesaving attempt , even though they know it does n't do any good . "
John Reese ( 4/25/97 )

WASHINGTON --
The House of Representatives headed toward a historic vote scheduled for Saturday on a bill overhauling the health - care system , with Democratic leaders acknowledging they have n't locked down the votes needed to pass it .
On Friday afternoon , Democrats estimated they were 10 to 15 votes short of getting to a majority of 218 , as lawmakers balked on issues ranging from abortion to costs to immigration .
There was a possibility debate would begin Saturday morning with no sure outcome guaranteed .

Todt is the new FIA president after comfortably winning Friday 's election in Paris .
The former Ferrari team principal had been up against former world rally Ari Vatanen for the top job within motor racing 's governing body .
Todt got 135 votes compared to Vatanen 's 49 .
There were 12 abstentions or invalid votes .
The entire voting procedure was supervised by an external Huissier de Justice , the French state - appointed public witness .
The victory means he will succeed outgoing president Max Mosley , who made it clear from the outset that he wanted Todt to win the vote .
Mary Lloyd 's husband was lying in the intensive care unit of an Arizona hospital when she got a good look at their new health insurance card for the first time .
Then she got the shock of her life .
The card read : " This is NOT an insurance card . "
For the retired couple from East Bethel , it was the beginning of a financial nightmare that left them with at least $ 50,000 in unpaid medical bills .
They discovered that the new " health plan , " they signed up for in January , for $ 499 a month , would n't pay for any of his medical care .
" I was royally duped , " said Mary Lloyd , a painful admission from a woman who spent 27 years as a clinic and hospital manager .
" I understand health care , and I understand health insurance , " she said .
" That 's why I was so mortified that this happened to us . "
No one knows how many customers have fallen into this trap .
But dubious health plans are " spreading like poison oak all over the country , " says James Quiggle of the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud , a nonprofit watchdog in Washington , D.C. Consumer advocates say companies are taking advantage of the recession and the growing number of uninsured people -- 1 in 5 American adults under age 65 -- to sell " health coverage " that evaporates when customers try to use it , or provides far less than promised .
Just last month , Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson sued two out - of - state companies for allegedly misleading customers with phony claims about their health plans ; and ten more investigations are underway , she said .
" Here , they 're targeting people who are pretty sophisticated , and who really asked all the right questions , " Swanson said .
People believe them , she said , because they 're " so desperate to find affordable coverage . "
' Wonderful , you qualify !'
Last December , Mary Lloyd spotted the commercial on late - night TV .
A Florida company , Cinergy Health , advertised medical coverage for as little as $ 5 a day .
She thought it was worth a call .
Her 60 - year - old husband was set to retire as a deputy sheriff in Isanti County , and it would cost $ 1,200 a month to continue his coverage -- too pricey , she thought .
If she had done a Google search , she would have discovered that Cinergy had been cited in Florida for misleading advertising in 2006 .
( This past summer , it was forced to drop the TV ads after a similar investigation by New York insurance regulators . )
But at the time , Mary Lloyd says , she was n't particularly suspicious .
A salesman from Louisiana called her back , and pointed her to a website : aimhealthplans.com .
It offers " limited medical health plans " that promise " first dollar coverage " with no copays and an array of choices , including " unlimited surgical benefits . "
Mary , who took meticulous notes , initially chose a plan for $ 588 a month .
The salesman , who identified himself as Darryl Williams of Mid South Benefits , promised it would cover all preexisting conditions , Mary Lloyd recalled .
After a few questions , " he said , ' Wonderful , you qualify . ' " A month later , they were still waiting for something in writing .
With their old insurance expiring in two days , Mary Lloyd called Williams in late January .
That 's when the salesman offered to switch them to a better and cheaper plan .
She admits , in retrospect , that she did n't ask a lot of questions .
Running out of time , she simply agreed .
Eight weeks later , while vacationing in Arizona , Anthony was hitting a bucket of golf balls at a driving range when pain shot across his shoulders .
He tried to shrug it off .
Friends rushed him to Banner Boswell Medical Center in Sun City , and he heard the words : " He 's having a heart attack . "
' This is terrible insurance ' Mary Lloyd peeled out her insurance cards the next morning in the hospital 's business office .
Doctors had discovered a 100 percent blockage in her husband 's artery .
Fortunately , they had cleared it quickly enough to prevent heart damage .
Now Anthony was resting in the ICU .
The business agent took the cards , Mary Lloyd said , and threw them back on the counter .
" She said , ' This is terrible insurance .
This is not even insurance , ' " Mary recalled .
Puzzled , she studied one of the cards :
It read " Secure Care " by the United Service Association for Health Care ( USA + ) , a nonprofit membership group in Texas .
Their health plan turned out to be a " health care savings " program that offers discounts at participating providers .
The customer , not the company , must pay the bills .
Mary Lloyd was sure there had been a mixup .
But the hospital business agent took a hard line , she recalled .
" She said ' you need to pay and you need to pay today . '
By that time I was so mortified I could hardly stand up . "
She called salesman Williams for help , but no one ever called back , Mary Lloyd said .
( His employer , Mid South Benefits , said last week that Williams had been " terminated , " but did n't answer questions about the Lloyds ' case . )
When she tried to call Secure Care , she said , " the call would not go through .
It was like calling the moon . "
The Lloyds learned that their " membership plan " included a limited insurance benefit : up to $ 8,000 for an operation , and $ 1,000 a day for hospital care .
But the Lloyds never got any of it .
In spite of the salesman 's promises , their entire claim was rejected because of a preexisting condition : Anthony 's high blood pressure .
By the time Anthony Lloyd was discharged two days later , his bills totaled $ 67,000 .
Keeping promises Mary Cranon , executive director of the United Service Association , said the Lloyds should have known what they were buying because it was spelled out in the handbooks they received in February .
She did n't address the salesman 's claims , saying only that the programs are marketed by " independent contractors . "
But she said the company lived up to all its promises .
In a letter to the Star Tribune on Friday , Cranon said that under the " contracted rate , " the Lloyds will get a $ 15,000 discount on their medical bills , lowering the total from $ 67,000 to $ 52,000 .
Mary Lloyd said that was news to her .
The Lloyds received a bill from the hospital in September , saying they still owed the original amount .
The hospital would not comment , except to say that it 's willing to work with patients in financial hardship .
It did , however , issue a written statement saying " we truly regret that the Lloyds felt they were treated rudely . "

Members of Led Zeppelin , Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age are working together on a new project , it has been revealed .
And not minor , touring - only side men – three of the biggest names in rock music , banding together and making a racket .
The as - yet - unnamed supergroup unites Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones , Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme , and lead Foo Fighter ( né Nirvana drummer ) Dave Grohl .
The trio are presently in Los Angeles , recording their debut album .
Although the project has been simmering for years , this week 's confirmation comes thanks to a marital indiscretion .
Brody Dalle , of the band Spinnerette , leaked the news during an interview with the website Antiquiet ; Dalle is Homme 's wife .
" I 'm not at liberty to talk about it , " she said , " but I think it 's pretty fucking amazing ...
Just beats and sounds like you 've never heard before . "
Grohl has been talking about such an album since 2005 , when he described the prospective lineup to Mojo magazine .
" The next project that I 'm trying to initiate involves me , [ Josh Homme and John Paul Jones ] .
That 's the next album .
That would n't suck . "
Jones dropped his own hints to the French journalist Cyril Deluermoz earlier this summer , discussing a " secret " band .
" I 'm working on some other music , which is more rock based , with a couple of other people , " he said .
" We hope to be everywhere this summer . "
Homme and Jones previously contributed to the Foo Fighters ' 2005 album In Your Honor .
Before the season , there were plenty of questions about how SEC fans would find their favorite team on TV .
We now can see the complete picture of Year 1 of the SEC 's record 15 - year contracts with ESPN and CBS .
There were a variety of media platforms .
But the most widely - distributed for the SEC are CBS , ESPN and ESPN2 .
Consider them the Big Three for the conference .
They 're the channels where the most eyeballs are watching college football across the country ( along with ABC , a sister company of ESPN ) .
Kentucky , which has beaten Georgia and Auburn , got the shortest end of the stick for a team that 's done well in 2009 .
What the Wildcats suffer in football exposure they make up with basketball exposure .
Still , Rich Brooks must feel like the Rodney Dangerfield of the SEC .
Where 's the respect ?
SEC Appearances on CBS , ESPN , ESPN2
Florida ( 11-0 ) : 9 appearances
Alabama ( 11-0 ) : 7 appearances

If you wanted to help the economy and you had $ 14 billion to bestow on any group of people , which group would you choose :
a) Teenagers and young adults , who have an 18 percent unemployment rate .
b ) All the middle - age long - term jobless who , for various reasons , are not eligible for unemployment benefits .
c ) The taxpayers of the future ( by using the $ 14 billion to pay down the deficit ) .
d ) The group that has survived the Great Recession probably better than any other , with stronger income growth , fewer job cuts and little loss of health insurance .
The Obama administration has chosen option d  people in their 60s and beyond .
The president has proposed sending a $ 250 check to every Social Security recipient , which sounds pretty good at first .
The checks would be part of his admirable efforts to stimulate the economy , and older Americans are clearly a sympathetic group .
Next year , they are scheduled to receive no cost - of - living increase in their Social Security benefits .
Yet that is largely because they received an artificially high 5.8 percent increase this year .
For this reason and others , economists are generally recoiling at the proposal .

AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - The Dutch are among the lowest users of marijuana or cannabis in Europe despite the Netherlands ’ well - known tolerance of the drug , according to a regional study published Thursday .
Among adults in the Netherlands , 5.4 percent used cannabis , compared with the European average of 6.8 percent , according to an annual report by the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction , using latest available figures .
A higher percentage of adults in Italy , Spain , the Czech Republic and France took cannabis last year , the EU agency said , with the highest being Italy at 14.6 percent .
Usage in Italy used to be among the lowest at below 10 percent a decade ago .
Countries with the lowest usage rates , according to the Lisbon - based agency , were Romania , Malta , Greece and Bulgaria .
Cannabis use in Europe rose steadily during the 90s and earlier this decade , but has recently stabilized and is beginning to show signs of decline , the agency said , owing to several national campaigns to curb and treat use of the drug .
“ Data from general population and school surveys point to a stabilizing or even decreasing situation , ” the report said .
The policy on soft drugs in the Netherlands , one of the most liberal in Europe , allows for the sale of marijuana at “ coffee shops , ” which the Dutch have allowed to operate for decades , and possession of less than 5 grams ( 0.18 oz ) .
Nearly a fifth of the 228 coffee shops in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam , a popular draw for tourists , are scheduled to be shut down because they are too close to schools .
The full report by the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction is available at r.reuters.com/vef87f
Announced on 4 September in Berlin , Samsung 's third generation Galaxy Note will be released starting on 25 September in more than 140 countries across the globe .
Ahead of the market roll - out , Android 4.3 Jelly Bean test build for the Galaxy Note 3 has leaked .
According to Sammobile , Android 4.3 test firmware with build version XXUBMH1 has leaked for the international LTE version Samsung Galaxy Note 3 bearing model number SM - N9005 .
As the device has not been released yet , users will not be able to flash the firmware except Samsung employees .
The primary reason behind releasing the test firmware is to allow third part developers to port features from the Galaxy Note 3 to other devices .
However , users would be able to flash the firmware once the device becomes available .
Firmware details
Model : SM - N9005
Country : Open Europe
Version : Android 4.3
Changelist : 1287056
Build date : 3 August , 2013
Product code : OXX
PDA : N9005XXUBMH1
CSC : N9005OXXBMH1
MODEM : N9005XXUBMH1
Download link : N9005XXUBMH1_N9005OXXBMH1_N9005XXUBMH1_OXX.zip
The N9005XXUBMH1 is slightly old and was built on 3 August .
Due to the implementation of Samsung Knox , many test builds are failing to boot but the N9005XXUBMH1 is reportedly the most stable test build so far .
The Galaxy Note 3 comes with enriched privacy and security protection provided by Samsung Knox , which allows users to run and store security - sensitive applications and data inside a protected execution environment called container .
The security inside the container is strengthened by system - level protection of Samsung Knox against malware and phishing attacks as well as hacking attempts on devices when the devices are stolen or lost .

This is largely due to the fact that Infinity Ward has managed to craft a game which perfectly balances the inclusion of some fantastic new features with the maintenance of everything that worked in the first Modern Warfare instalment ( COD4 ) in terms of its core gameplay experience .
The control system is smooth and intuitively mapped to the controllers .
The visuals have been given a polish and the frame rate is excellent .
The sound effects remain largely unchanged from COD4 , but this is by no means a bad thing when one considers how integral to the in - game experience they are .
The weapons feel weighty and give a satisfying kick depending on their size .
Overall , the experience of playing Modern Warfare 2 is very similar to COD4 ; Infinity Ward hurl everything at the player including the kitchen sink and the result is a white - knuckled , visceral shooter which hits the player at gut - level throughout its entire duration .
The sense of a world that exists outside the game is obliterated by the firefights onscreen .
The player is both thrilled and disorientated by the constant pace of the action which comes so thick and fast that the player really does feel that death ( or at least game over ) could come at any second .
It 's in this way that Modern Warfare 2 , more than any other shooter in the market , both challenges the player 's reflexes and accuracy while at the same time engaging their primal need for survival .
It all adds up to some of the best shooter action money can buy .
Everybody 's seen redirection in bash commands , that 's pretty common , but bash also allows you to define redirections when you define functions .
This causes the redirections to be evaluated / executed whenever the function is called .
This feature does n't really give you any new features , just another way to express existing features .
The syntax for this is simple , you simply append the redirections onto the end of the function defintion :
function testy ( ) { ... } < testy .in > testy.out 2 > testy.err
Now whenever the function testy is called its input will come from testy .
in , its output will go to testy .
out and any errors will go to testy.err .
Since the redirections are evaluated when the function is called the redirection (s ) can use variables and the variables are also evaluated when the function is called .
So you could do something like this :
#!/bin/bash function testy ( ) { echo testy westy } > $ out out = jj1 testy out = jj2 testy
This causes the output of the function to go to a different file with each call .
The first call 's output goes to jj1 and the second 's to jj2 :
$ bash j.sh ; more jj ? :::::::::::::: jj1 :::::::::::::: testy westy :::::::::::::: jj2 :::::::::::::: testy westy
As I mentioned earlier , there 's not any real new capability here , you could also accomplish the same thing this way :
#!/bin/bash function testy ( ) { echo testy westy } testy > jj1 testy > jj2
One possible use of this feature might be to put all your code inside a main function and then redirect it 's error output so that you make sure it always gets captured :
#!/bin/bash log = kk function error ( ) { echo " $ * " > &2 } function testy ( ) { error testy westy } function testy2 ( ) { error testy 2 westy 2 } function main ( ) { testy testy 2 } 2 > $ log main
Running this produces :
$ bash k.sh ; cat kk testy westy testy 2 westy
2
Since bash also allows redirection to be included on {...} blocks / lists you could accomplish the same thing with the following :
#!/bin/bash log = mm function error ( ) { echo " $ * " > &2 } function testy ( ) { error testy westy } function testy2 ( ) { error testy 2 westy 2 } { testy testy 2 } 2 > $ log
You can also use redirections on ( ... ) blocks / lists but that causes the commands to be executed in a sub- shell , which is n't necessary here and which may cause problems since the sub - shell is a different process .
If you 're wondering if you can override the redirections in the actual call , the answer is no .
If you try to override them all that happens is that redirections in the call are executed / evaluated first then the ones in the function definition replace them .
For example , in the following :
#!/bin/bash function testy ( ) { echo testy westy } > nn1 testy >nn2
The output file specified in the call ( nn2 ) gets created but nothing gets written to it .
Also note that pipe " redirections " do not work , but here documents do :
#!/bin/bash function testy ( ) { while read line do echo $ line done } << EOF hello there EOF testy
Running this produces :
In the frenzied runup to Tuesday 's bad - news budget , the Liberal government quietly sent out hundreds of ticking time bombs and retreated to the relative safety of their homes for the weekend .
Last Friday , dubbed " Black Friday " by the thousands of B.C. charities that depend on gaming revenues for their existence , Rich Coleman , the minister responsible for disbursing the money , sent out a memo .
His message , delivered under the sunny " Best Place on Earth " logo , was to the point : Dear Community Organizations ,
We screwed up the numbers , so you know that cheque we said was in the mail ?
It is n't .
The tone was brisk .
Unapologetic .
The gaming gravy train has ended , it suggested , and in its place we 're funding , well , gravy .
CommunityLINK , which supplies lunches to needy kids and was previously paid for by the education ministry , will be getting your money , in addition to projects supported by the BC Arts Council , also previously funded by the taxpayer .
Priorities have shifted , Coleman lectured , and community groups that we deem expendable — environmental , adult sports groups , alumni associations , and especially " a number of arts and culture organizations " — are out of luck .
It got worse .
That money had n't only been for future use .
In most cases it had already been spent , based on formerly ironclad written guarantees that have simply been trashed by the very officials who signed them .
Oh puh-lease , I hear some of our readers thinking .
We 're all suffering , so why should I get upset about a bunch of fancy - pants artists when the alternative is to let kids go hungry ?
Well , that 's exactly what Minister Coleman wants you to think .
That false comparison is calculated to distract from the heart of the issue :
It 's not the government 's money to take away .
To understand why , we need to go back a few years .
In Canada , before there was " gaming " — a cuddly word that evokes family Scrabble nights — there was gambling .
And it was bad .
So bad , in fact , that it was illegal for the first 100 years of Confederation .
The only exemption was for charities , which ran lotteries , bingo halls and casinos , and reaped the profits .
Then , in 1969 , a Criminal Code change allowed governments a foot in the door — but only when a worthy cause was involved .
Charities were their ticket and their moral justification , and still are : Just look at the pages on the BCLC website trumpeting the motto " When you play , good things happen . "
Smelling easy money , the province , by the late 1990s , was soon kicking open that door , even while promising to set aside charities ' cut in a trust and ensure direct access to the funds .
The contest between a goliath government and small , varied community interests had predictable results .
In 1997 , when the province , in a reverse Robin Hood maneuver , tried to rob charities of $ 24 million to pay for its own " charitable " health and education services , the NDP government was taken to court .
The following January , when then - deputy premier Dan Miller was ordered to give the money back by the Supreme Court , opposition leader Gordon Campbell summed up the decision best :
Board up the windows of that abandoned hospital if you must , but if the dead ever come back to life as zombies and begin infecting the population , a group of Canadian researchers do n't hold out much hope for our survival .
A group of University of Ottawa mathematics students and their professor came to their dire conclusion after developing a simple model similar to one researchers might use to track the spread of a pandemic .
The result is food for thought for those who worry the living dead might eat their brains .
" A zombie outbreak is likely to lead to the collapse of civilization , unless it is dealt with quickly , " they write .
The research began as an exercise in mathematical disease modelling , said University of Ottawa assistant professor Robert J. Smith ? , whose last name contains a question mark to distinguish his common name from that of other researchers .
Smith ?
asked his students to come up with their own scenario , and to consider the possibility that when tracking the spread of disease the dead might factor into the model .
That advice , he said , likely was patient zero for the zombie scenario , the brainchild of students Joe Imad , Philip Munz and Ioan Hudea .
Scenario ' unlikely , ' researchers say
While the authors said the model is an " unlikely " scenario if taken literally , Smith ?
said it could have real - world applications if applied to diseases with a dormant infection and provides a useful framework in instances when scientists are dealing with the outbreak of an unknown disease .
Key to the rapid spread of the zombie infection in the scenario is the assumption , based on popular films , that zombies are able to infect both living and the " newly deceased , " giving them a steady supply of potential targets .
Neither quarantines nor a cure for the zombie infection appear to stop the zombies from their eventual victory .
The researchers might have broken from Hollywood convention and been overly pessimistic , however , in their assumption that even a beheaded zombie could rise again if reinfected .
Smith ?
said the concern is addressed in the group 's final scenario , in which the researchers outline a strategic eradication of zombies early in the outbreak , which resulted in the destruction of the zombies within 10 days .
As the researchers write in the paper , published in the journal Infectious Disease Modelling Research Progress , " the most effective way to contain the rise of the undead is to hit hard and hit often . "
Global warming may not be caused by humanity 's fossil fuel emissions , but could be due to changes in the Sun .
Research suggests that the magnetic flux from the Sun more than doubled this century .
As solar magnetism is closely linked with sunspot activity and the strength of sunlight reaching Earth , the increase could have produced warming in the global climate .
Solar Wind
This magnetic field is caused by the Solar Wind , a stream of particles given off by the Sun which fills the solar system .
The Solar Wind brings the Sun 's magnetic field into space
Evidence from before the space age suggests that the magnetic field is 2.3 times stronger than it was in 1901 .
Scientists do not doubt that the increased magnetic field results from a more energetic Sun .
Their problem is that the effect of these increases on the Earth is unknown .
Not our fault ?
The research is published in Nature and in the same journal Professor Eugene Parker , of the Laboratory for Astrophysics and Space Research , University of Chicago , comments that it could explain global warming .
He notes that the increased solar activity has occurred in parallel with an increase in carbon dioxide in the Earth 's atmosphere .
And it may not be a coincidence , he says .
Professor Parker suggests that the Sun 's increased activity caused the Earth 's global temperature to rise and that in turn warmed the oceans .
Warmer oceans absorb less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
So a warmer Earth has more of the so - called greenhouse gases .
Humanity 's burning of fossil fuels may therefore not be the cause of global warming .
Perilous plans
Professor Parker adds that that more research must be done about the Sun 's role in global warming before drastic action is taken here on Earth .
" It is essential to check to what extent the facts support these conclusions before embarking on drastic , perilous and perhaps misguided plans for global action , " he says .
Measurements of the magnetic field are not the only evidence for the Sun 's variable influence on the Earth .
The planet went through a " little ice age " during the 17th Century , at a time when very few sunspots appeared on the surface of the Sun .
And the so - called " medieval maximum " was a period of warmer than average global weather in the 12th Century .
Astronomers believe that the Sun was slightly brighter at that time .

Belgian architect Axel Enthoven has designed a mobile holiday home that resembles the Sydney Opera House .
Called Opera , the canvas holiday home unfolds from a trailer and includes two beds , a toilet , hot and cold water , LED lighting and a mobile hob .
It is handmade and fitted out with materials including hardwood , stainless steel and leather .
The design will be on show at the Design at Work trade fair in Kortrijk , Belgium , next month .
Here 's some more information from Enthoven :
--
Multiple award - winner Axel Enthoven designs new mobile holiday home
Opera offers freedom in nature with 100 percent luxury
It is not a tent , not a caravan and not a motor home .
The new mobile holiday home designed by Axel Enthoven has been christened Opera for its striking shape , reminiscent of the Sydney Opera House .
The subtitle chosen is Your Suite in Nature to suggest the best of hotel rooms , but in the heart of nature in this case .
The Opera allows you to stay in the most beautiful places , but with the luxury of a wine cabinet , warm - air heating , espresso bar and an enclosed teak veranda .
This nomadic , contemporary living tent offers the quality of a luxury yacht combined with the outdoor feeling of camping under canvas .
The Opera will be presented for the first time at the Design at Work trade fair in Kortrijk in December .
The finishing touches are currently being put to the first Operas , which are being made completely by hand in Geldrop in the Netherlands .
Only first class materials like hardwood , stainless steel and leather are used in production .
The dimensions of the Opera are magical .
When it has opened and levelled itself by electric power – inside 5 minutes and without tent pegs , stabilizer jacks and loose tent poles – what you see is a residence measuring 7 metres long , more than 3 metres wide and 3.5 metres high with every conceivable luxury : two first class and electrically adjustable beds that become one with a single simple movement , hot and cold water , ceramic toilet , LED lighting and a mobile hob and barbecue , for example , for cooking outside .
An exclusive , small number of Operas will go into production in 2010 .
The mobile holiday home will be supplied with what is known as the Opera Guide , which presents a selection of exclusive sites with information about good restaurants and picturesque destinations in the surrounding area .
The Opera was conceived and developed by Rob Vos , in partnership with a consortium of investors .
Vos previously more than made his mark in the automotive industry .
The designer of the Opera is Axel Enthoven , who has won more than 25 international awards in eight different countries , possibly the most important of which was the Belgian Henri van der Velde Career Prize .
Enthoven has been Professor and head of the department of Man & Mobility at the Academy of Industrial Design in Eindhoven since 1989 .
Previous to this , he held an appointment as a visiting professor at the National Institute for Architecture , Construction Engineering and Urban Planning in Antwerp .
Axel ’s firm , Enthoven Associates , has designed more than 1700 products and has offices in Paris , Eindhoven and Antwerp .
The Opera will be presented for the first time at the Design at Work trade fair in Kortrijk from 8 to 10 December inclusive .
“ No man ever steps in the same river twice ,
For it ’s not the same river
And he ’s not the same man . ”
– Heraclitus
You start by driving all the way to the end of Kaluanui road , and then find the gap between multi-million dollar houses that goes up the mountain .
Gravel , rock and red dirt greet you as you step onto the path which winds up the side of the Koolau range .
This is Mariner ’s Ridge – one of my favorite hiking trails on the island of O’ahu .
From the summit you can see across the entire east side of the island and the ocean .
This is n’t just a story about working out and getting into nature however : hiking , and the passage of time on the trail , has taught me a lesson I ’d like to share with you today .
Years Ago
When we first hiked the trail :
The dirt path was about 3 feet wide .
was about 3 feet wide .
The forest floor was a bed of pine needles
was a bed of pine needles
The trail near the summit – nothing but dirt
Months Ago
After a few months when we hiked the trail :
The dirt path had eroded a little and widened
had eroded a little and widened
The forest floor had little rocks and pebbles in the bed of pine needles
had little rocks and pebbles in the bed of pine needles
The trail near the summit – little plants were growing
Present Day
Still more time has passed , and the latest I have seen on the trail :
The dirt path is a 2 - 3 feet deep trough , with rocks everywhere .
is a 2 - 3 feet deep trough , with rocks everywhere .
The forest floor is even more rocky
is even more rocky
The trail near the summit – covered in greenery
The Opportunities You Have
Do you see the pattern in my observations ?
The trail is never the same .
There is constant change – and if I was to bring you on the trail today , we would have a fantastic experience – but you will never be able to see the trail that I have seen , because that trail is gone .
This trail represents your life .
Every day you are faced with dozens of little choices , opportunities hidden in between all the day - to - day moments in your life : and you have the power to choose whether to take advantage of each moment – or you can choose not to .
Every opportunity is beautiful , unique – and available only to you ; nobody else .
Not So Second Chances
Any chance you choose not to take however , is lost forever .
The trails and chances in front of us are forever living , forever changing , and just like if I am not hiking on any single particular day , I will never see the uniqueness of the trail on that single day – so too if a moment passes you by , that same moment will never come again .
There is no second chance .
There are many near second chances , but each moment is with us once , never to return again .
The trail , and the path that your life takes , waits for noone .
If you choose to wait , and hike it tomorrow , it will be different – and the opportunities you would have had today will be lost forever .
Embrace and enjoy the chances you have in your life – and do n’t worry about what other people day or do .
Your life is yours to lead : and only you get to see your unique opportunities .

A neutron star is born : Stellar core just 12 miles across spotted 11,000 light years away
An infant neutron star , the super - dense core of a stellar explosion , has been observed for the first time .
The 12.4 mile - wide object is the youngest object of its kind ever discovered , having appeared just 330 years ago .
It has been cloaked in mystery since it was identified as a powerful X - ray source in 1999 .
Astronomers now know the source is a neutron star 11,000 light years from Earth at the centre of the supernova Cassiopeia A .
This supernova was captured by Nasa 's Chandra X - Ray Observatory .
The neutron star is the blue dot at the centre of the picture
Neutron stars are the super - dense compact cores of massive stars whose outer shells have been blasted away in violent explosions at the end of their lives .
Compressed tightly by gravity , they are composed almost entirely of neutrons , sub-atomic particles with no electric charge that form part of atoms .
One teaspoonful of material from a neutron star would weigh a billion tonnes .
The newly identified neutron star has a unique carbon atmosphere just four inches thick .
Britain 's first Astronomer Royal , John Flamsteed , is believed to have observed the supernova that spawned it in 1680 .
Position of the neutron star in Cassiopeia .
The 12.4 mile - wide object has been cloaked in mystery since it was identified as a powerful X - ray source in 1999
Astronomers studied the supernova using the Chandra X - ray space telescope launched by the American space agency Nasa in 1999 .
Every other neutron star identified by scientists has been much older .
It is hoped the object will reveal more clues about the role exploding stars play in building the Universe .
Heavy elements flung out into space by supernovae end up in the rocks of planets such as the Earth .
Even the human body is largely composed of stardust .
Professor Craig Heinke , from the University of Alberta in Canada , who co-led the new research published in the journal Nature , said : ' The discovery helps us understand how neutron stars are born in violent supernova explosions .
' This neutron star was born so hot that nuclear fusion happened on its surface , producing a carbon atmosphere just 10 centimetres thick . '
Scientists are intrigued by the star 's carbon atmosphere which is just 10 cm thick .
This compares to our own atmosphere which is 100km

To believe that the Legg Inquiry would draw a line under the expenses fiasco must rank as one of the Prime Minister 's most fatuous judgements .
The most junior observer of the parliamentary scene knows that this saga is going to run right up to the General Election campaign .
Worse still , it will continue to ricochet into the new Parliament .
The Tory Prime Minister Harold Macmillan , asked why his government was so regularly destabilised , remarked , " Events dear boy , events " .
The pathway between now and the general election is strewn with such expenses events .
Let 's first take the Legg Inquiry .
MPs have until Monday to question Sir Thomas Legg 's conclusions .
Some MPs are being asked to repay money because of arbitrary decisions which he has made retrospectively .
Equally important are the many factual errors in Sir Thomas 's auditing .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Legg will then send his report to the Commons Members ' Estimate Committee , and those MPs who still feel aggrieved are likely to try and make representations to the Committee .
That will only add to the series of grandstanding events .
Then , little appreciated , will be the reports of the Standard and Privileges Committee that is inquiring into some of the worst abuses .
The Committee will need to produce a report , like they have done with Tony McNulty and Jacqui Smith , every couple of weeks if its backlog of cases is to be cleared before the general election .
Hard on the heels of the initial Legg findings comes the Kelly report on the future of MPs ' expenses .
Sir Christopher will publish his report on Wednesday – the eve of the gunpowder plot 's anniversary .
Sir Christopher has been schooled in what public service is about rising to the near apex of the civil service .
Yet if the official leaks are an accurate guide of what is to come on Wednesday , Kelly will make it even more difficult to live a public life , split between Westminster and our constituencies .
Much more important , Kelly is unlikely to face the fundamental non-alignment of MPs ' pay : where MPs believe they should be placed in the salary hierarchy and where , at the moment , most of our voters wish to place us .
This is where the root of voters ' incomprehension and anger lies .
Back in the early 1960s the sociologist W C Runciman wrote a seminal work entitled " Relative Deprivation and Social Justice " .
Runciman wanted to explain why , when some people were so very rich , it was that the vast majority of us made so few claims .
Runciman explained this paradox by bringing into play the idea of the " notch group " – the social group that are placed just above our own status .
It was to this group which all of us made reference when considering whether other people 's circumstances were fair or not .
People did not look towards the top when making a judgement on the fairness or otherwise of our rewards hierarchy .
The media 's unprecedented and sustained campaign against the appalling abuses by MPs of their expenses has shifted Runciman 's " notch group " .
Now our rewards are firmly in the gaze of our constituents .
They do n't like what they see .
The distribution of income in this country is such that there is a huge tail towards the bottom end .
And most of our constituents find themselves earning below and often well below the mean income .
Viewed from where our constituents stand in the economic hierarchy , we as MPs have far too much of the cake .
The position looks very different if one is standing in the shoes of an MP .
Most MPs are educated to inherit a middle - class job – their notch group are senior teachers , doctors , police officers , lawyers or journalists .
MPs see their income in relation , to their friends and acquaintances who are similarly educated and who are part of the minority of the population with incomes above , and often well above , the mean .
The source of the new conflict will be between how MPs evaluate their worth and where many of our constituents place us when they undertake a similar analysis .
MPs feel hard done by in that their rewards have not kept pace with other professional groups to which they naturally make a comparison .
In stark contrast is the judgement of our constituents , many of whom budget brilliantly on a household income of a third of what MPs take home .
Kelly , it appears , will do nothing whatsoever to begin to reconcile what apparently are two irreconcilable positions .
Not to begin to reconcile them will result in continual turf warfare between voters and MPs stretching away into the far distant future .
The results will be serious and go way beyond the personal sense of humiliation that most MPs now feel .
This dismal state of affairs is compounded by a total failure of political leadership .
David Cameron has mesmerised the Prime Minister over this issue .
Anything Cameron does Brown tries to do better .
Each time he fails miserably .
The Commons is also in desperate need of an exceptional Speaker who has the courage to stand up to the hue and cry of the media .
This crisis is now deeply damaging our democracy .
Just as Speaker Lenthall defined his role in facing down the Monarch , so we now need a Speaker who has the courage , judgment and ability to be able to defend in the media the role of MPs while condemning the appalling and indefensible excesses of some .
Furthermore , who amongst the next generation , with the range of qualities necessary to be a good MP , is going to step into this political maelstrom ?
Here , beyond the thrill of baiting MPs , lies the deadly threat to our democracy .
Political parties will always be able to attract more than enough placemen .
But democracy can only prosper in the longer run if some of the best of each generation take public office .
As the current debate charges on , devouring an increasing number of souls on its way , my guess is that the quality of MPs will have fallen even lower when the public marks the next House of Commons .
Frank Field is Labour MP for Birkenhead ; www.frankfield.co.uk
George Osborne , the shadow chancellor , delivered an economically illiterate , and fear - mongering , rant to the Tory conference claiming that Britain is drowning in a sea of debt .
As veteran economic commentator Samuel Brittan pointed out last week , this is sheer economic nonsense .
Brittan wrote :
The British political classes are going through one of their occasional bouts of masochism , with party leaders vying with each other on the theme of who can cut public spending faster and more effectively …
My own bottom line is that all this is in response to a largely imaginary budget crisis .
If we have a normal economic recovery the red ink will diminish remarkably quickly .
If we do n't , it wo n't and wo n't need to .
This good sense contrasts with the shadow chancellor , who did not say a word about how he would restore economic growth , the real key to healthy public finances .
He should not be allowed to get away with it .
There is an iron law in politics – the party that sets the agenda wins .
A year ago , Labour was rising in the polls as it set a clear political agenda : the global financial crisis could only be addressed by massive state intervention .
Thatcherism , the real ideology of the Conservative party , was shattered throughout the world .
That does not mean the government 's response was entirely right .
It was not .
It unnecessarily bailed out bank shareholders , at vast cost to the population without even taking real control of the financial institutions it now effectively owns .
State intervention was the right policy , but bankers and their shareholders should have been left to enjoy the downside of the free markets whose merits they had extolled for so long .
The government should have let their shares values collapse and then taken them over at virtually zero cost , while exercising real control to restore lending in the economy .
Partly as a result of this hugely expensive mistake , which Osborne went out of his way to support , and partly caving into concerted pressure , the government has now handed much of the agenda back to the Tories , by accepting the false argument that the critical issue facing the British economy is to cut public spending .
In reality , claiming that cutting public spending is the main issue facing the country , makes as much as a doctor focusing purely on the symptoms rather trying to cure the disease which causes them .
The position of public finances has deteriorated for two reasons .
First , because bailing out the bankers and their shareholders is projected to cost a mind - boggling 9.5 % of GDP in the current financial year .
Second , because the worst collapse in economic growth since the second world war has seen tax revenues fall by a projected 3.4 % of GDP this year .
In other words , as in any serious recession , tax revenues have fallen with output , profits and employment , while immense sums have been transferred from taxpayers to bank shareholders .
These two items , the fall in tax revenues and the bankers ' bailout , far outweigh the rise in inevitable rise in state benefits as people lose their jobs .
Public sector pay and pensions have literally nothing to do with the deterioration in public finances yet the Tories want to make them the scapegoats .
The only way out of the crisis , including the deterioration in public finances , is not cuts or attacks on public sector pay , which will make a bad situation worse , but a restoration of economic growth .
That requires tackling its real cause , a huge drop in private investment .
If we take the components of demand in the economy , up to the first quarter of the year , private consumption fell 1.8 % , government consumption rose just 3.7 % but investment fell by a massive 14.7 % .
This trend has continued .
In the second quarter business investment was fully 28.2 % lower than in the same period last year .
The only way to stabilise public finances is to restore economic growth , and the only way to do that drastically raise the level of investment in the economy .
That requires full control of the banks and literally ordering them to resume credit at affordable interest rates and direct state intervention into the sectors of the economy where the investment collapse is most calamitous , above all , house building .
Within that framework , wasteful public spending , that does nothing to benefit either the economy or the population , should be cut – the Trident programme should be abandoned , defence spending cut to the same share of the economy as Germany , ID cards and other grotesquely expensive gimmicks should all go .
Labour must seize back the political agenda from the Tories by explaining that the top priority is to restore investment and growth which in turn will , over time restore , public finances .
Otherwise we have a race to the bottom , with parties competing to promise more and more savage attacks on public sector pay , older people and everyone else who depends on public spending .
If Labour stops bending to the Tories on cuts and sets its own clear agenda for investment and growth , the general election will be anything but the forgone conclusion even many Labour politicians now predict .
The ebb and flow of combat in Battlefield : Bad Company 2 , currently in beta test for PlayStation 3 , feels immediately familiar .
That 's because Electronic Arts ' DICE studio has been tweaking , polishing and reworking its formula for goal - oriented , first - person combat since 2002 .
Just this summer , Battlefield 1943 re-familiarized us with this particular brand of brawl , where vehicles , air strikes and stationary weapons help create a heightened sense of chaos .
Bad Company 2 does n't feel quite as harried .
The fights are slightly less gonzo .
Maybe that 's because were no manned aircraft in the one level being tested in the beta .
The air combat in 1943 made the game incredibly unpredictable .
One second , you'd be creeping up on an enemy encampment , the next you'd be pulverized by a kamikaze pilot .
I 'm sure choppers , which will be included in the final version of Bad Company , will bring back some of that craziness .
Arica Harbour is a linear battleground that sprawls from a high desert encampment down through an abandoned village and across a bridge to a train depot .
Americans have four positions to attack and destroy .
Russian defenders must resist the push .
I found myself sticking to the Engineer class , sneaking up behind enemy tanks to take them out with a rocket - propelled grenade .
As I played , I unlocked better weapons and a few character upgrades , like the ability to carry more ammo .
If you 've even touched Modern Warfare , the upgrades will feel instantly familiar .
There 's a little less going on here – Bad Company 2 ( at this point , at least ) does n't have any of the purely aesthetic rewards that Modern Warfare 2 does .
But while the rewards are fewer and farther between , they still compel you to keep going .
I played the same map over and over again , hoping to power up my Engineer 's tank - busting power .
Finally , I earned the right to lay down anti-tank mines .
For my first couple of spawns as a defender , I chose the mines as my kit loadout .
I spent a life or two setting up a deadly nest of explosives anywhere an enemy tank would enter our perimeter .
Then on my next spawn I switched from mines to the standard rocket - propelled grenade .
My worst enemies were snipers , guys in ghillie suits who picked at me from positions on the outskirts of the maps .
Die enough at some jerk 's hands and they 'll become your " Nemesis . "
Seek them out and take revenge and the experience reward for the kill will be greater .
I used the word " linear " earlier when describing the Arica Harbour map .
Do n't take that as an insult .
I like the way the corridor of playable real - estate forces players to create a line , a distinct front where a good part of the battle takes place .
Flanking feels more meaningful when you can tell exactly where the enemy is or wants to be .
Storming a position feels that much better when you do it with four or five allies at your side .
The Battlefield : Bad Company 2 beta test is currently open to those who pre-order the game .
The retail version of the game is due in March 2010 .

Mabul generally sells six copies of the book in a day Booksellers touting their wares amid the heavy traffic in the Bangladeshi capital , Dhaka , have discovered an unusual best - seller .
Adolf Hitler 's autobiography manifesto Mein Kampf is selling as well as Dan Brown 's latest novel , The Lost Symbol .
The street vendors in Dhaka are found at every major road junction and intersection .
Most of the sellers are young boys and many compete with beggars to attract the attention of motorists .
Last week , Mein Kampf did unusually well because many bought the book to give it away as an Eid present .
' All the rage ' Mabul , 15 , is among many boys who risk the chaos of Dhaka 's roads to earn a living selling pirated copies of popular paperbacks .
Among his offerings are The Audacity of Hope by Barack Obama , the 9/11 Commission Report - Omissions and Distortions by David Ray Griffin , The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy and copies of Mein Kampf ( volumes one and two ) .
" For some reason Hitler 's book is all the rage among educated people - on a typical day I can sell as many as five or six , " Mabul told the BBC .
Hitler is not as popular as Dan Brown or Amartya Sen among Dhaka 's motorists and their passengers , but there is a constant demand for his book .
" I think it 's because many people have seen Hitler in films and want to know more about him . "
Mabul earns up to 1,000 taka ( $ 8 ) a day in his job , usually working eight hours a day for six days a week .
He says that the best time to sell books is when traffic is at its heaviest , in the morning and evening rush hours .
When it is gridlocked , some people appear to buy his books because they are bored and there is nothing else to do .
Career path Nearly all the books Mabul sells are photocopies of books he has bought from dealers - and in some cases the photocopying is not of the highest quality .
The maps in his Lonely Planet guide to Bangladesh , for example , are difficult to read and of poor quality .
Yet despite the dubious legality of his career path , Mabul and his friend Aminul - who has the use of only one arm - typify the entrepreneurial spirit for which many Bangladeshis are renowned .
" If I did n't do this job I would have no income - it's as simple as that , " said Aminul , as he proffers a copy of Monica Ali 's latest novel .
" It 's not easy being disabled and selling books in a Dhaka traffic jam .
Several times we come close to getting run over . "

Have you ever bowled a string of strikes that seems like it came out of nowhere ?
There might be more to such streaks than pure luck , according to a study that offers new clues as to how the brain learns from positive and negative experiences .
Training monkeys on a two - choice visual task , researchers found that the animals ’ brains kept track of recent successes and failures .
A correct answer had impressive effects : it improved neural processing and sent the monkeys ’ performance soaring in the next trial .
But if a monkey made a mistake in one trial , even after mastering the task , it performed around chance level in the next trial — in other words , it was thrown off by mistakes instead of learning from them .
“ Success has a much greater influence on the brain than failure , ” says Massachusetts Institute of Technology neuroscientist Earl Miller , who led the research .
He believes the findings apply to many aspects of daily life in which failures are left unpunished but achievements are rewarded in one way or another — such as when your teammates cheer your strikes at the bowling lane .
The pleasurable feeling that comes with the successes is brought about by a surge in the neurotransmitter dopamine .
By telling brain cells when they have struck gold , the chemical apparently signals them to keep doing whatever they did that led to success .
As for failures , Miller says , we might do well to pay more attention to them , consciously encouraging our brain to learn a little more from failure than it would by default .

When the balloon boy story broke last week - about the 6 - year - old who was supposed to be helplessly soaring through Colorado in a balloon - there were lots of reactions .
But Marin contractor Dan Nowell had the most unusual .
Been there .
Done that .
In 1964 , Nowell was a skinny 11 - year - old who volunteered to help launch a hot air balloon in Mill Valley .
But when the balloon abruptly lifted off , his fingers became entangled in the rope .
As a horrified crowd of 200 spectators watched , the sixth - grader from Tamalpais Valley Elementary School was hoisted 3,000 feet into the air .
" People still refer to me as the Balloon Boy , " Nowell said .
" My kids got pretty tired of it over the years .
I did get some interesting phone calls and e-mails last week .
I said , ' Somebody is trying to steal my thunder . ' "
Unlike the kid from Colorado , whose parents face fines and charges for manufacturing the story , Nowell 's experience was real and captured the nation 's attention before news helicopters , Twitter , and cable news networks came to be .
" The most extraordinary thing was the power of the press , " Nowell said .
" I got letters from all over the world addressed to ' Balloon Boy . ' "
The basics are pretty simple .
Nowell and some of his friends rode bikes to a field near Tamalpais High School on a Saturday morning in April to see the balloon .
When they arrived , someone asked if they could hold a rope for the launch .
Nowell , last in line , wrapped the rope around his left hand , but over the roar of the hot air burner , did n't hear the command to cast off .
' I could n't let go '
As his feet flew off the ground , one of his father 's friends grabbed his legs and tried pulling him down .
The yank was n't strong enough to bring the balloon back , but it did cinch the rope tightly around four fingers of his hand .
" I could n't have let go if I had wanted to , " Nowell said .
" It was almost like a dreamlike experience .
As the people on the ground got smaller and smaller , all I wanted was to do anything I could to relieve the pain . "
Nowell says it hurt so much he was trying to reach his pocketknife , thinking he would cut the rope , even if it meant dropping from the sky .
Balloonist notices at last
Meanwhile , up in the basket , balloonist William Berry of Concord was utterly unaware that he had a passenger .
The racket from the hot air burner kept Berry from hearing Nowell yelling .
It was n't until he reached 3,000 feet that he turned off the burner and looked over the side to see a boy hanging from a rope .
According to media lore , the first thing Nowell shouted up was , " Sir , could you please help me ? "
It seems a little hard to believe he would be so polite , but Nowell is n't about to ruin a good line now .
Is that really what he shouted ?
" Um ... sure , " Nowell said .
Berry managed to set the balloon down in a backyard in Tamalpais Valley .
Nowell crashed into a plum tree but landed safely .
His 10 - minute flight was over , but the really wild ride was just beginning .
He was on the front page of The Chronicle the next morning , and that was just the start of it .
He fielded interview requests , made the news wires , and even was flown to New York to appear on the nationally televised game show " To Tell the Truth . "
" I did n't have any psychological scarring from the event , " he said .
" I even went up in a balloon again with the same pilot . "
A few days of recovery
Nor did he have any physical scarring .
He had some numbness in his left hand for a while , and his fingers were packed in ice for a few days , but now he says he 's perfectly fine .
" I even think my arms are the same length , " he said .
( CNN ) --
Two fingers cut from the hand of Italian astronomer Galileo nearly 300 years ago have been rediscovered more than a century after they were last seen , an Italian museum director said Monday .
They were purchased recently at an auction by a person who brought them to the Museum of the History of Science in Florence , suspecting what they were , museum director Paolo Galluzzi said .
Three fingers were cut from Galileo's hand in March 1737 when his body was moved from a temporary monument to its final resting place in Florence , Italy .
The last tooth remaining in his lower jaw was also taken , Galluzzi said .
Two of the fingers and the tooth ended up in a sealed glass jar that disappeared sometime after 1905 .
There had been " no trace " of them for more than 100 years until the person who bought them in the auction came to the museum recently .
" I was very curious , " the Galluzzi said .
" There is a description from 1905 by the last person to have seen these objects .
It provides us with a very detailed description of the container and the contents inside , " Galluzzi explained .
The jar " matches in every minute detail " the description , Galluzzi said .
But by the time the urn went on sale , the label saying what was inside had been lost , so the sellers and the auctioneer did not realize its significance .
" Everybody knew there were fingers and a tooth , but the people preparing the auction did n't know it was Galileo , " Galluzzi said .
The owner who bought the fingers wants to remain anonymous , Galluzzi said , so the museum is not giving more details about who sold them or when .
The museum plans to display the fingers and tooth in March 2010 , after it re-opens following a renovation , Galluzzi said .
The museum has had the third Galileo finger since 1927 , so the digits will be reunited for the first time in centuries , he added .
Removing body parts from the corpse was an echo of a practice common with saints , whose digits , tongues and organs were revered by Catholics as relics with sacred powers .
There is an irony in Galileo 's having been subjected to the same treatment , since he was persecuted by the Catholic Church for advocating the theory that the earth circles the sun , rather than the other way around .
The Inquisition forced him to recant and jailed him in 1634 .
The people who cut off his fingers essentially considered him a secular saint , Galluzzi said , noting the fingers that were removed were the ones he would have used to hold a pen .
" Exactly as it was practiced with saints of religion , so with saints of science , " Galluzzi said .
" He was a hero and a martyr , keeping alive freedom of thought and freedom of research . "
He said it was little surprise that the 18th century followers of Galileo would have mimicked the practice of those who persecuted him .
" The behavior of people adhering to one pole of these antagonisms is often much like those on the other pole , " he said .
It is not yet clear whether enough organic material remains in the newly discovered fingers for DNA testing , Galluzzi said , but if there is , it could shed light on the blindness that afflicted Galileo late in his life and his final illness .
Galluzzi is convinced the find is genuine .
If it was a fake , " would you have sold it at very low cost at an auction ?
All the story is so convincing I cannot think of a reason not to believe it , " he said .
Galileo Galilei invented the telescope -- among many other achievements -- which enabled him to discover that the planet Jupiter has moons .
He became the foremost advocate of Copernican astronomy , which denied that the earth was the fixed center of the universe .
He died in 1642 .

A Law Firm That Takes A Personal Interest In Its Clients
At Heller Law Firm , APC , a personal injury law firm in Woodland Hills , California , we hear stories like the one about a 9 - year - old boy in Sacramento County whose family we represented .
The boy — we ’ll call him Michael — was invited to an after - school swim party for about 20 children .
The homeowner who hosted the party left the children by the backyard pool unattended .
Another boy pushed Michael into the pool and then jumped on top of him .
Stunned and frightened , Michael sunk in the deep end of the pool and was not pulled out of the water until at least five minutes later .
Michael was unresponsive .
He was rushed to the hospital where he was diagnosed with irreversible brain damage .
His parents discovered that day that their son would be in a coma and require 24/7 care for the rest of his life .
It ’s cliché to say that life can change in an instant .
Not for little Michael or his parents .
Our thorough investigation of the incident revealed that the boy who pushed Michael into the pool was known to have behavioral problems at school and picked fights often .
This boy ’s parents were aware of his aggressive propensities and failed to either stay at the party to monitor their son or warn a responsible adult at the party about him .
We obtained a policy limits multimillion - dollar settlement for Michael from the insurance company of the homeowner who hosted the party and from the insurance company of the parents of the boy who pushed Michael into the pool .
Of course , in cases like Michael ’s , no amount of money can adequately compensate him or his family .
They had already suffered irreparable harm .
We ensured that the tragedy was not compounded by putting an undue financial strain on the family to pay medical bills and fund a lifetime of assisted care for Michael .
The money we obtained for Michael allowed his parents to provide the finest care required for the rest of Michael ’s life .
A while ago Julia O'Brien had a post where she noted that in our culture we use the word " Bible " to refer to instruction manuals of all kinds .
She suggested that as long as we keep labeling the Bible as such people will think of it as an instruction manual and avoid it as literature .
She 's right of course , but there 's an even bigger problem for those of us who are Christians .
The bigger problem is that people will think of the Bible as an instruction manual and ignore it as Scripture .
No , the two things are not the same .
The Bible is a collection of a wide variety of literature which was written over a very long period of history ( hundreds of years ) .
The primary unifying qualities of the Bible are that it all has to do with the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and that over the course of time these books came to be thought of as revelatory literature by the broad community of faith .
That is to say , the Bible is about God and it was " chosen " ( not in the sense of one time conscious decision , but in the sense of a long and organic progression ) by the Church .
The consequence of this is that the Bible has many witnesses that often stand in deep tension with one another .
There is tension between the prophets and the Torah , between the prophets and the lament literature , between the Apocalyptic literature and the Gospels , and between the letters of Paul and the catholic letters .
There is tension all over .
The Bible does not have one , single , easily summarized , unitary message .
It is not an instruction book .
Your Bible is not a bible .
I have heard it said that all biblical passages fall into two categories .
They are all either 1 ) promises , or 2 ) instructions .
Wrong .
Are there promises in the Bible ?
Sure .
Are there instructions in the Bible ?
Sure .
But there is a whole lot more as well .
There is poetry that describes pain .
There are narratives that tell tales of conflict and confusion , and of triumph and joy .
There are longing love letters .
There are instances of purest hate .
In the Bible you will find a wide variety of literary genres , a wide variety of themes , a wide variety of people , a wide variety of really almost everything .
That should n't be scary , but for some reason this scares evangelicals .
It scares us so much that we are n't allowed to critique the Bible , we are n't allowed to ask it difficult questions .
We accept it all dogmatically because we think it 's all dogmatic , but it is n't .
There is room to question and challenge the Bible .
Do you know how I know this ?
Because the Bible questions and challenges itself .
Ezekiel questions the Torah .
Lamentations questions Deuteronomy and the great deuteronomistic history .
Jesus questions the Law , even as he says that he does not set aside even one jot of it .
The great power and theological depth of the Scripture is found within these points of tension , and again within the tension between our lives today and the various parts of this ancient collection of books .
The Bible is like a stringed instrument in this respect .
It only works because of great tension .
Stop trying to take the tension out of the Bible .
If you take away the tension , smoothing over and dumbing down and making everyingthing instructions and promises , all you get is a poorly tuned instrument and really bad music .
After a very long day yesterday ( do n’t we say that every day ? ) , Team Internode did what they intended to do : set a new distance record for a production electric car .
Simon and Emilis making history
In the words of the man himself :
On Tuesday 27 October 2009 , Simon Hackett , Managing Director of Australian national broadband company Internode , who owns the only Roadster in Australia , has driven it with with co-driver Emilis Prelgauskas , to a distance of 501 km’s ( 313 miles ) on a single charge .
The world record - setting distance for a production electric car on a single charge was achieved as part of the Global Green Challenge ( http://www.globalgreenchallenge.com.au).
The car had about 3 miles of range left when the drive was completed .
The distance will be fully accredited by event officials in due course , and preparation for the record - setting drive included security sealing of the electric charge port door at departure and full on - road supervision of the vehicle during the drive .
The path driven was to the south from Alice Springs , in the Australian Northern Territory , and ended at a distance marker on the highway at a point 183 km north of Coober Pedy , in South Australia .
Internode ’s favourite road marker on the entire Stuart Highway
Congratulations , team !
We did it !

The devastation of the 1918 - 1919 influenza pandemic is well known , but a new article suggests a surprising factor in the high death toll : the misuse of aspirin .
Appearing in the November 1 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases and available online now , the article sounds a cautionary note as present day concerns about the novel H1N1 virus run high .
High aspirin dosing levels used to treat patients during the 1918 - 1919 pandemic are now known to cause , in some cases , toxicity and a dangerous build up of fluid in the lungs , which may have contributed to the incidence and severity of symptoms , bacterial infections , and mortality .
Additionally , autopsy reports from 1918 are consistent with what we know today about the dangers of aspirin toxicity , as well as the expected viral causes of death .
The motivation behind the improper use of aspirin is a cautionary tale , said author Karen Starko , MD .
In 1918 , physicians did not fully understand either the dosing or pharmacology of aspirin , yet they were willing to recommend it .
Its use was promoted by the drug industry , endorsed by doctors wanting to “ do something , ” and accepted by families and institutions desperate for hope .
“ Understanding these natural forces is important when considering choices in the future , ” Dr. Starko said .
“ Interventions cut both ways .
Medicines can save and improve our lives .
Yet we must be ever mindful of the importance of dose , of balancing benefits and risks , and of the limitations of our studies . ”
Google may be planning to give all of its apps and services a great do - over , creating a more unified experience across the different products .
None of Google 's biggest names is spared , starting with Gmail and moving to Docs and News , all of which will supposedly get a brand - new interface , very similar to Google Wave .
Even the search results page will be pretty drastically redesigned to bring it in line with the overall new theme .
If the leaked photos Engadget managed to get its hands on turn out to be accurate , Google Wave is just the first step and offers a glimpse of how most of Google 's apps will look and feel in the not - so - distant future .
The source of the screenshots says Google 's " goal is to provide a consistent experience throughout all Google Apps and blur the line between the browser and the website ( e.g. drag and drop , right - click , etc. ) . "
That sounds reasonable enough , it 's something that Google obviously has a great interest in and has been working towards for years .
It launched its very own web browser just to make its apps run faster and integrate better with the desktop and now it 's even launching its own operating system to take that even further .
As for the photos themselves , they do n't look obviously fake , though Engadget was n't able to verify the leak with any other source .
The design elements are coming straight from Wave , but the changes are more than just cosmetic , it looks like most of the elements will be more interactive , especially in Gmail .
That being said , Google is notorious for the seriousness it treats its designs and for the fact that changes like modifying a border 's thickness by even one pixel can lead to endless debates and studies at the company .
It 's true that Google constantly tweaks and updates its products and this includes design elements , but for the most part , the company has been very reluctant to make any radical change , especially to its search engine .
Most of Google 's interfaces are becoming somewhat long in the tooth , though , and , despite having some common elements , there is n't a clear common theme across all of them , so it will be interesting to see if Google really does have something like this cooking .
Since I became the first “ communities editor ” for The Globe and Mail newspaper in Toronto almost a year ago , I ’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what makes for a good community — a healthy community — and what makes for a bad one .
I ’ve looked at every newspaper I can think of and tried to figure out what works and what does n’t .
I ’ve looked at non-media communities like Metafilter and Slashdot and even ( so help me ) 4 chan .
I ’ve looked at research into real - world communities and how they evolve , and why some thrive and some die out .
There are all sorts of manifestations of community on news sites — blogs , wikis , etc. — but one of the most fundamental elements of community is reader comments .
Some media outlets only allow comments on certain stories ; some pre-moderate , while others wait for readers to flag unpleasant comments and then remove them .
Some sites do the moderating themselves ; others outsource to companies like ICUC in Winnipeg .
But everyone sees the value of comments , right ?
Wrong .
The reality is that — as Alfred Hermida of the University of British Columbia journalism school writes at MediaShift — many newspapers still see comments as some kind of necessary evil : a bone tossed to readers to help drive traffic , but something that produces little else of value .
Hermida writes about research presented at the recent Future of Journalism ’09 conference in Wales ( where he presented his “ Twitter as ambient journalism ” paper ) that said most journalists see comments as containing very little news — and mainly view them as a nuisance .
As Mike Masnick at Techdirt points out in a recent post , this kind of attitude is revealing .
What it says is that for most journalists and newspapers , having comments is n’t something fundamental or necessary — or even beneficial .
If they do n’t produce useful news , then many do n’t seem to see the point .
The idea that creating a real community around the news — or rather , enhancing and appealing to a community that already exists — might be valuable all by itself never seems to enter their minds .
( Some newspapers get it , however , including the Telegraph and the Guardian , and both have done an excellent job on the community front . )
Another thing that seems to escape many journalists is the direct connection between their own indifference to interacting with readers and the parlous state of their comments .
If my research has taught me anything — not to mention writing columns and a blog for 15 years — it is that the surest way to improve the tone of the debate in forums or comments is to get involved in them .
Writers who do , both at the Globe and elsewhere , uniformly say it has a significant effect on the civility of the comments they receive afterwards .
On top of that , there is almost always a pleasant surprise on the part of readers that a writer is actually responding .
Our comments routinely point us in the direction of new angles for stories , and in many cases commenters have become sources for future pieces .
They do fact - checking for us , which we should be grateful for .
And they let us know which stories they care about and which they do n’t , which is invaluable market research .
But those are n’t the only reasons why comments are important .
Giving people a place to talk about important issues has value in and of itself , and the more we restrict that and impose limits on it , the more we risk losing the trust of the people formerly known as the audience .
As Craig Newmark has noted , trust is “ the new black , ” particularly in media — by which I think he means that trust is the only competitive advantage we have , in an age when anyone can gather and publish a majority of the information found in any major newspaper , and in most cases can do it faster and cheaper .
Take a look at Net News Daily sometime .
Looks nice , does n’t it ?
That site was founded by two 12 - year - olds 13 - year - olds in their spare time .
The point is that if we see aggregating wire stories and posting witty headlines on them as our core competency , then we have already failed .
Kids are doing that .
[ UPDATE : Scott Campbell of Net News
Daily emails to note that he and his partner were 13 when they started the site , not 12 , and that they do some original reporting too .
Duly noted .
— Josh ]
All we have left is the trust that our readers — that our community — have in us .
And how do we gain and keep that trust ?
By telling them the truth — but also by listening to them and valuing their input , and making them an equal partner in what we are doing .
Only then will we get the kind of community that really matters .

This is an example of a laser wakefield simulated in a " Boosted Frame . "
Electrons ( colored tubes ) are injected and accelerated by surfing the wave ( blue surfaces ) generated by a laser pulse .

Using Einstein's theory of special relativity to speedup computer simulations , scientists have designed laser - plasma accelerators with energies of 10 billion electron volts ( GeV ) and beyond .
These systems , which have not been simulated in detail until now , could in the future serve as a compact new technology for particle colliders and energetic light sources .
Researchers at Instituto Superior Técnico of Portugal ( IST ) , the University of California at Los Angeles ( UCLA ) , and the U.S. Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) used Einstein 's principle that length and time scales change with the speed of the observer ( in this case , the simulator ) to incorporate otherwise intractable calculations into the simulations required to design these novel accelerators .
High - energy particle accelerators are used in many areas of science and technology , including fundamental physics exploration and discovery , medical science , chemistry , biology , and material science , among others .
In the past couple of decades , a new concept of acceleration based on laser ( or particle beam ) plasma interactions has been demonstrated , with the potential to greatly reduce the size and cost of the world 's largest atom smashers and to create very compact accelerators for a wide variety of applications .
In a laser wakefield accelerator ( LWFA ) , an intense , short laser pulse is sent through a column of tenuous plasma , generating a wave wake on which particles can surf to very high energies .
The acceleration gradients obtained are more than three orders of magnitude higher than conventional radio - frequency accelerators .
In the last five years , LWFA experiments have produced electron beams with energies from 100 million electron volts to 1 GeV within millimeter to centimeter distances .
At 1 GeV , an electron is traveling at 99.99999 percent of the speed of light .
The next decade promises tremendous improvements as a new generation of more powerful lasers becomes available , and the process becomes better understood .
It is at this point that numerical simulations play a critical role , not only to determine the optimal laser and plasma parameters , but also as a tool to explore new concepts and configurations .
The challenge , however , is that accurate one - to - one simulations of the next generation of laser wakefield experiments are not easily possible : it would take more than one year to perform a single simulation using standard techniques .
The difficulty arises from the necessity to resolve the laser wavelength of about one micron ( 1 millionth of a meter ) while simulating a laser propagating through a plasma that can be several meters long — distances that are more than six orders of magnitude apart .
To access this range of scales in reasonable computational times , researchers have successfully used reduced models .
These models , however , cannot capture some of the physics required for next - generation experiments .
Performing simulations in a frame of reference that moves close to the speed of light makes simulations of next - generation experiments possible .
By Einstein 's theory of special relativity , the laser pulse will stretch and the plasma will contract , which brings the scales of the two entities closer together .
This means that modeling an experiment in this " boosted frame " can be more than 1,000 times faster than a simulation in the standard " laboratory frame . "
Using this technique , scientists at IST , UCLA , and LBNL are now designing and simulating self - guided stages up to 12 GeV - and externally guided and injected stages up to 50 GeV .
These new kinds of numerical experiments enable the scientists to understand the new physical processes involved , to optimize experimental parameters , and to estimate the acceleration possible with the next generation of laser systems .
The new results show that laser wakefield acceleration with near term lasers could lead to compact , less expensive infrastructures for fundamental science research , for new accelerator technology development , and might potentially lead to a future particle collider at very high energies .

The French consider Scientology a cult .
From the BBC :
Prosecutors had asked for the group ’s French operations to be dissolved and more heavily fined , but a legal loophole prevented any ban .
Instead , a Paris judge ordered the Church ’s Celebrity Centre and a bookshop to pay a 600,000 - euro fine ….
Unlike the US , France has always refused to recognise Scientology as a religion , arguing that it is a purely commercial operation designed to make as much money as it can at the expense of often vulnerable victims , the BBC ’s Emma Jane Kirby reports from Paris .
Fast food is n’t the only thing .
Jaeger snacks on hard - boiled eggs these days .
Cymbala stopped taking along big chunks of meat after she choked on one while driving on the highway ; she ’s made the shift to sandwiches for long trips .
And Lynne Molnar , 56 , of Cambridge , ate oatmeal with nuts and fruit until a policeman pulled her over for a red - light violation ( a judge overturned the ticket ) and ordered her and her 11 - year - old daughter , Caroline , to throw away their cereal .
“ That ’s called littering , ’’ Molnar told him pointedly .
“ But once in a while , I would get a Frosty and that you just have to eat with a spoon ! ’’ says Jaeger .
“ Knees come in handy then . . . one hand for the cup , one hand for the spoon , and the knees for the steering wheel . ’’
Kent Lam of Randolph , 30 , likes bagels from Dunkin ’ Donuts .
Joan Jaeger , 58 , of North Attleboro , used to go for burgers “ because forks and spoons were tricky .
Not infrequently , that means eating , and for many of us , car fare is the stuff you pull up to a window to order .
Seventy percent or more of the Dunkin ’ Donuts shops in Massachusetts have drive - through windows ; 50 to 60 percent of McDonald ’s sales are made at drive - through windows , according to spokeswomen for the companies .
“ People just get in the car and think , ‘ I ’ll do what I have to do , ’ ’’ says Sergeant James Fitzpatrick of the Lowell Police Department ’s traffic division .
But the study lists other distractions , including daydreaming , personal hygiene , and eating , each of which accounted for 2.1 percent of the total .
Few of us are strangers to dining and driving , as well as other , more distracting habits on the road .
A 2006 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration blamed “ inattentive driving ’’ for 80 percent of all car accidents and 65 percent of near - misses .
Use of wireless devices accounted for 14.6 percent of the crashes , more than any other cause .
Last month the Obama administration banned federal and military personnel from texting while driving .
Sound strange ?
It should n’t .
Studies show that more people eat in their cars , more often , than ever before , according to Stephen Bailey of Tufts University , an associate professor of anthropology and nutrition - and the food we consider acceptable to eat while we ’re driving has changed .
Once we were a nation on wheels .
We ’re becoming a nation of meals on wheels .
Helen Cymbala , 54 , who lives in Boxford , tells the story of a woman she saw sipping espresso from a tiny china cup while driving in Cambridge .
“ She had her pinkie finger up in the air , ’’ Cymbala says , sounding amazed .
Northeastern University student Sam Maman , 19 , keeps one hand on the wheel while the other holds a slice of pizza .
“ You can manage it , ’’ says the Newton resident .

Carolyn Roesler , 45 , of Plainfield , Vt. , eats toast in her car while driving to work , even though “ there ’s always a possibility that you ’ll show up with a few crumbs on your chest . ’’
Emily Lapkin of Boston , 35 , still eats in her Saab - “ designed for Euros who would never dream of eating in their cars ’’ - even though when she first started driving she had an accident while eating a quesadilla .
“ The only thing worse than quesadillas [ are ] open - faced bagels with cream cheese , ’’ she says .
“ I once tried this and a hand - over - hand turn resulted in cream cheese all over the steering wheel . ’’
Since then , she has switched to supermarket sushi .
So why not sit down and eat later ?

Those reasons and more , according to the scientists .

Mary Douglas said a long time ago that food is not feed , ’’ says Bailey .
But while dining once also meant socializing , “ In the last 20 years or so there ’s been this tendency to make eating simply stuffing your stomach .
Basically what happened with fast food and eating in cars is , food has become feed again . ’’
Bailey says people are time - starved ; he also cites suburbanization and marketing as factors contributing to the trend .
“ The popular theory is that we ’re time - starved ; we just do n’t have enough time in the day , ’’ he says .
And that carries prestige : “ When we ’re multitasking , what we ’re thinking about is how important we must be to have to do all these things all at once .
. . . [ And ] the ultimate kind of multitasking is actually feeding yourself while you ’re doing other stuff . ’’
Suburbanization has meant longer commutes for many workers , and a study of truck drivers by Toyota found that has contributed to a view of the automobile as office and dining room .
“ People manage their lives out of their trucks , and I think that can be said for most automobiles nowadays , ’’ Bailey says .
Then there ’s marketing , which has widened our expectations about what we can eat in our cars , and made it easier to do so .
The standardization of mass - marketed food ( “ every Big Mac is the same as every other Big Mac , ’’ Bailey says ) makes it simple to eat more than snacks while we ’re driving .
As Maman says , “ You really do n’t need to look at your food while you ’re eating . ’’
Bailey agrees .
“ You can eat it without thinking about it .
Sandwiches and fries or chips and a drink and maybe a dessert of some kind - it is n’t very nutritious , but it is a whole meal . ’’
And it ’s one that he goes for himself .
Asked if he also eats behind the wheel , the professor says , “ Oh , God , yes . ’’
“ I can dissect this intellectually , ’’ he says , “ but I get sucked up by it . ’’

DUBLIN --
A premier Dublin golf club can continue to bar women from membership , the Irish Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in a discrimination case inspired by similar protests against men-only clubs in the United States .
In a split 3 - 2 judgment , Ireland 's top court ruled that Portmarnock Golf Club was not violating Ireland 's Equal Status Act , because that 2000 anti-discrimination law permits exceptions for exclusively male and female clubs .
The seaside club northeast of Dublin successfully appealed a 2004 Dublin District Court judgment that found Portmarnock in breach of the law -- and threatened to withdraw its bar license if it did n't give women equal access to the clubhouse .
The Equality Authority of Ireland pursued the case on behalf of the National Women 's Council of Ireland .
It filed a 2002 complaint following similar protests in America against the men-only membership of the Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia .
But in their majority judgment , the three Irish Supreme Court judges -- among them one woman -- noted that Ireland 's law permits clubs to restrict membership to one sex , if that club 's " principal purpose is to cater only for the needs of persons of a particular gender . "
Those needs included Portmarnock 's central purpose of social fraternization , they ruled .
Lawyers representing the club conceded up front that its membership policy discriminated in favor of men , but the Equal Status Act permitted this exception .
They noted that women could play the course as visitors on specific days and hours of the week .
One of the dissenting judges , Susan Denham , said her colleagues gave too little weight to the reality that golf was no more a " need " for men than for women , therefore any golf club barring a particular sex as members was breaking the law .
" Portmarnock Golf Club is exactly what its name says : a golf club in Portmarnock .
It caters for men and women in different ways , " she said , arguing that this was the essence of discrimination ..
An executive member of the Women 's Council , Therese Murphy , said lawmakers needed to close the loophole .
She said golf clubs were venues for power - brokering relationships important to businessmen and women alike .
" A lot more happens in golf clubs than playing golf .
It is about networking and camaraderie , " she said .
Irish broadcasters RTE interviewed an unidentified Portmarnock club member who welcomed the verdict .
The man said he did n't want women on the course because they would slow down the speed of play .
Ireland , a country of 4.2 million , has nearly 1,000 golf courses .
Portmarnock is among the most exclusive with about 1,300 members and visitors ' fees for an 18 - hole round set at $ 180 to $ 300 .
The wind - swept links course , founded in 1894 , is bounded on three sides by water .
Its only permitted female member is President Mary McAleese , Ireland 's symbolic head of state .
In Georgia , Augusta also continues to bar women .
The National Council of Women 's Organizations , which criticized the golf club 's men-only membership in 2002 , did n't file a lawsuit .

Worst miss in history of soccer ( football )
SOCCER ( FOOTBALL ) FAIL
This is video from Croatian first soccer league ( Europe ) , match Dinamo Zagreb – Cibalia Vinkovci .
Dinamo player Ilija Sivonjic missed goal from just 3 inches !
For me this is absolutely worst soccer miss ever !
What do you think ?
Last year I traveled more than I traveled in my entire life .
I ’ve been on 4 continents and circled the Earth 2 times by plane .
It was an exciting time , knowing my propensity for travel as a personal development tool , but it was also pretty draining .
Never having long distance trips until that was definitely a huge roadblock for me .
I had to learn on the fly ( sometimes , literally on the fly ) .
Somewhere between my 2nd and 3rd trip I started to write down some simple steps I should follow , sort of self directed tutorial .
For your information , long distance traveling means for me one to two weeks trips which includes at least a transcontinental flight longer than 7 - 8 hours .
Here is a ( hopefully incomplete ) list of tips I gathered last year .
Looking at it , I just know there is so much more to be explored , but I ca n’t avoid a feeling of satisfaction and fulfillment for already being in all the beautiful places I ’ve been so far .
If you ’re an experienced traveler , this list will look like common sense , but if you ’re just starting out you may find out some simple , practical , yet most of the time underrated advice .
Packing
If possible , you should automate as much as you can .
I ’m easily bored , so packing is just not my stuff .
Whenever I can put this on auto - pilot , I put it .
1. Make A Standard Packing List
And refine it every trip .
I do have a minimal packing routine and I always start by getting it done first .
After my minimum is done , I try to figure out what exactly I need in rapport to that specific destination : is it going to be clothing ?
Or maybe some specific medicines I should carry on ?
Sun glasses and sunscreen ?
I ’m usually done in one hour , regardless of the final destination .
2. Pack Light
Especially when you ’re going long distance try to understand that you can’t really take with you everything .
Packing light means to have a bare minimum and then a little bit of extra .
But not more .
Most of the stuff you ’ll need in case of an emergency will be available at the destination too , so instead of carrying too much with you , better have a little more cash .
3. Have At Least 5 Kilos Less Than The Airplane Limit
Usually , the maximum accepted weight for a bag is 20 kilos .
So , instead of trying to figure out how to reach that limit with more stuff from home , try to go with at least 5 kilos less .
You will badly need those kilos for stuff you ’ll got home from the destination .
On my first trip I had to actually leave some clothes to my friends to make room for some presents .
4. Load Your Digital Companion
I use my iPhone as my travel mate .
So , I make sure I load it with everything I need just as I pack my bag with clothes and personal hygiene stuff .
I put maps on the GPS app , audiobooks for the plane , make sure that I have enough space for photos and even load 1 or 2 movies just in case I get bored by the inflight entertainment system .
5. Take Some Meds
It ’s a good idea to have some light meds with you .
Depending on where you go , taking some prophylactic shots in advance is also a very good idea .
I usually carry some antibiotics , some bandaids and some digestive pills .
I stick them in a pocket of my personal hygiene bag and I only verify the expiration date each time I get on a new trip .
6. Have And Use A Local Dictionary
Again , I use my iPhone for that and it does a great job .
I have a number of dictionaries , especially for exotic countries , like Japan , or Thailand .
Whenever I get the chance I exercise my language skills with locals .
It ’s one of the best parts of my long distance travels .
And since I ’m not a native English speaker , I can also use a plain English dictionary as well .
7. Get An Universal Plug Adapter
They have different plugs in Europe , United States , Oceania or parts of Asia .
It ’s better to get an universal kit that would become part of your standard list above , especially if you ’re part of the digital nomads tribe , as I am .
You can get adapters for free during your stay in hotels but form the 3rd or 4th travel it ’s easier to just make it part of your baggage .
Planning
I like the feeling of randomly putting my finger on an Earth map , making that spot my destination .
But between that gesture and the actual plane take - off there ’s a little bit of extra action .
It ’s important and it ’s about planning .
1. Book Your Flight And Hotel Together
You will get some discounts if you do that and it ’s also easier to maintain the necessary documents .
Having all the reservations in one plastic envelope makes it easier to access them on crowded and / or hectic airports .
If your trip has multiple segments ( flights + hotels ) keep them in a separate plastic envelope .
2. Do n’t Create A Fixed Itinerary
Most of my long distance trips have been one week long .
It ’s a shame to stick into such a limited time as many attractions as you can even before landing there .
I usually go with my intuition and try to book some guided tours on the spot , if need will be .
But most of the time I ’m on myself .
It ’s far more flexible and much more fun .
3. Plan Your Transfer From Airport To Hotel In Advance
It ’s very important to solve your transportation from airport to the hotel ( or your accommodation of choice ) in advance .
Some of the airports can be pretty far ( Narita is 1 and a half hour to center Tokyo by train , for instance ) while others can offer limited on the spot transportation .
A smooth transition to the hotel will also have a positive effect on your entire trip .
4. Do n’t Plan Anything Important In The First 36 Hours
You ’ll be pretty tired after a 9 + hours flight , not to mention that jetlag will most likely give you a hard time .
I usually spend the first day and a half walking around the hotel , knowing the environment , finding local stores and transportation .
Once I know my way around the hotel and I have a decent amount of food supplies in my room , I can go out and experience more .
5. Get Roaming On Your Phone
It ’s far more convenient than buying local calling cards .
I use it because it helps me keep all the data in a central point , not mangling with several phones at once and also keeps me for making long , unnecessary calls .
On the other hand , when there ’s a need to make a call , I can do it instantly .
6. Budget Your Local Currency Leftovers
You will have local currency leftovers .
Meaning the small notes you end up with at the airport , when you ’re ready to leave that country and do n’t know when you ’ll going to be back again .
During my first long travels those leftovers were in the 70 - 80 USD range .
Quite a lot .
After a little bit of exercise I reduced them at around 15 - 25 USD , which is basically a decent meal at any airport restaurant .
7. Identify Human Connections At Destinations
Find them on the Internet , on discussion groups , on blogs .
Find some people you know in advance and try establish a connection with them .
Not only they will become useful guides but they will also enhance your overall experience of traveling .
It ’s not as much about visiting places as it is about making friends .
Destination
Knowing where you go is important , although keeping a little bit of mystery around is also pretty exciting .
But there are several things I learned to do before and sometimes right after I get to my destination of choice .
1. Get Info About The Food
If you ’re on a special diet , as I was back when I was a raw foodist , get as much information as you can in advance .
I overlooked this step only once , during my trip to Japan , and incidentally Japan is one of the most unsuitable places for a raw vegan to be .
I actually had to break my diet during that visit and even after , so now I ’m a little bit cautious on this one .
2. Assess Political Situation
I do n’t travel in hot areas of the world , but even if you do n’t do this on purpose , traveling long distance can get you close to hot areas ( if your plane has been rescheduled for instance and you have to connect on a different airport in a different country ) .
Assessing the political situation of the closest countries on your itinerary is a good idea .
3. Read Reviews On Travel Sites
But take them with a little bit of salt .
I use only a few of travel sites , wikitravel being the most important one .
Most of the time I ’m just trying to get in the vibe , know the local habits , the local geography and cultural norms , letting the actual discovery to occur once I ’m there .
4. Look Up The Itinerary on Google Maps
Especially on long distance trips this could be a very interesting activity .
When I first come to New Zealand I actually did n’t realize that I would have 2 10 + hours long flights .
The segment between Bangkok and Auckland seemed like a few hours , when in reality was 10 hours .
That made me a very loyal client to Google Maps ever since .
5. Follow Your Intuition
Do n’t always go for the famous places .
Risk your time a little .
The very best moments of my travels were the unexpected ones .
I searched for a floating market in Bangkok ( while the real floating market was 150 km away ) , got lost on some mountain roads while driving in Alps and got lost in a park near Danube Tower in Vienna .
6. Search For The High Points
Literally .
Every big city has a high point .
I ’ve been on Eiffel Tour in Paris , France , on Sky Tour in Auckland , New Zealand , on Danube Tower in Venna , Austria , on Tokyo Tower in Tokyo , Japan and so on .
There ’s something really special about climbing on those high points and see the city unfolding under your feet .
Flying
A big part of your long distance trip will be on a plane .
Do n’t overlook this because you can’t really sleep all the time .
Besides , there are a lot of interesting things you can do on a long distance plane if only to make sure you ’ll arrive at your destination in the best possible shape .
1. Request An Aisle Seat
Even if you ’re going to be bothered by other passengers to get up and down , it will be good for your body .
Not to mention that you have the freedom to get up and walk whenever you want .
Unless you really want to look at the Earth from 10.000 meters every minute of your 10 + hours flight , take an aisle seat .
2. Do n’t Oversleep
It ’s not good for your body .
Out of 9 - 10 hours of an average transcontinental flight , I found that maximum 3 hours of sleep are the best you can get .
Oversleeping will have a very strange effect on your body and will make your jetlag fighting a little bit difficult .
Try some light conversation instead .
3. Do n’t Abuse The Inflight Entertainment System
Every transcontinental plane has what they call an inflight entertainment system : movies , tv shows , documentaries , music or games .
From my experience one of the best combos is maximum 2 movies and 1 documentary per flight .
More than that is going to have quite an adverse effect on your brain .
Balance the entertainment flight with some sleep , light conversation and discrete physical exercise .
4. Exercise Your Muscles And Joints
Does n’t necessarily mean you ’ll have to run to the restroom and back every 15 minutes ( your flight attendants could be especially upset by such a behavior ) but do try to activate some groups of muscles every half an hour .
Your legs especially must be worked out , in a very discrete and effective way , but do n’t forget your shoulders and neck .
5. Get On The New Local Time
Once you ’re on the plane , set up your clock to the local time at the destination .
If you had at least 3 weeks between your trips , it ’s a good idea to get on the local time with 1 - 2 days in advance , in order to reduce some of the jetlag .
Regardless of that , once you are on the plane , think and live by the new time at the destination .
6. Prepare For Glitches
Flying is by far one of the safest and best organized ways of traveling , but this does n’t makes it perfect .
Even flights can be delayed , or technical problems may postpone your flight with several hours or days , or you can jump into a bird .
Be ready to face those situations and do n’t get panicked .
Eventually , you ’ll get there , that ’s all that counts .
7. Fully Recharge All Electronic Devices Before Getting On Board
You will need your kindle , your iPod or your laptop .
During the flight , your electronic devices can be a very good replacement of the inflight entertainment system , if you ca n’t find something you like .
Not to mention that you will need them functioning at your destination .
Of course , you must switch them off during landing and taking off .
8. Take Off Your Shoes
This is not a joke .
First time I saw some of my flight colleagues doing that I was quite surprised .
But after 3 hours of hurting feet I finally understand .
Do n’t worry about walking in your socks on the plane , it ’s much cleaner than you think and you ’ll get rid of those socks anyway .
Having healthy feet once you get down from the plane is so often underrated .
9. Keep Your Tickets And Passports Handy
Do n’t stick them to the bottom of your backpack or handbag .
Always keep them at hand especially when in the airport .
You will need them at security checkpoints , at boarding and sometimes during the flight when you will complete arriving cards ( various countries need some of those cards completed when you enter them ) .
10 . Keep Your Tickets And Vouchers Available
I book electronically most of the time so I do n’t really have tickets but receipts and itineraries .
I print them and I also print all the vouchers ( most of the time for airport to hotel transportation ) .
Do n’t underestimate the stress you ’ll experience in a foreign airport .
Make sure you can react fast to any request regarding your tickets or vouchers .
11 . Get A Name Tag For Your Bags
Many airlines are providing this at the check - out desks , but many still are n’t .
A name tag will have your exact name and address on it , gets attached to the bag handle and makes it much more easier to identify your baggage at the carousels .
Your bag may look very much like another bag and in this case the name tag is the only distinctive element .
12 . Keep The Flight Timetable Available
Again , I use my iPhone Notes app for that .
For each long segment I write down my flight number , my plane type and the expected duration of the flight .
It helps me gain a feeling of clarity in the middle of unknown surroundings .
You may put it in a notebook or on a piece of paper .
For me , it worked with the iPhone and helped me keep my head clear during 20.000 + km long flights .
13 . Airports Are Part Of The Trip
I always enjoy walking inside airports , watching people and trying to get a glimpse of the local lifestyle .
I do n’t take airports as transitory , tasteless points in my journey .
Whenever I can , I try to connect with people , to visit interesting places , to get in airport lounges or to capture beautiful pictures of planes taking off or landing .
14 . Hunt For Power Outlets
Some airports have designated places for charging electronic devices , some not .
Whenever I am at a coffee shop or in a waiting room , I hunt for the closest place to a power outlet .
And take it .
15 . Take An Extra Sweater On Board
Although many airplanes are providing light blankets , on long flights the temperature can get pretty low .
Better be prepared with an extra sweater .
When flying at 10.000 meters for more than 9 hours , the cold combined with the lack of humidity can be pretty nasty .
16 . Get Hydrated
The air in the plane cabin is extremely dry , due to the pressuring conditions .
It ’s very easy to get dehydrated but it ’s also very easy to avoid it .
Be sure to tell to flight attendants to get you water or juice every time you need it .
Some prefer to take some moisturing creme for the hands or face , I ’ve been ok without it , but your mileage may vary .
Accommodation
This is something really personal , so your choice may be different than mine , Regardless of the quality of the accommodations , and of the main goal of your trip , I found out that you will always need at least those 3 simple tips .
1. Look For Basic Hygiene
I usually book hotels when I know in advance where I ’m going .
In 99 % of the cases hotels are clean and safe .
But depending on the trip , budget and local context , I can book some bed and breakfast or even a backpackers hostel .
Whenever I have to choose on the spot , I usually ask to see the room in advance .
Saved a lot of frustration , many times .
2. Sleep Well
Do n’t overextend yourself by staying late , especially when you ’ve been jetlagged .
Sleep as much as you want , because you do n’t want to be hit by an unbearable need to sleep in the middle of a visit to some important attraction , or even when you ’re in a public spot , like a restaurant or coffee shop .
Assess the room in advance and ask if it ’s quiet and / or sleep friendly .
3. Make Human Connections
I split my accommodation between hotels , hostels and bed and breakfast facilities .
Every time I try to make some human connection with somebody there , being the concierge , the owner of the house or just some random sleeping colleagues in a backpackers hostel .
The next step for this will be of course coach surfing but I ’m not sure I ’m ready for it .
Yet .
Field Activities
This is what you ’re actually doing , the core of your trip .
Of course , it ’s entirely personal so the only tips here are related to your interaction with the world , and how to streamline it as much as possible .
1. Get Local Currency As Fast As You Can
If you can get it with you in advance , that ’s even better .
I travel mostly with EUROs and US dollars and that covers pretty much every part of the world .
Be aware that exchange offices in the airports are usually much more expensive than the bank offices in the town , or have some huge commission .
From my experience , it ’s always better to get local currencies at a local bank .
2. Update Your Itinerary Frequently
And by that I mean let your friends and followers in the digital world knowing where you are .
I am a digital media citizen and I do update my itineraries as often as I can ( meaning when I get some free wifi spots , data roaming being horrendously expensive everywhere in the world ) .
It ’s good not only for letting your closest ones that you ’re safe and sane , but also for personal branding .
I got a few interesting followers from each country I visited after some of my long distance travel tweets .
3. Know Your Surroundings
That goes hand in hand with the planning activity which says not to do anything important in the first 36 hours .
I use those hours to know : shops around , restaurants around , walking areas and public transportation areas .
If there ’s internet in my hotel room ( 99 % of the cases , that is ) I ’m also browsing some Google Maps around my accommodation address to see the big picture .
4. Buy Day Or Week Long Public Transportation Tickets
If your planning was good , you should know in advance the costs of public transportation .
In almost any of the cases , buying day long passes or even week long passes proved to be an incredible money ( and time ) saver .
Depending on the local context you may use some exotic transportation , like Thailand tuk - tuk ’s but do n’t rely on them for getting fast and safe at a certain destination .
5. You Ca n’t Have Enough Photos
Never .
Traveling long distance is such an eye opening experience , in every way you look at it .
I never know when I ’m going to be back there , so keeping a strong visual record will always help me remember the best I can .
Most of the time I use – again – my iPhone , but recently I took the habit of carrying with me a brand new Canon 450D .

That ’s it , I hope you found it useful .
If you have more , feel free to add them in the comments .
Living life as a holiday is one of the best ways to live life , after all . 🙂

The first - time homebuyer tax credit is one step closer to being extended .
Yesterday , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ’s office announced that Senate Democrats plan to extend the $ 8,000 credit and also provide additional benefits for a select group who already own residences .
In short , the proposal would extend the credit to home purchases under contract by April 30 , 2010 and it would be available to individuals earning up to $ 125,000 , or $ 250,000 for couples , up from $ 75,000 for individuals and $ 150,000 for couples under the current law , according to Bloomberg News .
The proposal would also let homeowners qualify for a $ 6,500 credit if they have lived in their residence for five years .
While this all could be good news for homebuyer ’s , the extension is still a ways from becoming a reality .
From the Associated Press :
Senators in both political parties were hoping to add both tax provisions to a bill that would give people running out of unemployment insurance benefits up to 20 more weeks of federal aid .
The Senate could vote on the overall bill as early as Thursday , but lawmakers were still haggling over several unrelated amendments Wednesday evening .

上記の報道があり、たくさんの人々がこれを鵜呑みにしたようだが、増加した事実はない。
8月22日の日記に書いたように、5月から、Winnyネットワークに対して、ランダムなIPアドレスをソースノードとした偽キーの散布が、目的不明ながら、何者かによって断続的に実施されている。これは、その後も継続しており、現在も続いている。8月22日の日記の図4のグラフを現時点のデータで示すと、以下のようになる。灰色で塗りつぶした区間が、偽キー散布の影響を受けた期間である。
青の線（下の線）は、クローラが1回巡回する間に受信したキーから抽出したノードの数で、これを過去24時間で累積したのが、黄色の線（中央の線）である。
ランダムIPアドレスの偽キーが散布されると、青の線も若干増加するが、その数は1000個程度（2%程度）なので、ほとんど目立たない。これが、24時間分蓄積されると、6万個ほどになるため、黄色の線では極端なピークとして現れている。
キー散布は、なぜか断続的に行われている ため、散布が行われなかった期間、つまり黄色の線の底辺部分を見ることで、実際のノード数の推移を推察できる
。しかしながら、10月に入ってから、キー散布が連続して行われているため、これでは増減を判別できない。
そこで、これまでのキーの観測記録を元に、偽キー由来と思われるノードを除外して再集計（30分を超えて2回以上現れることのなかったキーを除外して集計）してみた。これには長い計算時間を要すので、ひとまず9月20日以降の分だけを集計した。この間のキーの数は約46億個で、集計に48時間かかった。
その結果を以下の図3に示す。緑の線（上から3番目）がそれで、黄色の線から偽キーを除外したものである。
このように、実際のノード数は増加していない。（休日に多くなるのはいつも通り。）
緑の線と黄色の線の差が偽キーによる増分であり、緑の線と黄色の線が平行している部分（灰色でない区間）でもいくらか差があるのは、現れて30分以内に消えた実在ノードも一緒に除外されてしまったためと思われる。
灰色の区間が偽キー散布による影響を受けている期間であるが、そのうち、濃い灰色の区間は、偽キー散布が行われていた期間で、淡い灰色の部分は、偽キー散布が止まって以後、ノード数集計に影響が残る期間（散布中止から24時間後まで）を表している。
このグラフを、ネットエージェント社発表のグラフ（図4に引用）と比べてみる。
グラフの読み方として、私のグラフとネットエージェントのグラフでは、横軸の目盛りが1日ずれて見える点に注意が必要である。私のグラフで「10/08」の目盛りの値は、10月8日0時0分の時点での過去24時間のノード数であり、これは、ネットエージェント社のグラフでは、「10/7」の目盛りの値に対応していると思われる。
そうして見ると、ネットエージェントのグラフの値は、図3のグラフの赤の線（上の線）の、各日付の0時0分の目盛りの値に概ね一致している。このことから、ネットエージェントのノード数データは、ランダムIPアドレス散布の影響を除外できていないと考えられる。
そもそも、図4のネットエージェントのグラフだけ見て、「判決後にノード数が増加！」と書いてしまうメディアもどうかしている。「10/8」と「10/9」が平日なのに休日並みに多くなっているということなのだろうが、「10/5」や「10/1」も平日なのに同程度に多いわけで、おかしいと思わないのだろうか。（そして、それらは、図3の「10/09」「10/10」「10/06」「10/02」の部分であり、ちょうど偽キー散布によって水増しされていた日である。）
ところで、8月にこの事態について書いた際、偽キー散布について、「 Winny利用者が増えているということにしたい何者かが、ネットエージェント社のノード数発表の頃合いを見計らって、ノード数の水増しを謀っているのではないか」といった声が出ていたが、はたしてそれはどうだろうか。
私がそれを疑わずに、大学等での実験ではないかと考えたのは、もし、ノード数の水増しを謀るなら、もっとうまくやるはずだと思うからだ。図1のように断続的に散布したり中止したりを繰り返す意味がわからない。もっとうまく散布されていたら、私も水増しに気づかなかったかもしれない。
今回、10月8日（高裁判決の日）以降連続して偽キー散布が行われており、意図的なものかという感じもしなくもないが、判決によって増加したことを演出したいなら、判決前の10月1日から散布されていたのは何なんだということになる。もしかして、有罪と見越して「高裁でも有罪判決でWinny利用者激減」という演出を予定していたというのだろうか？（それにしては、判決前の8日午前0時から偽キー散布が開始されているわけで、どういう説明がつくのか。）
いずれにせよ、もし今後、この偽キー散布が自然な方法に進化していったなら、実験ではなく意図的な水増しだという可能性を疑う必要が出てくるかもしれない。
ちなみに 、Winnyネットワークのノード数調査は、中央大学のJVNRSSでも実施されており、2007年10月以降のデータが掲載されている。
こちらでは、1時間当たりの数として集計されているので、偽キー散布の影響はほとんど現れていない。（1時間当たりのランダムIPアドレスの数は、2000〜3000個程度であるため。）

Foreign secretary warns that UK will lose out internationally if it opposes EU policymaking because of hubris or xenophobia
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Britain must take a lead in developing a strong European foreign policy if it is to retain its influence around the world , David Miliband said today .
The foreign secretary warned that the UK would lose out internationally if it tried to oppose EU foreign policymaking on the grounds of " hubris , nostalgia or xenophobia " .
Speaking at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , Miliband attacked the Conservative opposition to the Lisbon treaty – which creates an EU foreign minister and diplomatic service – as a " deception " .
" It is very strongly in the British national interest for the European Union to develop a strong foreign policy , " he said .
" To be frightened of European foreign policy is blinkered , fatalistic and wrong .
Britain should embrace it , shape it and lead European foreign policy . "
Miliband warned that without an effective European foreign policy Britain and the EU would increasingly become an irrelevance , in a world dominated by Washington and Beijing .
" The choice for Europe is simple – get our act together and make the European Union a leader on the world stage or become spectators in a G2 world shaped by the United States and China , " he said .
" I think the choice for Britain is also simply stated .
We can lead a strong European foreign policy or , lost in hubris , nostalgia or xenophobia , watch our influence in the world wane . "
Miliband also warned that an unsuccessful attempt by a Conservative government to renegotiate elements of the EU in the wake of ratification of the Lisbon treaty could simply lead to demands for Britain to leave Europe altogether .
" The truth is that there is a deception here at the heart of policy – a deception of the country : that you can hate Europe as it exists today and remain central to European policymaking , " he said .
" In fact a failed attempt to renegotiate aspects of the EU that the Conservative party does not like would inevitably lead to more calls for Britain to leave the EU . "
Miliband spoke out after yesterday endorsing Tony Blair to become the first president of the European council , declaring that the EU needed a big hitter who could stop the traffic in world capitals .
Amid signs that the Czech Republic will soon ratify the Lisbon treaty , creating a legal basis for the new post , the foreign secretary described Blair as a very good choice for Britain and the EU .
" I think it 's very important for Europe that it has a strong figure in that role , " Miliband told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 .
" I think it would be very good for Britain , as well as very good for Europe ...
We need someone who can do more than simply run through the agenda , " he said .
" We need someone who , when he or she lands in Beijing or Washington or Moscow , the traffic does need to stop , the talks do need to begin at a very , very high level . "
Pressed about the appointment again today , Miliband said Blair was waiting to see what kind of president the European council wanted , suggesting he would want to be a " strategic leader " of Europe in the world .
Asked on BBC Radio 4's World at One whether he and Blair had discussed the position , Miliband said : " I think that he , like me , is waiting to see what kind of person Europe wants , because the choice is not primarily his , the choice is for Europe .
" Does it want someone who is just going to tick off the items on the agenda ?
Or does it want someone who is going to be a persuasive advocate , a coalition - builder , a strategic leader of Europe 's relationships around the world ?
" I think it 's very strongly in Britain 's interests that we have the latter kind of person .
" As it happens , the leading candidate is a retired British prime minister and any European country except this one would be delighted if one of its former prime ministers was being touted for this job . "
Speaking to journalists earlier , Gordon Brown 's spokesman said : " If the role is created and if Tony Blair wishes to be a candidate then the prime minister and government would be completely supportive . "
Both the prime minister and the foreign secretary will be meeting their EU counterparts at a European council meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday .
The formal agenda is not thought to include consideration of the new jobs but there are bound to be discussions on the sidelines of the gathering .
A further one - day summit to discuss the issue is likely to take place at a later date .
Banks , given trillions stolen from the taxpayer , are using their ill - gotten fiat to speculate in markets using quant computers and insider information , neither of which the taxpayer has access .
Nor do they have access to national level politicians , their contributions simply are not as large .
Thus , the banks hoard their trillions while cutting off lines of credit to the very taxpayers who bailed them out .
What lines are not cut are charged 30 % or more , rates that the Godfather could only dream of .
The consumer knows that credit is tighter than it was before .
I ’ve been saying all along that total money and credit are contracting , that the world of derivatives and leverage is contracting despite our government ’s best efforts to flood the system with money .
While it ’s difficult to see the overall shape of the shadow banking world , clues can be found when digging .
Again , I point to the OCC reports showing that JPM notional derivatives have shrunk by some $ 10 TRILLION in the past two years despite acquisitions .
The OCC reports overall growth in derivatives , but that is only because investment banks , speculators like Goldman Sachs , applied for and were granted status as a commercial bank ( to gain access to taxpayer money ) .
So , we have the money supply increasing , government debt skyrocketing , but that is more than offset by the shadow banking system and falling overall private credit .
Today I ’m going to show you the real dollars behind the collapse in consumer credit along with how that is affecting the securitization of that credit , this being but one small piece of the derivatives and credit ( debt ) world .
Yesterday , a $ 14.8 billion contraction in consumer credit was reported for the month of September .
That translates into a contraction at an annual rate of 7.3 % for the month , 6.1 % in the third quarter , which follows a 6.6 % contraction in the second quarter .
Revolving credit decreased at an annual rate of 10 percent , and nonrevolving credit decreased at an annual rate of 3.8 percent .
It would seem that never ending growth has ended .
Keep in mind that the consumer and their spending represents 70 % or more of this nation ’s economy .
Let ’s start our tour of the charts by showing that the contraction is not just in consumer credit .
Below is the latest chart from the St. Louis Fed showing Total Loans and Leases at Commercial Banks percent change from a year ago :
Now , let ’s look at consumer credit and its components .
Below is a chart showing Total Consumer credit expressed in billions of dollars change from one year ago :
There are two types of consumer credit , revolving ( credit cards , lines of credit , etc. ) , and nonrevolving .
Below is the chart of Total Revolving Credit Outstanding , again expressed in billions of dollars change from last year :
Next is the Total Nonrevolving Credit Outstanding expressed in billions change from a year ago :
The Fed actually reports Securitized Total Consumer Loans , but I would contend that their data does NOT capture nearly all of it , nor does it capture all the derivatives based around it , credit default swaps and the like .
Still , you can see that the securitization process is no longer creating never ending growth in this category .
Of course the “ securitization ” of debt process did not exist prior to about 1990 :
The Fed further breaks down who holds consumer debt .
Below is a chart of Consumer Revolving Credit Owned by Finance Companies :
Consumer Revolving Credit Owned by Commercial Banks :
Of course , as credit contracts , businesses do poorly , and they lay people off .
Below is the updated chart of those who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or longer :
Unemployed people and people without credit do not order things , as this chart showing Durable goods orders attests :
Good luck with the “ recession is over ” call , welcome to the second Great Depression , what I now label the Great Deception .
Keep in mind when you see trumped up GDP growth figures that even during the Great Depression of the ‘ 30s that GDP was positive off and on for years while the people suffered .
Today we may not have soup lines extending for blocks , instead they collect unemployment , food stamps , buy their cars with the help of government money , and buy their houses on the backs of taxpayers too .
The person next to you in the checkout line may look solvent , but they may be shopping with your money .
Those thinking that real recovery is here or is imminent had best keep their eye on consumer credit .
They are confusing speculation and false accounting with growth .
That will become more and more evident given time .
The myth that more debt can cure a debt problem , that incomes can support never ending credit growth is simply a dream true only in the minds of central bankers and their minions …
Public health and AIDS experts hailed President Obama 's announcement Friday to end a two - decade ban on people with HIV from entering the country , a restriction they described as archaic and discriminatory .
The United States is among just a handful of countries , including Yemen , Qatar and Sudan , that bar HIV - visitors from entering their borders .
The process to end the travel ban was started last year by Congress and the Bush administration .
The president said his administration will finish it by publishing the final rules to eliminate the ban Monday .
The ban is expected to be lifted early next year .
" It 's just not supported by any evidence at this point - whether it was that people were coming into the United States and wildly infecting others or any other sound public health ground on which they could continue to exclude people , " said Dana Van Gorder , executive director of Project Inform , an advocacy organization in San Francisco for people living with AIDS / HIV .
Obama made the announcement as he signed the fourth reauthorization of a federal program named for Ryan White , an Indiana boy who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion .
The program , started in 1990 , provides funds for HIV - related care .
Attendees at the U.S. Conference on AIDS , which is being held this week in San Francisco , were elated by the news .
The ban was based on " old thinking about how you stop the progression of a disease without understanding the science , " said conference attendee Ravinia Hayes - Cozier , director of government relations and public policy for National Minority AIDS Council .
" The science and policy has finally caught up with each other . "
In 1987 , the U.S. health officials added HIV / AIDS to the list of communicable diseases that could prevent a person from entering the country .
Congress , in 1993 , codified the ban into law , which was signed by President Bill Clinton .
In 2006 , the Bush administration said HIV - positive visitors could enter the United States on short - term or business visas without a special waiver .
Then last year , President George W. Bush signed a law to repeal rules that prevented HIV - infected immigrants , students and tourists from receiving visas , without special permission , to enter the country .
That step led to Friday 's announcement to lift the entire ban .
Dr. Grant Colfax , director of HIV prevention and research for the San Francisco Department of Public Health , described the ban as discriminatory .
He said the law was actually deleterious to public health .
" It encouraged people hiding and not getting tested , " he said .
Health experts said visitors seeking permission to enter the country are asked about their HIV status , but it was difficult to determine how strictly the ban was enforced .
" Stigma and discrimination are huge ( issues ) for people living with HIV , " said Lance Toma , executive director of Asian and Pacific Islander Wellness Center in San Francisco .
" The travel ban is one that is in our laws that legalizes the stigma . "
Mothers who use a breast pump to express milk during the day and then bottle - feed it to their baby at night may be letting themselves in for a sleepless night .
Naturally occurring chemicals called nucleotides that have previously been linked to sleepiness only reach their highest concentrations in human breast milk that is expressed at night .
Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA , but they also participate in cellular signalling and metabolic processes within cells .
Several of them have also been implicated in sleep .
The chemicals had already been found in breast milk , their concentrations increasing in the first few weeks after birth , so it seemed likely that they are important for tissue development .
Now it seems they may have an additional role .

Milk round
Cristina Sánchez at the University of Extremadura in Badajoz , Spain , and her colleagues looked at the concentrations of 5 ’ UMP , 5 ’AMP and 5 ” GMP – the three nucleotides most strongly associated with sleep and sedation – in the breast milk of 30 healthy mothers who had been breast - feeding for at least 3 months .
Samples of milk were collected before each feed over a 24 - hour period , with between six and eight samples collected per mother .
They found that concentrations of 5 ’AMP were highest at the beginning of the night , while levels of 5 ’GMP and 5 ’UMP increased as the night wore on .
These sedatives were found at much lower concentrations in milk expressed during the day .
“ It is a mistake for the mother to express the milk at a certain time and then store it and feed it to the baby at a different time , ” says Sánchez .
She suggests that 5 ’AMP in breast milk might be fuelling the release of the sleep - promoting neurotransmitter GABA , while 5 ’GMP is involved in the secretion of melatonin , which helps regulate the natural body clock .
5 ’UMP is known to promote the amount of both REM and non-REM sleep .
Since previous studies have also hinted that bottle - fed infants have more problems sleeping through the night , Sánchez ’s colleague , Javier Cubero , has been investigating whether sleep - inducing nucleotides could be added to formula milk .
In a separate study , Sánchez and Cubero created a “ night - time ” milk by adding 5 ’AMP and 5 ’UMP to standard formula milk .
Infants receiving this milk between 6 pm and 6 am , and normal milk during the day , fell asleep faster and spent longer sleeping than when they drank standard formula milk all the time .

As Morpheus said to Neo : u201 Cwe live in an imaginary state .u201D
A state in which people have been indoctrinated to such a degree that they are no longer able to discern reality from make believe .
A culture that is so socially numb and easily pliable that words like u201 Cmisspokeu201D and u201 Cmisstatedu201D have replaced the word u201 Cliedu201D ; a culture where a person can be asked a yes or no question and speak for 5 minutes and never answer the question and yet everyone believes that somehow he did ; a culture where a black person ca n’t be referred to as black ; a 5 ’ 0 " 100 - lb woman ca n’t be referred to as smaller and weaker than a 6 ’ 6 " 250 - lb man ; a culture where the wife of a president is considered able to lead a nation for no reason other than she was the wife of a president and ignoring that her version of a story is given more credence than actual video footage ; a culture where one can be sued if they do n’t hire someone even if they are unqualified for the job ; a culture where people can be arrested , booked and thrown in jail for driving a car and feel as though somehow they deserve it .
There is an entire generation or two of people that are so anesthetized that they condone the invasion and destruction of sovereign third - world countries that could n’t possibly pose a threat to our national security whatsoever and the killing of innocent men , women , children in the process : Afghanistan , Iraq and Pakistan and yet practically bring the country to a standstill for the death of 13 U.S. soldiers in Texas .
When did we go to war with Pakistan ?
We are a society of people who have gone down the rabbit hole with the Mad Hatter and March Hare and believe that somehow contrary to basic mathematical laws like one plus one equals two the economy can be improved by taking money from one person and giving it to another or by dropping it from a helicopter .
Given their drunken social state , it makes perfect sense to them .
We live in a society where one ’s celebrity equates to ability ; where a pretty face , gender or ethnic background means more than character , integrity , ability and courage ; where a political man , morally , professionally and personally disgraced , can lecture at Harvard ’s school of ethics and a political woman known for lying during campaign trips and elsewhere can be appointed to one of our countries highest posts : secretary of state .
A society in which a man wins an international peace award , not for his peace efforts , but rather for a PowerPoint presentation about a theoretical and controversial environmental condition or by a man who , not only did n’t exhibit any of the required characteristics of the award , but in fact exhibited exactly the opposite by sending American men and women into war zones to do his dirty work .
It will be a glorious day when u201 Cleaders u201D have to fight their own battles .
I wonder how quick they would be to go to war then .
We live in a society of political figures who are so insecure with who they are that they use fake Las Vegas — type names in an attempt to seem more potent than they really are .
Names like : John McCain the maverick , Ted Kennedy the Lion , Sarah Palin the rogue .
The rogue ?
Can anyone think of a word that describes Palin any less ?
Well considering the u201 Crogueu201D quit her elected position in order to promote her own celebrity I ’d like to describe her with the word quitter .
Now that ’s a woman we want leading a nation ; a woman who exhibits such loyalty and perseverance .
What ’s going to happen if she breaks a nail as president ?
Will she invade Thailand ?
Of course like everyone who is stoned , some might get emotional about my description of the Alaskan mutant , but that ’s to be expected from those whose mental state is altered .
We have people around the world including our biggest financier , China laughing at our government ’s highest officials when they try to sell them the same bullshit the inebriated Americans buy and yet the drugged continue to believe .
Our leadership does n’t even try to hide their contempt for the rule of law anymore because they know that a mentally impaired electorate wo n’t complain just as long as they keep bringing the high .
Every election cycle it ’s the same people on the dance card and nobody says anything .
They admittedly vote for the u201 Clesser of two evilsu201D every four years and yet they continue to vote for the u201 Clesser of two evilsu201D without it ever hitting them upside the head that the lesser of two evils is still an evil .
Being in their euphoric state of social silliness , how could they ever notice ?
So this is the society in which we sober folks live and we must continually keep an eye on the addicts , who are in fact the majority , in order to make sure they do n’t affect us to the detriment of our lives .
We must constantly try to convince them to seek help ; to enroll in rehab because the problem starts with them .
Delusion is real and the truth will set them free .
It ’s scary to know the truth because one can never go back to the ignorant bliss from which one came .
Let ’s hope the truth does it before depression , hyperinflation and bread lines or worse do it .

I 've made a variation of this so many times it 's not to be believed .
My wife and I are perpetually on diets , so I made some changes to drop the caloric content .
First , I cut down on butter and oil .
I will use spray oil to do all the sauteing .
Second , ixnay to the heavy cream .
Traditional Marsala dishes wo n't have cream , but I like the creamy sauce .
To emulate that I use skim milk instead and thicken it by whisking in about a tablespoon of whole wheat flour and reducing the liquid .
We serve it in bite - size chicken chunks over whole wheat linguine .
A thicker pasta really works well .
We love mushrooms too , so I double or triple the mushrooms .

Static analysis tool for Django projectsStatic analysis tool for Django projects .
Django Lint is a static analysis tool that checks ( or " lints " ) projects and applications that use the Django web development framework .
It reports on common programming errors and bad code smells , including checking for nullable CharField field types , the use of brittle or deprecated Django features ( such as auto_now_add ) as well as the absence of recommended options in settings.py .
It aims to encourage the development of high - quality re-usable Django applications .
Django Lint is currently implemented as a wrapper around PyLint .
An example output is :

It ’s tough these days being from South Carolina .
Ask Dick Harpootlian .
He was in Peru , on a train from Cusco to Machu Picchu , when he and his wife began chatting with another couple .
Where , Harpootlian asked , are you from ?
Rio , came the response , and you ?
South Carolina , Harpootlian replied .
Mark Sanford !
the couple exclaimed .
Argentina !
Later that night Harpootlian returned to his hotel room , flipped on the TV and picked out two words in a stream of Spanish : Joe Wilson .
( As in , “ You lie ! ” )
“ Thousands of miles from home , ” Harpootlian said with a sigh .
“ In the middle of nowhere . ”
Advertisement
Harpootlian is a prominent lawyer , former head of the state Democratic Party and a fierce partisan .
Sanford and Wilson are Republicans .
But Harpootlian is hardly alone in his civic embarrassment .
“ This is a small state that does n’t get on the national stage very often , ” said David Woodard , a GOP consultant who teaches political science at South Carolina ’s Clemson University .
“ To get on the stage because your congressman shouted at the president , or your governor is running around with an Argentine mistress , is n’t what you want your state to be about . ”
It does n’t help that the state treasurer was sentenced to prison last year for cocaine possession .
Advertisement
Or that the state agriculture commissioner went to jail for ties to a cockfighting ring .
Or that the head of the state board of education resigned amid allegations she used a pseudonym to post erotic fiction on the Internet .
Quite a lively few years in South Carolina , mused Jack Bass , a historian at the Citadel in Charleston .
“ If you ’re thinking of retirement and you tend to get bored easily , come on down , ” Bass said .
“ You ’ll enjoy the place very much . ”

“ Gov. Mark Sanford said he was hiking the Appalachian Trail . . . .
He was really climbing Mt. Mistress . ” -- Craig Ferguson , “ The Late Late Show ”
So what is it about the place ?
South Carolina has a long history of hotheadedness -- it was , after all , where the Civil War started .
( In 1860 , James L. Petigru , an attorney and Union loyalist , described South Carolina as “ too small for a republic and too large for an insane asylum , ” a line dredged up countless times since . )
The state also has a reputation for some of the nastiest campaigns in the country .
Lee Atwater , who grew up in South Carolina , transferred its scorched - earth tactics to the 1988 presidential race as manager of George H.W. Bush ’s campaign .
Twelve years later , George W. Bush clinched the Republican nomination after operatives here smeared John McCain with claims that his adopted Bangladeshi daughter was his illegitimate black child .
Advertisement
On Sunday , two GOP officials thought they were being helpful when they lauded Sen.
Jim DeMint ’s thriftiness in an opinion piece invoking a Jewish stereotype .
DeMint condemned the comment , and the party chairmen apologized .
South Carolina was once among the richest places in America , thanks to its lucrative plantation economy .
Some say arrogance and an obstreperous attitude have been bred into people ever since -- which might account for Wilson ’s outburst .
But ask about , say , Charles Sharpe , the former agriculture commissioner convicted in 2005 of taking money to protect an illegal cockfighting ring , and you ’re likely to hear about other scandal - stained figures : New York ’s Eliot Spitzer , New Jersey ’s Jim McGreevey , Louisiana ’s Edwin Edwards .
“ Some of it is the natural hubris of politicians who believe the rules do n’t apply to them , ” said Phil Noble , a Democratic strategist in Charleston .
“ That ’s not new to America or unique to the South . ”
Advertisement
Matters of the heart are , of course , a mystery , and few profess to understand Sanford ’s reckless behavior .
“ This is a small enough state where people feel they know their politicians personally , or they know their family or where they go to church , ” Woodard said .
“ His case is pretty astonishing .
There ’s a real sense of betrayal . ”
::
“ Sanford admitted to having an affair in Argentina . . . .
Great , now we ’re outsourcing mistresses . ” -- Craig Ferguson

There is a lot of smiling through gritted teeth these days in South Carolina .
It seems outsiders had pretty much forgotten the fight over the Confederate flag , the last big story to gain national attention .
( Under a compromise , the banner was removed from the Capitol dome in 2000 and now flaps , somewhat faded , over a Confederate memorial on the Statehouse grounds . )
Now this .
Lee Bussell , who runs a public relations and ad agency in Columbia , was recently at a conference in Little Rock , Ark. , where he endured a weekend of ribbing -- “ How ’s Mark doing ? ” -- over the state ’s Lothario governor .
“ You have to be able to laugh at it to keep from being defensive , ” said Bussell , who would n’t be worth the ink on a news release if he did n’t at least try to make a positive pitch for his home state :
“ All those incidents do n’t represent the mainstream of the people in South Carolina .
It certainly does n’t make me any less proud of where I live . ”
Advertisement
So how is Mark doing ?
Nearly four months after disappearing , then tearfully confessing he was with his Argentine lover -- not hiking the Appalachian Trail , as he told staffers -- Sanford continues a statewide contrition tour .
( He says his speeches to Rotary Clubs and the like are really about promoting economic development . )
The father of four is separated from his wife , who is writing a book , and is fighting the State Ethics Commission in court .
It turns out Sanford ’s extramarital excursion was just the start of his woes .
Advertisement
The commission is investigating various accusations , including that Sanford improperly used state aircraft for personal and political trips , failed to disclose flights on private aircraft owned by family and friends , and improperly traveled in business class instead of coach .
( The latter might be the equivalent of jaywalking if the pinch - penny governor had n’t insisted underlings follow state law and buy the cheapest seats . )
One legislator vows to introduce an impeachment resolution next week , when lawmakers meet in a special session to clean up technical language in a jobless benefits bill .
But most legislators are awaiting results of the ethics probe to decide whether to oust Sanford , who has about 15 months left in office .
The governor has asked the state Supreme Court to block release of the report to anyone other than law enforcement officials .
“ If I thought it was best for the state to have moved on , I would have left a long time ago , ” Sanford told the Greenville News in late September .
Sanford suggested he could be more effective , because “ nobody works harder for redemption than someone who fails . ”
That , however , seems to be a minority view .

::
“ Mark Sanford . . . held a press conference to reveal he had an affair with a woman from Argentina .
People were shocked because Republicans traditionally do n’t do well with Hispanic women . ” -- Conan O’Brien , “ The Tonight Show ”
Polls have shown most South Carolina voters want Sanford to go .
“ He ’s not getting the respect he needs to do a good job , ” said Alvin Rhodes , 50 , sweat pouring off his face as he unloaded cases of wine outside a bistro in Columbia ’s trendy Five Points neighborhood .
“ I do n’t think people take him seriously . ”
Lawmakers of both parties have called on Sanford to resign , as has the state GOP .
The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce recently urged legislators to get on with impeaching Sanford , if that ’s their intent .
“ We do n’t want it running into the next [ legislative ] session , particularly in light of the way our economy is , ” said Otis Rawl , head of the chamber .
Advertisement
Like most states , South Carolina has serious budget problems .
The unemployment rate is the highest in the region , topping 20 % in places .
Still , Sanford refused $ 700 million in federal stimulus funds , prompting a battle with lawmakers of both parties and a lawsuit that consumed most of the legislative term .
Sanford lost the fight in a unanimous state Supreme Court ruling and had to accept the money .
A few weeks later he traveled to Argentina ; the state capital has been paralyzed ever since , attention riveted on a three - story , stucco - and - mirrored - glass office complex that houses doctors , lawyers , lobbyists and the state Ethics Commission .
“ It ’s almost like the backwater of a swamp , ” said Carey Crantford , a Democratic pollster .
“ Everything ’s sitting there , nothing ’s circulating , and the only thing moving is the mosquitoes . ”
::
Advertisement
“ During President Obama ’s speech . . . this guy from South Carolina begins to heckle the guy , and I thought , ‘ OK , so now Mark Sanford is the second - most embarrassing politician from South Carolina . ’ ” -- David Letterman , “ Late Show ”
The jokes are bad enough .
Even more worrisome is the possible damage to South Carolina ’s national reputation .
Surveys taken during the Confederate flag fight showed that corporate executives around the country were put off by the controversy , which still simmers .
An NAACP boycott remains in effect and the state continues to lose business .
In July , the Atlantic Coast Conference pulled three championship baseball tournaments from Myrtle Beach when it failed to resolve concerns over the flag .
Some fear this fresh batch of humiliating headlines will only make things worse , scaring off retirees , turning away prospective college students and , most critically , discouraging businesses from expanding or moving to South Carolina .
Advertisement
“ If you ’re in competition and they say they ’re not coming because of Sanford or the flag , that gets told , ” said Rawl , who is angling for a Boeing plant that could bring about 3,000 jobs to Charleston .
“ What concerns the business community more than anything else is the looks we do n’t get and never find out about . ”
Walter Edgar , head of the University of South Carolina ’s Institute for Southern Studies , does n’t minimize the Sanford affair , calling it “ a weeping sore on the body politic . ”
But he wants people to know “ there ’s a lot more to South Carolina ” than politicians behaving badly ; he ’ll match the state ’s beaches against California ’s any day .
“ The water ’s certainly more comfortable , ” Edgar said , “ and we do n’t have McMansions spilling into the sea . ”

The New Imperialism
de facto
The natural climate of Iceland could be used to reduce carbon emissions
By Simon Hancock
BBC Click
Since the financial crisis , Iceland has been forced to retreat back from high octane bubble living to nature .
Fortunately , there is a lot of that nature to retreat to .
It is a breathtaking world of volcanoes , endless prairies and ethereal winter landscapes .
Not , you might think , the most obvious place to stick millions of the world 's computer servers which are , for all their uses , rather less attractive .
But the country now wants exactly that - to become home to the world 's computing power .
Behind all the large internet companies lurk massive and ever growing data centres chock full of servers churning away .
Google for instance is thought to have around a million of the things , but even less IT intensive operations , banks for example , need hundreds of thousands of servers to store all their data .
Up to 60 % extra energy is required to cool computer servers in the UK
The problem is that while these computers look innocuous , they use a lot of energy .
There is of course the power you need for the servers themselves , but almost as significant is the energy used to keep them cool .
" For every watt that is spent running servers , " says Dr Brad Karp , of University College London , " the best enterprises most careful about minimising the energy of cooling and maximising efficiency typically find they are spending 40 - 60 % extra energy on just cooling them . "
Cold rush
In Iceland , with its year round cool climate and chilly fresh water , just a fraction of this energy for cooling is needed .
It means big savings .
Just outside Reykjavik , work is well advanced on the first site which its owners hope will spark a server cold rush .
In around a year - if all goes according to plan - the first companies will start leasing space in this data centre .
And if this proves successful more sites are planned .
The company expects demand to be huge because as the number of servers around the world grows , a big environmental cloud is looming - all that energy use means an increase in CO2 production .
Iceland has far more power than it can domestically use .
" The data centre industry now is on par with the airline industry as far as the carbon footprint , " says Jeff Monroe , head of Verne Global - a data centre company working in Iceland .
A company would save greater than half a million metric tons of carbon annually
Jeff Monroe , CEO of Verne Global " But , if you think about the growth of those two industries , the growth of the data centre industry is exponentially greater than the airline industry .
" The two are going to cross and we think that - just like the legislation that was passed in the UK concerning carbon footprint and power utilisation - it is going to be a growing concern across the industry . "
So data centres are already producing as much CO2 as airlines .
While it has been below the radar until now , Verne Global thinks that with cloud computing on the rise , the carbon footprint of the digital world will soon become " unacceptably high " .
And this is where Iceland 's natural resources really come into their own .
Enormous savings
The volcanic forces which shaped the landscape have also gifted the country masses of geothermal power - 100 % of the country 's electricity is renewable and basically carbon free , much generated from water heated far below the ground .
Mr Monroe explains what would happen if a company moved its data centre to Iceland .
" The carbon savings would be enormous .
All of Iceland 's electricity is renewable and basically carbon free " For example , if a large internet media company operating thousands and thousands of servers relocated its servers to Iceland , that company would save greater than half a million metric tons of carbon annually . "
So you have the cooler climate and an abundance of green energy .
But you would not want to move your previous data centre to what is effectively the middle of nowhere unless it had some good connections .
Iceland has been busying itself laying fibre optic cables to connect the country with North America and Europe .
The cables coming in provide a capacity of more than five terabits / sec - all with server farms in mind .
Travelling down this pipe , data sited in Iceland is just 17 milliseconds from London .
Sitting at home on YouTube you would never know , but even that is too slow for some .
Big industry Gudmundur Gunnarsson , head of communications company Farice , explains some of the problems .
" There are very sensitive financial services that cannot even go outside the M25 in London " , he says .
" So everything has to be within that circle , but for approximately at least 70 % of other traffic , this delay is more than satisfactory . "
Even where speed is not an issue however , the allure of Iceland is not for everyone .
Companies will have to overcome their natural server - hugging tendencies , and some may harbour security fears of storing their data remotely .
But having been through the financial mill Iceland hopes and believes in the next five to 10 years this will be one of its biggest industries .
And , in an irony not lost on a country brought to its knees by finance , one early customer rumoured to have signed a deal to move servers here is - well who else - one of America 's biggest investment banks .

The substance , described as a chemical , leaked out of the man 's bag at Yorkshire Bank on Abingdon Street , Blackpool , on Saturday morning .
Emergency services were alerted after a member of staff became " woozy " while cleaning it up and three people were taken to hospital as a precaution .
Police said there was " no malicious intent " in the man 's actions .
No offence had been committed , they added .
The man became irate after being told the coins he was trying to deposit were not bagged properly .
He could n't find any trace of the substance within the carpet or the tissues used to clean it up

Regulators clamped down last fall on shady sales practices for privately run Medicare health insurance for the elderly .
But customers and advocate groups say the plans ’ confusing nature still leaves room for pitches bordering on the deceptive , and abuses still crop up .
Medicare Advantage plans are privately run versions of the government ’s Medicare program , which provides health coverage for the elderly and disabled .
The government subsidizes these plans , and the industry has developed what can be a mind - numbing array of them .
Seniors report being pressured with unsolicited phone calls or home visits that are clearly prohibited .
Some have signed up for plans that did n’t include their longtime doctors or hit them with unexpected costs , things they learn weeks later .
CMS learns every year about areas that need more vigilance , said Timothy Hill , deputy director for the Center for Drug and Health Plan Choice .
http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=8446040
And …
Some question private Medicare plans ’ advantage
By Matt Sedensky
Associated Press
Seniors have flocked by the millions to Medicare Advantage , privately run plans offered as an alternative to traditional , government - run Medicare .
In the debate on overhauling the U.S. health care system , Advantage has been criticized as an example of a broken system that costs too much , confuses enrollees and suffers from a lack of oversight .
But even many backers acknowledge one of its toughest problems is few seniors understand the essential difference in private plans :
Even services covered by traditional Medicare that doctors deem medically necessary routinely need the insurers ’ advance approval and are sometimes denied .
Participants have been denied visits to specialists , rehabilitation to help them walk again and countless other services they ’d be entitled to under traditional Medicare .
“ Every decision is based on not what ’s right for the patient , but what ’s right for the bottom line , ” said Dr. Michael Sedrish , who coordinates HMO payments for Medisys Health Network , which runs three New York City hospitals .
With basic Medicare , seniors generally know what sort of coverage they ’re getting .
That ’s not the case with the roughly 7,000 Medicare Advantage plans , where one person ’s coverage could be completely different from a next door neighbor’s .
A 2008 Government Accountability
Office report found wide differences in enrollee costs depending on the plan , including home health service costs that could be up to 84 percent more than traditional Medicare .
“ The plans tell them they have the same coverage , ” said Delores Bowman , who handles calls to the Medicare Rights Center , “ and they do n’t . ”

Comment :
By Don McCanne , MD
What ’s beautiful about the Medicare Advantage program is that it has provided us with a real - life laboratory experiment which allows us to compare the functioning of highly - regulated private insurance plans as contrasted with the functioning of a public insurance program : traditional Medicare .
The results are in , though that would be tough to ascertain if you simply observe the response of Congress .
What have we learned ?
The private plans take away the choice of health care providers that the traditional public program offers .
The private plans insert intrusive interventions between the patient and the physician – interventions that are not found in the public plans .
Private plans divert more resources to excessive , wasteful administrative services while increasing the administrative burden on the health care providers and on the public stewards who must provide oversight of our tax dollars that are diverted to this industry .
Private plans also provide more entry points for the criminal element to cheat the taxpayers , patients , and providers .
And for this we are paying far more of our tax dollars than we do in the traditional Medicare program for comparable levels of care .
The obvious lesson is that we should dump the private plans .
What has Congress learned ?
They have decided that we should provide more subsidies to the private plans so that they can expand their markets !?
And they have apparently decided that we will not even have a genuine public plan because it would provide unfair competition to the private plans because of Medicare ’s greater efficiency and lower costs !?
It is true that a fragmented , multi- payer system is much more expensive and much less equitable , leaving too many exposed to suffering and financial hardship .
But our Medicare Advantage experiment has demonstrated that it is the private plans that must be jettisoned , and it is Medicare that must be granted to everyone after modest , appropriate reengineering so that it works even better than it does now .
We need to send this urgent message to Congress and the administration , immediately :
IT ’S THE INSURANCE COMPANIES , STUPID !
Genetic analysis of the now - extinct Falkland Islands Wolf has answered a biological riddle that caught the attention of a young Charles Darwin , and helped shape his understanding of evolution .
During his voyage aboard the HMS Beagle , Darwin observed that the wolves — like his now - famous finches — varied widely in size between different islands , suggesting that the traits of species were not immutable , but changed over time in response to their environments .
Darwin also wondered at the origins of the wolves , which were unusually small , and had reddish fur and relatively short jaws .
He dubbed them foxes , and was the first of many scientists to suspect that the strange canids were n't wolves at all .
Others thought they were descended from dogs brought by the islands ' first human settlers .
Indeed , not a single mammal species other than the wolf was native to the Falkland Islands , located 300 miles off the southeastern tip of South America .
In a study published Tuesday in * Current Biology * , researchers address these questions with a genetic analysis of five museum specimens .
Their findings are twofold .
First , the specimens last shared a common ancestor 70,000 years ago , or a full 50,000 years before humans sailed to the Falklands ; and the animals ' closest relative is the maned wolf , still found on the savannas of South America .
Moreover , the split from the maned wolf appears to have occurred 6.7 million years ago — some four million years before wolves are known to have lived in South America .
At that time , maned wolves lived in North America , and it seems that all of South America 's canids originated in the north .
Unfortunately , by the time Darwin arrived in the Falklands , the wolves were being killed for their fur , and their numbers were in decline .
" Within a very few years after these islands shall have become regularly settled , in all probability this fox will be classed with the dodo , as an animal which has perished from the face of the earth , " he wrote .
Forty years later , the Falklands Islands wolf was gone .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Scientific progress depends on accurate and complete data .
It also relies on replication .
The past couple of days have uncovered some shocking revelations about the baloney practices that pass as sound science about climate change .
It was announced Thursday afternoon that computer hackers had obtained 160 megabytes of e-mails from the Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) in England .
Those e-mails involved communication among many scientific researchers and policy advocates with similar ideological positions all across the world .
Those purported authorities were brazenly discussing the destruction and hiding of data that did not support global - warming claims .
Professor Phil Jones , the head of the Climate Research Unit , and professor Michael E. Mann at Pennsylvania State University , who has been an important scientist in the climate debate , have come under particular scrutiny .
Among his e-mails , Mr. Jones talked to Mr. Mann about the “ trick of adding in the real temps to each series … to hide the decline [ in temperature ] . ”
Mr. Mann admitted that he was party to this conversation and lamely explained to the New York Times that “ scientists often used the word ‘ trick ’ to refer to a good way to solve a problem ‘ and not something secret . ’ ” Though the liberal New York newspaper apparently buys this explanation , we have seen no benign explanation that justifies efforts by researchers to skew data on so - called global - warming “ to hide the decline . ”
Given the controversies over the accuracy of Mr. Mann ’s past research , it is surprising his current explanations are accepted so readily .
TWT RELATED STORIES :
• Tea Party react : Conservatives seek litmus test for RNC funding
• S.C. governor faces 37 ethics violations
• Food snobs fork over $ 225 for taste of heritage turkey
There is a lot of damning evidence about these researchers concealing information that counters their bias .
In another exchange , Mr. Jones told Mr. Mann : “ If they ever hear there is a Freedom of Information Act now in the UK , I think I ’ll delete the file rather than send to anyone ” and , “ We also have a data protection act , which I will hide behind . ”
Mr. Jones further urged Mr. Mann to join him in deleting e-mail exchanges about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s ( IPCC ) controversial assessment report ( ARA ) : “ Can you delete any emails you may have had with Keith re [ the IPCC ’s Fourth Assessment Report ] ? ”
In another e-mail , Mr. Jones told Mr. Mann , professor Malcolm K. Hughes of the University of Arizona and professor Raymond S. Bradley of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst : “ I ’m getting hassled by a couple of people to release the CRU station temperature data .
Do n’t any of you three tell anybody that the UK has a Freedom of Information Act ! ”
At one point , Mr. Jones complained to another academic , “ I did get an email from the [ Freedom of Information ] person here early yesterday to tell me I should n’t be deleting emails . ”
He also offered up more dubious tricks of his trade , specifically that “ IPCC is an international organization , so is above any national FOI .
Even if UEA holds anything about IPCC , we are not obliged to pass it on . ”
Another professor at the Climate Research Unit , Tim Osborn , discussed in e-mails how truncating a data series can hide a cooling trend that otherwise would be seen in the results .
Mr. Mann sent Mr. Osborn an e-mail saying that the results he was sending should n’t be shown to others because the data support critics of global warming .
Repeatedly throughout the e-mails that have been made public , proponents of global - warming theories refer to data that has been hidden or destroyed .
Only e-mails from Mr. Jones ’ institution have been made public , and with his obvious approach to deleting sensitive files , it ’s difficult to determine exactly how much more information has been lost that could be damaging to the global - warming theocracy and its doomsday forecasts .
We do n’t condone e-mail theft by hackers , though these e-mails were covered by Britain ’s Freedom of Information Act and should have been released .
The content of these e-mails raises extremely serious questions that could end the academic careers of many prominent professors .
Academics who have purposely hidden data , destroyed information and doctored their results have committed scientific fraud .
We can only hope respected academic institutions such as Pennsylvania State University , the University of Arizona and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst conduct proper investigative inquiries .
Most important , however , these revelations of fudged science should have a cooling effect on global - warming hysteria and the panicked policies that are being pushed forward to address the unproven theory .

Joan Neubauer , of the Davis Mountains Trans - Pecos Heritage Association has posted an article entitled " Government in My Doctor 's Office " which can be read here : http://dmtpha.wordpress.com/read-all-about-it/
She also submitted it to the Alpine Avalanche and it was printed under the title " Address health concerns through free market " in the November 19 , 2009 issue of that paper
This article is written in response and will be published in the Alpine Avalanche as well .
It is also posted at click here
Joan Neubauer wins the prize for the most misinformation per square inch of print for her latest column on the US House version of health care reform .
However , rest assured that most of the inaccuracies she repeated did n't originate with her .
Her entire column was a repetition of talking points corporate America is slipping into the hands of conservative and libertarian spokesmen and pushing on their media subsidiary , Fox News .
Their purpose is simple and it goes like this :
The United States is the only advanced nation that collectively finances health care primarily through corporate , for - profit insurers .
( Note , I 'm talking about health care financing , not the provision of care by doctors and hospitals and other providers ; this is how we PAY for care , not how it 's provided . )
Those for - profit , corporate insurers have pocketed our health care dollars instead of paying for the care we need .
Meanwhile , forty - six million Americans are uninsured , and 45,000 die every year because they do n't have access to a doctor .
Almost a million Americans have gone bankrupt because of health related costs , and costs are rising such that we are spending almost twice as much per person on health care as any other nation .
Private insurers broke this system and they know it .
They want to keep our money flowing their way so their CEO 's can live in the " manner to which they have become accustomed " and their stockholders can make more money with our money .
The only way they can keep this scam going is to prevent regulation and corner their already restricted market .
There is NO " free market " in health care financing !
We 're talking about an industry that was mistakenly given exemption from anti-trust regulation !
There is only one entity big enough to stand up to mega- corporations ( if it will ) , and that is the US government .
So , at the first moves in over a decade to rein them in , their strategy is to demonize the government and elected representatives who are seeking reform .
Folks , the US Government is not some beast out there bent upon devouring us ; it is the collective representative of us , operated by our elected representatives , with our tax dollars and for the purposes stated in the US Constitution .
In the Preamble to the US Constitution you will see one purpose is to " promote the general welfare . "
Ask yourself this :
When was the last time your friendly neighborhood health insurer came to your home town , conducted public town hall meetings or held regular office hours to hear from and help you ?
Never !
Did you vote for them ?
No way !
Further , Ms Neubauer spoke of the fraud that has been discovered in Medicare , and that certainly is important to control .
But one reason we know about that fraud is because Medicare is a government - run program with some transparency , oversight and accountability .
Just imagine what 's happening in the private health insurance realm where there is less accountability and no incentive to control costs .
The corporate insurers know the real facts , but they do n't want YOU to know .
So they make things up .
I 'll just run through a few of the tales , but , in sum , Neubauer 's column contains nothing BUT misinformation .
Here 's one whopper : Health care reform is " government intrusion into one of the most private of human relationships , that between a patient and doctor . "
Talk to some folks who receive health care financed by Medicare , Medicaid , Tricare , SCHIP and the VA ( all of them government managed ) and you will find patient satisfaction is high .
The government ENABLES doctor / patient relationships to exist where none would otherwise exist at all !
Yet the for - profit insurers intrude in that relationship daily , as any doctor who has had to negotiate to get their patients care will tell you .
And they prevent millions from even seeing a doctor .
Furthermore , decisions on coverage by government programs are based on patient care , while decisions made by private health insurers are based on corporate profits .
Here 's another :
It is not Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi who established that health care reform would lower our deficit .
It 's the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office who analyzes and scores federal bills .
And they also confirmed that our deficit will be far , far worse without reform because we would continue to fund the corporate profits and there will be no downward pressure on prices .
How genuinely concerned can conservatives be about the deficit anyway , since they endorsed Bush 's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans , two unjustified wars and the TARP giveaways .
By the way , if we would end those wars , we could easily pay for health care for all .
And another :
The planned cuts in Medicare are cuts in payments to certain providers who are now being overpaid , not in benefits to patients .
Instead of harming those 65 and older , reform will make Medicare coverage more secure .
Here 's another : Health care reform does not contain ANY federal funding of abortion .
It enables the current status whereby 85 % of private insurance plans , using private funds , cover abortions along with other reproductive health services .
The public option is a non -profit plan some can choose that provides competition for corporate insurance .
There is no plan for it to become mandatory .
On the contrary , as it stands now , the public option will only be available in the individual market , not in the much larger employer - paid insurance market .
While they tout the free market , insurers have already weakened the competition of the public option .
Finally , health care reform will help , not hurt , small businesses ( and employers of all kinds , such as state and local government ) and it will boost , not cut , employment and wages .
And health care provider jobs will increase as those needing care finally get it .
Multiple columns would be required to detail all the points of health care reform winding its way through Congress .
It 's not perfect , but it 's a real start , long overdue .
I urge everyone to become informed of the true facts and to back genuine reform that serves the interest of ordinary Americans , not the corporations .
They have tremendous clout - about 2.5 lobbyists for every member of Congress .
They 're using our money to spread misinformation .
But we know where they 're coming from and the facts are on our side .
We have to insist that our government enact true health care reform now !
Our last poll examined how software configuration management ( change management / version control ) is performed by organisations .
Is it an informal activity or performed with formal procedures that are validated by an automated tool ?
2009 2006
No formal procedure and no tool 13 % 15 % A formal procedure but no tool .
11 % 10 % A tool but no formal procedure 17 % 26 % A formal procedure and a tool 36 % 49 % Continuous integration 23 %
Participants : 271 ( 346 in 2006 )
Ending date : November 2009 ( April 2006 )
If we compare the current results with the 2006 numbers , we can see two major points .
The first is that the number of participants that do n’t use tools remains at the same level , around 25 % .
It is true that there has not been any strong innovation in the area of software configuration management tools in the recent years .
The major open source products were also available three years ago .
Things have change however for the participants that were using tools .
The number participants using a formal procedure is now a clear majority , counting the people that do continuous integration in this category .
The increased demand for regulation , for instance the Sarbanes - Oxley law , has surely influenced corporations to adopt formal policies in their software development practices .
We introduced in this poll a new answer to take into account the “ continuous integration ” way of software configuration management .
This agile - linked practice is adopted by 23 % of the participants to the survey .
This result is similar to the survey conducted by Jurgen Apello on noop.nl .
In his case , 29 % of the participants had adopted continuous integration .
As a funny conclusion on this topic , when I researched on this topic , I noticed that in the 2007 Agile Survey by Version One 50 % of the participants declared that they were practicing continuous integration and 57 % were currently using a continuous integration tool .
This makes me wonder what 7 % of the participants were using the continuous integration tool for .
;o)
Anyhow , this always remembers us that we should be very cautious with survey number .

A MOVIE called Vanishing of the Bees opened in cinemas across the UK earlier this month .
It ’s a feature - length documentary about the “ mysterious collapse ” of the honeybee population across the planet – a phenomenon that has recently attracted a great deal of attention and hand - wringing .
The idea that bees are disappearing for reasons unknown has embedded itself in the public consciousness .
It is also a great story that taps into the anxieties of our age .
But is it true ?
We think not , at least not yet .
First , the basics .
Pollination by bees and other animals …
After having been invited to appear on CNBC to discuss the litigation launched against State Street for what on the surface at least appears rather damaging allegations ( and , in honesty , something that does not come as a surprise to anyone on Wall Street ) , the California Attorney General is greeted by this intellectual pearl from the woman who alleges bloggers tend to generically fall in the " idiot " camp .
Michelle - while the blogosphere can not made any counterclaims yet , it is quite nice of you to open your mouth and do it for us :
" I do n't dispute that $ 56 million is a lot of money , I do n't dispute the merits of the suit but you had a big press conference , you 're coming on C....N.... B.... C....[ the leader in propaganda worldwideTM ] , all this surrounding publicity over this $ 56 million , what do you say to people [ or one person in this case ] who look at this and say this is a perfect example of the demagoguery that attorney generals [ sic ] use when they want to run for governor . "
The hilarity that ensuses has to be seen to be believed ( at 3:20 into the clip ) .
Also , for whatever , reason the recently cancelled Dennis Kneale chimes in .
Almost a decade after the human genome project laid bare the building blocks of life , scientists have figured out how they work together to create a living person .
The genome project identified about 25,000 genes that are needed to make a healthy human being , but said nothing about how they combine to produce everything from hearts and minds to legs and livers .
Now researchers in California have published what is effectively the first manual to show how genes are orchestrated inside cells ‑ a milestone that promises to revolutionise scientists ' understanding of human development and how it can sometimes go wrong .
Many scientists believe the work will lead to new treatments for life - threatening diseases such as cancer , and possibly mental disorders such as schizophrenia .
The work is also expected to shed light on intriguing studies that suggest how we live today can have striking repercussions for the health and behaviour of our grandchildren .
In one study , scientists found that people who smoked as youngsters went on to have grandchildren who reached puberty early .
In another , a person 's diet appeared to affect the way their grandchildren burned food .
Scientists have long known that nearly all the cells in the body have the same genetic makeup .
What makes a heart cell different from a brain cell comes down to which genes are turned on or off inside it .
The process is controlled by chemical switches that stick on to genes and alter how active they are .
For a decade , scientists have been trying to decipher what they call the human " epigenome " , or the pattern of chemical switches in all 200 types of human cell .
The prefix " epi " means " on " , because the chemical switches stick on to genes .
Until now , they had only a vague idea of what the epigenome looks like .
A team led by Joseph Ecker at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , studied human skin and stem cells to produce the first complete map of the human epigenome .
By comparing this with the epigenomes of diseased cells , scientists will be able to work out how glitches in the epigenome lead to cancers and other diseases .
" This knowledge will be extremely valuable for understanding diseases such as cancer and possibly even mental disorders .
Right now we just do n't know how the epigenome changes during the ageing process or how the epigenome is impacted by our environment or diet , " said Ecker , whose paper – first to report among a $ 190 m ( £ 119 m ) international project to map the human epigenome – appears in the journal Nature .
Previous studies suggest that changes in our environment , from what we eat to what we breathe in , can cause damage to the epigenome .
This can throw a wrench into the way genes work , causing a variety of medical conditions .
Ryan Lister , lead author on the Ecker study , said : " What we have now is a reference .
What is important now is for other groups to map the epigenomes of cancer cells and compare those to ours . "
Manufacturers have already developed drugs that act on the epigenome , but the latest research will help scientists target therapies with far more precision .
Stefan Beck , professor of medical genomics at University College London , said : " We 've been working for years to get the epigenome project off the ground and finally it 's happening .
It is absolutely exciting that the first fruits of the project are coming out . "
Beck 's work focuses on how changes to the epigenome can lead to cancer .
Humans carry a number of genes that stop tumours from growing , but disruption to the epigenome can effectively silence these genes , making it more likely a person will develop cancer .
" Science has matured to a point that we can now map the epigenome of a cell , " said Linda Birnbaum , director of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences , part of the US National Institutes of Health , which part - funded the work .
" This will help us better understand how a diseased cell differs from a normal cell , which will enhance our entire understanding of the pathways of various diseases . "
How environment holds the key
If the genetic code were a keyboard , the epigenome would be the pianist .
Different chords become the various cell types , and all the notes have to be played perfectly to produce a healthy human being .
Damage to the epigenome – the pattern of chemicals that controls our genes – has been linked to medical conditions as diverse as asthma , schizophrenia and cancer .
The epigenome can be disrupted by smoking , ageing , stress , atmospheric pollution , what we eat and drink , and a host of other environmental factors .
There is some evidence that the environment causes epigenetic changes that make people more susceptible to asthma .
Its role in other conditions , such as heart disease , schizophrenia , autism , abnormal growth and development and the eye disease glaucoma , are all being investigated .
Epigenetic changes are thought to be a major factor in our risk of developing cancer , an area that has attracted an enormous amount of research .
Many genes help to prevent tumours from growing , but disruption of the epigenome can switch these protective genes off by accident .
Drug companies have developed some treatments that reset epigenetic information in cancerous cells , making them revert back to being healthy .
Understanding the whole human epigenome is expected to help scientists develop drugs that can reduce our risk of cancer and potentially reverse it even if it has become established .

Williams will switch to Cosworth engines next season , AUTOSPORT has learned , after believing its prospects for success in 2010 are best served with the independent engine maker .
Although the Grove - based outfit came close to a deal with Renault , high level sources at the French car manufacturer have revealed that Williams has now informed the company that it is no longer interested in a tie - up for next year .
With Toyota already having confirmed that it is ending its customer supply deal at the end of this year , it means that Williams has now settled on a switch to Cosworth .
Williams is refusing to confirm its engine plans until after the end of the season , but its engineering director Patrick Head praised Cosworth 's efforts in preparing for its return to Formula 1 .
" They are certainly very committed to it and working hard , " he said .
" They have been one of the options but we are not stating where we cast our final hook in terms of what is available to us until after the final race of the season .
But I think our design office know what they are designing for . "
Sources claim that one of the key attractions for Cosworth is the fact that the engine supplier will be able to re-tune its power unit until early next year - something no other manufacturer is able to do because of F1 's engine freeze .
The tweaks could help ensure Cosworth 's engine is competitive throughout 2010 , which is why Red Bull Racing is also considering a switch to the power unit if it is unsuccessful in its bid to secure Mercedes - Benz power .
Head said that his team had chosen to finish its partnership with Toyota because it fancied a change of direction .
" We had a very good relationship with Toyota , " he said .
" We made a decision about two months ago that we wanted to go in a different direction and I think the reasons are not for public consumption .
" We have n't had any falling out so it 's an amicable parting .
There were a number of factors that caused us to make the decision but I do n't think that the combination of the reasons we decided to make a change are not ones that we are prepared to share .
But it was nothing that caused any shouting and screaming , we chose to change direction .
" Ross Brawn and the team showed that you can make an engine change on Christmas Eve and still produce a pretty competitive car but I do n't think our design office would thank us for doing that and they will have a little longer than that to design the car around the engine . "
The US Patent and Trademark Office today published a collection of Apple filings , including a 3D interface that may herald the most radical - or , dare we say , the most bizarre - usability development since Doug Englebart first demoed a window - based GUI 40 years ago yesterday .
Described in excruciating detail by AppleInsider , the " Multi- Dimensional Desktop " application , filed on June 8 of last year , describes a 3D workspace - " desktop " being a wholly inadequate term - in which the familiar 2 - dimensional GUI is joined by a floor , ceiling , and right and left walls , each capable of displaying interface items such as windows and icons .
If you think your desktop is crowded now ...
Interestingly , although the filing appears to describe a 3D representation on a 2D surface , it in no way precludes such an interface from being implemented on a fully 3D display , with physical rather than virtual displays of the aforementioned floor , ceiling , and right and left walls .
Coupled with the proximity - sensing patent
The Reg discussed last week , if implemented in true 3D space this newly published filing may usher in an entirely new way of interacting with your Mac - one in which you reach inside your display to manipulate interface elements rather than merely pushing your cursor around your 2D desktop using your mouse .
Or Apple may simply be attempting to patent the inside of a box .
As MacRumors correctly points out , " Apple has not been the only one working on 3D desktops , " and cites examples from the Dynamic Graphics Project and Sun 's Project Looking Glass .
Long - time Apple watchers may also remember rumors of a 3D interface for iWork , or the aborted HotSauce interface ( aka Project X ) of the mid-1990s , created as a demonstration of Apple 's Meta Content Framework ( MCF ) .
3D icons may live in a 3D environment .
3D elements are already present , of course , in Mac OS X Leopard 's icon-holding Dock , as well as in the Cover Flow view in the Mac OS X Finder , iTunes , and iPhone and iPod Touch ; the media - managing Front Row ; and the useful - but - somewhat - silly file - restoration interface for Mac OS X's backup utility , Time Machine .
This new filing , however , vaults 3D from mere eye - candy status to the central metaphor of the entire GUI .
The " Multi- Dimensional Desktop " filing describes an interface in which the " floor and " walls " can themselves slide in and out of view , carrying icons and windows with them .
Icons and other elements can position themselves in the foreground or background - or even delete theselves - in relation to their " last access time , " or move from the main work area to secondary areas - or vice versa - when an " online buddy " logs on or off .
A physics model described in the filing can enable a toggleable " magnetism " function that can facilitate icon grouping and ungrouping , and an " illumination effect " coming from one or more windows can " change according to local environmental states " - meaning that , for example , a simulated sunbeam could track across the 3D space in relation to local time or even " local weather conditions that are received over the network . "
The filing describes alternate geometries to the simple interface - in - a - box , including a tetrahedral implementation , a triangular version , and even a cylindrical view in which your interface becomes " like , totally tubular , man . "
Luckily , " a configuration menu can present one or more multidimensional environment geometries for selection by the user , " so you 'll be able to regain your visual sanity with the click of a Preferences button .
This GUI gives a whole new meaning to " IP tunneling . "
As intriguing as all of this may sound , do n't expect to see a 3D interface on your Mac anytime soon .
Nothing in the Snow Leopard specs point to such an interface option in next year 's Mac OS X 10.6 , nor have there been any leaks from the sieve - like Mac developer community .
Will Mac OS XI see the introduction of a 3D interface ?
Will proximity - sensing displays couple with a 3D GUI to provide a true physical 3D experience sometime in the not - so - distant future ?
Or will the " Multi- Dimensional Desktop " filing - along with the rest of the crowd published today - join HotSauce and others in Apple 's graveyard of good intentions ? ®
The Taliban targeted India 's embassy in Afghanistan for the second time in two years with a car bomb that killed at least 17 people on a heavily guarded street in downtown Kabul .
The explosion came a day after the anniversary of the 2001 U.S. - led invasion that toppled the Taliban regime .
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack on the group 's Web site .

Ticketmaster and Live Nation 's controversial merger could result in them being forced to dispose of UK operations or sell tickets through a rival after regulators warned their tie - up could damage competition and push up prices .
The Competition Commission 's provisional findings on the multimillion - pound merger , published today , said that the deal would make it harder for new entrants to break into the ticketing marketplace .
The commission also warned that combining the two major players in the music market could mean the price of tickets went up , or result in concert - goers receiving a poorer service .
Ticketmaster is the world 's largest seller of tickets to live events , while Live Nation is the world 's biggest concert promoter , with a roster of stars including U2 , Madonna and Coldplay .
In February the pair agreed to team up in a $ 800 m deal .
Bruce Springsteen was one of the earliest opponents of the merger , warning that it would create " a near - monopoly situation " .
In the US the deal is being probed by the department of justice .
In the UK , the planned merger was referred to the Competition Commission by the Office of Fair Trading in June because of concerns about its impact on the £ 1.9 bn - a - year live music market .
The regulator came to its preliminary ruling after considering the case of CTS Eventim , which is the second - largest ticket vendor behind Ticketmaster .
It landed a major deal to sell tickets to Live Nation events in December 2007 .
But the commission concluded that if the merger went through , Live Nation would seek to block CTS 's development in Britain .
" We believe that , if the merger proceeds , Live Nation will seek to limit its relationship with CTS , with the effect of putting CTS 's future prospects in the UK in considerable doubt , " said Christopher Clarke , deputy chairman of the commission , who led the inquiry into the deal .
Both Ticketmaster and Live Nation are based in the US , which means the commission cannot block the whole deal .
However , it could insist that one or other of the parties sells its UK operations , or sells a proportion of tickets through a rival such as CTS .
The Competition Commission is seeking comments on its provisional findings , and plans to issue a final report on 24 November after it has considered " a range of possible ways to address the loss of competition " .
Live Nation and Ticketmaster said that they respected the commission 's work , but insisted they were still committed to a merger .
Outside the US and UK , the deal would affect operations in 13 markets worldwide .
Regulators have become involved in only two of those – Turkey and Norway – and in both instances the deal was approved .
The companies said today they were confident their merger will ultimately go ahead .
" We firmly believe that our merger achieves an important and much needed public interest , and remain optimistic that it will ultimately be approved , " they said in a statement .
They painted a bleak picture of the music industry , portraying themselves as potential saviours .
" The recording industry is a shell of its former self .
Where the recording industry was once the economic engine for the music business , it is live entertainment that is now the future of the music industry .
" We believe this merger will build a more efficient and effective company moving forward , and that working together we will be able to help achieve needed change that will strengthen a flagging music industry . "
But the Competition Commission warned that the merger could result in " lower levels of innovation " .
Rivals have applauded the ruling .
Seatwave , the UK - based reseller of tickets , claimed it was " great for fans " .
" Clearly , the Competition Commission believes that more choice in the market leads to lower ticket prices for fans , " said Joe Cohen , Seatwave 's chief executive .
The strength of Linux , or why Mac OS X is weak as development environment
Something like one year ago I switched from Linux to Mac OS X .
It was not an easy switch if you think that my desktop on Linux used to be this one , that is , just fvmw2 with a minimal configuration , super fast virtual desktop , border - less windows .
Why I switched after more than 12 years of Linux ?
Actually I did n't decided to switch , just I got a macbook because I wanted to hack a bit with the iPhone SDK and with Mac OS X itself .
I installed Linux and Mac OS X in multi boot , and for a few weeks the user interface of Mac OS X was impossible to use for me .
But after a few more weeks I was using only Mac OS X for everything .
For the first time I had a system thatin all of its parts , it was a good desktop experience with consistent behavior .
Screen sharing was cool when working with remote people , no need to hack configuration files or to check why my webcam was not working .
To try new programs was as simple as downloading the disk image , opening it , and .
And .. as optional , the system still usable and responsive while it was performing a lot of I/O !
Not something Linux users are used to see .
Note that I 'm not the kind of guy that do n't want to hack with the system he is using .
I even wrote in the past .
But it was years ago and I was still willing to trust that Linux after all was young and that it was improving in the desktop side .
Now enough is enough , with my computer I want just to focus on what I 'm doing without spending hours trying to fix unrelated desktop stuff .
When I sayI do n't think about an IDE or something like this .
I used to program with a terminal and vim , and I still code this way on Mac OS X , so in this respect nothing changed .
What I 'm missing are a number of important tools that made the Linux experience so much comfortable .
So here is my list of what 's wrong with Mac OS X , or if you want to read it the other way around , of what is cool with Linux ..
If you are serious about writing C code you can't live without valgrind .
Valgrind turns you into a better programmer .
The code you produce is times more reliable after you discover this tool .
It is invaluable , and guess what ... it started to be usable for Mac OS X only lately , then Snow Leopard came and broken everything already .
There are patches that make it barely working with issues ( AFAIK things will get better when the new source code of Darwin will be relased ) , but , this is one of the most important tools of a C developer together with the compiler , it must be rock solid ..
Homegrow , Fink , and alike , are great tools , but seriously , they are no way as cool as the apt - get in a good distribution like Debian or Ubuntu .
You can find tons of libraries , full systems , with perfect dependencies , fully managed by people that are serious users of this projects , that will tell you that something changed in this new release when you upgrade , " do you want to automatically fix your old config file ? " or things like this .
And ... theof tools is impressive .
From the mainstream to the almost unknown library , there is almost everything .
Want the GD lib for Tcl ?
There is .
Want an old release of a lib ?
Sure .
Documentation , full application servers , everything .
I can turn a freshly installed Debian system into a production server with everything inside to run a web application in one hour or less ( every system administrator can ) .
It 's wonderful .
And guess what ?
Developers need to simulate the systems they are developing for , in short time and without too much efforts in order to be productive ..
Mac OS X API , excluding the POSIX calls , change simply too often for my tastes , and there is nowhere the same amount of information you can find about Linux .
For instance I compiled nmap yesterday for snow leopard , and guess what , it was not working , unable to open the interfaces .
The compiled binary I downloaded from insecure.org worked against the loopback interface but not against the wifi one .
The interface to capture raw frames from the airport extreme changed again with snow leopard , breaking valuable programs like Kismac .
It 's not an open platform so this changes are even worse .
I know Mac OS X exposes similar informations in other ways , but I sincerely miss the proc filesystem , it was a quick way to explore what was going behind the scenes without having to remember hard - to - remember names to grep ..
Do n't know why but gprof does not work with the standard GCC ( the one installed by the official Apple SDK ) .
Tried to compile applications with -- arch i386 too , still not working .
I bet there is a trivial way to fix it , did n't googled , but it 's not OK profiling does not work out of the box with the official compiler .
This are the things that I 'm remembering just now , but there are more , little problems that I encounter in my everyday programming experience with Mac OS X that I did n't had with Linux .
I still continue to use Mac OS X as my first development platform because while I code I also want a good desktop to surf the web , tweet , chat , and so on , but in order to do my paywork ( that 's about web development mostly ) and my open source development with Redis I 've to use a Linux box constantly in order to be more productive .
Chicago , Illinois ( CNN ) --
For Jewel Mitchell , it was the worst Christmas of her life , the pain so raw she secluded herself in her bedroom to shield her two young daughters .
It was 1996 , and the man she was supposed to marry - the man her girls idolized - had already been gone two years .
But this Christmas , he was supposed to come home and pick up where they had left off :
Walking Latoni and Latoya to school .
Playing Chutes and Ladders with them on Friday nights .
Taking their mother on dates to the lakefront to watch the waves of Lake Michigan dance .
But Jewel 's fiancé was n't returning to their home on Chicago 's South Side .
Five days earlier , Dean Cage , had been sentenced to 40 years in prison for an aggravated sexual assault he said he did n't commit .
Jewel was his alibi .
At the time of the attack , she said , he was asleep next to her .
The day they 'd planned to marry had come and gone with Dean in the Cook County Jail , unable to afford bond set at half a million dollars .
When his trial date finally arrived -- just two months before this miserable Christmas -- Jewel listened to a young girl describe the man who brutally attacked her as she walked to her bus stop on a dark November morning .
She was just 15 .
Those were difficult days for Jewel , but at least then she could still cling to the hope that the world would soon learn what she knew without a doubt :
This was a case of mistaken identity .
On the day of the verdict , family and co-workers packed the courtroom to support a man who'd never been arrested before in his life .
Jewel wore her best navy pantsuit and told her older brother : Today , my fiancé is coming home .
But the truth did not prevail .
Two years after being arrested , Dean was declared guilty , and Jewel 's optimism was drained away , her hope annihilated .
She would put on a happy face to celebrate the holiday with her daughters .
But the Christmas gifts she 'd bought Dean , a boom box and a pair of black Timberland boots , lay on the bedroom floor , unopened .

Separated by bars , freedom lost
It is the most unlikely love story .
When the world labeled her fiancé guilty of a monstrous crime , Jewel refused to believe it .
When the judge sentenced him to four decades in the Illinois penitentiary system , she stood by him .
" I love him , " she would say .
" It 's as simple as that .
He was good to me and my girls .
He 's a good man . "
Ask a defense attorney how many clients profess innocence .
Ask a prison warden how many inmates claim they are not guilty .
The answer is the same : Denial is epidemic behind bars .
" We get about 200 to 300 new letters a month " from prisoners who say they 've been wrongly convicted , says one attorney at the Innocence Project , a national nonprofit that works to exonerate the innocent .
Since its inception in 1992 , the group has used DNA testing to overturn convictions of 244 inmates .
By the time those prisoners won their freedom -- they had served an average of 12 years -- many had lost the bonds that would help them make a new life on the outside .
One study shows marriages are three times more likely to fail when a man is incarcerated .
There is no movie night or anniversary dinner when a boyfriend or husband is locked up .
Even for women like Jewel , single - minded about their loved one 's innocence , time tests the relationship .
Women face emotional abandonment and the challenges of a long - distance relationship .
Sometimes financial responsibilities , the burden of single parenting and prejudice from outsiders drive them away .
If Jewel stuck by Dean , she'd be the rare exception .
Who would blame her if she simply moved on ?
A smile that lit up the room
They met on an icy evening in Chicago in the winter of 1992 .
A crumpled scarf protected Jewel 's face from the sharp wind as she walked home from her job as a waitress at the historic Daley 's Restaurant .
At her mother 's house , where 23 - year - old Jewel still lived , she found a stranger playing a video game with her cousin .
Dean Cage was 25 , a thin man who flaunted his muscular 6 - foot frame .
He wore his hair trimmed short , curved along his head like M.C. Hammer .
And he flashed a wide , animated smile .
" It lit up the room , " Jewel remembers .
The two sipped Pepsi in the dining room and discovered shared passions : Both were raised Baptist and loved card games and children .
Dean had three sons in Arkansas from a previous relationship ; Jewel had two daughters .
Neither Dean nor Jewel had ever married .
He worked at a warehouse that packaged paper cups .
His manners were impeccable .
Raised by his grandparents in Hope , Arkansas , he was a Southern gentleman who uttered " please " and " thank you " frequently .
That made her glow .
" He said he would come back the next day , but I did n't think it would be so soon , " Jewel recalls .
" He came back the next , and then the next day and then every day . "
The two became inseparable .
They went bowling together , barbequed hot dogs and chicken with cousins on the lakefront .
They drank champagne at birthday parties , and giggled and danced until her heels were sore .
After six months , they moved into a house with her daughters and became a family .
Jewel 's mother adored her daughter 's new boyfriend .
An old - fashioned , churchgoing woman who believed in the sanctity of marriage , Jewel 's mother , also named Jewel , married once and had nine children .
She bombarded the couple with questions :
When will you two get married ?
she teased .
After two years of dating , the proposal sprang casually from a conversation about children one day in September 1994 .
I wo n't have another child out of wedlock , Jewel told Dean .
No silly , we 're going to get married , of course , he responded .
Will you marry me ?
He already knew the answer .
The man in the funny hat
They set their wedding for the following spring : May 13 , her mother 's birthday .
The couple looked at rings , and Jewel dreamed of green bridesmaid dresses .
But the wedding day passed with Dean in jail .
He sought a bench trial - putting his future in the hands of a judge - because his lawyer felt the heinousness of the crime and the victim 's young age might make the jury biased .
In October 1996 , the girl , by then 17 , took the stand at a Cook County courthouse and told her story : A black man wearing a black leather motorcycle jacket and " funny looking hat " jumped her from behind at the corner of Wabash and 70th Street , threatened to kill her and dragged her into the basement of a building .
There he sodomized , beat and performed oral sex on her .
A few days after the attack , police received an anonymous tip :
The composite sketch made from the victim 's description of her assailant resembled a man at a butcher shop .
Police took the victim there and she identified Dean .
She later testified that his voice sounded similar to her attacker's .
Dean testified in his own defense .
He said he'd slept late on November 14 , 1994 , and did n't leave the house until 7:30 a.m. , more than an hour after the incident occurred .
Jewel 's testimony buttressed his .
She said she and Dean were in bed together late that morning .
But prosecutors grilled her about her black leather jacket , which they believed was the same leather motorcycle jacket worn by the assailant .
Dean 's attorney argued there was no physical evidence to link his client to the crime .
After Dean 's conviction , Jewel and her daughters moved back in with her mother , no longer able to live in their own place without Dean 's support .
Jewel 's mother baby - sat the girls while her daughter waitressed and managed the cash register at Daley 's , sometimes until 2 or 3 a.m .
The 45 - minute train ride home on the Red Line felt like eternity .
Her walk through South Side streets notorious for violence was like sprinting through a two - mile war zone , deflecting hollers and threats as drunks shot dice in the streets .
The extra money she scraped together went to finding a place she and the girls could call their own , a three - bedroom apartment above a church .
Robbers ransacked the place twice while she worked the late shift .
Thankfully , her daughters were at their grandmother 's house .
" A lot of things would have been different if Dean were around , " Jewel says .
" If they knew he had been living there , they would n't have come . "
But Dean was n't there - except in the only way he could be , through phone calls and letters .
Transferred to four different institutions -- one on the opposite side of the state , more than four hours away - Dean worked in the prison laundry rooms and cafeterias .
He was a model inmate who the guards liked so much they sneaked him outside during lockdown to shoot hoops .
On birthdays and holidays , he mailed cards and money orders to his three boys in Arkansas and to Jewel 's daughters .
Latoni and Latoya may not have been his biological children , but he treated them as if they were - something that always surprised Jewel 's family .
" Before dad went away , I just remember laughs and smiles , " says Latoni Mitchell , now 21 .
" When he was gone , it was hard to get through -- not just for my mom , but on the whole family . "
With her mother at work , Latoni stepped in to help parent her sister , two years younger .
Both girls grieved their father 's absence .
He had brought them strawberry ice cream when their skin itched with chicken pox .
He had attended PTA meetings and chaperoned on field trips to the Lincoln Park Zoo .
Some kids envied the little girls whose father , unlike their own , visited the school so often .
Now the students taunted Latoni and Latoya , calling their daddy a rapist .
Connected by visits and letters
Nighttime was the most difficult .
Dean sandwiched Jewel 's perfume - scented letters into his pillowcase .
Jewel wore his flannel pajamas to bed , trying to draw him close .
Despite their faith in God , they sometimes felt lost .
Why us , they asked .
We are good people .
Why does this happen to good people ?
" It was almost like he was dead , " Jewel says .
" That 's how bad it hurt . "
Prison visits became a routine part of family life , and the trips were no vacation .
The length of each visit hinged on the kindness of the guards .
The frequency depended on how much money Jewel could save for gas .
" She was trying to live her life but never forgetting , " says Audrey Vandurhust , Jewel 's older sister , who served as the family photographer and sent shoeboxes full of family photos to Dean .
In between visits , the couple wrote .
Jewel 's colorful cards captured her emotions .
" When things get rough , " one said , " I can feel God 's kindness in your friendship , and I can feel his love lift me up when you reach out to me . "
Dean peppered Jewel with questions about everyday life : " Have you heard anything else about your Section 8 ?
How is your car running ?
Baby , I know you know you got to check on your oil and brakes every once in a while , right ? "
He signed every letter the same way :
" Your one and only , Dean "
The legend of the Innocence Project
Two words are legend in the Illinois penitentiary system : Innocence Project .
The story of one man 's freedom becomes another man 's hope .
Shortly after the judge found Dean guilty , an inmate at the Cook County Jail told him about the Innocence Project .
Thus began a research project that would consume him behind bars - and , he hoped , set him free .
" It was a nightmare , " Dean said .
" Guys look at you funny when you 're labeled a rapist .
I had to keep defying the lies . "
In the prison library , Dean dedicated hundreds of hours to scrutinizing his case and examining the law .
What went wrong , what could have been done better ?
In December 1997 , he filed his first appeal to the First District Appellate Court - and wrote his first letter to the Innocence Project
In both , Dean focused on tests for sexually transmitted diseases that both he and the victim underwent .
He tested negative for chlamydia and trichomoniasis ; the victim tested positive .
The judge threw out the tests , arguing the results were irrelevant .
They were never introduced at trial .
Dean also raised questions about how he was identified .
He pointed out that he had no prior record , and that there was no physical evidence linking him to the crime .
At the Innocence Project 's New York office , Dean 's letter did not go unnoticed .
The attorneys wrote him back .
They could not take his case - yet .
But they would put it on a waiting list to be reviewed .
The nonprofit has limited resources to handle the thousands of letters they receive from inmates each year .
It accepts only cases in which DNA testing can yield conclusive proof of innocence .
Wrongful convictions , the group found , occur in a number of ways : faulty witness identification , false confessions , police misconduct and poor legal representation .
Witness misidentifications are responsible for three - fourths of wrongful convictions .
And of those , about 70 percent of the inmates are minorities like Dean .
He was determined to leave the place he called a " hellhole . "
In letters and visits , Dean told Jewel about the group that could fix this terrible mistake .
By August 1998 , they 'd already used DNA to exonerate 11 inmates in the Illinois prison system .
Jewel dared to feel hope that Dean would be next .
A new proposal
Jewel was exhausted as she pulled into Danville Correctional Facility in central Illinois , a three - hour drive from her home in Chicago .
Since Dean 's arrest seven years earlier , she was working late to support her family and slept unusual hours .
Her girls , now 13 and 11 , could push her buttons , and she was tired on this particular day from dealing with their rebellion .
It was the summer of 2001 , and Dean was still on the Innocence Project 's waiting list - three years after he'd first written them .
The courts had rejected his first appeal ; the second , filed in 1999 , awaited a response from the state of Illinois .
Sitting down across from Dean in the visitors ' room , Jewel thought he looked weak and hunched over .
The toll prison took on him sometimes came through the phone .
He would call crying after witnessing a stabbing or a rape .
Or tell her about cellmates who had killed family members and showed no remorse .
Dean had lost weight from the strain .
So had Jewel .
He knew , too , the unseen impact of his incarceration on Jewel .
He knew people in the community gossiped about her , called her crazy .
A childhood friend treated Jewel like an irrational teen .
How do you even know Dean will want you when he gets out ?
she asked .
Friends offered to set her up on blind dates .
Potential suitors flirted with her .
When Mitchell politely rejected the matchmaking offers , rumors swirled that she might be a lesbian .
Even her older brother nudged her casually to reconsider : " Dean might be innocent " he said , " but it do n't look good . "
Dean did n't want Jewel to suffer any longer - or to remember him this way .
He wanted something better for the fiancée he called " Baby . "
He swallowed his selfishness and made a very different proposal from the one he'd made on the day he asked her to marry him .
Move on , he told her .
Her cheeks grew warm , her heart raced .
What was he saying ?
Why would he tell her this ?
Had he found someone else ?
It was n't fair .
She 'd waited patiently for him .
Seven whole years .
Now what ?
Would she finally have to let go ?

Karthik ( KV ) crosses the reader - contributor divide to give us his take on the subtleties of Arsenal ’s 4 - 3 - 3 system .
______________________________________________________________________________
From time immemorial variation has led to the survival of species .
Slight variations have caused species to evolve through the years , making them more adept to the environment .
Last season ’s 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 did not quite have the right balance , with the countless number of low - scoring draws serving as evidence .
A slight variation in the formation has revolutionized the way we play the game and Arsenal is not only scoring goals , they are scoring quality goals .
Let us amplify the variations and analyze them .
“ We will play the formation and system that most suits the players and the balance of the team , ” Wenger says .
“ That means it ’s not rigid .
It can evolve throughout the season , depending on circumstances and personnel . ”
These few lines act as the epitome of Arsenal ’s formation this season .
It is fluid , enabling the individual brilliance and creativity of players to be unleashed .
The system sanctions the ‘ pass and offer ’ style of play , which has been the basis on which Wenger ball has been established .
It is a 4 - 3 - 3 which morphs into a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 .
“ I wanted to play high up the pitch and it can change in some games , ” said Wenger .
“ But overall I believe we can play high up and we can bring the threat to the opponents half very early in the game . ”
The cardinal aim of the system is to push the players high up the pitch into the opponents half .
This positions the likes of Fabregas , Arshavin and VanPersie deep into the opponents half which increases the killer impact of the final ball resulting in a goal .
The marching into the opposite half is done through lubricious passing and intricate movement .
Effective pressuring of defenders up front to rob the ball is necessary to keep possession .
Last season , Arsenal had abandoned the creative approach to a more direct game plan .
This has had an effect as Arsenal are investing that extra bit of effort by shipping men forward quickly so that the opposition have less time to regroup and defend .
This has created more one on ones in the counter and the likes of Diaby arrive late in the box to finish of the chances .
“ I must say he is attracted like a magnet by the opponent ’s goal , ” said Wenger on Diaby ’s attacking instincts .
His animal instincts are used as a late arrival ( llegada ) where he rushes into the box unmarked to score the goal .
This ploy seems to be extremely effective as the defenders are completely unaware of the run and it results in a goal more often than not .
Wenger has always mentioned that he likes to have ten ‘ players of the ball ’ on the field .
This can not be truer as the detached centre - back makes a surging run into the box which paralyses the opponents for a few seconds , taken by the player to execute the goal .
Arshavin is given the freedom of the flank this season .
He can cut in and operate as a second striker or he can choose to be touchline hugging ( or hogging ) .
By cutting in , he creates space for the Left back to advance and cross and for the left - sided midfielder to utilize .
Fabio Capello says that “ in the modern game , the only formation is 9 - 1 , ” which means that he accedes the centre - forward is a base on which teams build their attack .
The former Brazil manager Carlos Parriera added another twist to Cappello ’s view by predicting that the teams in the future may see no fixed striker .
Roma mastered this tactic by deploying Totti , a trequartista by trade as a lone man up front .
Then Manchester United put out a variation where the front four kept constantly interchanging , adding the ‘ strikerless ’ effect to the formation .
Arsenal seems to be the ‘ new kid on the block ’ as the prolific Robin Van Persie combines both the variation expertly to make our formation ‘ strikerless ’ .
He starts off in the center and as the clock ticks , he moves wider , drops deep and he interchanges with the wingers .
This leaves the defenders on the fence and confused as they will create space for the other players to exploit by following Van Persie .
If not , they will give precious time for the player to craft the next move .
“ It can get a little bit lonely for him ( van Persie ) , ” says Wenger .
“ But that depends how quick and how massive the support is we give him .
I believe that we work on that , you know ?
That he gets quick support and he needs people around him because he ’s a combination player , more than a physical player .
That ’s why the distances within our side are important , that he ’s not isolated . ”
It is an often argued point that water tight defenses bring you silverware .
To ensure this Arsenal have quite an efficient defense .
They play very high up the pitch , close to the touchline .
They are mobile and good readers of the game and need to be alert to the counter attack .
Song does a spectacular job sitting in front of the defense , slapping any counter attacks coming his way .
He covers for the CB if he goes out to attack .
The second function midfielder , namely Diaby plays a vital role in determining the shape of the team .
His job is to forage the space left over by Arshavin in the left - wing .
When we have the ball , the shape can be described as a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 as Diaby and Cesc advance to be in line with the wingers .
They provide extra man power around the box to create more triangles in the pass .
When we do n’t have the ball , the front three hunt up front to retrieve the ball as Diaby and Fabregas drop deeper to defend .
The beauty of the formation is that it can hardly be described by figures like 4 - 3 - 3 or 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 .
The fluidity allows the team to morph into various shapes .
The unpredictability and the variation make it deadly dangerous and lethal .
That is the aim and hopefully the end products will be silverware , silverware and more silverware .
U.S. military create live remote - controlled beetles to bug conversations
Spies may soon be bugging conversations using actual insects , thanks to research funded by the US military .
The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has spent years developing a whole host of cyborg critters , in the hopes of creating the ultimate ' fly on the wall ' .
Now a team of researchers led by Hirotaka Sato have created cyborg beetles which are guided wirelessly via a laptop .
Researchers at UC Berkeley have implanted surveillance equipment into beetles that allows them to control where they fly
Using implants , they worked out how to control a beetle 's take - off , flight and landing by stimulating the brain to work the wings .
They controlled turns through stimulating the basilar muscles on one side or the other to make the wings on that side flap harder .
The embedded system uses nerve and muscle stimulators , a microbattery and a microcontroller with transceiver .
They were implanted in the beetles when they were at the pupal stage .
Three types of large beetles from Cameroon were used in the experiments at the University of California in Berkeley .
The smallest was 2 cm long , while the largest was 20 cm .
Unsettling footage of the beetles in action has been released on YouTube .
Watch video of the cyborg beetle here ...
According to Professor Noel Sharkey , an international expert on artificial intelligence and robotics from Sheffield University , there have been attempts in the past to control insects such as cockroaches , but this is the first time the flight of insects has been controlled remotely .
Professor Sharkey questioned the ultimate military application of remotely controlled beetles as you would also need to implant a GPS transmitter and a camera too .
This would be too heavy for even the largest beetle to carry .
Researchers suggest the remote - controlled beetles could serve as couriers to inaccessible places
The Berkeley researchers suggested the ' cyborg ' beetles - part beetle , part machine - could serve as models for micro air vehicles .
Sato and colleagues also said the beetles could serve as couriers to inaccessible locations .
The Berkeley team is also experimenting on dragonflies , flies and moths because of their ' unmatched flight capabilities ' .
DARPA 's ultimate aim is to create cyborg insects that can fly more than 300 ft to their target and then stay put until commanded to buzz off again .

This article shows off a Ruby gem which has the power to overwrite a Ruby binary in memory while it is running to allow your code to execute in place of internal VM functions .
This is useful if you ’d like to hook all object allocation functions to build a memory profiler .
This gem is on GitHub
Yes , it ’s on GitHub : http://github.com/ice799/memprof.
I want a memory profiler for Ruby
This whole science experiment started during RubyConf when Aman and I began brainstorming ways to build a memory profiling tool for Ruby .
The big problem in our minds was that for most tools we ’d have to include patches to the Ruby VM .
That process is long and somewhat difficult , so I started thinking about ways to do this without modifying the Ruby source code itself .
The memory profiler is NOT DONE just yet .
I thought that the hack I wrote to let us build something without modifying Ruby source code was interesting enough that it warranted a blog post .
So let ’s get rolling .
What is a trampoline ?
Let ’s pretend you have 2 functions : functionA ( ) and functionB ( ) .
Let ’s assume that functionA ( ) calls functionB ( ) .
Now also imagine that you ’d like to insert a piece of code to execute in between the call to functionB ( ) .
You can imagine inserting a piece of code that diverts execution elsewhere , creating a flow : functionA ( ) –> functionC( ) –> functionB ()
You can accomplish this by inserting a trampoline .
A trampoline is a piece of code that program execution jumps into and then bounces out of and on to somewhere else .
This hack relies on the use of multiple trampolines .
We ’ll see why shortly .
Two different kinds of trampolines
There are two different kinds of trampolines that I considered while writing this hack , let ’s take a closer look at both .
Caller - side trampoline
A caller - side trampoline works by overwriting the opcodes in the . text segment of the program in the calling function causing it to call a different function at runtime .
The big pros of this method are :
You are n’t overwriting any code , only the address operand of a callq instruction .
instruction .
Since you are only changing an operand , you can hook any function .
You do n’t need to build custom trampolines for each function .
This method also has some big cons too :
You ’ll need to scan the entire binary in memory and find and overwrite all address operands of callq .
This is problematic because if you overwrite any false - positives you might break your application .
and find and all address operands of .
This is problematic because if you overwrite any false - positives you might break your application .
You have to deal with the implications of callq , which can be painful as we ’ll see soon .
Callee - side trampoline
A callee - side trampoline works by overwriting the opcodes in the . text segment of the program in the called function , causing it to call another function immediately
The big pro of this method is :
You only need to overwrite code in one place and do n’t need to worry about accidentally scribbling on bytes that you did n’t mean to .
this method has some big cons too :
You ’ll need to carefully construct your trampoline code to only overwrite as little of the function as possible ( or some how restore opcodes ) , especially if you expect the original function to work as expected later .
You ’ll need to special case each trampoline you build for different optimization levels of the binary you are hooking into .
I went with a caller - side trampoline because I wanted to ensure that I can hook any function and not have to worry about different Ruby binaries causing problems when they are compiled with different optimization levels .
The stage 1 trampoline
To insert my trampolines I needed to insert some binary into the process and then overwrite callq instructions like this :
41150b : e8 cc 4e 02 00 callq 4363dc [ rb_newobj ] 411510 : 48 89 45 f8 ....
In the above code snippet , the byte e8 is the callq opcode and the bytes cc 4e 02 00 are the distance to rb_newobj from the address of the next instruction , 0×411510
All I need to do is change the 4 bytes following e8 to equal the displacement between the next instruction , 0×411510 in this case , and my trampoline .
Problem .
My first cut at this code lead me to an important realization : the callq instructions used expect a 32 bit displacement from the function I am calling and not absolute addresses .
But , the 64bit address space is very large .
The displacement between the code for the Ruby binary that lives in the . text segment is so far away from my Ruby gem that the displacement cannot be represented with only 32 bits .
So what now ?
Well , luckily mmap has a flag MAP_32BIT which maps a page in the first 2GB of the address space .
If I map some code there , it should be well within the range of values whose displacement I can represent in 32 bits .
So , why not map a second trampoline to that page which can contains code that can call an absolute address ?
My stage 1 trampoline code looks something like this :
/* the struct below is just a sequence of bytes which represent the * following bit of assembly code , including 3 nops for padding : * * mov $ address , %rbx * callq * %rbx * ret * nop * nop * nop */ struct tramp_tbl_entry ent = { .mov = {'\ x48 ' , '\xbb'} , .addr = ( long long ) &error_tramp , .callq = {' \xff ' , '\xd3'} , .ret = ' \xc3 ' , .pad = {'\x90 ' , '\x90 ' , '\x90'} , } ; tramp_table = mmap( NULL , 4096 , PROT_WRITE|PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC , MAP_32BIT|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_PRIVATE , - 1 , 0 ) ; if ( tramp_table != MAP_FAILED ) { for ( ; i < 4096 / sizeof ( struct tramp_tbl_entry ) ; i ++ ) { memcpy ( tramp_table + i , &ent , sizeof ( struct tramp_tbl_entry ) ) ; } } }
It mmap s a single page and writes a table of default trampolines ( like a jump table ) that all call an error trampoline by default .
When a new trampoline is inserted , I just go to that entry in the table and insert the address that should be called .
To get around the displacement challenge described above , the addresses I insert into the stage 1 trampoline table are addresses for stage 2 trampolines .
The stage 2 trampoline
Setting up the stage 2 trampolines are pretty simple once the stage 1 trampoline table has been written to memory .
All that needs to be done is update the address field in a free stage 1 trampoline to be the address of my stage 2 trampoline .
These trampolines are written in C and live in my Ruby gem .
static void insert_tramp ( char * trampee , void * tramp ) { void * trampee_addr = find_symbol ( trampee ) ; int entry = tramp_size ; tramp_table [ tramp_size ] .addr = ( long long ) tramp ; tramp_size ++ ; update_image ( entry , trampee_addr ) ; }
An example of a stage 2 trampoline for rb_newobj might be :
static VALUE newobj_tramp ( ) { /* print the ruby source and line number where the allocation is occuring */ printf ( " source = %s , line = %d
" , ruby_sourcefile , ruby_sourceline ) ; /* call newobj like normal so the ruby app can continue */ return rb_newobj ( ) ; }
Programatically rewriting the Ruby binary in memory
Overwriting the Ruby binary to cause my stage 1 trampolines to get hit is pretty simple , too .
I can just scan the . text segment of the binary looking for bytes which look like callq instructions .
Then , I can sanity check by reading the next 4 bytes which should be the displacement to the original function .
Doing that sanity check should prevent false positives .
static void update_image ( int entry , void * trampee_addr ) { char * byte = text_segment ; size_t count = 0 ; int fn_addr = 0 ; void * aligned_addr = NULL ; /* check each byte in the . text segment */ for ( ; count < text_segment_len ; count ++ ) { /* if it looks like a callq instruction ... */ if ( * byte == ' \xe8 ' ) { /* the next 4 bytes SHOULD BE the original displacement */ fn_addr = *( int *) ( byte +1 ) ; /* do a sanity check to make sure the next few bytes are an accurate displacement .
* this helps to eliminate false positives .
*/ if ( trampee_addr - ( void *) ( byte +5 ) == fn_addr ) { aligned_addr = ( void * ) ( ( ( long ) byte+1 ) & ~( 0xffff ) ) ; /* mark the page in the . text segment as writable so it can be modified */ mprotect ( aligned_addr , ( void *) byte + 1 - aligned_addr + 10 , PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC ) ; /* calculate the new displacement and write it */ *( int *) ( byte +1 ) = ( uint32_t ) ( ( void *) ( tramp_table + entry ) - ( void *) ( byte + 5 ) ) ; /* disallow writing to this page of the . text segment again */ mprotect ( aligned_addr , ( (( void *) byte +1 ) - aligned_addr ) + 10 , PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC ) ; } } byte ++ ; } }
Sample output
After requiring my ruby gem and running a test script which creates lots of objects , I see this output :
... source = test.rb , line = 8 source = test.rb , line = 8 source = test.rb , line = 8 source = test.rb , line = 8 source = test.rb , line = 8 source = test.rb , line = 8 source = test.rb , line = 8 ...
Showing the file name and line number for each object getting allocated .
That should be a strong enough primitive to build a Ruby memory profiler without requiring end users to build a custom version of Ruby .
It should also be possible to re-implement bleak_house by using this gem ( and maybe another trick or two ) .
Awesome .
Conclusion
One step closer to building a memory profiler without requiring end users to find and use patches floating around the internet .
It is unclear whether cheap tricks like this are useful or harmful , but they are fun to write .
to write .
If you understand how your system works at an intimate level , nearly anything is possible .

Deputy Premier Paul Lucas says if the Traveston Crossing dam cannot be built for environmental reasons , then no new dam in Queensland will ever be able to be built .
Opponents of the proposed dam on the Mary River near Gympie , in the state 's south - east , conducted their annual protest horse ride through the region yesterday , which they have done every year since the project was announced in 2006 .
Mr Lucas says if the dam is not built , a more costly solution will be required .
" If we do n't have Traveston , something else will need to be built , " he said .
" It 'll be an extra desalination plant and it will be more expensive and people 's water will go up further .
" Traveston is a good solution , it is a good outcome , and if people say they should n't be building Traveston , then they should be consistent and say we should never build another dam anywhere in Queensland . "
Mr Lucas says while opponents have the right to protest , the dam is still important .
" Do n't think back and think just because it 's rained a bit in the last year or so that we can forget the importance of continuing to build the water grid or in 10 years ' time we 'll get to where we were again , and people will say ' why did n't you build Traveston ? ' "
No hurry - up
The Queensland Government says it is not pressuring the Commonwealth to hurry its decision on the dam .
The state 's coordinator - general is seeking federal comment on a draft dam report before sending the final version to federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett for consideration .
Feedback has reportedly been requested by Wednesday .
Queensland Planning Minister Stirling Hinchliffe says it is a matter for the coordinator - general , not the State Government .
" I understood it was a matter of weeks so that might make sense , but I have n't interrogated the particular date , " he said .
" In providing the draft report , he sought particular feedback in a certain time frame so he can finalise his report .
" The coordinator - general and his office have been dealing with all these matters entirely independently . "
Wow .
The Medved Show today went very differently than I expected .
I was all prepared to talk about evolution and intelligent design ; instead , Stephen Meyer of the anti-evolutionist Discovery Institute spent far more time attacking climate science than evolutionary science .
In this endeavor , he pulled out all the old chestnuts : the Oregon Petition , cooling during the 1970s , the alleged end to warming in this decade , satellite versus ground temperature measurements ... egads .
I 'll have more to say here about what I meant to say there , but for now , just an observation :
If I were Meyer , and I wanted to make the case for intelligent design as good science , I would not tie my position at all to global warming denial , much less in such a close way as I heard him doing today .
That 's two wildly controversial scientific positions to explain , instead of one ; it starts you down the Tom Bethell road of denying almost everything , including HIV / AIDS and even relativity and even even Shakespeare 's authorship of his plays .
Not good for credibility .... and it makes me wonder , how many folks from the Discovery Institute also attack climate science ?
Megan Williams now says she was lying all along when accusing seven men of kidnapping , sexually abusing and assaulting her .
The seven plead guilty to charges two years ago .
Indeed , “ former Logan County prosecutor Brian Abraham , who was in charge of the case , said no one ever went to jail because of Williams ’ statements .
Instead , Abraham said Tuesday night , he decided early in the case not to rely on Williams ’ statements , but on the physical evidence and the statements of the co-defendants . ”
And what did the defendants admit to ?
“ According to the admissions of those eventually convicted , Williams was physically and sexually abused .
She was beaten repeatedly , held against her will , burned with hot wax , stabbed in the leg , and forced to perform oral sex on at least two defendants . ”
So let me get this straight .
The supposed victim claims all the crimes were made up , yet government officials claim that the evidence apart from her accusations — as in , the evidence of something that Williams now admits never happened — was enough to send them to prison .
Now , if something did not happen , and prosecutors claim the evidence and the process were still legally sufficient to put innocent people in jail , then the entire system is n’t even theoretically just .
Williams ’s attorney muses , “ It sounds to me that there are innocent people held in jail for something they did not do .
I have no idea what convinced them to plead guilty . ”
Well , I have an idea .
The entire criminal justice system , like any socialist institution , is inherently rigged against actual justice .
And so most people sent to prison never enjoy a trial , but instead are bullied into pleading guilty because they know their chances with a trial are slim , that the cards are stacked against them , and that if they lose a trial they will end up punished far harsher than what they could “ negotiate ” in a plea bargain .
Despite all these plea bargains , our system is not one characterized by leniency , as we have more prisoners , both in absolute terms and per capita , than any other nation on earth .
And so most convicts plead guilty , but we can not be sure if they are actually guilty , as this was never proven beyond a reasonable doubt , even by the state ’s own terms .
When it is so much more attractive to cop to a heinous crime than to fight a false charge , even confessions must be doubted as a matter of course .
Perhaps the standard should be to prove the crime beyond a reasonable doubt , regardless of what the accused says .
But that would require far too much deliberation for each case .
This would be possible in a civil society with very few crimes , but when there are seven million Americans on parole or probation or behind bars , procedural niceties cannot get in the way of an ever expanding prison state .
I could n’t guess how many innocents have been wrongly imprisoned , even having plead guilty , for crimes they did not commit , including truly vicious crimes .
But I do know that I cannot possibly trust the state when it says someone is guilty , even if there ’s a confession .
A system that is able to railroad seven people into confessing to crimes they never committed , whose sentencing seems to prosecutors to be soundly based on “ physical evidence ” and their own desperate guilty pleas , even in retrospect , even despite it being clear there was no crime all along , can simply never be trusted in general to protect justice , nor in any given case not to have committed a great error or engaged in great immorality .

Sentence on Smith and the girl was deferred at the High Court in Glasgow A woman and teenage girl who assaulted a 53 - year - old man before pouring petrol over him and setting him alight have been convicted of attempted murder .
Isabella Smith , 50 , and the 14 - year - old girl , who cannot be named , carried out the attack on Eric Little at his home in Glasgow in January last year .
At the High Court in Glasgow , sentence on Smith was deferred until later this month pending a psychiatric report .
The girl was ordered to stay at a secure unit for the next six months .
The court heard how Smith , from Dennistoun , Glasgow , was a friend of Mr Little .
She and the girl repeatedly hit him on the head and body with a broom handle , brush head and a guitar at his flat in the city 's Reidvale Street on 11 and 12 of January last year .
They then poured petrol over his body and set fire to him .
Having regard to the gravity of the crime it is likely to be some form of detention .
How you perform over the next six months will determine when you are released
Lord Brailsford Mr Little was found the following day by a neighbour who called the police and an ambulance .
He spent several weeks in hospital with severe burns .
No reason was given in court for the attack , although days before Mr Little had apparently accused the girl of stealing a ring .
The trial heard that spatters of Mr Little 's blood were found on Smith 's shoes and the girl 's fingerprints were on lighters found in the flat .
During the trial both blamed the other for the attack .
Judge Lord Brailsford deferred sentence on Smith until later this month and called for a psychiatric report to be prepared .
Public safety
He deferred sentence on the 14 - year - old and ordered her to stay at a secure unit for the next six months .
Lord Brailsford told the girl : " Clearly this court is concerned both for the safety of the public and also your own well - being .
You are in need of supervision .
" I am deferring sentence for six months .
I have made no decision whatsoever on the final disposal .
" Having regard to the gravity of the crime it is likely to be some form of detention .
How you perform over the next six months will determine when you are released . "

What if we could create wind energy without using windmills ?
What if we could do it in Detroit , using the city 's now - underutilized manufacturing base ?
That 's exactly what Dawn White and her Ann Arbor - based company ,
, are trying to do .
" If you can make a fan without blades , why not a wind generator without blades ? "
White asked the crowd Wednesday at TEDxDetroit , referring to the
.
Her company is developing an " aerovoltaic " technology that captures wind energy without blades .
She compared the technology to both solar panels and a thunderstorm .
" Opposing electrical charges are attracted to each other , " she explained .
" It takes energy to pull those apart .
That energy is provided by the wind and converted directly to electricity .
Electrokinetic wind energy .
Very much like what happens inside a thunderstorm actually .
" We start with an engineered tube fabricated into panels .
Out of that you can create something of various sizes and shapes . "
Size is the important part here .
White says that 20 percent of all proposed wind farms do n't get built because of site prevention ( think
) .
But Accio's tubes , like solar panels , are modular and therefore flexible .
Nonetheless , they 'd take up space .
Creating 1 kilowatt of silent wind energy would take roughly 640 inches of tube , she said .
Creating 1 gigawatt would require 12,000 miles of tubes .
Creating a significant amount of tubing would take significant manufacturing capacity , which is why the company sees opportunity in Detroit .
" In Detroit , the manufacturing story here is as important as the idea generation , " White said .
" We can make this the place to create a new kind of clean energy and restore our economy . "
White said her company could manufacture the tubing in Detroit for around a penny a foot , and used the Ford Rouge Factory as an example of space they could potentially use .
" We 're trying to create the Model T of wind energy , " she said , " Apply automotive mass production of creating non-turbine mass energy . "
Accio hopes to utilize Southeast Michigan 's existing manufacturing base to produce a product by 2012 .
ZURICH , Switzerland ( CNN ) -- Woody Allen , Pedro Almodovar and Martin Scorsese have " demanded the immediate release " of fellow filmmaker Roman Polanski , who was arrested in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant related to a 1977 child sex charge .
A supporter displays a " free Polanski " tag on his shirt during the Zurich Film Festival .
They were among 138 people in the film industry who signed a petition against the arrest .
Polanski was on the way to the Zurich Film Festival when Swiss police detained him in response to the American warrant .
The filmmaker pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor but fled before he could be sentenced .
He settled in France , where he holds citizenship .
Investigators in the United States say Polanski , then 43 , drugged and raped a 13 - year - old girl .
The filmmakers objected to his being arrested en route to the film festival , which held a tribute to him this year .
" It seems inadmissible to them that an international cultural event , paying homage to one of the greatest contemporary filmmakers , is used by the police to apprehend him , " said the petition , backed by France 's Societe des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques ( Society of Dramatic Authors and Composers ) .
" The arrest of Roman Polanski in a neutral country , where he assumed he could travel without hindrance ... opens the way for actions of which no one can know the effects , " said the signatories , who also included actresses Monica Bellucci and Tilda Swinton and directors David Lynch , Jonathan Demme , John Landis , Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and Wim Wenders .
In the United States , powerhouse movie producer Harvey Weinstein is trying to recruit more supporters for Polanksi .
" We are calling every filmmaker we can to help fix this terrible situation , " his company told CNN in a statement .
Polanski has filed an appeal against his extradition to the United States , Swiss authorities said .
They added that they would act on the case within weeks .
Polanski won an Academy Award for Best Director in 2003 for " The Pianist . "
He was nominated for a Best Director Oscar for " Tess " and " Chinatown , " and Best Writing for " Rosemary 's Baby , " which he also directed .
See examples of Polanski's work »
On Monday , French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said that he hoped authorities would respect Polanski's rights " and that the affair [ will ] come to a favorable resolution , " the ministry said in a statement .
The French culture and communications minister , Frederic Mitterrand , said he " learned with astonishment " of Polanski 's arrest and expressed solidarity with Polanski's family .
Polanski , 76 , was arrested Saturday on his arrival at Zurich 's airport .
A provisional arrest warrant had been issued last week out of Los Angeles , California , after authorities learned that he was going to be in Switzerland , Sandi Gibbons , spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office , said Sunday .
In a written statement , Polanski's California counsel said Monday that " an issue related to the Swiss extradition matter is presently being litigated before the California Court of Appeal .
We had hoped that this would be determinative of this case . "
" We were unaware of any extradition being sought , and separate counsel will be retained for those proceedings . "
The lawyers -- Douglas Dalton , Chad Hummel and Bart Dalton -- said prior deputy district attorneys had told them that no efforts were being made to extradite Polanski , who " owned a home in Switzerland for many years and worked throughout Europe during that time . "
There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years , but the sticking point has always been Polanski's refusal to return to the United States to attend hearings .
Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man who " drugged and raped a 13 - year - old child " to go free .
The Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was " in provisional detention . "
But whether he can be extradited to the United States " can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalized , " ministry spokesman Guido Balmer said in an e-mail .
" It is possible to appeal at the federal penal court of justice against an arrest warrant in view to extradition as well as against an extradition decision , " Balmer wrote .
" Their decisions can be taken further to the federal court of justice . "
Gibbons said the extradition process will be determined in Switzerland but said authorities are ready to move forward with Polanski 's sentencing , depending on what happens in Zurich .
Polanski was accused of plying the teenage girl with champagne and a sliver of a Quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts , including intercourse , with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson 's house .
Nicholson was not at home .
Polanski's lawyers tried this year to have the charges thrown out , but a judge in Los Angeles rejected the request .
However , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court .
Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way the director 's case was originally handled .
According to court documents , Polanski , his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they 'd worked out a deal that would spare Polanski from prison and let the young victim avoid a public trial .
But the original judge in the case , who is now dead , first sent the director to maximum - security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing .
Then , on the eve of his sentencing , the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days .
Polanski fled the United States for France , where he was born .
In the February hearing , Espinoza mentioned a documentary film , " Roman Polanski : Wanted and Desired , " that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media - obsessed judge who was worried his image would suffer if he did n't send Polanski to prison .
The documentary was first broadcast in June 2008 .
" It 's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct , " Espinoza said .
But he declined to dismiss the case .
Polanski's victim long ago came forward and made her identity public , mainly saying she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled .
Samantha Geimer , now 45 and a married mother of three , sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement .
She is among those calling for the case to be tossed out .
In court papers filed in January , she said , " I am no longer a 13 - year - old child .
I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception .
" Every time this case is brought to the attention of the court , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others .
That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case . "
CNN 's Jennifer Wolfe , Morgan Neill , Frederik Pleitgen , Brooke Bowman , Karan Olson and Ann O'Neill contributed to this report .

Irgendjemand hat mich aufgefordert , ich möge in meinem Blog doch nicht so “ amtsdeutsch ” schreiben , sondern einfach immer wieder Geschichten aus dem Bundestag erzählen .
So wie man eben guten Freunden mal bei Bier & Wein Geschichten erzählt .
Nun gut : Mitten am Tag will ich auf das Bier verzichten , aber mal erzählen .
Ich beginne mit der historischen Frage :
Was wurde eigentlich aus dem Schadensersatz des Mautkonsortiums an die Bundesrepublik Deutschland ?
Wer erinnert sich nicht an das Maut – Desaster aus der Anfangszeit dieser stählernen Autobahnbrücken mit den daran hängenden merkwürdig anmutenden Geräten ?
Große technische Probleme warfen das Projekt zeitlich immer wieder zurück .
Von Milliardenschäden und Schadensersatzzahlungen durch das Maut - Konsortium war die Rede .
Nach 16 monatiger Verzögerung startete die Mauterhebung dann vielumjubelt doch noch Anfang 2005 .
Also geriet das Thema Schadenseratz auch bei unserer investigativen Presse in Vergessenheit .
Ich selbst bin zugegebenermaßen auch nur wieder auf das Thema gekommen , weil das Bundesverkehrsministerium im Bundestag zur Zeit nach meiner Pivatanschrift forscht .
Die tüchtigen Beamten dieses Ministeriums werden sie sicher irgendwann im Telefonbuch finden ( oder mit Lektüre dieses Textes : Hauptstr. 34 , 76703 Kraichtal – Gochsheim ) .
Man will , so hörte ich , mir nämlich jetzt einen “ Gebührenbescheid ” dafür zukommen zu lassen , dass ich als Volksvertreter so vermessen war , Einsicht in die als geheim eingestuften Verträge mit dem Mautkonsortium Daimler , Telekom und einem französischen Autobahnbetreiber namens Cofiroute zu verlangen .
Das Anliegen des Ministeriums ,
Geld einzutreiben , ist nur zu verständlich .
Irgendwann um das Jahr 2007 herum wollte die Bundesregierung vom Mautkonsortium sogar schlappe 5 Milliarden , die sie bis heute nicht hat .
Vielleicht findet das Ministerium die geheime Anschrift seiner noch geheimeren Vertragspartner auch nicht mehr ?
Aber der Reihe nach .
Warum wollte ich überhaupt Einsicht in den Mautvertrag ?
Erstens hatte mich das Thema als Bürger interessiert - Beträge in Milliardenhöhe sind schließlich auch in Zeiten von Abwrackprämien und der Unterfinanzierung der Bildung kein Pappenstil .
Zudem fragte mich selbst der Dorfstammtisch , “ was da denn eigentlich los sei ” .
Weiterhin wollte ich es als neugieriger Forschungspolitiker wissen .
Schliesslich war immer von verlockenden Mehrwerten des Systems bis hin zu intelligenten Flottensteuerungen in der Verkehrspolitik die Rede gewesen .
Nach all den Jahren ist von solchen Diensten aber schon lange nicht mehr die Rede , was wohl auch dazu führte , dass sich keine anderen Länder , nicht einmal Polizeistaaten , so wirklich für die tolle deutsche Mauttechnik interessierten .
Zumindest kein ausländischer Staat .
Die eigenen deutschen Sicherheitsbehörden seien der Korrektheit halber erwähnt .
Sie waren die einzigen , die sich für “ Zusatzanwendungen ” in ihrem Sinne aussprachen .
Aber das ist schon wieder eine eigene Geschichte .
Ich zog also um das Jahr 2007 herum mit den erstgenannten Punkten nach erfolglosen Bemühungen gegenüber dem Ministerium vor das Berliner Verwaltungsgericht , um die gewünschten Informationen zu bekommen , die mir , nach naiver eigener Meinung , als Volksvertreter eigentlich zustünden .
Dr. Peter Struck liess mich via Fraktionsgeschäftsführung noch wissen , man könne doch keinen “ eigenen Minister ” verklagen .
Dieser Hinweis belastete mich dann auch nicht weiter , zumal ich bei keinem Mitglied der Bundesregierung für mich Eigentumsrechte erkennen konnte .
Das Verwaltungsgericht Berlin befindet sich sozusagen im Schatten des Bundesinnenministeriums .
Dies hätte mir eigentlich schon Warnung genug sein müssen .
Ziemlich unverblümt lies mich Frau Verwaltungsrichterin im Verfahren sehr schnell wissen , dass sie gar keine Lust hätte , die vermutlich 10.000 Vertragsseiten darauf zu überprüfen , was ich von diesen nun sehen dürfe oder nicht , was nun tatsächlich geheim sei und was nicht .
Jedem , der auch schon einmal keinen Bock auf Arbeit hatte , leuchtet eine solche Argumentation sofort ein .
Frau Richterin suchte aber immerhin nach einem Ausweg :
Das beteiligte Bau- und Verkehrsministerium , so ihre pfiffige Idee , solle doch alles schwärzen , was nicht für einen normalen Bundestagsabgeordneten bestimmt sei .
Dieser Einfall wurde leider postwendend von der Gegenseite abgelehnt .
Treuherzig wiesen die Vertreter des Ministeriums darauf hin , dass man , wörtliches Zitat aus dem Gerichtssaal , “ dazu mangels Sachverstand nicht in der Lage sei . ”
Dieses zwingende Argument eines deutschen Ministerialbeamten leuchtet zumindest einer Berliner Beamtin am Verwaltungsgericht sofort ein , sodass auch diese Überlegung alsbald fallen gelassen wurde .
Erwartungsgemäß verlor ich kostenträchtig meinen Prozess .
Begründet wurde dies mit dem I nhalt der sagenumwitterten Akte und dem Schutz der Geschäftsgeheimnisse , die man wie ausgeführt nun einmal nicht schwärzen könne .
Vor allem wurde ich darauf hingewiesen , dass ja ein laufendes Schiedsverfahren stattfinde , bei dem es unter Leitung eines damaligen Präsidenten des Bundesgerichtshofs schließlich um den genannten hohen Schadensersatz ginge . .
Eine Aktenveröffentlichung bei diesem laufenden Verfahren , so die gemeinsame Überzeugung der eigentlichen Gegner Verkehrsministerium und Toll - Collect , “ gefährde durch mögliche öffentliche Debatten die Entscheidungsfreiheit des Rechtspflegeorgans . ”
Außerdem seien sich die Beteiligten ( ich war damit nicht gemeint ) einig , “ dass durch eine Veröffentlichung des Vertrages Toll – Collect im Wettbewerb Schaden entstehen könne . ”
Welcher Wettbewerb , ist man da versucht zu fragen ?!?
Soviel freundliche Übereinstimmung zwischen Ministerium und Toll - Collect herrschte vor meiner Klage übrigens nicht immer .
Ganz am Anfang waren Minister und die armen Beamten ohne Sachverstand sogar richtig sauer auf die Herren der Industrie .
Denn Toll - Collect habe den Bund “ getäuscht ” , so damals Verkehrsminister Stolpe , “ indem man Zusagen zu den Terminen der Inbetriebnahme ohne hinreichende Grundlage ins Blaue hinein , also arglistig , abgegeben habe ” .
Bei so viel Verhärtung bedurfte es dann doch einiger vertrauensbildender Massnahmen .
Am 12 . 6 . 2008 (! ) meldete die Welt , das Schiedsverfahren beginne “ in der nächsten Woche an einem geheimen Ort. ”
Anfragen seien aber zwecklos , weil Vertraulichkeit vereinbart worden sei .
Diese wiederum sei damit zu rechtfertigen , “ dass die Verträge eben geheim seien ” .
Wie es ausging , weiss ich deshalb nicht .
Denn es gab seit Juni 2008 keine weitere Sitzung mehr .
Oder sie tagen unter Leitung von Herrn Hirsch vielleicht am geheimen
Ort immer noch und wurden , fast wie im Märchen , nur von der Welt vergessen … .
Und wenn sie nicht gestorben sind , so tagen sie noch heute …..
Wer mehr wissen will , kann sich unter Berufung auf das Informationsfreiheitsgesetz ( IFG ) vertrauensvoll jederzeit an das Bundesministerium für Verkehr , Bau - und Wohnungswesen , Invalidenstr .
44 ( Nomen est omen ; ) ) in 10115 Berlin oder via Abgeordnetenwatch an seinen Bundestagsabgeordneten wenden .
Vorsicht : Könnte aber einen Gebührenbescheid zur Folge haben …. 😉
School 's right around the corner , goddammit , which means another year of lies , overpriced textbooks and underpaid teachers .
While you 're sitting in class reading Cracked and pretending to be taking notes on your laptop , why not take a look at what school would be like if books , teachers and administrators were honest ?

Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion .
Even if you are not familiar with its name , I ’m sure you ’ve fallen prey to Parkinson ’s Law countless times … what can we do to escape it ?
Do You Recognize These Symptoms ?
We all know the drill : when we have too much time to complete a task , we tend to slack off until the task becomes urgent .
Then , when meeting the deadline gets nigh impossible , we become super - productive and miraculously pull it off — getting the job done just in time .
The quintessential example of Parkinson ’s Law in action is school assignments : even with a full month to complete an assignment , most people work very unproductively ( if at all ) until the last few days — when they pull one or two all - nighters and manage to get it done right at the last minute .
If you are like one of those students , you know that ‘ working ’ on the assignment filled up the whole time available — even if only psychologically — despite the fact that you spent little time in actual , productive work .
Had you invested this short amount of time right after the assignment was handed to you , you would have completed it much sooner and could have spent the remaining time much more joyfully ( either truly resting or working more productively on other stuff ) .
Does that mean we ’re doomed to work at our peak only when we ’re faced with looming deadlines ?
How can we get rid of this unproductive behavior and beat Parkinson ’s Law ?
It turns out there are a few things you can do .
Read on .
6 Surefire Ways to Beat Parkinson ’s Law
1. Break Down Your Tasks and Deadlines
Parkinson ’s
Law always strikes the hardest when you have enormous tasks with far - away deadlines .
The best way to fix this is , of course , breaking those big , monolithic tasks into many smaller , bite - sized tasks , along with several intermediate deadlines to complete them .
In addition to showing how you are progressing , frequent , achievable deadlines create a mild sense of urgency during the whole duration of your work , keeping you naturally engaged and focused on what needs to be done .
This method works great indeed , but note that you still need to take those intermediate deadlines seriously — which is not always easy !
2. Know What ‘ Done ’ Means
It ’s not always easy to know for sure when a task is finished .
The more of a perfectionist you are , the most likely you ’re a victim of Parkinson ’s Law : there ’s always one more little thing to add , one little refinement to be made , is n’t there ?
Sure , I am all for aiming for greater quality : the hard part is knowing where to draw the line so we do n’t spend a lot of time overdoing it .
If you suffer from this same problem , one thing that helps a lot is to precisely define the output of your tasks .
The trick is to be as specific as you can about them — and then simply stop when you complete them .
For example , ‘ write white paper draft ’ allows too much room for interpretation by your inner perfectionist .
‘ Write a 1000 - word unedited stream - of - consciousness - style text ’ works much better , does n’t it ?
Being specific upfront helps keep our perfectionism in check .
3. Set Clear Boundaries
Most of the time , Parkinson ’s Law kicks in when we ’re doing too much stuff at the same time : our days become a jumble of tasks when hardly any ever gets completely finished .
And , with the huge amount of distractions that tend to creep in , it only gets worse .
To avoid Parkinson ’s Law ’s effects and finish tasks sooner , we must work on them one at a time , focused and with as few distractions as possible .
The best way I know to do that is by corralling your tasks using time boxes .
Get a countdown timer and set a time limit to work on them — a contiguous block without distractions to finish or at least make progress on those tasks .
Another great way of setting boundaries is by clearly separating between work and leisure .
If you restrict the time available for work ( and honor it , of course ) , you ’ll learn to fit all your work into these boundaries .
My favorite technique to keep work boundaries well - defined is the time budget ( where you define how much time you spend on each area of your life ) .
4. Challenge Yourself
When you have a tight time limit or deadline , it forces your brain to figure out ways to get it done in the time available .
So , it ’s time to stop adding hidden “ safety buffers ” when you estimate and allocate time for your tasks : if you pad your estimates , they will be wasted as a result of Parkinson ’s Law kicking in .
What works here instead is to set challenging deadlines for yourself .
Not too challenging — mildly challenging , I ’d say .
The trick here is that they must still be believable — otherwise you ’ll just disregard them .
Take those time boxes you set for yourself ( in item # 3 above ) and now shrink them !
Can you do the same task 10 % faster ?
Maybe 20 % ?
A litttle more , perhaps ?
As soon as you set an expectation — an estimate for the duration of a task — the estimate becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy .
The task will take the expected time , so take advantage of that !
The good thing about regularly challenging yourself that way is that you ’ll improve your estimation skills very quickly , in addition to having fun finding creative ways to win these self - imposed challenges .
If you practice ( and your tasks are well - defined and small enough ) , it becomes increasingly easier to effectively set challenges for yourself .
5. Create Incentives to Finish Early
One reason Parkinson ’s Law is so prevalent — especially in corporations — is that people rarely have the right incentives to finish early :
— “ Finished already ?
Here ’s more work for you . ”
— “ You ’re fast !
Guess we can bring the deadline forward next time ! ”
Even without pointy - haired bosses around , sticking to the current task as long as possible is often desirable , as it can act as a security blanket : maybe you ’re avoiding your next task because it is too daunting , for example .
So if you finish early , give yourself mini-rewards : take a quick break , browse the web , go for a walk — do whatever takes your fancy — and enjoy the feeling of having deserved it .
The key here is to associate rewards with results , not with time spent — so do n’t fool yourself .
Of course , incentives for finishing early only work if the task is well - defined ( i.e. , you know exactly what ‘ done ’ means ) , otherwise most of us will just cheat ( by doing a sloppy or incomplete job ) in order to get the reward sooner .
6. Know What ’s Next
Lastly , something that happens too often is hanging on too long to a task solely because we do n’t know exactly what to do next .
Most of the time , the cognitive effort in planning tasks is much higher than that required to actually carry them out .
That means that if we do n’t have anything ready to be acted on , we may not have the required energy to stop , plan on - the - fly , and then get back to work .
The easy way out is to stick to the current task for as long as we safely can .
One thing that I always strive to do is separate planning from doing , and make sure to always have a few next actions in the pipeline so you can keep the momentum going and avoid having to stop to reassess what you should be doing .

BEIJING : China expressed strong dissatisfaction on Tuesday over Prime Minister Manmohan Singh���s weekend visit to Arunachal Pradesh .
( Watch Video )
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 's trip to Arunachal Pradesh to woo voters ahead of Monday���s assembly elections came despite Beijing 's serious concerns , China���s foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said in a statement posted on the ministry 's website .
Reacting to China���s statement , foreign minister S M Krishna said , " Well , regardless of what others say it is the Government of India 's stated position that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India .
We rest at that .���
The ministry also said in a statement that New Delhi was " disappointed and concerned " over Chinese objection to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 's visit to Arunachal Pradesh .
�� �Arunachal Pradesh is inalienable part of India , and China is aware of this , said external affairs ministry spokesman Vishnu Prakash .
" The Chinese statement does not help the process of ongoing negotiations between the two governments on the boundary question , " he said .
Earlier , the statement from China said , " It is strongly dissatisfied with the visit to the disputed region by the Indian leader disregarding China 's serious concerns . "
`` We demand the Indian side address China 's serious and just concerns and not trigger disturbances in the disputed region so as to facilitate the healthy development of China - India relations , '' the statement said .
Manmohan Singh had toured and addressed an election rally in Arunachal Pradesh on October 3 .
The protest reflects enduring Chinese sensitivities over the mountainous state , which shares a 640 - mile ( 1,030 - kilometer ) unfenced border with China .
The Asian giants fought a border war in 1962 and the frontier has yet to be settled despite 13 rounds of talks on the issue .
China claims the region as its own territory and has never recognized a British colonial - era border known as the McMahon Line that designated the region as part of India .
China also occupies a chunk of territory in Kashmir that India regards as its own .
Most recently , China sought to block part of a loan to India from the Asian Development Bank earmarked for projects in Arunachal Pradesh .
Beijing also protested a visit to the region last month by exiled Tibetan leader the Dalai Lama , to no avail .
China 's protests and continuing claims have fueled Indian fears of military aggression , prompting calls for New Delhi to reinforce military units on its side of the border .
India says China is illegally occupying 43,180 sq kms of Jammu and Kashmir .
On the other hand , China accuses India of possessing some 90,000 sq km of Chinese territory , mostly in Arunachal Pradesh .
China earlier this year had also taken objection to Manmohan Singh 's visit to Arunachal Pradesh , and had informally protested .
Singh visited Arunachal on January 31 and February 1 this year , a few days after returning from a trip to China .
Singh 's reference to the state as " our land of the rising sun " at a public rally was objected to by China .
China apparently saw it as India 's assertion of its claim on Arunachal , which it claims is a " disputed territory " .
Responding to China 's objection , the then external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said , " Arunachal is an integral part of our country ...
Therefore , it is obvious the Prime Minister will visit any part of the country " .
ROME , Oct. 9 ( UPI ) --
Global rice stockpiles have plummeted because of poor crop yields , raising fears of upheaval in international grain markets ahead of the World Food Summit in the Italian capital next month .
Sharp increases in rice prices since last year have hit consumers across the world , especially in Asia and the Americas , the Food and Agriculture Organization said .
Whole communities depend on the grain as their staple food or as an important ingredient , as in Asian American communities .

Amid warnings of another surge in rice prices , after the runaway inflation triggered by shortages or export cuts in 2008 , FAO experts are citing sharp reductions in the stockpiles of the grain held by the five leading exporters -- the United States , Vietnam , Thailand , Pakistan and India .
Concepcion Calpe , a senior FAO economist , said stocks held by the five major exporters are forecast to plunge by a third to the lowest level in five years , and below last year , when prices rose amid declining inventories .
Total stockpiles held by the United States , Vietnam , Thailand , Pakistan and India are estimated to have fallen to about 20 million metric tons at the end of the marketing year on Sept. 30 , from 30 million tons a year earlier .
Calpe attributed the drop to lower - than - forecast crops and rising demand for imports , amid fears of impending shortages .
In India , hit by the weakest monsoon in at least seven years , rice production could drop by about 18 percent , Calpe said .
Further damage to Indian rice yields may occur as southern India grapples with effects of floods .
The last time stockpiles of the five major exporters fell by a third was in 2002 - 2003 , partly because of a bad monsoon in India .
Although rice farmers responded to higher prices -- up to $ 25.07 for 100 pounds at their peak -- and boosted production , those increases were not enough to replenish the stockpiles .
In the United States , the rice price outlook was further complicated because at last a third of rice consumed in the country is imported even as American rice exports reach developed and developing countries across the world .
Calpe said rice reserves in China , the world 's largest grower and consumer , could help slow the decline in total global stockpiles .
However , she warned , the impact of El Nino could affect the outlook because the adverse weather phenomenon can delay rains in Asia but unleash floods in South America .
The worsening rice outlook comes amid FAO projections that very large investments are needed to feed the world 's population , which is likely to exceed 9 billion by 2050 .
The FAO says the population growth and changing diets mean that global food production will need to increase 70 percent by 2050 .
FAO said , " In the first half of this century , as the world 's population grows to around 9 billion , global demand for food , feed and fibre will nearly double while , increasingly , crops may also be used for bioenergy and other industrial purposes . "
New and traditional demand for agricultural produce will put growing pressure on already scarce agricultural resources , the organization warned .
As urbanization grows , new technologies will be needed to make up for shortfalls in land and farming skills , FAO said , indicating the required funding could run into tens of billions of dollars .

BEIRUT —
The 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall passed very quietly in the Arab world , because the meaning of the wall ’s fall — the transition from total state control to human freedom — also bypassed the Arab world .
Not the Islamic world , or the Middle East , but the Arab world .
For many reasons , the Arab world collectively is the sole exception to the global wave of liberalization and democratization that touched every other region of the planet .
It is difficult to predict how and when our region will change , liberalize and democratize .
The spark that sets off a chain reaction for freedom could happen in one country , and then spread to others , like the Solidarity movement in Poland .
The instruments of state control vary throughout the Arab world , and the intensity of autocracy also differs by country , but the net result — with very few exceptions — is the same : Most Arabs feel strong and confident about their culture , religion and identity , but powerless and vulnerable as citizens of their state .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British man on the run from police sent a picture of himself to his local paper because he disliked the mugshot they had printed of him as part of a public appeal to track him down .
South Wales Police had issued media with the photo of Matthew Maynard , wanted by officers investigating a house burglary , as part of a crackdown on crime in Swansea .
When it appeared in the South Wales Evening Post , the 23 - year - old sent the newspaper a replacement photo of himself standing in front of a police van .
They obligingly printed it on the front page .
The police thanked him for helping them in their appeal , saying : “ Everyone in Swansea will know what he looks like now . ”
WASHINGTON
I felt a twinge of envy when I heard that my pal Tom Friedman had played golf with the president for five hours one September Sunday .
Tom learned a lot about Barack Obama ’s positions on weighty issues and sporty ones .
( This president does n’t cheat and he does expect bets to be paid off . )
My natural impulse was to shrug it off .
Men have always craved private realms  the golf club , men ’s club , garage , workshop , shed ; a place to get away from the chatter and clatter of women and kids .
( In Obama ’s case , he may desire a testosterone break from his estrogen nest  a wife , two daughters and a mother - in - law . )
Gordon Thorburn , the British author of the book “ Men and Sheds , ” explained that the word shed derived from the Anglo - Saxon “ scead , ” or shade .
It was , in a metaphorical sense , obscure , an “ intellectual pantry ” or “ spiritual home ” where a man could reflect and dawdle with tools and toys .
But I do n’t kid myself that the presidential playing fields are merely about play .
After Tom ’s golf outing , Politico ran the headline : “ Friedman jumps to the front of the influence list . ”
We previously gave you the recipe for the ground cherry hot sauce .
Now for the ribs to go with it .
There are a variety of ways to cook ribs .
This time I tried using the 2 - 1 - 1 smoking method — cooking them in 225° smoker for 2 hours uncovered , one hour wrapped in foil , and a final hour uncovered again .
This process starts out like most baby back rib recipes .
Remove the membrane from the bottom ( less meaty side ) , rinse the raw racks of ribs off in the sink and dry them off .
For easier handling , I cut each rack of ribs in half .
Apply a dry-rub and marinate 12 - 24 hours in the refrigerator .
I was lazy and used a pre-mixed rub , but there are hundreds of recipes for rib rubs available online .
After the ribs are done marinating , remove the ribs from the refrigerator and let them sit for 20 minutes or so to let them warm up a little .
When your smoker is up to 225° and is billowing smoke , it ’s time to add the ribs .
For these ribs , I decided to use hickory smoke .
After the ribs have been in the smoker for 2 hours , wrap each rack individually with aluminum foil and return them to the smoker for an hour .
For the final hour of smoking , remove the foil .
2-1-1
When the timer finally goes off , remove the ribs from the smoker , cover them with foil and let them rest for 20 - 30 minutes .
Finally , as a whole rack or cut it in to individual ribs , serve the ribs with your favorite BBQ , teryaki or hot sauce .
We used our ground cherry hot sauce and it was delicious .
Your pets will want some too .

Is Vince McMahon really accusing the MMA of going to " extremes " ?
Yes , and boy is it rich :
During the peak of what the company refers to as its " attitude era " a decade ago , the WWE 's audience was dominated by young men .
While its popularity has waned , the fan base has simultaneously grown older and younger with new constituencies , according to audience research .
A little more than a third of its audience is female .
The audience is ethnically more diverse that most shows : 62 percent of audience is white ; 20 percent of the viewership is black and 23 percent is Hispanic — Hispanics were counted as both white and Hispanic .
It 's the most - watched English - language show on cable among Hispanics , the company said .
With the Ultimate Fighting Championship and mixed martial arts becoming more popular as competitors , it made little sense for the WWE to ramp up the attitude with violence and sexuality , McMahon said .
" You really can't compete with that , " he said .
" Why not deliver a more sophisticated product and not go to those extremes ?
If the audience wants those extremes , they know where to go and how to get it . "
Going PG has helped the company draw advertisers who might have looked away before .
Pepsi , 7 - Eleven stores , Mattel toys and the Army National Guard are among the sponsors that have signed up since the shift , the company said .
I 'll let the picture do the talking for me .
He can change the image , but he can't run from the track record .
Silly rumors .
From the Washington Post 's Ezra Klein :
On Thursday night , Reid went over to the White House for a talk with the president .
The conversation centered on Reid 's desire to put Schumer 's national opt - out plan into the base bill .
White House officials were not necessarily pleased , and they made that known .
Everyone agrees that they did n't embrace Reid 's new strategy .
Everyone agrees that the White House wants Snowe on the bill ...
More from TPM's Brian Beutler :
Multiple sources tell TPMDC that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is very close to rounding up 60 members in support of a public option with an opt out clause , and are continuing to push skeptical members .
But they also say that the White House is pushing back against the idea , in a bid to retain the support of Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) .
More from The Hill :
“ I ’ve not been very happy with the White House ’s lukewarm support of the public option , ” [ Sen. Tom Harkin ] said .
More from The New Republic :
After a weekend of furious activity on Capitol Hill , Democratic leaders in the Senate think they are close to getting the votes they need in order to pass an " opt- out " version of the public option .
But they feel like President Obama could be doing more to help them , with one senior staffer telling TNR on Sunday that the leadership would like , but has yet to receive , a clear " signal " of support for their effort .
And here 's President Obama saying the Finance Committee bill Snowe voted for would be tolerable -- from his speech to OFA last week on Wed , Oct. 21 :
Among Democrats and progressives , there are a whole set of views about how we should do health care .
But understand that the bill that you least like in Congress right now .
The one you least like , of the five that are out there , would provide 29 million Americans health care .
29 million Americans who do n’t have it right now would get it .
The bill you least like would prevent insurance companies from barring you from getting health insurance because of pre-existing conditions .
Whatever the bill you least like would set up an exchange so that people right now who are having to try to bargain for health insurance on their own are suddenly part of a pool of millions that forces insurance companies to compete for their business and give them better deals and lower rates .
So there are going to be some disagreements and details to work out .
But to the Democrats – I want to say to you Democrats – let ’s make sure we keep our eye on the prize .
... Sometimes Democrats can be their own worst enemies .
Democrats are an opinionated bunch .
( laughter )
Yay bill we least like !
Yay insurance for 29 million people -- by mandating they buy insurance from rip - off artists with no choice of a public option !
Here 's what the White House needs to understand :
Expressing a preference for the public option is not the same as fighting for the public option .
Telling Harry Reid " good luck with that " is not the same as the president saying , " I am there helping Reid fight for those final votes . "
Americans clearly favor a strong bill over a bipartisan bill and are clamoring for President Obama to make good on the mandate for sweeping change that was given to him in the 2008 election .
President Obama will be judged by many of his biggest 2008 supporters on whether he fights for a strong public option at this critical moment .
If you have n't yet signed the Progressive Change Campaign Committee 's emergency petition to President Obama -- telling him to fight -- you can do it here

Remember when it took you over an hour to bust out of the sewers in Oblivion ?
Sure , you were eager to play the game , but that nose was just too wide and those cheekbones a bit too gaunt to save the world with .
BioWare is hoping to kill this problem in the PC version Dragon Age : Origins with the release of the Origins “ Character Creator , ” the exact tool players will be using at the beginning of the game to build their unique characters .
And the best part is that it ’s coming out October 13th -- weeks in advance of the games release .
It ’s an anal RPG face creator ’s dream come true .
The Character Creator will allow every type of character throughout the game ’s six chapters to be created in advance .
Also , because it ’s ripped from the game , the save files will transfer to the PC version seamlessly .
No more wading in a pool and fixing eye color before playing the game .
No word if this tool could make its way to consoles .
As Eurogamer notes , the wording is “ currently only available to PC players . ”
Looks like PC gaming has won once again .
Somehow .
Dragon Age : Origins hits November 3rd .

Just something I was thinking about , many of the wars mentioned in the bible were almost forced by outside situations by the neighboring nations .
Okay , lets say that once Joshua crossed the Jordan river ( or before ) , he decides not to conquer the Canaanites ( sorry if I mispronounced it ) .
Their choices are : go back to Egypt ( and experience torture and slavery ) , live alongside them ( and either get conquered or have their culture even more lost than it was after they conquered and started worshipping the idols ) , or go someplace else ( not a real option since the surrounding area is desert ) .
The only option was to kill inocents as you say .
the same can be seen throughout the rest of the Bible .
About God being arrogant , I really cannot completely deny that , after all he created every single thing there is and thus he deserves some glory .
However , he does help out many people , especially those who believe in them .
And even if their situation does not improve , I have seen sick or poor chistians happier than most other people .
They never seem troubled and they are quite at peace .
They see most things in a positive sight , even going as far as calling the death of a loved one " the party in heaven because the deceased is going back home " .
I will not deny there are muslims , hindus , theists , atheists and even satanists that are also happy and often at peace , but I have seen more good people coming from chistianity than any other belief or disbelief ( the only reason why christians are seen as annoying is because of that vocal and extremist group that does not seem to know the difference between being good and insanity .
The Bible has bad human characteristhics ?
Yes it does , but anything has bad characteristhics .
Vedas have them , the eightfold path has them , the Quran has them , the bible has them , you have them , I have them , everything has them .
And I will be the first to admit that God is jealous and has a lot of wrath , but this is mostly justified as he and Sin cannot be together , and thus sin leads to these two characteristhics of god .
It is just like a father punishing his son or a jealous lover ( when that lover has a reason ) .
As for the hell part , God hates hell , but it is necessary .
If he and sin cannot coexist , he can not let people who did not repent get a free pass to heaven .
It would be unfair who those who truly follow him .
And as for those who never hear about him , or the little children , including the aborted ones , go to heaven .
And yes , priests do not have the right to have as much authority as they sometimes claim to have .
So I disagree , but I do see where you are coming from .
I am christian , and I stand firm on my decision as he has done many things for me , from big ones such as the death on the cross , to small ones like helping me on my studies or when I win a League of Legends match ( yes , I thank him for that XD ) but I can see why you hate christianity .
How Twilight Works
A few weeks ago I had the miserable experience of reading Twilight .
A friend bought it for me and I took it with me to read on a long flight from Seattle to Houston .
I knew it was going to be crappy , but I thought it would be a guilty pleasure kind of crappy - where you know it 's bad but you still get enjoyment out of it .
I actually managed to power through around 400 pages until I gave up and started reading Sky Mall .
I 've been seeing Twilight everywhere lately , especially with Vampire Teens II New Moon 's release , so I thought I 'd break down why everyone is going apeshit for it .
First off , the author creates a main character which is an empty shell .
Her appearance is n't described in detail ; that way , any female can slip into it and easily fantasize about being this person .
I read 400 pages of that book and barely had any idea of what the main character looked like ; as far as I was concerned she was a giant Lego brick .
Appearance aside , her personality is portrayed as insecure , fumbling , and awkward - a combination anyone who ever went through puberty can relate to .
By creating this " empty shell , " the character becomes less of a person and more of something a female reader can put on and wear .
Because I forgot her name ( I think it was Barbara or Brando or something like that ) , I 'm going to refer to her as " Pants " from here on out .
So after a few chapters of listening to Pants whine about high school , sucking at volleyball , and being the center of attention , the second major character is introduced .
Imagine everything a lady might want in a man , then exaggerate it by ten thousand - and you 've got Edward Cullen .
The level of detail that the author goes into while describing Edward 's appearance is remarkable .
At one point while reading I started counting the number of times the author used the expression " Edward 's perfect face , " and it was far into the double digits .
The author excruciatingly details his muscular pecs , clothing , hair , eye color - even his goddamn breath ( I 'm not joking ) .
Edward intensely listens to everything Pants has to say , even if she 's bitching about she had diarrhea on Christmas or her preferred method for cutting a sandwich in half .
As far as the reader is concerned , Edward cares about nothing in the world more than Pants .
What the author has done is created a perfect male figure - a pale Greek statue which the reader can worship and in turn be worshipped by .
So what about men that like Twilight ?
If you 're male and you like Twilight , you 're gay .
I do n't mean that in the derogatory sense , I mean it in the " you want to put your testicles against another man 's testicles while gripping handfuls of chesthair " kind of way .
And the movie ?
The movie is just the same uninspired crap shat out onto a film reel .
If you like the taste of horse manure on your bologna sandwiches , you 're probably gonna like it on your birthday cake as well .
The same principle applies with Twilight .
Beyond that , it 's just a romance novel with the occasional vampire teen drama bullshit peppered here and there .
It does n't really break any new ground in the realm of vampire fiction , other than portraying vampires as a family of uncomfortable imbeciles who prance around the woods eating deer and bunny rabbits .
There 's lots of nervous lip- biting , tender kisses between Pants and Edward , and lengthy descriptions of every feature of Edward 's body .
Pants is a static character who never really progresses beyond being an insecure vampire fangirl who obsesses over Edward .
Whether her character grows beyond that is unknown to me , I 'd stopped reading by then and shifted my attention to an electric butt - massaging chair in Sky Mall .
For Abdullah Khadr , attending a training camp in Afghanistan where he learned to use a rocket launcher and detonate explosive material at the age of 13 was simply part of the " Muslim culture " there .
That 's what Khadr , now 28 , told an Ontario court Monday when he took the stand for the first time to testify in his effort to fight extradition to the U.S. on terrorism charges .
The member of the Khadr clan , Canada 's so - called Al Qaeda family , recounted in detail what he did during three months at Khalden camp , which he said was not combat training .
" So a 13 - year - old putting together an explosive is what kids are taught at summer camp , like kids here learn volleyball ? " asked Crown prosecutor Howard Piafsky .
Khadr , whose late father Ahmed Said Khadr was a reputed Canadian Al Qaeda financier and a friend of Osama bin Laden , said learning to use a grenade launcher was no big deal since " it 's something everyone has , " adding , " 99 per cent of the people are walking around with Kalashnikovs .
" Afghanistan is not Canada , it 's a country that 's been going through war , " said the Canadian - born Khadr , who grew up moving between Canada , Pakistan and Afghanistan .
" When you go fishing , you fish with a bomb , you do n't fish with a fishing rod . "
The camp was not Al Qaeda - operated , said Khadr , who played down any link between the terrorist group and his family , which includes younger brother Omar , who is being held at Guantanamo Bay on a charge of killing a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan .
Khadr , who admitted having a close relationship with his father before he was killed in 2003 , denied knowledge of his father 's ideologies , saying he had been engaged in charitable works in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
He also told Superior Court Justice Christopher Speyer he had no knowledge about allegations his father diverted funds to Al Qaeda .
" My father 's dream was to unite the Muslims , to make them stop fighting each other , " said Khadr , adding that while his father knew Al Qaeda 's top three leaders , their relationships dated back to when they ran charities during the Afghan war against the Soviets .
Piafsky accused Khadr of " brazen misstatements " and suggested he could not be believed .
He said Khadr 's younger brother Abdurahman told a reporter his father had asked him on three occasions to become a suicide bomber .
" Abdurahman said lots of things , " Khadr said about his brother , who claims to have worked for the CIA and to have given it information on Al Qaeda operatives in Kabul .
" He is part of the reason I 'm in jail .
Ninety nine per cent of what he said were lies . "
The U.S. has requested Khadr 's extradition to face charges of procuring weapons for Al Qaeda and plotting to kill American troops in Afghanistan .
If convicted , he faces a life sentence and a fine of $ 1 million ( U.S. ) .
Defence lawyer Dennis Edney has argued information his client gave authorities in Pakistan or Canada is tainted by alleged torture .
According to an affidavit signed by Khadr , he was arrested by Islamabad police in October 2004 and beaten with a hard rubber paddle or stick .
Khadr alleges Pakistani officials tortured him during the 14 months he was held without charge – a period when Canadian and U.S. officials also interviewed him about his family and Al Qaeda .
Khadr told the court Monday he told interrogators what they wanted to hear , while trying to minimize his involvement , because he wanted the abuse to stop and wanted to leave the Pakistani jail .
When he returned to Canada in December 2005 and met with RCMP officials in Toronto , he again confessed .
During cross-examination , Khadr said he told authorities in Toronto what he thought they wanted to hear because he feared being sent back to Pakistan .
In a videotape of the interview , which was played in court , RCMP Sgt.
Konrad Shourie tells
Khadr he is under investigation for terrorism - related offences , but is not under arrest and is free to leave at any time .
Still , Khadr testified he really had no choice to leave and feared telling the truth .
" When I first came off the airplane , do you know what was waiting for me ?
A SWAT team , " he said .
" I 've never harmed anybody in my life .
Why would I help people buy weapons ? "

" To make money , " replied Piafsky .
Days after being questioned by Shourie , Khadr was arrested in Toronto at the request of U.S. authorities .
He was indicted by a Boston court in February 2006 .
The extradition hearing is expected to last about three weeks .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PHOENIX – In a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union , an Arizona court found today that Maricopa County Sheriff Joseph Arpaio can no longer require inmates seeking abortion care to prepay their transportation and security costs before they can obtain an abortion .
Earlier this year , as part of a partial settlement in an ACLU lawsuit involving the right of women prisoners to obtain timely , safe and legal abortions , Arpaio agreed to follow a 2005 court order prohibiting Maricopa County correctional facilities from requiring inmates to obtain a court order before an abortion .
However , in the course of settlement negotiations , Arpaio decided inmates must prepay transportation and security costs associated with obtaining the procedure .
In his ruling today , Judge Robert H. Oberbilling of the Superior Court of Arizona indicated that requiring inmates to prepay security and transportation costs could be more onerous than the court order Sheriff Arpaio previously required .
" We are so pleased that Sheriff Arpaio can no longer pull a bait and switch by requiring women prisoners to pay transportation and security costs before obtaining an abortion , " said Brigitte Amiri , a senior staff attorney for the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project who argued the case today before the court .
" Arpaio 's new prepayment requirement was yet another way for him to do an end run around the law and to interfere with a woman 's private decision about whether to end a pregnancy . "
In May 2004 , on behalf of a woman inmate seeking an abortion , the ACLU challenged an unwritten Maricopa County Jail policy that required inmates to obtain a court order before officials would transport for abortion care .
The Maricopa County Superior Court struck down the unwritten policy in August 2005 , holding that it violated women 's reproductive rights and served " no legitimate penological purpose . "
The Arizona Court of Appeals upheld that decision ; both the Arizona and the United States Supreme Courts refused to hear the case .
Sheriff Arpaio defied these rulings and continued to require women to obtain a court order before an abortion .
As a result , in August 2008 , the ACLU asked the court to hold Arpaio in contempt .
In the course of settlement negotiations in that case , Arpaio shifted tactics and began insisting that inmates who seek abortions must pay upfront for transportation and security costs .
Inmates requiring transportation for other medical care are not charged for transport either before or after receiving services .
" Sheriff Arpaio has reached the end of the line here .
The courts have already confirmed that Arizona prison officials can not put up roadblocks to abortion care simply because they do not agree with the decision to end a pregnancy , " said Alessandra Soler Meetze , Executive Director of the ACLU of Arizona .
" It is time for Sheriff Arpaio to stop wasting taxpayer dollars to impose his own morality on women in his jails and to start upholding the law .
Game over . "
The case is Doe v. Arpaio , CV2004 - 009286 .
Lawyers on the case include Amiri and Talcott Camp with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project , and Dan Pochoda of the ACLU of Arizona .

Rich Paul , one of the original organizers of what has become a daily anti-prohibition rally , was singled out and arrested today by Keene Police .
He was later released on $ 1000 PR bond with a November 2nd court date .
Heard on the police scanner afterward : “ I think what we needed to do is done .
I do n’t know if there ’s any reason to go back and stir the pot again . ”
The question : Will they “ stir the pot ” again on Sunday ?
The official explained to Bibi Netanyahu that if there was a peace settlement , extra investment would push Israel 's long - term growth rate from 5 % a year to 7 % .
The Israeli prime minister responded that if the country had 5 % growth , it did not need peace .
Netanyahu was joking , according to the official who recounted the story – but the quip highlights a serious point .
There is no prospect of a settlement between Israelis and Palestinians , and many Israelis are fairly relaxed about that .
During a recent visit to Israel , I met very few people who were optimistic about the peace process .
Netanyahu says he supports the creation of a Palestinian state .
But the terms he is offering – with much of the hypothetical state 's security under Israeli control – would not be acceptable to any Palestinian leader .
Netanyahu 's coalition government shows no signs of offering the Palestinians the kinds of concession – such as freezing settlements – that would make a peace deal possible .
Nor do the Palestinians seem ready for peace : recent attempts to bring both Fatah and Hamas into a national unity government came to nothing .
Whether Mahmoud Abbas , the president of the Palestinian Authority , will carry out his recent threat to resign is unclear .
Within Israel , there is very little pressure for a peace settlement .
Israelis are getting on with their lives , without – for now – the threat of suicide bombers .
There are virtually no rocket attacks from the areas controlled by Hamas and Hezbollah .
The barrier that snakes through the West Bank makes Israelis feel safer – and also less interested in what happens on the other side .
As for the Gaza strip , most Israelis do not want to think or talk about it .
The only people I met who seemed worried about the situation there were foreign journalists , plus a few Israeli liberals – and Tony Blair , who as a peace envoy keeps telling the Israelis that the people of Gaza need to be " given a way forward " .
If pressed , moderate Israelis admit to being uncomfortable that their government ( like Egypt ) will not allow exports out of Gaza or building supplies in ( on the grounds that Hamas would profit from any trade ) .
In Gaza , 40 % of adults are unemployed and most of the rest are in government jobs .
The West Bank is doing better , with only 20 % unemployment and economic growth likely to be 7 % this year – partly because Tony Blair and others have persuaded Israel to lift some of the restrictions on movement .
Israelis hope that when Gazans see the brightening prospects of the West Bank they will turn against Hamas .
In fact Hamas 's popularity has waned to some degree since the last Israel - Hamas war , according to people who spend time in Gaza .
Can international pressure kick - start the peace process ?
Earlier this autumn Barack Obama pushed Netanyahu to accept a freeze on expanding West Bank settlements , but failed .
Liberal Israelis say Obama made the mistake of demanding that the freeze should apply to the suburbs of East Jerusalem , which most Israelis do not regard as settlements .
Netanyahu 's successful resistance to US pressure has made him more popular .
Many Israelis view Obama as both hostile and weak ; his approval rating is below 10 % .
Could the EU , Israel 's top trading partner , and the biggest provider of aid to the Palestinian Authority , put pressure on Israel ?
It was planning to offer an " enhanced agreement " that would establish regular EU - Israel summits , and give Israel the right to take part in a range of EU programmes .
But earlier this year the EU said it would hold up the agreement until Israel did more to alleviate the plight of Gaza .
This conditionality , which annoys Israel 's leaders , might be more effective if the EU increased its offer .
Why not tell the Israelis that if they forge a peace deal with the Palestinians , they could join the European Economic Area , giving Israel – like Norway and Iceland – full access to the EU 's single market ?
But for now , the Europeans ' divisions over how to handle Israel weaken their credibility as a partner for it .
For example earlier this month , when the UN General Assembly debated the Goldstone report – which had accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza – the EU split three ways : the Czech Republic , Germany , Italy and the Netherlands were among those voting with the US to reject the report , Britain and France led a large group of member - states into abstention , and a few others , including Ireland , Portugal and Cyprus , voted for the report .
Many Israeli politicians and businessmen have a dark view of Europe .
At a conference I attended in Jerusalem , one minister – a noted dove within the Israeli government – complained about the influence of Muslim minorities on the foreign policies of EU countries .
I told him that Germany and the Netherlands , two states with large and vocal Muslim minorities , were among Israel 's best friends in Europe .
He countered that the Czech Republic and Poland , which had very few Muslims , did not criticise Israel .
And he claimed there was a direct correlation between the willingness of British MPs to criticise Israel , and the size of the Muslim minority in their constituencies .
Several Israelis at the conference complained that , having sprung from European civilisation , they were now among its last defenders , given that the high birth rate of Muslim immigrants and Islamist ideology were undermining that civilisation from within ( I have heard very similar comments in Serbia and Russia ) .
Reinforcing the Israelis ' gloomy world - view is their fear of Iran 's nuclear programme .
Many of them urge the West to understand that the real problem in the Middle East is not the question of Palestine but the extremist alliance of Iran , Syria , Hizbollah and Hamas that threatens Israel and moderate Arab regimes .
Israelis have long been worried about Iran .
But their fear of Turkey – until very recently a close ally – is new .
The Turkish government 's criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza and its recent cancellation of joint military exercises makes Israelis fret that Turkey is nestling up to the Iran - led coalition .
They worry about the growing power of Islamists in Turkey , the diminishing role of the secular army in Turkish public life , and Prime Minister Erdogan 's burgeoning friendship with Iran 's President Ahmedi -Nejad .
Erdogan 's recent comments to the Guardian about the validity of the Iranian presidential election process were unfortunate .
But I think many Israelis exaggerate Turkey 's eastward tilt .
Erdogan is trying to balance Turkey 's foreign policy between the EU , the US , Russia , Iran and the Arab world , and that may be in Turkey 's best interests .
However , a lot of Israelis seem to believe the worst of Turkey , as they do of many countries .
Many of the Israelis that I met see themselves as increasingly isolated in a hostile world .

Parents who think the new film of Maurice Sendak 's picture book Where the Wild Things
Are is too frightening for children can " go to hell " , the author has said .
Telling the story of a naughty little boy , Max , who is sent to bed without his supper only to journey by boat to a land where wild monsters live , Sendak 's classic tale was first published in 1963 and has captured children 's imaginations ever since .
With a film version adapted by Dave Eggers and Spike Jonze out later this year , Sendak told this week 's edition of Newsweek that he would " not tolerate " parental concerns about the book being too scary .
" I would tell them to go to hell , " Sendak said .
And if children can't handle the story , they should " go home , " he added .
" Or wet your pants .
Do whatever you like .
But it 's not a question that can be answered . "
Sendak also criticised Disney , saying it was " terrible " for children .
As a child himself , he 'd loved Mickey Mouse as " the emblem of happiness and funniness " , and at the cinema he would stand on the chair screaming " My hero !
My hero ! " at the mouse – who at that point still had teeth .
" He was more dangerous , " the author told Newsweek .
" He did things to Minnie that were not nice .
I think what happened was that he became so popular – this is my own theory – they gave his cruelty and his toughness to Donald Duck .
And they made Mickey a fat nothing .
He 's too important for products .
They want him to be placid and nice and adorable .
He turned into a schmaltzer .
I despised him after a point . "
He based the monsters of Where the Wild Things
Are on relatives who visited his family home as a child , speaking practically no English .
" They grabbed you and twisted your face , and they thought that was an affectionate thing to do , " he said .
" And I knew that my mother 's cooking was pretty terrible , and it also took forever , and there was every possibility that they would eat me , or my sister or my brother .
We really had a wicked fantasy that they were capable of that .
We could n't taste any worse than what she was preparing .
So that 's who the Wild Things are .
They 're foreigners , lost in America , without a language .
And children who are petrified of them , and do n't understand that these gestures , these twistings of flesh , are meant to be affectionate . "
Sendak also recalled a fight he had with his publisher about Where the Wild Things Are , with the safety - conscious publisher keen to change the word " hot " to " warm " at the end of the book , when Max returns from his reign as king over the monsters to find his dinner " was still hot " .
" It was going to burn the kid .
I could n't believe it .
But it turned into a real world war , just that word , " Sendak told the magazine .
He won out eventually by " just going at it " , he said .
" Just trying to convey how dopey ' warm ' sounded .
Unemotional .
Undramatic .
Everything about that book is ' hot ' . "
By Robert Samuelson - November 23 , 2009
WASHINGTON --
One of our long - running political stories is the economic assault on the young by the old .
We have become a society that invests in its past and disfavors the future .
This makes no sense for the nation , but as politics , it makes complete sense .
The elderly and near elderly are better organized , focus obsessively on their government benefits , and seem deserving .
Grandmas and Grandpas command sympathy .
Everyone knows that the resulting " entitlements " dominate government spending and squeeze education , research , defense and almost everything else .
In fiscal 2008 -- the last " normal " year before the economic crisis -- Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid ( programs wholly or primarily dedicated to the elderly ) totaled $ 1.3 trillion , 43 percent of federal spending and more than twice military spending .
Because workers , not retirees , are the primary taxpayers , this spending involves huge transfers to the old .
Comes now the House - passed health care " reform " bill that , amazingly , would extract more subsidies from the young .
It mandates that health insurance premiums for older Americans be no more than twice the level of younger Americans .
That 's much less than the actual health spending gap between young and old .
Spending for those aged 60 - 64 is four to five times greater than those 18 - 24 .
So , the young would overpay for insurance which -- under the House bill -- people must buy : 20 - and 30 - somethings would subsidize premiums for 50 - and 60 - somethings .
( Those 65 and over receive Medicare . )
Not surprisingly , the 40 - million member AARP , the major lobby for Americans over 50 , was a big force behind this provision .
AARP 's cynicism is breathtaking .
On the one hand , it sponsors a high - minded campaign called " Divided We Fail " and runs sentimental TV ads featuring children pleading for a better tomorrow .
" Join us in championing your future and the future of every generation , " ended one AARP ad .
Meanwhile , AARP lobbyists scramble to shift their members ' costs onto younger generations .
For example , the House health legislation improves Medicare 's drug benefit .
That would help the half of AARP members who are over 65 .
The other half , those between 50 and 64 , could benefit from the skewed insurance premiums .
Although premium changes would apply mainly to people using insurance " exchanges , " the differences would be substantial .
A single person 55 - 64 might save $ 3,490 , estimates an Urban Institute study .
By contrast , single people in their 20s and early 30s might pay from about $ 600 to $ 1,100 more .
For the young , the extra cost might be larger , says economist Diana Furchtgott - Roth of the Hudson Institute , because the House bill would require them to purchase fairly generous insurance plans rather than cheaper catastrophic coverage that might better suit their needs .
Whatever the added burden , it would darken the young 's already poor economic prospects .
Unemployment among 16 - to 24 - year - olds is 19 percent .
Peter Orszag , director of the Office of Management and Budget , notes on his blog that high joblessness depresses young workers ' wages and that the adverse effect -- though diminishing -- " is still statistically significant 15 years later . "
Lost wages over 20 years could total $ 100,000 .
Orszag does n't mention that health care " reform " might compound the loss .
AARP justifies the cost - shifting as preventing age discrimination .
Premiums based on age should be no more acceptable than premiums based on medical expenses reflecting race , gender or pre-existing health conditions , it says .
The House legislation bans those , so it should also ban age - based rates .
AARP dislikes even the 2 - 1 limit .
It thinks premiums for someone 22 and someone 62 should be identical .
( In insurance jargon , that would be full " community rating . " )
This is unconvincing .
All insurance aims to protect against risk -- but within groups facing similar risks .
Put differently , most insurance is risk - adjusted .
Auto insurance premiums vary by age ; younger drivers pay higher rates because they have more accidents .
Homeowners ' policies for similar houses cost more in high - crime areas .
This is not " discrimination " ; it 's a reflection of risk and cost differences .
Insurers that ignored these differences would soon vanish , because they 'd suffer heavy losses and lose customers .
On health insurance , we may choose to override some risk adjustments ( say , for pre-existing medical conditions ) for public policy reasons .
But the case for making age one of these exceptions is weak .
Working Americans -- the young and middle - aged -- already pay a huge part of the health costs of the elderly through Medicare and Medicaid .
These will grow with an aging population and surging health spending .
Either taxes will rise or other public services will fall .
Already , all governments spend 2.4 times as much per capita on the elderly as on children , reports Julia Isaacs of the Brookings Institution .
Why increase the imbalance ?
It 's true that premiums for older people would be higher .
But this might have a silver lining : Facing their true health costs , older Americans might become more eager to control spending .
There are going to be two types of people when it comes to Borderlands — which is out now on the PS3 and 360 and is coming to PC next week — those that are incredibly excited about the game 's release , and those that just are n't going to understand why the rest of us are so excited .
This is a first - person shooter take on the Diablo genre , and again , that 's either going to arouse your gaming sense until you get hives or leave you completely cold .
If you 're in the second group , go read something else — this game is not for you .
If you 've ever had a water - cooler discussion about the gear you found in a game , however ...
I have something you might be interested in .
Title Borderlands
Developer Gearbox Publisher Take 2 Games Price $ 59.99 Shop.ars Platform 360 , PS3 , PC ( reviewed )
In terms of characters , there actually is n't much to choose from here .
There are four characters , each one a different class , and that 's it .
Each has one special power , such the ability to drop a turret or the ability to charge enemies and deliver a powerful melee attack .
As you level up you can dump points in different skills or abilities , but these choices are also somewhat limited .
Once you 've beaten the game once with one of the characters , it 's doubtful you 'll want to go back and play it again ; you 've already seen nearly everything there is to see with that experience .
That being said , this is a game that grabbed me and did n't let go .
I had a decent time playing the single - player game and finding some good loot and grinding the quests , but the real fun was in the multiplayer .
Jumping from single to multiplayer is simple : on consoles players can just jump in , and on the PC you simply invite a friend .
Your character can be used in both single and multiplayer , and while you can't get the experience points from beating a quest twice , you can help your friends with some extra firepower by tagging along when they go to kill 20 of this or collect the bounty on that .
This is a fun game to play with your friends while simply hanging out online .
Finish a mission or two , talk about your character path , compare gear , or just run around and kill the random enemies on the map .
While the changes in scenery take a while to get to , the game has more variety than we had first assumed .
You 'll be fighting across large overworld maps , with a few areas that require a brief loading time to transport to , and the main draw is the guns .
The glorious guns .
They 're constantly falling from dead enemies : shotguns , hand guns , SMGs , rocket launchers ... and they 're all different .
You also get specific weapons from killing bosses , and you can sell your unwanted firearms at vending machines to get money to buy ... better guns .
You 'll also buy add - ons to those guns , and things like shields , but it 's the ongoing race for the best ordnance that will keep you going .
The more you use a class of guns , such as sniper rifles , the better your proficiency in that type will go up ; you 'll be building your character 's strengths just by pulling the trigger .
When an enemy is killed — and this is a game with midgets that fire shotguns that knock them on their butts as well as masked madmen who attack you with axes by rushing towards you screaming while on fire — you can put your cursor over a beam of light that comes from the top of the weapon to see its attributes .
That way you can compare your existing equipment to figure who gets what .
You 'll find guns that set enemies on fire , shock them , and fire electrical blasts that move in waves .
You 'll find grenades that stick to enemies , give you health back , and break into multiple explosive pieces .
You 'll find better weapons than the ones you 're carrying , but you may pass them up simply because you like certain guns more .
I had found a scoped handgun , that hit for incredibly damage when you land a critical , that I fell in love with for a long time .
Head shots or attacks to the weak spots of enemies count as critical hits , giving you some measure of control over much damage you do ; there is no better feeling than watching an enemy 's head simply pop with a well - placed handgun round .
The game also features a refreshing and attractive art style .
Stylized , cartoony , but still hard - edged , this is a game that looks great on both the 360 and PC , but the PC version gets the nod for better controls with the mouse and keyboard and some great scaling .
My friend played one of my review keys on a higher - end desktop gaming box and it looked incredible .
I played it on my Macbook Pro on my gaming partition and it looked great and ran smooth as the action on my shotgun .
There are arenas that allow you to test your loadout on your friends , some great boss fights , a good variety of people to meet and kill , and with up to four - player co-op , this is a game to play with your Left 4 Dead crew if you 're in the mood for something new and exciting .
You can also spawn vehicles around the map and use them to get to where you 're going quicker , or just have fun with a few rocket launcher drive - bys .
The story may be a little thin , but who cares ?
This game is an absolute blast , especially with good friends playing with you .
Let me give you a sense of the replay value : we first had a 360 code , and then the PC code , and now next week the final retail release will be released for the PC .
After playing both the console and the PC version for endless hours , the first thing I 'm going to do when I get my boxed PC copy is reinstall , call some friends who have n't played it yet , and go through the whole thing again .
The quicker I help them beat the game , the faster they can help me get the good loot that 's unlocked in the second playthrough mode .
Verdict : Buy
Update :
There are no dice rolls in the game , different enemies have different weak areas that count as a critical hit .
I have updated the text accordingly .

It is with a heavy heart that we report the untimely death of NYC skateboard legend Andy Kessler .
Kessler , 49 , died on Monday night from cardiac arrest due to an allergic reaction to a wasp sting he sustained on Montauk , Long Island .
Kessler was an integral part of graffiti and skate crew The Soul Artists of Zoo York in the late ' 70s considered by some to be New York 's version of the Z - Boys crew from Dogtown in Santa Monica , Calif .
In 1979 , the crew earned its place in history when one member , Marc Edmunds , published the 'zine " Zoo York , " in which Kessler and crew were pitted in a fictional championship against a rival skate crew , establishing their outlaw legend .
They skated throughout the city from Riverside Park to the abandoned swimming pool in Van Cortlandt Park dubbed the " Death Bowl . "
The bowl was later immortalized in the documentary about the evolution of the skate scene in New York , " Deathbowl to Downtown . "
Kessler and Stacy Peralta at the " Dogtown and Z - Boys " premiere in 2002 .

" Kessler was the last of the true New Yorkers , " says Tim Vander , fellow skatepark builder and longtime friend of Kessler's .
" Some days you caught him and he was a jerk , some days you 'd sit and talk for hours .
Whether you liked his opinions or not , he was real .
I do n't know who I 'm going to call now and talk s--- to two or three days out of the week . "
After the crew broke up in 1980 , Andy went through some hard times , but eventually cleaned himself up and worked odd jobs .
He spearheaded a number of skateboarding initiatives in the city , including working with the Parks Department to build the first skatepark in Manhattan , at 108th Street in Riverside Park , earning him the nickname " Grandmaster of 108 . "
He went on to design and build parks throughout the five boroughs and beyond .
" I met Andy skateboarding in Washington Square Park in 1985 , when there were maybe 40 skaters total in New York , " says Joe Humeres , owner of Bodega Skateboards .
" This was right about the time he started taking on the Parks Department .
He was the perfect person to do it .
To be able to have Parks property allocated for skateboarding in NYC  something he was completely responsible for is a tremendous gift to skateboarding .
No one will ever fill those shoes . "
In his later years , Kessler 's support of New York City 's skate community and culture helped skateboarding in New York progress to where it is now .
He will be mourned by the skate community as a whole , from coast to coast , and be remembered by his friends and family .
" He battles hardships for 15 years , gets through things that would kill normal people , and he dies from a bee sting ?
In 2009 ?
It 's unbelievable .
He 's definitely going to be missed ; he 's had an impact on a lot of people , " says Vander .
Humeres agrees .
" He was fun , entertaining and extremely respected .
When Andy was there , the session was on .
There will never be anyone like him . "
Modern computer storage would be dwarfed by the new devices
Tiny crystals could hold the key to creating computers with massive storage capacity , scientists believe .
The crystals could be used as storage devices for desktop computers capable of holding 100 - times more data than current systems .
Scientists at the University of Edinburgh have been using low - energy lasers to make salt crystals in gel .
The development could allow users to store a terabyte of data in a space the size of a sugar cube within a decade .
This would be enough to hold the equivalent of 250,000 photographs or a million books .
There is much work to be done before these crystals can be used in practical applications such as optical storage , but we believe they have significant potential
Dr Andy Alexander
University of Edinburgh Many scientists regard making crystals as a black art , as the process of producing solid crystals from salt in solution is difficult to control .
It requires a critical mass of molecules gathered at one place , which is difficult to trigger and regulate .
The researchers overcame this difficulty by focusing two overlapping low - energy laser beams on a salt solution , providing exactly the right amount of energy to form a temporary crystal .
Dr Andy Alexander , of the university 's school of chemistry , who developed the technique , said it could be used to improve on traditional methods of optical data storage , such as CDs .
Massive amounts Compared with the flat two - dimensional surface of a CD , three - dimensional optical data storage uses many more layers , in which tiny crystals could act as storage points .
Information would be recorded in a similar way as on CDs - by making marks in a pattern , which are read using light .
Such devices , which could be available within 10 years , would enable users to store , access and move around massive amounts of information easily .
Dr Alexander said : " This research builds on a discovery that was made by accident many years ago , when it was found that light can be used to trigger crystal formation .
" We have refined this technique and now we can create crystals on demand .
There is much work to be done before these crystals can be used in practical applications such as optical storage , but we believe they have significant potential . "

I Retract My Apology and Call for More Regulation of Goldman Sachs
TSF – Opinion Commentary – November 22 , 2009 ( see also Apology )
According to SIGTARP1 , both the Federal Reserve and Treasury agreed that an AIG failure posed unacceptable risk to the global financial system and the U.S. economy .
On March 24 , 2009 , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke testified before the House Financial Services Committee [ P.9 ] :
[ C] onceivably , its failure could have resulted in a 1930 ’s - style global financial and economic meltdown , with catastrophic implication [s ] .
From July 2007 , AIG ’s financial situation deteriorated while so - called “ AAA ” collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) dropped in value .
AIG sold credit default swaps ( CDSs ) on these CDOs and had to post more collateral , as the prices plummeted .
Goldman Sachs was AIGFP ’s ( UK - based AIG Financial Products ) largest CDS counterparty with around $ 22.1 billion , or about one - third of the problematic trades .
Goldman underwrote some of the CDOs underlying its own CDSs , and also underwrote a large portion of the CDOs against which French banks SocGen , Calyon , Bank of Montreal , and Wachovia bought CDS protection .
Goldman provided pricing on these CDOs to SocGen and Calyon .
Goldman was a key contributor to AIG ’s liquidity strain and the resulting systemic risk .
( See “ Goldman ’s Undisclosed Role in AIG ’s Distress ” )
Apocalypse AIG
By mid September 2008 , AIG ’s long - term credit rating was downgraded , its stock price plummeted , and AIG could n’t meet its borrowing needs in the short - term credit markets .
According to SIGTARP , “ without outside intervention , the company faced bankruptcy , as it simply did not have the cash that was required to provide to AIGFP ’s counterparties as collateral . ” [ P.9 ]
The Federal Reserve Board with Treasury ’s encouragement authorized a bailout .
2
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( FRBNY ) extended an $ 85 billion revolving credit facility , so AIG could make its collateral payments to Goldman and some of its CDO buyers .
AIG also met other obligations , such as payments under its securities lending programs owed to Goldman and some of its CDO buyers .
( See also : “ AIG Discloses Counterparties to CDS , GIA , and Securities Lending Transactions . ” )
Goldman “ Would Have Realized a Loss ”
Fed Chairman Bernanke said AIG ’s crisis put the world at risk for a global financial meltdown .
Goldman purchased little credit default protection3 against an AIG collapse .
Even if Goldman escaped a collateral clawback of the billions it held from AIG4 , the underlying CDOs posed substantial market value risk ( SIGTARP P. 17 ) .
As for systemic risk , Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein worried about untold billions in losses .
( Too Big to Fail , P. 382 . )
On September 16 , 2008 , as the FRBNY arranged AIG ’s $ 85 billion credit line , Goldman CFO David Viniar said whatever the outcome , he would expect the direct impact of credit exposure to be “ immaterial to [ Goldman ’s ] results . ”
The CDOs ’ ( $ 22.1 billion ) value was down around $ 10 billion , and AIG still owed Goldman $ 2.5 billion in collateral ( hedged and partly collateralized by CDSs on AIG ) .
SIGTARP shows the CDOs ’ value fell another $ 2.5 billion in two months , and AIG ’s new credit line provided more collateral .
The CDOs were losing market value .
If AIG had collapsed , the value drop would have been swift and brutal with new protection either unavailable or too expensive , if past CDS market mayhem provided any information .
As the Wall Street Journal put it , SIGTARP “ throws cold water on [ Goldman ’s ] claim . ”
Before September 16 , 2008 , AIG tried to negotiate a settlement for forty cents on the dollar .
Other insurers have negotiated even deeper discounts to settle their CDS contracts on CDOs .
The SIGTARP report shows that the FRBNY ’s decision to pay 100 cents on the dollar to resolve $ 13.9 billion ( part of Goldman ’s $ 22.1 billion ) of credit default swaps by purchasing the underlying CDOs in Maiden Lane III was important to Goldman Sachs .
“ Goldman Sachs … did not agree to concessions , because it would have realized a loss if it had . ” [ P.16 ]
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , then President of FRBNY , is revealed in this New York Times article with apparent Stockholm syndrome rivaled only by Patty Hearst .
He seems to echo Goldman ’s talking points after discussions with Goldman ’s CFO .
In the fall of 2008 , Henry ( “ Hank ” ) Paulson was Treasury Secretary .
Paulson was formerly CEO of Goldman Sachs and held that role when Goldman executed its trades with AIG .
Stephen Friedman , a former Goldman Sachs co-chairman , was Chairman of FRBNY .
Friedman owned shares of Goldman Sachs , and was a member of Goldman ’s board , while he held his influential Fed position .
He resigned the Fed position in May 2009 , but not before purchasing 50,000 shares of Goldman Sachs , when the public was still in the dark about the terms of the bailout .
Goldman ’s Turn to Apologize
In light of the SIGTARP report , I withdraw my earlier apology to Goldman .
Public commitments to AIG are currently around $ 182 billion .
If you wonder what Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein meant when he said : “ [ Goldman Sachs ] participated in things that were clearly wrong and we have reason to regret and we apologize for them , ” think of Goldman ’s role in AIG ’s crisis , Goldman ’s bailout , and Goldman ’s ongoing heavy taxpayer subsidies .
That way , one of you will be genuinely sorry about it .
1 The November 17 , 2009 report of the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Programs , “ Factors Affecting Efforts to Limit Payments to AIG Counterparties . ”
The report does not address the risk of collateral clawbacks by authorities on behalf of AIG or the public , and it does not address the relative size of Goldman ’s CDS positions and CDO underwriting activity related to AIG ’s CDSs mentioned in the above commentary .
2 Fed and Treasury officials thought AIG ’s derivatives were “ more risky and unbalanced than Lehman ’s . ”
They were concerned about loss of confidence in AIG ’s subsidiaries , AIG ’s failure to perform on annuities and wraps , losses to state and local governments , global banks and investment banks , losses to 401k plans , and the credit markets .
The Reserve Primary Fund had fallen below $ 1.00 per share after it wrote off Lehman ’s debt causing a run on the fund , and officials worried about an AIG failure causing further “ breaking - of - the - buck . ” ( P. 10 )
3 SIGTARP says Goldman would have trouble collecting on the credit default protection it bought to protect against an AIG collapse — which by deduction seems to only be around $ 2.5 billion .
It is usual to have mark - to - market collateral , but it is unlikely this position was 100 % collateralized .
In November 2008 , it seems $ 1.2 billion of this hedge was allocated for Maiden Lane III assets and $ 1.1 billion to another $ 8.2 billion position leaving an apparent slight excess notional amount .
But even if it were 100 % collateralized , that seeming advantage could quickly disappear in a volatile market when pricing discounted illiquid assets that lack transparency .
[ P. 16 , 17 ]
4 According to SIGTARP , private participants felt AIG ’s financial condition was so tenuous that on September 15 , they refused to fund AIG making the Fed ’s bailout necessary .
Their analysis showed AIG ’s liquidity needs exceeded the value of the company ’s assets . [ P.8 ]
Goldman ’s status in the event of an AIG collapse would have been that of a credit default swap counterparty during a global crisis with very special circumstances .
Goldman thought it would get to keep the billions in dollars it received from AIG , if AIG collapsed .
That would normally be the case , but these would have been extraordinary circumstances inflamed by value - destroying CDOs over which Goldman had pricing power , and Goldman had underwritten some of the CDOs .
Authorities charged with resolving a collapse of AIG may have clawed back a substantial portion of the collateral .

This week the United Nation 's Human Rights Council produced a 600 - page report alleging that Israel carried out war crimes in Gaza .
The Goldstone Report — named for its chief investigator Richard Goldstone — also asserts that Israel 's motives for its operation against Hamas nine months ago were purely political .
I am outraged by these accusations .
Let me explain why .
It is the duty of every nation to defend itself .
This is a basic obligation that all responsible governments owe their citizens .
Israel is no different .
After enduring eight years of ongoing rocket fire — in which 12,000 missiles were launched against our cities , and after all diplomatic efforts to stop this barrage failed — it was my duty as defense minister to do something about it .
It 's as simple and self - evident as the right to self - defense .
While such logic eluded Mr. Goldstone and his team , it was crystal clear to the thousands of Israeli children living in southern Israel who had to study , play , eat and sleep while being preoccupied about the distance to the nearest bomb shelter .
When I accompanied then - presidential candidate Barack Obama on his visit to the shelled city of Sderot , he said " If somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night , I 'm going to do everything in my power to stop that .
And I would expect Israelis to do the same thing . "
Too bad the Human Rights Council was n't listening .
Whenever we are forced to defend our own lives , it is our obligation to do so in a way that ensures that the lives of innocent civilians on the other side are protected .
This duty becomes extremely difficult when we have to face an enemy that intentionally deploys its forces in densely populated areas , stores its explosives in private homes , and launches rockets from crowded school yards and mosques .
In Gaza , we reached out to the civilians via millions of leaflets , telephone calls and text messages urging them to leave areas before we acted .
Tight credit and slow sales are putting retailers in a crunch this holiday season .
Unable to finance their inventory via traditional means , CNN Money notes small businesses struggle fending off empty holiday shelves .
Retailers traditionally borrow money to buy holiday inventory .
But credit for small businesses has dried up this year , and with the recession slowing sales , few merchants have cash on hand .
The crunch is forcing business owners to find new ways to keep running .
For a handful of New York City retailers in one hard - hit stretch of Brooklyn , a small community lender is playing the role of Santa Claus .
Lesia Bates Moss , president of Seedco Financial Services , noticed an ever - increasing number of vacant storefronts along Atlantic Avenue .
In response , she hosted a meeting with a dozen area retailers to find out how her organization could help .
One common problem the merchants cited was getting enough credit to buy sufficient holiday inventory .
So Seedco Financial , a nonprofit that specializes in financing for underserved communities , launched a streamlined holiday program : Retailers who could provide a marketing plan for spending the money and driving foot traffic would get fast loans .
On Monday , Seedco staffers started delivering checks .
A typical loan request is for around $ 20,000 , to be repaid over the next year at interest rates of 6 % to 10 % .
Toys and beer glasses : Karen Zebulon , the owner of toy and clothing retailer Gumbo on Atlantic Ave. , is one of Seedco Financial 's borrowers .
" Especially this year , because we have had such hard times , we really need a boost , " she said .
" If I can really strategize and plan and buy the right merchandise , I think it can be a turning point for me .
Artez 'n Gift and Gallery , which sells products made by local Brooklyn artisans , also got a loan from Seedco .
Owner Jessica
Furst got her check on Monday and " ran to the bank . "
She plans to use the cash to stock up on one of her best - selling items : pint glasses with illustrations of Brooklyn landmarks on them .
They 're a proven customer lure , drawing in tourists and others who make a special trip to Artez 'n for the glasses .
With sales slow this year , Furst would n't have been able to afford to produce the Brooklyn beer glasses without the last - minute loan .
The big challenge for merchants will come over the next month .
The National Retail Federation forecasts that this year 's holiday sales will decline 1 % , to $ 437.6 billion .
" The real concern is , can you sell stuff ? " said Bill Dunkelberg , chief economist of the National Federation of Independent Businesses .
" I am sure inventory accumulation has been cautious .
It does n't look like it is going to be much better than last year , which was terrible . "
Misguided Hope
Clark Kepler 's dad opened Kepler 's Books in 1955 .
Like so many other independent bookstores , Kepler 's Books is fighting for sales in an industry now dominated by Big Box discount retailers and Internet book sellers .
Four years ago , with the shop on the brink of closure , 25 members of the Silicon Valley community voluntarily donated $ 1 million to save the neighborhood bookstore .
The recession has further ravaged the business , which saw a double - digit sales decline .
" We had the most difficult time this last several months with the cash - flow issues , " Kepler said .
" We managed to get through it , but we were robbing Peter to pay Paul every step of the way . "

A couple have successfully sued their wedding photographer for his shoddy coverage of their big day .
Anyone can point a camera at a happy couple , but what pitfalls do the professionals face ?
The memorable shots from Marc and Sylvia Day 's wedding are unusual , to say the least .
Decapitated guests , a ceremony hardly visible through the gloom , and random close - ups of ... not the bouquet , or a snatched kiss , but of carriage wheels .
The three - year - old bridesmaid - caught in one snap without her clothes on - could have done a better job .

Your bad wedding pics
The Days are so upset that they 've taken their photographer to court for breach of contract over the £ 1,450 photo and video package .
But how hard can it be to get great shots at a happy occasion , where everyone is dressed up in picturesque locations ?
Most guests bring along their own cameras , after all .
Harder than it looks , says Paul Cudmore , a past winner of Wedding Photographer of the Year , who has been in the business for 18 years .
" It 's all about emotions and capturing emotions .
And obviously you 've got to look out for vans driving past in the background . "
The secret is in the planning - knowing what the bride and bridegroom want , who will be there , where the best locations are .
Then there are the timings .
" Brides are always late arriving , so you have perhaps four or five minutes to get shots you 'd normally spend an hour on .
A guest told me that at the last wedding she went to , the photographers were blowing whistles at them
Paul Cudmore
Newlyweds compensated for photos " And brides and grooms - most of whom have n't been married before - do n't realise that it can take quarter of an hour for people to leave the church and assemble for photos .
I 've had reception venues phoning me to ask where everyone is . "
Most tricky of all is the group shot most couples want , if not for themselves , then for Mum and Dad , Auntie Mabel , and their grandparents .
To get that many people to stand in the right place , to look in the right direction - and to smile at the right time - can be like herding cats .
" It 's all about communication , making the guests and the wedding party feel relaxed and happy , " says Mr Cudmore .
" At one wedding , a guest told me that at the last wedding she went to , the photographers were blowing whistles at them . "
One of Neil Thayer 's wedding shots Neil Thayer , a wedding photographer based in Bath , says it 's the photographer 's job to keep everyone happy .
" It 's like getting all your family together at Christmas - some people do n't get on , there are husbands and wives who have split up and come together for this big set - piece .
There can be a lot of tension .
On one job I was on , there was very nearly a fight . "
And even if fisticuffs are n't on the horizon , many of those being photographed simply want to crack on with the celebrating .
They complain that the photos are taking too long , and itch to get off to the bar .
How does Mr Thayer keep things moving along , and still get the right shots ?
" I never stop talking to people , even if it 's making silly jokes .
I always make sure I work with the ushers , and know their names - because they will know the names of the people I do n't . "
Camera trouble
Then there are the naturalistic reportage shots popular with couples today .
The only trouble is , people often freeze when they sense a camera lens pointing in their direction .
" They stop , crack a smile , then say ' Are you finished ? '
I say yes , they breathe a sigh of relief , relax , and start talking and laughing again .
I keep shooting , " says Mr Thayer .
There 's more to it than fancy kit " The bride and groom are not often together , " says Mr Cudmore .
" She 'll be on one side of the room talking to someone , and he on the other .
You have to instruct them to stand next to each other - not fake reportage , but staged reportage . "
Both live in fear of mechanical failure , whether it's a camera card corrupting ( which happened once to Mr Cudmore ) or car trouble ( Mr Thayer locked his keys in the boot and almost missed the reception ) .
" I always take two cameras and three or four lenses , " says Mr Thayer .
" You 've got to have back - up kit - I always take double .
And I always pack a needlework kit in my bag in case of accidents , " adds Mr Cudmore , who often finds himself helping to tie cravats and advising relatives on which side of the church to sit .
And if there are small children involved ?
" So many people tell them ' you 've got to be good , you 've got to smile ' .
Then these little four and five - year - olds build up this big worry .
I tell them 'we 're going to have lots of fun , the bride will look like a princess and you 'll be helping her ' . "
His advice for choosing a photographer for the big day ?
" Look at their portfolio and make sure it is all their own work . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
I 've only started in this industry and shot my first wedding recently .
It 's an incredibly daunting task .
The timing , the constant awareness needed to capture moments , the technical difficulties in low light , people herding , research , and the time consuming post - processing all make this a lot more difficult than imagined .
People just dive in , thinking a £ 500 camera with a built - in flash will cut the mustard .
Not a chance .
I 've spent over 4 k on gear , and need more lenses and light tools , six months of deep research and practice , 12 years using Photoshop professionally as a graphic artist .
I 'm still nervous about every shoot .
Emmett McLaughlin , Liverpool I was married just outside of Gloucester 13 months ago today and I still get upset thinking about our wedding photos .
We scoured the region for a photographer and had several discussions with him about the shots and style we wanted .
Although I remember being nervous on the day how shots would come out , it was n't until a week later that we received the final images and were absolutely devastated .
None of us alone after the wedding , or full - length shots of my dress , or with my bridesmaid or family .
Family shots like " where 's Wally " .
We wrote to him afterwards to ask about some make - up shots and let him know our disappointment but received no reply .
It all sounds so trivial , but it nevertheless hurts when there 's no picture taken you can bear to have on display of your wedding day .
Jessica Oldroyd , London , England
As a professional photographer I can categorically state that wedding photography is a very special skill , a skill which I do not have .
There is no second chance , no room for any error and no room for a small mistake .
The ONLY way to learn wedding photography is to work as an assistant to a wedding photographer - not an easy job to get , either , as you are a potential threat to their business .
Chris Young , Caheragh , West Cork , Ireland I 'm one of the new breed of photographers I 'm afraid .
I 've had some tutoring and attended classes in lots of photography disciplines , but none of it can really prepare you for what you will face on a real shoot .
I 've been fortunate that I 've been chosen by friends to shoot weddings for cost of printing only or for free , and they have been happy with my work , but it 's clear the real professionals earn every penny .
It 's exhausting , stressful work .
You only get one chance at taking these photos , and the pressure and responsibility does n't really hit you until the big day .
Best left to the pros .
Roy Stoliday , Southampton
We also have terrible wedding pictures .
The only one we have framed was taken by my father and we never look at our album as the photographer 's pictures are dreadful .
We plan to renew our vows after 10 years ( four years time ) and have some decent pictures taken by a talented photographer , and as a bonus our children will be there too .
Corrine , Sleaford
We did n't have a photographer at our wedding - we could n't face spending hundreds of pounds to have a stranger boss everyone about for hours while we all got tired and bored .
Our friends and family took lovely shots , we have a beautiful album , and everyone looks so happy and relaxed because they are being photographed by people they know .
Sarah S , York , UK
We had a fabulous photographer for our wedding , not stupidly expensive and he really captured the mood of the day .
It was only after we booked him we realised he had won Wedding Photographer of the Year .
Friends of our paid twice as much for theirs , who managed to get a fire extinguisher in every photo of the bride before the ceremony and tourists ' heads looking over the castle walls .
Sarah , Sutton Coldfield
I got married in pre-digital times , 14 years ago .
The photographer took three rolls of film , but when they were developed , the machine broke and two of the films , including the one with the church pix , got completely over - developed .
While we only have happy memories of the main part of the ceremony , the lab made some manual black and white prints of as many church pictures they could , including some close - ups of bride and groom .
They look absolutely stunning and everyone thinks it was done this way on purpose .
I was very impressed by the skill and dedication of everyone involved to save as many pictures of our special day as possible .
Chris , London
I worked as a wedding host at a country house hotel and saw all kinds of photographers come and go .
The digital era appears to have promoted a scatter gun effect in which the man behind the lens takes thousands of shots and hopes to get a good one .
The best we worked with - and the ones who had the best rapport with guests - were the old school ones .
We would support them and herd guests into the right places at the right times , but high cost does n't mean high quality .
Our recommended photographer was about mid-price and did Hasselblad work for the main photos and his daughter caught people in unguarded moments with a digital camera .
A great pairing with an old school camera and new fangled digital one .
Gavin , Manchester , England Many people are not using professionals because they think that the images shot by their guests will suffice and see it as a way of cutting costs .
But a good wedding photographer can make the day run so much more smoothly .
As well as taking pictures , the photographer is the one person prior to the reception who can organise and stage - manage the event ensuring that everyone is in the right place and guiding things along .
It is an immensely stressful job with a huge amount of responsibility and certainly not for the faint - hearted .
Yes , pros can be expensive but it's a three day job when all of the pre-organisation , editing , and post production is taken into consideration and so costs need to be covered .
Andy Newbold , Leatherhead , Surrey
We just asked guests to share their pictures with us .
We ended up with the most fabulous photos and one guest even put an album together which was very special .
My advice is not to pay out - the pictures we ended up with are exceptional quality , very natural and really catch the essence of the day .
Daphne , Northants , Daventry
As we were living abroad before our wedding , my parents arranged everything for us , so when we got back the photographer was already booked .
At our first meeting she said she 'd driven by the church ( chosen because I 'd know the minister my whole life , not for its appearance ) and on a scale of 1 - 10 it rated about 3 for attractiveness , turning her nose up .
I asked if she 'd walked around to the little churchyard - of course she had n't , should have fired her right then .
She decided we would do most of the photos at the reception in a concrete courtyard , with the wrong lighting , shadows , a bench poking into half the photos , people squinting .
She upset half the guests , bossing them about & as she only had a hand - held camera , they thought she was another guest .
The photos are very average , but my friends took much better ( =relaxed ) ones .
The technique and equipment is only half of it - the bedside manner counts for a lot .
This was pre-digital - these days your guests can do it all , just have a list & maybe one friend to make sure which group shots you do n't want to miss .
Jane ,
York I was told by the person who taught me the science behind the camera , about wedding photography : " The ceremony lasts an hour , the cake may last three days , the bride wo n't fit in to her dress in five years , but ... your photographs will have to last a lifetime . "
That mantra has stuck with me and in a business where the end product is still very disposable , it is one reason why I very rarely take any wedding photographs ; because when pressing the shutter release , the image not only has to look good tomorrow , it still has to be appreciated 10 , 20 or 30 years down the line .
Sean , Chesterfield , Derbyshire / Barcelona , Spain
At our wedding , our photographers ( she had a team working with her ) were brilliant .
Never in your face and capturing emotion and moments and lighting ... the pictures are as much art pieces as they are printed memories .
Eight years later and we still keep in touch with her .
We 've been to several of her exhibitions and have one of her photos ( not of our wedding ) hanging in our hallway .
Bottom line - it's not the equipment or luck , though those help .
It 's the eye of the artist holding the camera .
John F , Philadelphia
Over the past 10 years I shot countless weddings .
I came to hate wedding photography as it is repetitive and very ungrateful .
I admire those who are willing to cope with weddings .
Stopped the whole wedding business about a year ago and switched entirely to studio work .
And I love my photography again .
Charles , Belfast , UK
We did n't have a massive budget for our photographs , and found the extortionate prices some photographers were charging truly jaw - dropping .
Our photos were OK , but I really believe that I could have done as good a job .
Had I not been the groom , I would have done them myself .
Shane , Sale
That takes me back .
Our photographer was brilliant , kept chatting , got all the shots we wanted and was a reasonable price .
Not the 1000s quoted above .
You need a good photographer .
It is an art .
I know someone who had a friend of a friend to do their wedding photos and they were just snapshots .
Nothing outstanding for the mantlepiece .
Ian , Romford , UK
It takes more than just a good camera and a flash .
It 's all about reading a situation , learning how to use light and understanding group psychology .
Not to mention weddings always put you in impossible situations ... situations where the biggest names in photography would say " no way ... you ca n't do that " .
So if you do n't think you can work your way out of any situation , do n't even think of ruining someone 's wedding .
Every day I see wonderful photographers on Flickr .
Amazing work from amazing people .
Thing is about 90 % of them should never go near a wedding .
Photographing things and photographing people are two very different things .
Robert Burress , Liss , Hampshire , UK I got remarried last November in a Gothic style of wedding , which was new to the photographer .
Although the finished album turned out fantastically , the photographs on the day were a real chore .
After the wedding itself , it took about an hour for all the pictures to be done in every configuration imaginable ... and 20 minutes after the guests had left for the reception .
It started to feel as though the day was more about him and his pictures than about me and my husband .
Heather , Willenhall
This is a sad reflection on today 's industry where anyone with a camera can now call themselves a photographer .
As a professional and full - time photographer for 27 years , I have seen the standards within this industry eroded because of amateurs and weekend photographers who posses very little in the way of technical training or knowledge , vocational qualifications , no professional affiliations , no insurance , and no ability .
I hope this is a valuable lesson and wake - up call for non-professional photographers that sub-standard work is not acceptable , and that they should get trained and get affiliated with a photographic organisation .
Ian Arthur , Glasgow Some friends of mine chose their wedding venue ( civil ) simply because of the picturesque location it offered for photographs .
The bride had a list of specific shots she wanted .
Everything had been prepared for ; they even allowed two hours for the full range of photographs in this spectacular garden with stunning wide - reaching vistas .
On the morning of the wedding , I flung open my curtains with eager anticipation of a perfect day only to see ...
... nothing .
Not even the tree 30 feet away from my bedroom window .
The DENSEST fog in many years had descended .
It could have been a disaster but their photographer was a genius .
She took close - ups of everyone , little vignettes of buttonholes or bridesmaids ' beaded pumps or family groups inside the venue , then returned on the next decent day and took the vistas the couple had been so enchanted by .
When the prints were placed in the album , the entire effect was eye - moistening .
Jaye , Rutland , England I 've been photographing weddings for over 10 years now and the industry has changed substantially .
There are many photographers out there using sub-standard amateur equipment .
The problem with underexposed photos in the church above is caused by the use of cheap lenses on a cheap camera body - 99 % of churches do not allow flash photography so you need wide aperture lenses to cope with the low light conditions .
The problem is that many people believe wedding photography is a less professional art than perhaps fashion or editorial .
It is in fact probably the most demanding area of photography there is .
You only have one chance , the lighting conditions are constantly changing and you have to keep people happy at the same time .
I did a photography degree but only experience can teach you the pitfalls of this industry .
Ian , Sevenoaks
We just did n't have the money to spend over £ 1,200 on photographs , so we bought loads of disposables and got people to send us pictures they had taken on their own cameras .
The quality of these was brill .
Your mates know how to take your best picture .
Caroline , Winchester I 've stopped agreeing to be " official " photographer at friends and family weddings .
It is simply the most stressful role to play and the results can be hit and miss .
My tip : get a nice long telephoto lens and be inconspicuous and take candid photos after you 've done all the staged cheesy stuff .
It also helps to know your location beforehand .
Give me landscapes and nature over excited , tipsy wedding revellers any day of the week .
Adam , Manchester I used to provide tech support to a number of clients including a wedding photographer .
Every time he wandered in with his latest video editing disaster I cried a little on the inside for the poor victims .
It was n't my place to tell him he was destroying dreams but I think anyone looking for a photographer should ask to see some kind of portfolio .
There really are some muppets out there who see an easy few hundred quid in the making .

Many of the deaths are preventable , the report says
Tens of thousands of women die in India during pregnancy or childbirth or soon after giving birth , a new report says .
The Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) report says the deaths occur despite government programmes guaranteeing free maternal health care .
The focus of the study is on Uttar Pradesh - India 's most populous northern state - where a large number of women die from " preventable causes " .
The state is among the most backward in India with abysmal health care systems .
The 150 - page report - No Tally of the Anguish : Accountability in Maternal Health Care in India - documents repeated failures both in providing health care to pregnant women in Uttar Pradesh and in taking steps to identify and address gaps in care , HRW said in a press release .
The state has one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in India , but government surveys show it is not alone in struggling with these problems , including a failure even to record how many women are dying .
' Life and death ' " Unless India actually counts all the women who die because of childbirth , it wo n't be able to prevent those thousands of unnecessary deaths , " says Aruna Kashyap , lead researcher of Human Rights Watch .
" Accountability might seem like an abstract concept , but for Indian women it 's a matter of life and death , " she says .
India has made reducing maternal deaths a major health priority by making maternal health care free for poor women , and providing cash incentives for those delivering at health facilities instead of at home .
Despite this " priority " status , monitoring is so poor there is no reliable record of how many women are dying each year , and whether these initiatives are reaching those who need it the most , the report says .
It cites numerous examples where a breakdown in the system ended tragically .
India created a flagship programme - the National Rural Health Mission - in 2005 to improve rural health , with a specific focus on maternal health .
But the system is not working as it should in many cases , the report says .
It blames corruption and a lack of awareness among women for the sorry state of affairs .

The causes of the disaster are not due to faulty organisation , but to misfortune in all risks which had to be undertaken .
1 . The loss of pony transport in March 1911 obliged me to start later than I had intended , and obliged the limits of stuff transported to be narrowed .
2 . The weather throughout the outward journey , and especially the long gale in 83 º S. , stopped us .
3 . The soft snow in lower reaches of glacier again reduced pace .
We fought these untoward events with a will and conquered , but it cut into our provision reserve .
Every detail of our food supplies , clothing and depôts made on the interior ice - sheet and over that long stretch of 700 miles to the Pole and back , worked out to perfection .
The advance party would have returned to the glacier in fine form and with surplus of food , but for the astonishing failure of the man whom we had least expected to fail .
Edgar Evans was thought the strongest man of the party .
The Beardmore Glacier is not difficult in fine weather , but on our return we did not get a single completely fine day ; this with a sick companion enormously increased our anxieties .
As I have said elsewhere we got into frightfully rough ice and Edgar Evans received a concussion of the brain – he died a natural death , but left us a shaken party with the season unduly advanced .
But all the facts above enumerated were as nothing to the surprise which awaited us on the Barrier .
I maintain that our arrangements for returning were quite adequate , and that no one in the world would have expected the temperatures and surfaces which we encountered at this time of the year .
On the summit in lat .
85 º 86 º we had - 20 º , - 30 º .
On the Barrier in lat .
82 º , 10,000 feet lower , we had - 30 º in the day , - 47 º at night pretty regularly , with continuous head wind during our day marches .
It is clear that these circumstances come on very suddenly , and our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather , which does not seem to have any satisfactory cause .
I do not think human beings ever came through such a month as we have come through , and we should have got through in spite of the weather but for the sickening of a second companion , Captain Oates , and a shortage of fuel in our depÙts for which I cannot account , and finally , but for the storm which has fallen on us within 11 miles of the depÙt at which we hoped to secure our final supplies .
Surely misfortune could scarcely have exceeded this last blow .
We arrived within 11 miles of our old One Ton Camp with fuel for one last meal and food for two days .
For four days we have been unable to leave the tent – the gale howling about us .
We are weak , writing is difficult , but for my own sake I do not regret this journey , which has shown that Englishmen can endure hardships , help one another , and meet death with as great a fortitude as ever in the past .
We took risks , we knew we took them ; things have come out against us , and therefore we have no cause for complaint , but bow to the will of Providence , determined still to do our best to the last .
But if we have been willing to give our lives to this enterprise , which is for the honour of our country , I appeal to our countrymen to see that those who depend on us are properly cared for .
Had we lived , I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood , endurance , and courage of my companions which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman .
These rough notes and our dead bodies must tell the tale , but surely , surely , a great rich country like ours will see that those who are dependent on us are properly provided for .

The American Physical Society has named Carl Richard Hagen , professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Rochester , as a recipient of the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics .
Hagen was honored with the prize , which is considered one of the most prestigious in physics , for his contributions that helped lead to the electroweak theory , and to what scientists believe is the origin of mass .
He shares the prize with Robert Brout and Francois Englert of the Université Libre de Bruxelles , Gerald S. Guralnik of Brown University , Peter W. Higgs of the University of Edinburgh , and Tom W. B. Kibble of Imperial College , all of whom contributed to the same theory .
Hagen will accept the prize along with the other recipients at the American Physical Society 's annual meeting , Feb. 14 , in Washington , DC .
The prize consists of $ 20,000 , to be split among the six recipients , and a certificate citing the winners ' contributions .
" Dick has played a pivotal role in the history of theoretical particle physics , " says Nicholas Bigelow , chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy .
" We are proud of Dick both as a member of our faculty and as a scientist who influenced an entire field of physics with his insights . "
Hagen is the second University of Rochester faculty member to win the Sakurai Prize .
In 2004 , Susumu Okubo , professor of physics , was honored for his groundbreaking investigations into the decay rates of subatomic particles .
In 1964 , Hagen and the other winners of this year 's prize wrote papers showing how a massless particle could acquire mass by means of a mechanism called symmetry breaking .
Hagen and his colleagues suggested that the particles generated during symmetry breaking are created without mass , but that they acquire their masses because they interact with a field called the Higgs field , named after the co-recipient of the same name .
These papers helped physicists detect the particles that create the weak force , which is responsible for radioactivity .
They also led to the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics for the unification of the weak force and the electromagnetic force .
The prize was endowed in 1984 as a memorial to and in recognition of the accomplishments of J. J. Sakurai by his family and friends .

It is a fundamental principle in any democracy that the military fulfils the wishes of the elected politicians .
However , the Armed Forces are entitled to be given a clear idea of what those wishes are and how success is to be recognised .
Confused messages , political histrionics and indecision are inimical to the proper conduct of any conflict , and especially one as difficult as that currently taking place in Afghanistan .
Yet there is a dangerous chasm developing between the political leaders both here and in America and the military , that is caused largely by a failure of the former to explain clearly what is wanted .
The disclosure that Barack Obama and Gen Stanley McChrystal , the Nato chief in Afghanistan , are seriously at odds over tactics and resources , including manpower , is deeply worrying .
Here , Gordon Brown believes he has been " let down " over the running of the war by Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , the chief of the defence staff .
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph , Gen Sir David Richards , the Army chief , issued a warning that failure would have an " intoxicating effect " on militant Islam .
Sir David is right ; and he articulates the strategy better than the politicians .
It is not merely about stopping al - Qaeda regaining their base in Afghanistan ; it is about ensuring that defeat of the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan stops the spread of Islamism in Pakistan , a nuclear - armed state vulnerable to the allure of religious militancy .
It is in the West 's interests to prevent this happening , but it will not be achieved by a piecemeal approach .
The soldiers daily risking death and mutilation deserve better than to see their top brass and governments squabbling over a strategy that is supposed to be clear , but can only be achieved if the resources are made available .
This palpable sense of disarray needs to be sorted out quickly .
Just 73 seconds after launch on January 28th , 1986 , the Challenger space shuttle broke apart over the coast of Florida and ended the lives of all seven crew members .
A subsequent investigation determined that an O - ring failure on one of the shuttle ’s solid rocket boosters , coupled with extremely cold weather around the time of launch , caused the accident .
6 months prior to the launch , the following memo was sent by Roger Boisjoly — an engineer working at Morton Thiokol , the manufacturers of the solid rocket boosters — to the company ’s Vice President , in which he predicted the problem and warned of a potential “ catastrophe of the highest order . ”
Boisjoly ’s warning went unheeded ; he then attempted to halt the launch , unsuccessfully .
Boisjoly later revealed this memo to the presidential commission investigating the disaster and was then forced to leave Morton Thioklol after been shunned by disgruntled colleagues .
In 1988 he was awarded the AAAS Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility for his actions .

Applied Mechanics – Ext. 3525 SUBJECT : SRM O - Ring Erosion / Potential Failure Criticality
This letter is written to insure that management is fully aware of the seriousness of the current O-ring erosion problem in the SRM joints from an engineering standpoint .
The mistakenly accepted position on the joint problem was to fly without fear of failure and to run a series of design evaluations which would ultimately lead to a solution or at least a significant reduction of the erosion problem .
This position is now drastically changed as a result of the SRM 16A nozzle joint erosion which eroded a secondary O-ring with the primary O-ring never sealing .
If the same scenario should occur in a field joint ( and it could ) , then it is a jump ball as to the success or failure of the joint because the secondary O-ring cannot respond to the clevis opening rate and may not be capable of pressurization .
The result would be a catastrophe of the highest order – loss of human life .
An unofficial team ( a memo defining the team and its purpose was never published ) with leader was formed on 19 July 1985 and was tasked with solving the problem for both the short and long term .
This unofficial team is essentially nonexistent at this time .
In my opinion , the team must be officially given the responsibility and the authority to execute the work that needs to be done on a non-interference basis ( full time assignment until completed . )
It is my honest and very real fear that if we do not take immediate action to dedicate a team to solve the problem with the field joint having the number one priority , then we stand in jeopardy of losing a flight along with all the launch pad facilities .

DETROIT --
The African - American leader of a Detroit mosque was fatally shot Wednesday during a Federal Bureau of Investigation raid on what authorities called a criminal gang run by U.S. converts to Islam .
An FBI spokeswoman said six men were arrested in the raid on a suburban warehouse and two Detroit homes .
The men were arrested on suspicion of a variety of offenses , including illegal possession of firearms , trafficking in stolen goods and altering vehicle identification numbers .
Three suspects remain at large .
Luqman ...
About six months ago , critics pummeled Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg .
He ’d made questionable management decisions , or so it appeared from the outside .
He ’d fumbled the site ’s redesign and botched the company ’s terms of service agreement — moves that whipped up negative publicity and user backlash .
Some people asked whether it was time for Zuckerberg to go .
Six months later , those critics have gone .
The company is enjoying astounding momentum — blowing through user growth forecasts and becoming cash - flow positive earlier than expected .
Recent management hires make the company look more impressive than ever .
Zuckerberg remains firmly in charge .
What happened ?
Insiders say changes reflect the steady decision - making over the past year and a half by a maturing Zuckerberg .
Facebook ’s founder , who was under drinking age when he received his first investment round from a venture capitalist five years ago ( investor Jim Breyer once complained he could n’t even buy Zuckerberg a glass of wine to celebrate the round ) is emerging as a talented business manager , according to a number of executives and investors I talked to over the past several weeks :
He ’s hiring seasoned executives and entrusting key roles to them , becoming more comfortable communicating and leading , and bringing more order to the chaos that so far has characterized the company .
David Sze , a venture capitalist from Greylock Capital and investor in Facebook , says he has watched Zuckerberg over the past two years since his investment , and may have underestimated Zuckerberg ’s ability to scale .
“ When I invested , I thought Mark was one in a million .
Now I think Mark is maybe one in a trillion . ”
Several executives and board members , including Sheryl Sandberg , Mike Schroepfer , Chamath Palihapitiya , Jim Breyer and David Sze talked openly for this piece .
Other employees requested anonymity .
Finding the right business culture
As an example of Zuckerberg ’s new footing , take the incident surrounding the hiring and firing of the company ’s chief financial officer , Gideon Yu ( pictured right ) .
Just 18 months ago , hiring Gideon Yu , the seasoned former Yahoo treasurer and YouTube CFO , was considered a ridiculous coup for Facebook .
So much so that when
Yu left earlier this year , some outsiders saw it as a strategic fumble , and press reports started questioning Zuckerberg ’s rule :
Why was there so much dissension within Facebook ’s leadership ?
Talk with employees , though , and they ’ll tell you sentiment was different on the inside .
Facebook had grown so much in stature that even
Yu became expendable .
Several employees say they were n’t rattled by Yu’s unexplained departure .
Zuckerberg silenced the critics in June when he hired the highly respected former Genentech chief financial officer , David Ebersman , as the new CFO .
“ Every six months , he can upgrade every role in the company , ” said one employee about Zuckerberg , requesting anonymity .
“ That ’s true for Gideon Yu , it ’s even true for [ COO Sheryl ] Sandberg . ”
The Yu replacement was more than just another management shuffle .
It was part of an emerging preoccupation by Zuckerberg with business culture .
Genentech ’s Ebersman ( left ) embodied much of those ideals .
Well before the hire , Zuckerberg forwarded an article about Genentech to one of his advertising product leaders , Tim Kendall .
The piece extolled Genentech ’s hardworking but “ meaning ” - based culture , which has kept Genentech on the edge of innovation and growing for 25 years .
Zuckerberg ’s focus on culture contrasts with three years ago , when he hired Owen Van Natta , the former Amazon executive : “ Zuck cared less about incorporating Amazon ’s culture , ” said one manager .
“ It was more : ‘ Can this guy make me win ? ’ ” Van Natta left last year .
The ruthless meritocracy
Zuckerberg ’s increased sensitivity about hiring is double - edged , however :
It means a more ruthless “ managing out ” of employees if they underperform .
Every employee is rated on a scale from 1 to 5 , with five being the highest .
No one gets a five .
If you get a 1 or a 2 , you ’re quickly shown the door .
Related to that are the steady departures of early founders and executives .
Two of them , Adam D’Angelo and Dustin Moskovitz , were Zuckerberg ’s high - school and college friends , respectively .
They were n’t forced out , but they burned out or realized they were n’t right for their jobs .
Had they not left of their own accord , they ’d have been passed over in hierarchy shifts .
“ There ’s a clear path of bodies , ” said one employee , conceding that it ’s easy to come to a cynical view : “ Zuckerberg uses people for what they ’re worth and kicks them to the curb . ”
However , if you talk to employees still at the company , they see it differently :
It ’s a ruthless Silicon Valley - style meritocracy — where the talented and hardworking rise to the top .
For years , Facebook had no human resources manager .
In 2006 , the company hired an HR manager , but she stayed 3 months and then left .
Zuckerberg could n’t care less about HR .
However , things changed when Zuckerberg appointed a 25 - year - old engineer to run the department , Chris Cox ( right ) .
The grad - school dropout was the last person you ’d think could run HR , but it was the beginning of what would become a serious investment of time into fixing Facebook ’s hiring message .
A very early employee , Cox shared Zuckerberg ’s vision as intimately as anyone .
The Zen - like Cox would greet prospective employees with a 30 - minute Facebook mantra about how Facebook is going to change the world by connecting people .
The Sandberg era of “ stability ” begins
Cox ’s work built on the evangelism of early Zuckerberg acolytes like the charismatic Sean Parker ( who left the company two years ago ) .
Facebook ’s reputation spread — it was the coolest company in the valley to work for .
Oddly though , as late as 2007 , Facebook ’s employees were n’t having that much fun .
Cliques tended to form around whoever seemed Zuckerberg ’s favorite executive at the time .
For a while it was Parker , then it was Van Natta , then someone else .
Facebook was a snakepit .
People jostled for position : “ Angst , stress and burnout , ” recalls one insider .
That all changed in March 2008 , when Zuckerberg brought on Sheryl Sandberg ( left ) , a respected executive at Google who had built out a considerable team at that company .
The two met at a party thrown by a Google executive .
Zuckerberg peppered her with questions about how to “ scale ” a business , and then wooed her to join him .
After Zuckerberg made several promises — including locating his desk next to hers and meeting at least once a week — Sandberg agreed .
Sandberg ’s reign as COO , of course , has brought its own form of politics , but at least it ’s brought stability .
The evidence : “ They seem more jazzed , happier , ” says Saar Gur , an investor with several friends at Google and Facebook .
Googlers , some who never thought they ’d leave Google , are leaving to join Facebook and spreading the word .
“ I ’ve got friends at Google who say that for the first time they feel like they ’re really missing something by not working at Facebook , ” said Gur .
Up to 20 percent of Facebook ’s employee base now hails from Google .
It ’s incentives , stupid
There ’s also a growing recognition by Zuckerberg that “ all human behavior boils down to incentives . ”
That ’s reflected by Zuckerberg ’s efforts to motivate each person according to what gets them excited :
For engineers , that means giving them the best product to build , but for business executives , it means big financial incentives .
Zuckerberg backs that up with an unconventional compensation scheme .
Most Silicon
Valley companies grant you a single set of stock options .
You may get a bonus if you do well , but it ’s unusual to be able to increase your stock option grant .
At Facebook , if you excel in meeting your project goals , you can double your stock option count in 1.5 year “ refreshing ” cycles .
This individual multiplier is added on to another bonus that is based on how well the company does as a whole , in terms of user and revenue growth .
But here ’s the tough part : Managers have to force - rank their employees .
The more Machiavellian managers make a point of telling their employees where they stand .
If you ’re tenth on of team of 10 , you ’re hanging on by a thread , and you know it .
So absorbed has Zuckerberg become in running the company that although he feigns wanting to code , and pledges he ’s going to go home and work on product features , it ’s rare that he actually codes anymore , say those around him .
Instead , he ’s making himself accessible for things like interviews of candidates , talking strategy , and putting together deals .
Before acquiring Friendfeed , Zuckerberg briefed up with his legal and business team , and formulated the deal terms to buy the company , negotiating it personally .
The focus on execution , creativity and big bets
Zuckerberg bought Friendfeed because of its talented team .
In Silicon Valley , it ’s well known that the talent bell - curve among engineers is steep .
A good engineer can be 10 times more efficient than an average engineer — a genius engineer translates into more impact for Facebook , and Zuckerberg understands that , says Mike Schroepfer , vice president of engineering .
Schropefer ( pictured right ) , the former Mozilla executive , was himself hired to replace predecessor D’Angelo .
In hiring , Facebook cares not just about raw talent — including IQ or GPA — but also about whether someone has shown they can follow through and do things .
Creativity is also sought for .
The hiring of Blake Ross , the former Firefox developer , and of the Friendfeed team , are frequently mentioned as examples .
Zuckerberg has ceded vast swaths of authority to executives around him , starting with the hiring of Sheryl Sandberg , the former Google executive .
Sandberg leads Facebook ’s business and operations .
Under her are business execs , Dan Rose and Mike Murphy .
Zuckerberg devised a new role , led by Chamath Palihapitiya , that ties together the three existing business units ( product , sales , business ) in a singular focus on ways to grow user numbers .
Such a “ VP of Growth ” is unusual , if unheard of , at large companies .
In retrospect , though , Zuckerberg ’s move was a stroke of brilliance .
“ Zuck , ” as he is referred to by employees , had serious doubts about creating such a position .
It meant departing from the company ’s focus on core feature development , and looking at data that showed more precisely how users were using the site , from clicking on links to sharing buttons — and tweaking those features to boost activity accordingly .
Zuck locked horns with Palihapitiya ( left ) , debating , for example , whether it was the sheer number of friends a user starts with , or simple virality ( making it easy to invite other friends ) that was more critical to driving growth .
Palihapitiya was behind virality .
They decided to push both , but optimized for virality first , then friend count .
It turned out to be the right decision .
Growth accelerated .
It was “ a massive , colossal home - run , ” in Palihapitiya ’s words .
Zuckerberg acknowledges this , and seems to enjoy the Devil ’s Advocate role Palihapitiya plays .
Like Zuckerberg , Palihapitiya is strong willed , and speaks his mind ( in Palaihapitiya ’s case , it sometimes leads to controversy ) , and few others at Facebook play that role .
Palihapitiya says Zuckerberg deserves credit for trusting him .
Palihapitiya had struggled in earlier roles , where he ’d had mixed success at best , including presiding over Facebook ’s disastrous Beacon project .
But by giving him another shot , Zuck turned Palihapitiya from a self - described “ B player ” into an A - player .
In part , one employee said , Palihapitiya ’s resurrection stemmed from the deeper bench of talent now at Facebook :
The company is now readier to take such risks .
The evolving communicator
Palihapitiya says Zuckerberg is so attentive that he leans over and “ physically listens to you . ”
Indeed , the delegation of power coincides with an increased attention by Zuckerberg to communication .
Earlier this year , Zuckerberg personally took responsibility for a delayed program that would buy back employee stock .
Someone drafted a letter to employees disclosing the delay and gave it to Zuckerberg , but Zuckerberg inserted a sentence saying he was sorry ( even though Sandberg said numerous factors led to the delay , many of them not in Zuckerberg ’s control ) .
He ’s developed more ease in public speaking , in part because of more than a year of company - wide question - and - answer meetings .
” He ’d say very few words before , ” Palihapitiya recalls .
Zuckerberg , whose demeanor is often described as halting , but intense , has since taken speaking training and been receptive to speaking tips from others .
In part , he ’s also driven by an awareness of how important communication is for the company .
He used to be preoccupied with building out features for the Web site , less by public perception .
When controversy broke out two years ago around Beacon , it was an awakening : “ I do n’t think he internalized how brand damaging it was , ” said a long - time employee who watched how Zuckerberg learned from the experience .
“ Now he ’s absurdly concerned about [ branding ] . ”
If you look closely enough at Facebook , for all the chaos that still reigns at the company amid the frantic product launches , there is emerging a paradoxical appreciation for order and process .
The company ’s new digs exemplify this : Zuckerberg has placed his desk at the geometric center of the new building — located at the shortest walking distance form any point in the building .
Next to him sit the leaders of each company division : Schroepfer , of engineering , Cox of product ( Cox took over product last year , moving over from HR ) and Sandberg , of operations .
This way , any employee can walk by the area up to four times a day : “ I want to bump into people on my way to get coffee , ” says Schroepfer , who argues the structure affects psychology .
Zuck the great
Despite the signs of Zuckerberg ’s personal development , insiders say he has always displayed qualities that make him a leader .
He is relentlessly competitive .
Last month , he and other engineers challenged each other to do 5,000 pushups in a week .
Zuckerberg vowed he could do it , but others doubted him , placing 30 - to - 1 odds against it , recalls Sandberg .
Zuckerberg insisted the goal was easily attainable .
He took regular breaks throughout the day to do 10 - 15 pushups , even if he was in the middle of a meeting with visitors .
He completed the 5,000 .
Outside of Facebook , and his girlfriend Priscilla Chan , there ’s time for much else in Zuck ’s life .
He ’s been called an ascetic .
He unabashedly tells people he does not party .
People compare him to Google ’s co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin : disciplined and focused .
On the business side , he likes to push forecasts higher in a continued test of his executives ( see our piece about his challenge to Palihapitiya ) .
People also talk about his intelligence .
Palihapitiya refers to Zuck ’s ability to “ random walk , ” or compute outcomes of particular decisions .
He often moves two or three steps ahead of people he ’s talking with , making it easy to fall behind .
One example often mentioned of Zuckerberg ’s prescience was his conceiving of the idea for Facebook ’s platform as early as 2005 .
Finally , Zuckerberg ’s long - term vision for the company — he thinks in terms of decades — makes him prone to make huge , risky bets .
He pushed through a redesign that caused massive protests , but with further tweaks , those protests have died down .
The Terms of Service controversy earlier this year is another example .
Instead of suggesting a quick removal of an offending clause related to personal privacy , he moved to completely overhaul the TOS — and encouraged users to participate .
If there were rumors about internal dissension at Facebook , board member Jim Breyer says that not once has the board ever thought of removing Zuckerberg as CEO ( not that it could if it tried ; Zuckerberg , the largest shareholder , still effectively controls the board ) .
Breyer says Zuckerberg reminds him of Michael Dell — the founder of Dell who made a series of courageous decisions to disrupt the market with his PC company by innovating on the business model ( selling PCs directly to consumers online ) .
Like Dell , Zuckerberg is managing to create a huge business , even while lacking the dominant technology position that a Microsoft or Google had enjoyed in their markets .
Zuckerberg ’s continued hiring of talented leaders is the most impressive , says Breyer : “ Mark is getting better and better with each month . ”
For Palihapitiya , a better comparison is basketball ’s greatest star : “ Michael Jordan was not born the best basketball player in the world .
He grew into it with practice , ” Palihapitiya said .
“ Mark Zuckerberg has evolved and will evolve into being one of the best CEOs .
He will build an enduring company that has generated immense value , but it will be an evolution . ”
WASHINGTON  The Department of the Interior has frozen oil and gas development on 60 of 77 contested drilling sites in Utah , saying the process of leasing the land was rushed and badly flawed .
The 77 government - owned parcels , covering some 100,000 acres in eastern and southern Utah , were leased in the last weeks of the Bush administration .
But the leases were immediately challenged by conservation groups , and in January a federal judge blocked drilling on the ground that the Interior Department had failed to follow its own procedures for reviewing the appropriateness of lands designated for oil and gas extraction .
An Interior Department review team then presented Secretary Ken Salazar with a recommendation that drilling be allowed to proceed on 17 of the 77 parcels .
But it also said that the leases on eight parcels should be withdrawn and that 52 should be subjected to further study because of potential threats to wildlife and air and water quality .
In announcing Thursday that he had accepted those recommendations , Mr. Salazar said there was a “ headlong rush ” at the end of the Bush administration to lease the sites , without proper attention to environmental and aesthetic concerns .
Some of the parcels are near Arches National Park , Canyonlands National Park and Dinosaur National Monument .

" Ask not what your country can do for you , ask what you can do for your country , unless the President is Black ! "
I paraphrase , of course , the late and great President John F. Kennedy , who died at the hands of an assassins bullet after being demonized by the far right and it's John Birch Society conspiracy theory cranks .
Of course , if these words were spoken then by an African American President , well , that would have never happened .
African Americans were barely citizens , barely had the right to vote or sit in a white man 's restaurant , let alone run for or win the Presidency , but one could imagine that if an African American President at the time had said the same quote as JFK , it would be followed by the Republican addendum , unless the President is Black ! " .
In only 7 months , 7 Damned Months we have seen the following blatant acts of racism and race baiting by the Republican party , and not once , NOT ONCE , has a single adult among them stood up and said ENOUGH OF THIS , I WILL NOT ALLOW IT .
Not once .
The evidence to the GOP 's racism and racist projection is both prolific and obvious .
Wonkette notes that a racist e-mail was sent out by a legislative staffer for Tennessee GOP state senator Diane Black .
The staffer , Sherplatfvormri Goforth , e-mailed this composite picture of the country ’s 44 presidents , which represents President Obama with only a set of eyes : thinkprogress.org
Of course , America 's So Called Liberal Media / Right Wing Noise Machine has had it's own hand in the racism / race baiting game , including the perpetuation of the birthers by Fox and CNN's Lou Dobbs , who tipped his own so called Independant hand in this Gods awful moment .
CNN ’s Lou Dobbs stopped by the booth and exclaimed , " My wife will love this ! "
A photo shows Dobbs with a box of the mix in his hand .

GOP politicians have not been ashamed of themselves enough to bite their tongues either .
They praise right wing terrorists , they advocate violence and the threat of violence against those whom they oppose , they refuse to tell their base to act like adults and civilized people , and their base just goes farther and farther every day .
" I Want My Country White Back !!!!! "
And the media does not call it out , other than a few hours a night on MSNBC .
Instead , they ignore or encourage it .
Limbaugh plays " Barack the Magic Negro " on his show
Limbaugh calls Sotomayor , POTUS Obama Racist
The master of the RWNM and the GOP 's official mouthpiece , of course , is Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation , and it's television propaganda arm , Fox News , who did n't even wait for Barack Obama to win the Presidency before they played the race baiting charge , a card they keep hidden up their sleeve in order to cheat the American electorate out of a intelligent political conversation every chance they get .
After the fair and free election where Americans overwhelmingly rejected the Republicans candidates and elected President Barack Hussein Obama , the GOP 's media propaganda arm did n't stop the racism there .
They can't help themselves .
It is who they are .
It defines them .
And , of course , the coup de grâce
" This guy ( President Obama ) , is , I believe , a racist . "
And this is ONLY after 7 months into the first African Americans Presidency in US History .
There is much I have missed and certainly more and worse to come .
This makes me SICK AND MAD AS HELL , and it should make you mad , too .
By refusing to denounce and fire Glenn Beck , Fox News and News Corp has chosen to endorse Glenn Beck 's racist projection and race baiting .
By refusing to denounce racist statements made by their own party members , the GOP has chosen to endorse racism and race baiting .
The only national African American figure , RNC Chairman Michael Steele , in the Republican party who might take offense at this has chosen to turn a blind eye to this racism .
I wonder if Micheal understands that the moment he stands up to this blatant and obvious racism he is out on his ass .
Fortunatly for Mr. Steele
I am sure his landing will be cushioned by the big fat wallet in his back pocket .
It is obvious by now that one of the main objections to this President that his opposition has is rooted in his skin color and his ethnic heritage .
The fact that he is Black has " broke their brains " , thuugh , one must assume the average Republican still has a brain if they are hanging on to the elephants corpse still .
To deny this is naïve and / or foolish .
I deeply dislike the phrase it is what it is , but it is .
It is racist and the endorsement of racism .
It is proof positive that the Republican party is racist and condones racism as a part of their political platform .
To quote one Kossacks screen name Silence Is Complicity , and in this and many other cases , the GOP is guilty as hell .
So , let 's decode the Conservative message if we can .
Obama is going to spread the wealth around , to lazy minorities like President Obama
Obama is a reverse racist and hates white people , because he is black and hates everyone who is n't like him , just like you .
Obama is a socialist who will give your hard earned money to brown people just like him .
Obama is NOT an American citizen , but in fact is a Kenyan and you can tell just by looking at him .
Obama is a fascist Nazi who wants to kill your grandmother , baby in a death panel and take all control in a violent tyranny that will kill millions and millions and end freedom tommorrowbecause we all know that people like him are violent .
Of course , I do n't hold these views myself .
This is just my poor attempt to peek into the shrinking minds of the few Republicans who are left in the GOP , an increasingly southern , old , white and uneducated party who is now encouraging parents to keep their children home from scholl instead of subjecting them to a speech by a Black President .
Amazingly , wingnut and OBVIOUSLY WHITE parents are going to oblige .
Why ?
Maybe it is because they can't trust their children with someone like that .
And all the non white children who go to school that day and do n't see as many white students as they will the rest of the school year will know why .
They may not know why exactly , but they will know .
Maybe the first questions we should ask Republicans when we engage them in conversation is how they feel about President Obama .
I have a feeling their answer will tell us quite a bit about them and how they really feel .
So , as the elected GOP officials , the Right Wing Media outlets and Republican voters calls the legitamatly elected ( unlike President George W. Bush { R / War Criminal - Texastan} President Obama a
A Cult of Personality
Elitist
Secret Muslim
Socialist
Communist
Marxist
Fascist
Nazi
Tyrant
Authoritarian
Oligar(c ) h
Kenyan
Racist
Reverse racist
UnAmerican
Terrorist friendly
FEMA camp planning
Traitor
and Non American citizen
And worst of all as our fellow Kossack Vyan so clearly points Obama is a damn dirty Liberal
and who knows whatever hell the else they 'll be calling him tommorrow , a week from now , a month from now or a year from now ,
Just put in the one word they will NEVER speak except by accident , the one word we ALL KNOW is behind all the other names , the one word they dare not speak , and if one should , it will certainly go without consequences as Republicans and their voters sit silent , but their children will know , and they will not need it to be explained .
The children are the closest thing to adults in that party .
and that word is soooo ugly I will not repeat it myself , once is too much .
My advice to you , Republican voters , elected officials and the right wing media , can be summed up in six simple words .
GROW UP AND GET OVER IT !

I 'm surprised this has n't gotten more attention .
But imagine for a moment that the opt - out public option passes and becomes law ( I give it a 65 percent chance at this point ) .
Then what happens ?
Well , there has to be a debate in every state in which Republicans , where they hold a majority or the governorship , will presumably decide to deny their own voters the option to get a cheaper health insurance plan .
When others in other states can get such a plan , will there not be pressure on the GOP to help their own base ?
Wo n't Bill O'Reilly 's gaffe - when he said what he believed rather than what Roger Ailes wants him to say - be salient ?
Wo n't many people - many Republican voters - actually ask : why can't I have what they 're having ?
This is why this is lethal .
The argument against new entitlements requires a macro - level perspective .
You have to argue that although a measure may help an individual get something she would n't otherwise have - like adequate and reliable , if barebones , health insurance - its consequences will come back to haunt us all .
You have to remind people that money does n't grow on trees , that in the long run , more government involvement might hurt healthcare excellence , that you just need to rely on the wonderful private sector to deliver the goods in a more market - friendly way .
This is always a tough sell because it requires voters to put abstract concerns over practical short - term gains .
It 's why conservatism always has a tough time in welfare state democracies .
It began with a knock on the door .
Cameron Crowe turned the knob , and there was Lowell Marchant , a beaming 19 - year - old freshly relocated from Arkansas to Los Angeles .
“ It ’s a pleasure to be here in California , ” he told Crowe .
“ I ’m a kickboxer .
Do you know about kickboxing ?
It ’s the sport of the future . ”
To anyone who ’s passed through adolescence in the last 20 years , that brief recollection is enough to pinpoint the source for Lloyd Dobler , the gallant , determined and , yes , kickboxing hero of Crowe ’s directorial debut , “ Say Anything . . . , ” which
Fox will release next week in a deluxe Blu-ray edition to commemorate its landmark anniversary .
Played by John Cusack , whose performance cemented his status as the thinking teenager ’s heartthrob , Lloyd is a rebel without an attitude , an individualist because he can conceive of being nothing else .
Lots of guys have crushes on comely valedictorian Diane Court ( Ione Skye ) , but Lloyd is the only one to successfully ask her out .
When one awe - struck classmate inquires what kind of man can accomplish such a feat , he says simply , “ I ’m Lloyd Dobler . ”
On its initial release , “ Say Anything . . . ” was put forth as a teen movie , part of a clutch of post - John Hughes high school pictures .
But contemporary critics saw deeper truths beneath its surface .
Pauline Kael , nearing the end of her tenure at the New Yorker , said it conveyed the sense that Lloyd “ stands for something , like Jacques Tati ’s Mr. Hulot . ”

Crowe still recalls reading her review in a Seattle mall .
“ I could n’t believe how much she understood about our intentions , and she picked out my favorite scene in the movie , when Lloyd tape - records a ‘ heartbreak tour ’ of his doomed love affair with Diane , ” he said .
“ It was a body rush to read that review and to have made it under the wire as one of the last few rounds of films she reviewed . ”
With 1982 ’s “ Fast Times at Ridgemont High , ” Crowe had established himself as a screenwriter capable of capturing the reality of young people ’s lives , and Cusack had earned his romantic - lead stripes in 1985 ’s “ The Sure Thing . ”
But on 1989 ’s “ Say Anything . . . ” their voices came through with unprecedented clarity .
Cusack had sworn off teen movies before Crowe sent him the script , but his “ Eight Men Out ” costar John Mahoney advised him to look it over .
“ I remember telling him , ‘ John , you have to read this script , ’ ” said Mahoney , who ended up playing Skye ’s morally flawed father .
“ He said , ‘ No , I ’m all done playing teenagers .
I ’ve gotta move on . ’
And then when I went to my audition , there he was . ”
Cusack could not be reached for comment at press time .

Crowe courted Cusack assiduously , giving him substantial input into the character , who as a result was like nothing Cusack had done before .
Lloyd has a nervous , jittery energy that invades his body and his speech , which pours forth in great unedited torrents .
If not playing himself , Cusack seemed to be tapping into something deeper than in his previous movies .
As Mahoney puts it , “ he found his Cusackness . ”
“ The parts we ’d seen him in before , it was like John was bringing everything to the character , but it ’s like John and Lloyd met each other halfway , ” said Lili Taylor , who played the small but unforgettable role of Lloyd ’s friend Corey , a brokenhearted woman who has written dozens of songs about the same unfaithful ex-boyfriend .
“ The thing with John is that his impulses are really alive , and Lloyd was a perfect vehicle to bring out all of John ’s strength as an actor . ”
Taylor and Cusack had studied acting together in Chicago , along with Jeremy Piven and several other members of the cast , which added a dose of collegiality to the set .
“ I was young , they were all my friends , we met this cool guy Cameron Crowe who had just written ‘ Fast Times , ’ ” Taylor said .
“ I still have a real fondness for the whole thing , and I ’m not surprised that it ’s stayed around this long . ”
Unlike Cusack , Skye was playing a character who was her virtual opposite .
Diane is , in Crowe ’s words , a “ golden girl , ” whose close - knit relationship with her single father is upended when he is revealed to have spent years skimming money from the residents of his nursing home .
Skye ’s father is the psychedelic folk singer Donovan .

“ I did feel very different , ” she said .
“ I was n’t a good student .
I grew up with my mother , not my father .
I kind of had a wild childhood .
Even the father stealing money from old people , I was saying to Cameron , ‘ I ca n’t access why this would upset me . ’
That did n’t seem bad to me at the time . ”
Skye has played characters closer to her heart , notably in the 1986 cult classic “ River ’s Edge ” and 1992 ’s “ Gas , Food Lodging , ” but when she needs to explain to people what she does for a living , she sends them to “ Say Anything .
. . . ”
The film ’s staying power might have something to do with some of its most memorable moments being drawn from real life :
The scene where Diane unexpectedly dumps Lloyd in his own car , for example , was inspired by Crowe ’s own history of heartbreak .
“ I learned something important about what it is to write personally , about things that matter to you , and over time it ’s been obvious that people respond the most to exactly that , the stuff that ’s on the edge of being too personal to even write , ” Crowe said .

Crowe did n’t intend to make “ Say Anything . . . ” his directorial debut and stepped into the role only after one potential director kept breaking off their phone meeting to yell at a Lakers game .
But 20 years later , it ’s his favorite of the movies he ’s made .
“ It ’s a very personal movie , and it reminds me of falling in love , falling out of love , and falling back in love with life and all the unexpected glories and pain that happen along the way , ” he said .

There are no electrical outlets on the moon .
No power cables either , no transmission towers , no grid , no generating plants .
So when astronauts arrive sometime after 2020 for long - term occupation , they 'll have to bring their power system with them .
During the three - day stays of the Apollo era , batteries and fuel cells did the job .
But NASA is planning much longer and more ambitious missions this time around , with crews of at least four living and working on the moon for weeks or months at a stretch .
They 'll need electricity for everything from shavers and computers to heaters and lights for the long , frigid lunar nights .
Engineers at NASA's
in Cleveland are leading work on a possible solution : an ultra -compact nuclear power plant that can run for eight years or longer without maintenance , and can make more than enough electricity to meet the daily needs of the average American house .
The whole rig could fold up to fit in a tractor - trailer with room to spare .
The heart of the system is a reactor no bigger than an office trash bin .
" Unfortunately , we can't send up a big extension cord from Earth , " said Lee Mason , a Glenn mechanical engineer and the principal investigator for the fission surface power project .
" Our job is to bring up the [ electrical ] outlet for the crew , and all the things that have to go behind that . "
Project members want to prevent a repeat of the Apollo 13 crisis in 1970 , when the command module , its fuel cells crippled by an explosion , almost ran out of power to keep the crew alive as they struggled to return to Earth .
" We do n't ever want to put astronauts in that situation again , " said Don Palac , the fission power project 's manager .
" We want them to have an excess of power – what we call a power - rich environment .
We think we owe that to future space explorers . "
The lunar outpost 's design is still evolving , and NASA 's overall human space exploration program is in flux as the White House and Congress wrestle with the cost of building new spacecraft to send astronauts to the moon and Mars .
Space agency planners wo n't decide for several years yet what kind of facilities astronauts will occupy while on the moon 's surface .
A pair of internal reviews next year of NASA 's lunar exploration strategy , along with input from the space agency 's international partners and data from a NASA satellite looking for evidence of frozen water on the moon , will help determine the outpost 's scope , said Pat George , the Glenn - based manager of NASA 's lunar surface power systems .
That decision , in turn , will dictate how much electricity lunar explorers need , and how it will be generated .
One scenario is to send crews to multiple landing sites , using each landing craft as a temporary base and relying on rovers to explore nearby surroundings .
Another concept involves picking a single location of major scientific interest – possibly the
, where permanently shadowed impact craters deeper than the Grand Canyon may hold frozen water – and setting up a large , semi-permanent habitat .
Visiting astronaut crews would swap in and out , as they do now on the International Space Station .
Initially , they would build living and working quarters .
Later they would conduct science experiments , and mine the surface for rocket fuel ingredients , oxygen and raw building materials .
The larger , busier and more permanent the outpost , the greater its power demands .
NASA figures it will need at least a continuous 35 kilowatts to operate equipment , keep batteries charged and maintain a shirtsleeve environment in a place where there 's no air , and temperatures swing from daytime highs hotter than boiling water to nighttime lows of minus 300 degrees .
Solar power seems an obvious choice .
It 's a well - understood technology in use on many spacecraft .
Sunlight collection does n't pose a problem ; lunar days are nearly a month long , and there are no clouds to block the sun 's rays .
But nights on the moon are long , too – about 350 hours long .
Some areas near the poles never get direct sunlight at all .
During lengthy dark periods , an outpost would have to get by on battery power .
Batteries are heavy , and every pound on a cargo rocket to the moon costs big money .
They 'd also have to be able to reliably charge and discharge many hundreds of times .
So NASA is studying options in addition to solar , and has turned to the Glenn center because of its expertise in designing space power systems .
About 10 Glenn engineers , working with colleagues at the U.S. Department of Energy , NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala. , and industry partners , have a preliminary design of a lunar nuclear power system and are already testing some of its components .
The nuclear micro-plant wo n't come cheap .
Team members estimate it will cost NASA $ 1.5 billion to fully develop and manufacture the first production model if the space agency chooses to go with nuclear power on the moon .
That 's about 1 percent of the $ 119 billion price tag through 2020 for NASA 's overall Constellation program to design and build new rockets , spacecraft and hardware for exploring the moon .
" In that context , this [ fission power ] system is pretty small to provide an important commodity , " Mason said .
Here 's the Glenn - led team 's basic plan :
The small reactor would be buried about 6 feet deep in the lunar soil and shielded with a plug made of boron carbide , a material that blocks radiation as effectively as lead but is much lighter .
Splitting uranium atoms in the reactor 's core would release energy in the form of heat , as much as 1,200 degrees .
A couple of gallons of liquid metal – probably sodium or a sodium / potassium mix – piped around the core would transfer that heat energy to four Stirling engines mounted on a metal truss above the reactor .
The Stirling engines
, driving an alternator that makes electricity .
Together , the engines should put out 40 kilowatts .
Waste heat would be absorbed by coolant and pumped through a series of radiator panels that unfurl from the truss like giant bat wings .
The fully extended panels would be 100 feet long , but when folded they 're less than 5 .
The whole system would weigh 11,000 pounds , about as much as a fully armored Humvee .
NASA 's Altair lunar lander conceivably could haul two at a time to the surface .
" The idea is to deliver [ the nuclear power plant ] in this nice , compact , stowed configuration , and once you install the reactor in the hole , you can deploy the radiators , " said Mason .
" You can do it remotely from Earth , or from the habitat on the moon .
It 's meant to be a very simple setup . "
The 40 kilowatts of electricity is a fraction of the yield of a typical commercial nuclear plant on Earth .
The tiny lunar reactor is capable of more ; during its eight - year lifespan it will use up less than 1 percent of its fuel .
But the designers have sacrificed greater power output for simplicity and safety .
" The DOE guys call this a dog of a reactor , " Palac said .
" It 's sort of motoring along at idle , practically , and you do n't have to watch it . "
To further ensure the lunar fission plant 's reliability , the Glenn and Marshall centers and DOE are testing parts of it under the harsh operating conditions it would encounter on the moon .
In one Glenn lab , pressurized 440 - degree water shoots through nine titanium pipes like those that would shed heat from the power plant 's radiators .
The heat pipes are as long and thin as pool cues .
The 24 - hour - a - day durability test has been underway for three years , and will last at least another eight .
Nearby , in a
the size of an airplane cabin , Glenn engineers recently set up one of the radiator panels , then pumped out the chamber 's air and dialed down the thermostat to minus 150 degrees .
Despite the brutal , airless cold , the radiator panel and its plumbing worked properly , getting rid of the required amount of heat .
In two years , Glenn engineers will run a much larger - scale test .
They 'll assemble a working portion of the power plant inside a vacuum chamber .
The heat will come from an electric - powered dummy reactor , not the real thing .
But the rest of the rig – the liquid metal coolant , two Stirling engines and six radiator panels – is supposed to function like it would on the moon , cranking out about 10 kilowatts .
The experiment will judge how well the components work together while simulated conditions in the chamber switch from lunar day to night .
Future testing of the nuclear reactor would not take place at the Glenn center ; it would be done at one of the DOE 's labs .
The proposal for a nuclear - powered lunar outpost is n't NASA 's first foray into using fission reactors in space .
During the 1960s , the space agency worked with the Atomic Energy Commission and a company called Atomics International to develop compact reactors that could power satellites .
The program was called
, or SNAP .
On April 3 , 1965 , a rocket carrying a small reactor , SNAP 10A , lifted off from California 's Vandenberg Air Force Base .
For 43 day as it circled the globe , the reactor steadily churned out more than 600 watts of power .
An electrical system failure prompted the reactor 's shutdown .
It remains in orbit , the only such nuclear reactor flight test the government has conducted .
NASA acknowledges the political sensitivities and safety issues of launching a nuclear - powered device like the proposed lunar power plant .
According to declassified documents , the president would have to approve such flights .
Protestors unsuccessfully tried to stop NASA 's 1997 launch of Cassini , a Saturn probe carrying 72 pounds of radioactive plutonium fuel .
( The plutonium generates a tiny amount of electricity from the heat of nuclear decay , not fission . )
" We 're not naive to think that there wo n't be people who are concerned " about the possibility of sending a fission reactor to the moon , said Mason .
The proposed design locks down the reactor 's controls during flight , preventing a nuclear chain reaction from starting unintentionally , he said .
" There is no launch accident scenario that would cause this reactor to go critical and start producing radiation . "
The radiation level of the reactor 's individual uranium dioxide fuel pins is low enough that they can be safely hand - held , Palac said .
If the rocket carrying the reactor exploded , its nuclear fuel would be dispersed , he said , and the remnants , although they would require cleanup , would not exceed normal background radiation levels .
Palac said he hopes people will react to the project like his wife 's aunt , a member of several environmental groups .
He 'd been worried about her response to his research , and described it obliquely as developing fission surface power for the moon ..
" She said , ' Oh , you mean nuclear , ' " Palac recalled .
" She said , ' You know , nuclear power has tremendous potential to be a solution to our global energy crisis , and how wonderful you 're taking it to outer space , where I 'm sure it 's even more useful . '
I was blown away by that . "
Netflix continues its domination of the video streaming market by partnering with Sony to bring its service to the PS3 .
The two companies announced Monday that Netflix's " thousands " of movies and TV shows will be streamable to the PS3 as of November 2009 , and at no extra cost to Netflix members .
Though the implementation is a little less than ideal , the partnership will solidify Netflix 's spot as the go - to service for on - demand streaming .
The arrangement is " less than ideal " because PS3 users will have to insert an " instant streaming disc " into their consoles before they can take advantage of Netflix 's streaming content .
The disc uses BD - Live , which allows Blu-ray discs to pull down content from the Internet — basically , the Netflix player wo n't be native on the PS3 operating system , but will run within the device 's Blu-ray player software .
It does n't take a genius to observe that this is noticeably less polished than Netflix 's implementation on the Xbox , for example — content can be accessed through an Xbox dashboard application without the need to insert a disc or do anything that involves getting up out of that comfy dent in the couch .
As pointed out by Zatz Not Funny , this was probably to get the solution to market as soon as humanly possible , but may also have been chosen in order to avoid making Sony too much as a middleman .
Either way , having to an insert a disc means one extra step that will take this feature from " welcome " to " slightly irksome . "
This may not be the case forever , though .
The two companies predicated the news by saying that this would only be the case " initially , " indicating that the PS3 might still get native Netflix streaming sometime in the future .
Indeed , this appears to be the case after we spoke with Netflix spokesperson Chris Garrity .
" Netflix members and PS3 owners have really wanted a way to instantly watch movies and TV episodes streamed from Netflix via the PS3 system .
The instant streaming disc represented the fastest and easiest way to let them so this , " Garrity told Ars .
" Late next year we expect to have an embedded solution available for PS3s via a system software update slated for release through the PlayStation Network . "
The move is not only meant to make PS3 fanboys happy , though — Netflix is also trying stay a step ahead of the competition .
With online video giant Hulu considering charging for content — possibly on a subscription basis like Netflix — it 's possible that the two companies could be competing more directly in the near future .
Netflix certainly has a distribution advantage , though , with its streaming content going to numerous set - top boxes already ( Xbox , TiVo , Roku , and now PS3 ) , while Hulu has repeatedly tried to shut out non-computer browsing from consoles and media centers .

Bell Aliant Regional Communications , Limited Partnership and Bell Canada – Applications to introduce usage - based billing and other changes to Gateway Access Services
File number : Bell Aliant Tariff Notice 242
Bell Canada Tariff Notice 7181
The Commission approves on an interim basis , with one change , Bell Aliant 's and Bell Canada 's requests to introduce , for Gateway Access Services , two new speed options , usage - based billing rates , and a charge for excessive usage .
Introduction
1. On 13 March 2009 , Bell Aliant Regional Communications , Limited Partnership ( Bell Aliant ) and Bell Canada ( collectively , the Bell companies ) applied to introduce , for their Gateway Access Services ( GAS ) , 1 two new speed options , usage - based billing ( UBB ) rates , an excessive usage charge , and an uncorrelated usage charge .
2. The Commission received submissions from Acanac Inc. , Accelerated Connections Inc. , AOL Canada , Aventures en Excellence Inc. , the Canadian Association of Internet Providers , the Coalition of Internet Service Providers inc. , Cybersurf Corp. , Distributel Communications Limited , EGATE Networks Inc. , Electronic Box , Execulink Telecom Inc. , l'Union des consommateurs , Managed Network Systems , Inc. , MTS Allstream Inc. , the Ontario Telecommunications Association , Primus Telecommunications Canada Inc. , TekSavvy Solutions Inc. , Telnet Communications , Vaxination Informatique , and Yak Communications ( Canada ) Corp. ( collectively , the intervenors ) .
The Commission also received a large number of comments , mostly from individuals ; these submissions generally opposed the Bell companies ' applications .
3 . On 5 June 2009 , the Bell companies provided reply comments .
On 16 July 2009 , they filed cost studies in support of their applications .
2
4 . The public record of this proceeding is available on the Commission 's website at www.crtc.gc.ca under " Public Proceedings " or by using the file numbers provided above .
Issues
5 . The Commission has identified the following four issues to be addressed at this stage in the proceeding to consider the Bell companies ' applications :
I . Should the proposed additional GAS speed options be approved on an interim basis ?
II .
Should the proposed UBB rating structure for GAS be approved on an interim basis ?
III .
Should the proposed excessive usage charge for GAS be approved on an interim basis ?
IV .
Should the proposed uncorrelated usage charge for GAS be approved on an interim basis ?
I . Should the proposed additional GAS speed options be approved on an interim basis ?
6 . The Bell companies proposed to introduce a new speed option for GAS - Residence with speeds of up to 2 megabits per second ( Mbps ) downstream and up to 800 kilobits per second ( Kbps ) upstream .
They also proposed to introduce a new speed option for GAS - Business with speeds of up to 1 Mbps downstream and up to 640 Kbps upstream .
The Bell companies submitted that these new speed options will ensure that their retail Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line ( ADSL ) speeds provided over their legacy Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks are available to wholesale customers , where there is wholesale demand for such speeds , consistent with Telecom Decision 2008 - 117 and Telecom Order 2009 - 111 ( the matching speed decisions ) .
Certain intervenors objected to the Bell companies ' proposal to match only those retail service speeds provisioned on their legacy networks .
7. The Commission considers that the Bell companies ' proposal to introduce the new GAS speed options under consideration is consistent with the matching speed decisions .
Accordingly , the Commission approves on an interim basis the Bell companies ' proposed new speed options and rates for each of GAS - Residence and GAS - Business .
II .
Should the proposed UBB rating structure for GAS be approved on an interim basis ?
8 . The Bell companies submitted that , consistent with their three - pronged approach to managing the current significant increase in Internet usage , 3 they began transitioning their retail Internet service customers to a form of UBB in 2006 , and that a significant number of their retail customers were on UBB plans at the end of 2008 .
9 . The Bell companies submitted that their UBB proposal for GAS was consistent with the principle that the Commission established in Telecom Decision 2006 - 77 when it approved UBB for incumbent cable carriers ' third - party Internet access ( TPIA ) service .
4
The Bell companies also submitted that , because the Commission had approved UBB for TPIA service , considerations of regulatory symmetry between incumbent telephone carriers and incumbent cable carriers supported approval of their proposal .
10 .
Intervenors made a number of submissions with respect to the Bell companies ' UBB proposal , including that ( a ) current GAS rates already recover service costs and ( b ) the proposal is not revenue - neutral .
Intervenors submitted that the UBB proposal should apply only with respect to GAS customers ' new end -users .
They submitted further that the proposal is anti-competitive and unduly preferential , contrary to subsection 27 ( 2 ) of the Telecommunications Act ( the Act ) .
11 . Intervenors argued that ( a ) a preview UBB program for GAS customers conducted by the Bell companies in December 2008 provided inaccurate billing data , ( b ) GAS customers had difficulty reconciling the Bell companies ' data with their data , and ( c ) the Bell companies should provide GAS customers with their end - users ' log - in information ( end- user name ) to permit GAS customers to reconcile all of the Bell companies ' UBB information with their information .
Internet service providers ( ISPs ) also submitted that they did not know the specifics of the Bell companies ' proposal regarding UBB for GAS until the companies had filed the tariff notices under consideration .
Intervenors also submitted that it would be premature and inappropriate to dispose of the Bell companies ' applications before decisions are made in various other ongoing proceedings , including the proceeding initiated by Telecom Public Notice 2008 - 19 ( the Internet Traffic Management proceeding ) .
12 . With respect to submissions made that their UBB proposal is anti-competitive and not revenue - neutral , the Bell companies replied that the GAS customers ' retail rate structure does not have to replicate their GAS rate structure , that revenue neutrality is not required , and that the point of their UBB proposal is to encourage GAS customers ' end -users to match their usage to their willingness to pay for that usage .
The Bell companies also submitted that implementing their UBB proposal only for new end -users of GAS customers would require separate billing arrangements which would be costly to implement .
The Bell companies submitted that any preference towards their own retail customers who remain on flat - rated billing plans is not substantial and undue , and that these plans are not available to new customers .
13 . The Bell companies further replied that inaccurate data in preview billing would have been infrequent and that they had reviewed errors in order to prevent their reoccurrence .
With respect to the reconciliation of the Bell companies ' provided data and GAS customer data regarding GAS customers ' end -users , the Bell companies submitted that they had always provided end - user data on a working telephone number ( WTN ) basis and that this had not presented a problem to date .
They also submitted that it would be costly and complex for them to develop a way to associate log - in information with WTNs for UBB purposes , and that their GAS customers should be able to keep records of their end - users '
WTNs .
With respect to submissions regarding advance notice of their UBB proposal , the Bell companies replied that their GAS customers had advance notice of their proposal , and thus had time to prepare .
14 . Subject to the consideration below , in the Commission 's view , approving the Bell companies ' proposal to introduce UBB for GAS would be consistent with Telecom Decision 2006 - 77 in that UBB would apply to both their retail Internet and wholesale GAS .
Further , with respect to regulatory symmetry , in the Commission 's view , approving the Bell companies ' UBB proposal for GAS would be consistent with its approval of UBB for the incumbent cable carriers ' TPIA services .
15 . The Commission considers , however , that GAS customers would require time to prepare for the implementation of UBB , including time to adapt their business plans and billing systems and to manage their relationships with their end -customers .
The Commission considers that a period of 90 days from the date of this order would be appropriate for this purpose .
16 . The Commission notes the Bell companies ' proposal that UBB would apply in relation to all GAS customers ' end -users , both existing and new .
The Commission also notes the Bell companies ' submission that it would be costly and administratively cumbersome to apply UBB charges only in respect of new end -users of GAS customers , as intervenors requested .
In the Commission 's view , given the size and complexity of these services , it would be impractical for the Bell companies to implement separate billing arrangements for new and existing end - users ' of GAS customers .
The Commission finds that the Bell companies ' UBB proposal , while discriminating against GAS customers because it would not apply to the Bell companies ' retail customers who are not on UBB plans , is not unjustly discriminatory .
17 . With respect to intervenors ' other submissions , the Commission considers that the Bell companies have provided an adequate response at this time for the purpose of disposing of their applications on an interim basis .
18 . Accordingly , the Commission approves on an interim basis the Bell companies ' requests to introduce UBB for GAS , effective 90 days from the date of this order .
III .
Should the proposed excessive usage charge for GAS be approved on an interim basis ?
19 .
The Bell companies proposed an excessive usage charge of $ 0.75 per additional gigabytes ( GBs ) in excess of 300 GB of monthly usage for a GAS customer 's end - user if , and when , they introduce a corresponding $ 1.00 charge per GB in excess of 300 GB for their retail customers on UBB plans .
The Bell companies proposed to notify the Commission if , and when , they apply this proposed charge to their retail services .
Intervenors submitted that such a charge would give the Bell companies an undue preference because it would not be applied to the Bell companies ' retail customers who are not on UBB plans .
20 .
The Commission notes that the Bell companies would apply the proposed excessive usage charge to GAS customers in respect of their end - users only if , and when , the Bell companies apply this charge to their own retail customers who are on UBB plans .
The proposed charge would therefore represent a new charge with respect to all customers who are on UBB plans , whether they are retail or wholesale customers of the Bell companies .
The Commission finds that the Bell companies ' excessive usage charge proposal , while discriminating against GAS customers because it would not apply to the Bell companies ' retail customers who are not on UBB plans , is not unjustly discriminatory .
21 . Accordingly , the Commission approves on an interim basis the Bell companies ' proposed excessive usage charge , effective the date that the Bell companies notify the Commission in writing that they apply an excessive usage charge of $ 1.00 per GB in excess of 300 GB to all their retail customers on UBB plans .
IV .
Should the proposed uncorrelated usage charge for GAS be approved on an interim basis ?
22 . The Bell companies submitted that in some instances they cannot correlate Internet usage that has been authenticated by a particular GAS - ISP 's end - user with a specific line to which that end - user subscribed .
The Bell companies considered such actions as intentional measures undertaken by the end - user to evade payment for valid usage .
They submitted that the ISP that authenticates such a session should be accountable for the usage , and proposed an uncorrelated usage charge for their GAS of $ 1.875 per GB or portion thereof , to be applied on a monthly basis .
23 . Intervenors submitted that uncorrelated usage can occur for various legitimate reasons , and argued that the proposed charge is too high .
The Bell companies replied that , in their view , most if not all uncorrelated usage is a result of some GAS - ISPs ' end - users attempting to evade payment for usage .
They submitted that the charge will not affect most end -users of its GAS customers .
The Bell companies submitted further that what they described as a premium rate is justified by the extra costs they incur to determine which GAS - ISP 's end -users are responsible for uncorrelated usage .
24 . Before making its decision on the proposed uncorrelated usage charge , the Commission requires further information ( for example , the specifics of the circumstances in which uncorrelated usage occurs ) .
Accordingly , the Commission intends to rule on this aspect of the Bell companies ' proposal following further process .
Policy Direction
25 . The Commission considers that its determinations in this order advance the telecommunications policy objectives set out in paragraphs 7 ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( f ) of the Act . 5
The Commission further considers that its determinations are consistent with the Policy Direction6 requirements that ( a ) the measures in question be efficient and proportionate to their purposes , and that they minimally interfere with competitive market forces to meet the above policy objectives , and ( b ) the measures neither deter economically efficient competitive entry into the market nor promote economically inefficient entry .
Conclusions
26 . The Commission approves on an interim basis the Bell companies ' proposed two new GAS speed options and rates .
The Commission also approves on an interim basis their proposal to introduce UBB for GAS , effective 90 days from the date of this order .
The Commission further approves on an interim basis their proposal to introduce an excessive usage charge for GAS of $ 0.75 per GB in excess of 300 GB , effective the date the Bell companies notify the Commission in writing that they apply an excessive usage charge of $ 1.00 per GB in excess of 300 GB to all their retail customers on UBB plans .
27 . Further , interrogatories will be addressed to the Bell companies and additional process will be established shortly .

Noel Edmonds ' spokesman said the star was protesting against congestion
Presenter Noel Edmonds has admitted driving his personal taxi in Bristol bus lanes - to " help " other drivers .
The Deal Or No Deal host was spotted using the red lanes in his unlicensed black cab , which has a sign on the back saying " action against time - thieves " .
Edmonds ' spokesman Mark Borkowski said Mr Edmonds was being " slightly cheeky " .
He added : " Perhaps by getting out of clogged , congested traffic lanes and getting into the bus lane , clearly he 's helping people who are clogged up . "
Mr Borkowski said by using empty bus lanes Edmonds was also making a point about the congested state of Bristol roads .
He was seen using the lanes twice in two weeks , his spokesman confirmed .
' Not for celebrities '
The star risked a £ 60 fine if caught by council detection units , which are soon to be activated .
A CCTV bus lane monitoring trial is expected to end later this month , after which fines will be issued .
Bristol City Council transport chief , Jon Rogers , said : " Bus lanes are there for buses , [ licensed ] taxis and cyclists - not for celebrities . "
Edmonds was photographed earlier this month on journeys from his home and the Endemol West studios , in Bristol , where the Deal Or No Deal game show is filmed .
The ' action against time thieves ' sign on Edmonds ' cab is a reference to his campaign against people who waste his time , including time spent in traffic jams .

This graph shows the YoY change in the occupancy rate ( 3 week trailing average ) .
The three week average is off 7.3 % from the same period in 2008 .
The average daily rate is down 8.3 % , and RevPAR is off 13.7 % from the same week last year .
As I noted last week , the comparisons are now easier soon since business travel fell off a cliff last October .
Comparing to the same week two years ago , occupancy rates are off 16.4 % .
Occupancy rates for October in 2006 and 2007 were close to 68 % .

In a blow to ongoing plans by Murdoch ( and others ) to capitalize on premium content , a new study from Forrester shows that 80 % of consumers would not be willing to pay for online news content .
As readers are able to move from one content aggregator to another with greater facility than the Fed prints another billion dollars , Rupert 's approach will likely entail a massive " game theoretical " strategy whereby either all move to a premium model or none do : if even one " defector " remains , it will render the " premium - paid " plan DOA .
Forrester submits :
In the past year , we 've seen a palpable shift from newspaper and magazine publishers with regard to paid content -- they still do n't know how to make paid content work , but they know they want to try .
A recent report from the American Press Institute underscores this trend :
The API reports that 60 % of newspaper executives say they 're considering paid content options , even though currently 90 % do n't charge for any content online .
Consumers , though , have different ideas .
In a new Forrester report , we find that most consumers ( 80 % ) say they would n't bother to access newspaper and magazine content online if it were no longer free ( no surprise ) , and the rest are split about how they 'd like to pay for content :
This data suggests two things :
Publishers should continue to offer free , ad - supported products to the 80 % of consumers who wo n't pay for content online ; and Publishers should offer consumers a choice of multichannel subscriptions , single - channel subscriptions , and micropayments for premium product access .
But one size wo n't fit all — consumers want choice .
The need for a multichannel product and pricing strategy is further reinforced by the " what if " scenario of print being discontinued .
When we asked consumers , " If the publications you read were no longer available in print , how would you prefer to access that content ? " we found that no single channel dominated responses .
Thirty - seven percent of US consumers say they 'd prefer to access content on a Web site , and smaller percentages say they 'd prefer access via portable devices like mobile phones ( 14 % ) , laptops and netbooks ( 11 % ) , or eReaders like the Amazon Kindle ( 3 % ) .
Notably , 10 % say they 'd prefer the anachronistic solution of PDF by email .
Again , this points to the need for publishers to provide consumers with choice :
There 's no one delivery platform , and no one pricing model , that will satisfy all consumers .
Consumer willingness to pay is so modest — and , in general , we find it tends to over - report in surveys — that publishers need to be extremely flexible to accommodate the needs of these precious customers .
While some aggregators of data , most notable Debtwire and its comparable , are able to charge exorbitant amounts of money due to their targeted , highly - focused niches , primarily in the financial arena , it is very unlikely that many will be able to replicate Debtwire 's success at charging up to $ 100,000 a year from subscribers for what amounts to critical , " ahead of the news " data .
And with ad spending continuing its death spiral courtesy of the traditionally wealthy advertisers autos and airlines pulling back , the ad model will likely make it impossible for the massive assortment of online content to continue its existence in the current format .
One strategy : a global roll up of all high margin on - line products ( i.e. , focused blogs ) , which can still be had for a song .
It is surprising that nobody in the mainstream media has considered this yet .
An example whereby Thomson Reuters or News Corp acquires all the blogs covering a unique space , and proceeds to charge nominal fees in addition to collecting ad revenue would likely be a very cash flow positive model .
As M&A activity in the media spece picks up , we expect the blogosphere to become a place where much more acquisitions and roll - ups become the norm as media conglomerates begin positioning for a dominant presence in any one vertical .
According to a BBC report :
A controversial Scottish brewery has launched what it described as the world ’s strongest beer — with a 32 % alcohol content .
Tactical Nuclear Penguin has been unveiled by BrewDog of Fraserburgh .
At its website , BrewDog boasts that its “ ‘ Tactical Nuclear Penguin ’ beats the previous record of 31 % held by German beer brand Schorschbraer . ”
Intended for battlefield use , tactical nuclear weapons pack a significantly lower yield than the heavyweight nukes , which , of course , are known as strategic .
( How the phrase “ strategic ” was appropriated for nuclear weapons is a subject for future post . )
Despite a size intended to facilitate their utilization , tactical nukes are still judged too hot to handle by those nuclear powers that have developed them ( the United States , the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom , and France ) .
If BrewDog ’s new beer was called “ Strategic Nuclear , ” the wary drinker might fear the high alcohol content would lay waste to him , her , or the whole bar .
“ Tactical ” suggests that , if the beer is used judiciously , its effects are manageable .
( The word “ penguin ” in its brand name signifies the amount of time the beer has spent exposed to extreme cold , which apparently boosts the alcohol content . )
The BBC report also mentions that “ BrewDog was previously branded irresponsible for an 18.2 % beer called Tokyo ” — after the World War II bombing ? — “ which it then followed with a low alcohol beer called ” — drum roll , please — “ Nanny State . ”
Clearly this is a company with a sense of humor .
But , too , it ’s a company with a plan .
BrewDog is soliciting 10,000 investors online through a program called Equity for Punks .
The BBC also reports quotes a representative of a group Called Alcohol Focus Scotland named Jack Law , who said : “ We want to know why a brewer would produce a beer almost as strong as whisky . ”
Yeah , and we disarmament advocates want to know why the national defense establishment would produce weapons as strong as nuclear .
One ca n’t help but wonder : Will Schorschbraer seek to redress the brewery balance of power by breaking BrewDog ’s record for alcohol content with the aforementioned Strategic Nuclear beer .
Instead of using cold brewing , it will exponentially increase the alcoholic content with extreme heat — thermonuclear , in fact .
Eventually , the breweries will realize that their high - yield beers are only good for deterrence .
Nobody will be able to drink them without killing themselves .

For the first time , researchers can use infrared spectroscopy to determine what type of bonds protein molecules contain and to identify materials .
The new technique has been sought to overcome several limitations of the current , standard technique .
Credit : Hatice Altug , Electrical Engineering Department , Boston University
( PhysOrg.com ) --
An interdisciplinary team of researchers has created a new , ultra - sensitive technique to analyze life - sustaining protein molecules .
The technique may profoundly change the methodology of biomolecular studies and chart a new path to effective diagnostics and early treatment of complex diseases .
Researchers from Boston University and Tufts University near Boston recently demonstrated an infrared spectroscopy technique that can directly identify the " vibrational fingerprints " of extremely small quantities of proteins , the machinery involved in maintaining living organisms .
The new technique exploits nanotechnology to overcome several limitations of current , conventional techniques used to study biomolecules .
" It allows identification of a protein by directly analyzing its vibrational fingerprint signatures , " said team leader Hatice Altug , an assistant engineering professor at Boston University .
" It may lead to a new toolkit for studying biomolecules . "
The advance is reported in this week 's edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The National Science Foundation supports the research .
Previous bio-molecular study methods commonly use fluorescence spectroscopy , where biomolecules are labeled with very bright fluorescence tags to track how efficiently they interact with each other .
Understanding interactions is important for medical drug research .
Fluorescence spectroscopy is quite sensitive at the single molecule level .
However , the tags can be as big as the biomolecules themselves and interfere with the biomolecular interactions .
" There is currently a need to develop label - free bio-detection technologies , " Altug said .
" Infrared spectroscopy is a label - free method , because if you tune your ‘ eye ' to the infrared frequencies , you can directly see the bio-molecules without any labels . "
Molecules consist of atoms bonded to each other with springs .
Depending on the mass of atoms , how stiff these springs are , or how the atoms ' springs are arranged , the molecules rotate and vibrate at specific frequencies similar to a guitar string that vibrates at specific frequencies depending on the string length .
These resonant frequencies are molecule specific and they mostly occur in the infrared frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum .
The sensitivity of infrared spectroscopy previously had been too low to detect these vibrations , particularly from small quantities of samples .
The new method demonstrated by Altug 's graduate student Ronen Adato and her post - doctoral fellow Ahmet Ali Yanik combines the strengths of nanotechnology and nanophotonics and overcomes the problems that prevented past use of infrared spectroscopy .
" We use arrays of tiny gold nanoparticles as efficient plasmonic nanoantennas to greatly amplify the ability to detect a molecule 's inherent frequency , " says Yanik .
With their technique , the team obtained vibrational signatures from nearly 145 silk proteins deployed at the tip of each nanoantenna .
" Our technique gives researchers an ability to enhance inherent vibrational signatures more than 100,000 times , " says Altug .
" This allows us to sensitively study molecular structures and biological functions of extremely small quantities of molecules . "
Altug anticipates that these new tools someday will help researchers design drugs , minimizing the complications of life - altering diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's .
" This advancement is fundamentally important for bio- chemistry , " she says .
" Our plasmonic method is quite general and can also be adapted to enhance the infrared fingerprints of other molecules than proteins " said Altug .
" It therefore provides a general purpose toolkit and may help amplify chemical sensing capabilities that are of particular concern to national defense . "

After reporting on illegal logging in Cambodia , Radio Free Asia journalist Lem Piseth received an anonymous phone call .
‘ You are insolent , do you want to die ? ’ said the caller .
‘ Why are you insulting me like this ? ’ asked Piseth .
‘ Because of the business of the forest and you should know that there will not be enough land to bury you , ’ replied the caller .
Piseth fled across the border into Thailand .
He was lucky .
Others have not been : Uzbek journalist Solidzhan Abdurakhmanov has been given a 10 - year jail sentence for exposing the ecological destruction of the Aral Sea ; Mikhail Beketov ended up in a coma , and lost a leg and several fingers in an attack after criticising the construction of a motorway between Moscow and St. Petersburg that threatened the Khimki Forest ; Filipino journalist Joey Estriber , who wrote about illegal logging , has been missing since 2006 .
Dangers for activists
It reads like a roll call from warzone reporting .
In fact , it is an accurate reflection of the current dangers of reporting on environmental issues .
The press freedom group , Reporters Without Borders ( RWB ) , has recently released a report entitled ' The dangers for journalists who expose environmental issues ' in an attempt to bring attention to the worsening violence and intimidation .
It says that the companies , criminals and governments profiting from the destruction of the environment see activists and investigative journalists as , ' enemies to be physically eliminated ' .
' In many countries , journalists who specialise in the environment are on the front line of a new war .
The violence to which they are subjected concerns us all .
It reflects the new issues that have assumed an enormous political and geo- strategic importance , ’ says the report .
One of the most troubling stories has been the case of the Filippino journalist Joey Estriber ; he had been critical of ongoing logging in Aurora by companies with allies in the government .
After campaigning to have the permits of nine of these companies withdrawn he was kidnapped by four men .
He has not been seen since .
State clampdown
In Burma , there is less need for such retaliation .
The military government censorship board has suppressed all references to illegal logging making things easier for the Chinese companies logging on a large scale .
In Cambodia , another country with a history of illegal deforestation , Global Witness representatives who had reported on logging that implicated associates of Prime Minister Hun Sen were told by his brother Hun Neng that if any of them returned to the country , he would 'hit them until their heads are broken . '
However , the opposition faced is not always from the most obvious sources .
In many cases even the local population oppose the investigative work of activists and journalists .
The Andean town of La Oroya is the fifth most contaminated place in the world because of a smelting complex operated by Doe Run Peru .
According to the RWB report , its 35,000 inhabitants are permanently exposed to heavy metals and gases , yet none complain .
Anyone talking to representatives of the media risks losing their jobs and social benefits .
What ’s more , Doe Run Peru ’s employees even rejected an ecological rescue plan to be certain of keeping their jobs .
Bloggers threatened
It is not just mainstream journalists that are being threatened either .
The net is cast as far as relatively unknown online writers .
Tamer Mabrouk , an Egyptian blogger , exposed the dumping of untreated waste water into Lake Manzala during 2008 .
He was subsequently sued for libel and fined 6,000 Euros in May 2009 .
He later also lost his job .
Despite the threats and risks they face , activists and journalists are often able to highlight environmental issues that would otherwise remain unknown .
Journalists attacked
Andrew Wasley is a reporter for Eco - Storm , an investigative news agency based in the UK .
In July 2009 , two of his colleagues were attacked and later charged with trespass after filming the slaughter of baby seals in a popular nature reserve on the Namibian coast .
They escaped jail and crucially were able to get their footage back to the UK .
In doing so they raised awareness of cruelty few had realised was an issue in the African country .
Wasley says it is this type of information that is vital for generating political pressure for action .
' If it was n’t for the actions of investigations by activists and journalists the facts behind the problems would n’t be out there .
' The investigations provide the building blocks .
Before you can do anything you need to know the facts about what is going on , ' he said .

2 . Buy a programmable thermostat .
Or , if you already have one , double - check the settings .
Energy Star says that , on average , for an initial investment of $ 50 to $ 100 , you will save $ 180 annually on heating ( and cooling ) bills if in winter you keep the thermostat set to no higher than 70 degrees Fahrenheit when you ’re at home and awake and no more than 62 degrees when you ’re away or asleep .
Energy Star–qualified models come with preprogrammed settings .
While you ’re at it , check the batteries in your smoke alarms and carbon - monoxide detectors .
1 . Tune up your heating system .
For about $ 80 to $ 100 , a technician will inspect your furnace or heat pump to be sure the system is clean and in good repair so that it can achieve its manufacturer - rated efficiency .
The inspection also measures carbon - monoxide leakage .
And you minimize the chance of being 200th in line for repairs on the coldest day of the year .
Look for a heating and air - conditioning contractor that belongs to the Air Conditioning Contractors of America ( www.acca.org), employs technicians certified by the North American Technician Excellence ( NATE ) program , and follows the protocol for ACCA ’s “ national standard for residential maintenance ” ( or the “ QM , ” short for quality maintenance ) , says Wes Davis , manager of technical services at ACCA .
As winter nears , it ’s time to prepare your home for cold weather .
These steps , at least some of which most homeowners can do themselves , will lower your utility bills and protect your investment .
3 . Hit the roof .
Or at least scan it closely with binoculars .
Look for damaged , loose or missing shingles that may leak during winter ’s storms or from melting snow .
If need be , hire a handyman to repair a few shingles ( $ 95 to $ 125 , according to www.costhelper.com) or a roofer for a larger section ( $ 100 to $ 350 for a 10 - by - 10 - square - foot area ) .
Check and repair breaks in the flashing seals around vent stacks and chimneys , too .

If your roof is flat and surfaced with asphalt and pebbles , as many are in the Southwest , rake or blow off fall leaves and pine needles , which hold moisture , says Bill Richardson , president of the American Society of Home Inspectors , in Albuquerque .
( Do n’t sweep aside the pebbles ; that will expose the asphalt to damaging sunlight . )
4. Caulk around windows and doors .
Richardson says that if the gap is bigger than the width of a nickel , you need to reapply exterior caulk .
Check window glazing putty , too ( which seals glass into the window frame ) .
Add weatherstripping as needed around doors , making sure you cannot see any daylight from inside your home .
5 . Clean the gutters .
A service charges $ 70 to $ 200 for a single - story house , depending on its size .
If your gutters are full of detritus , water can back up against the house and damage roofing , siding and wood trim , plus cause leaks and ice dams .
Also look for missing or damaged components that need repair .

6. Divert water .
Add extensions to downspouts so water runs at least 3 to 4 feet away from the foundation , says David Lupberger , home - improvement expert for ServiceMagic ( www.servicemagic.com), which connects consumers with service providers .
For example , HomeDepot.com sells Amerimax Flex - a - Spout extension ( 25 to 55 inches ) for $ 10 .
7 . Turn off exterior faucets .
Undrained water that freezes in pipes will expand and can burst .
Start by disconnecting all garden hoses and draining water still in faucets .
If you do n’t have frost - proof faucets ( homes built before ten to 12 years ago typically do not ) , turn off the shut - off valve inside your home .
8. Trim landscaping .
Clear the area at least 1 foot away from exterior walls , and rake gunk out of corners and away from the foundation .
Cut back tree limbs growing within about 5 feet of the house , or worse , scrubbing the house or roof .
You will create better ventilation , help dry out surfaces and prevent decay and damage .
( Different rules apply in landscapes vulnerable to wildfires ; visit www.firewise.org, or do a Web search using your state ’s name and “ firewise landscape . ” )
9 . Have your lawn - irrigation system professionally drained .
Your sprinkler service will charge $ 50 to $ 150 , depending on the size of the system .
As with draining spigots , this will help avoid freezing and leaky pipes come spring .

Ari Fleischer says " How Dare You ?

TreeTop , stop the pretense OK .

It 's comical and ironic that anyone questioning whether Obama was a natural born citizen is dismissed as a ' wingnut ' , even though no proof has been shown .
Yet the very same people are whining in 2009 over an election in 2000 AFTER the Supreme Court and the Congress settled the matter .
By your own standards , does n't that make you a wingnut ?

For your information , a person could be a ' naturalized ' citizen and have the very same certificate , meaning they were not born in the United States .

Soul Rebel - Easy please .
No need to name call here .
TreeTop007 - You asked :
Why is the label ' wingnuts ' used for anyone who cares about the requirements of the Constitution being followed ?
It 's not .
It 's used for wingnuts .
I 've seen no evidence that the cadre of folks running their evidence - free campaign against Obama gives a damn about the Constitution .
If they did , they would have been quite loud over the last eight years .
They were n't .
They did n't give a damn .
Now , they give a damn only about delegitimizing a legit President ( now that we actually have one , like him or not ) .
You further charged :
It 's comical and ironic that anyone questioning whether Obama was a natural born citizen is dismissed as a ' wingnut ' , even though no proof has been shown .
Yet the very same people are whining in 2009 over an election in 2000 AFTER the Supreme Court and the Congress settled the matter .
You 're right .
No proof has been shown that he is not a citizen .
On the other hand , much proof exists to show that he is .
Even more proof than is available to show that McCain was , for that matter !
( Since McCain is quite arguably NOT a natural - born U.S. citizen , having been born outside of the U.S. and at a time when foreign - born children of military were NOT born with natural - born citizenship , but I fail to recall any wingnuts making that case last year . )
As to your second point , the Supreme Court has no place in deciding Presidential Elections .
May want to read that Constitution you mentioned .
The people are supposed to decide , via electors .
And the people decided by ballot that Gore should have been the President .
The Supreme Court decided otherwise , in one of the most extraordinary contraventions of the U.S. Constitution this country has ever seen .
" Whining " about it ?
Hardly .
Outraged out about it ?
You damned well better believe it .
Those of us who actually give a damn about the Constitution do n't just do so every few years when it 's convenient , or when someone on Fox " News " tells us to .

" Troll , multiple lawsuits have been dismissed by US District court judges as being without merit . "
No court or judge has seen the documents .
The cases are dismissed on the grounds that individual citizens do n't have the right to bring them to the court .
I hate being on this side of the argument but all of the high paid legal obfuscation raised many red flags with this reader .
The question is not whether he was a citizen , the question is whether he met the special set of conditions reserved for the chief executive officer .
The founding fathers did n't want a british subject to become president so they created different standards .
And if you tell me that Obama submitted a certficate to an organization with a website and that they verified it , then I think Karl Rove .
I do n't know what the answers are but I do know that the official 9/11 narrative is impossible and that has earned me the label " truther " .
" Birther " is no a real world and is a back handed personal attack .

Edward --- the " special set of conditions reserved for the chief executive officer " are satisfied by the fact that Obama was born in the United States .
That has been verified by high - ranking officials of the State of Hawaii --- whose governor , by the way , is a Republican who supported McCain .
For most people , a little research will get all the confusion straightened out .
I must say , though , given your position about 9/11 , that generalization may not apply to you .

TreeTop007 flipped and flopped : Maybe you would like to rewrite history .
but Congress certified the electoral votes in all 50 States and the District of Columbia .
Perhaps this is difficult for you to understand , but where the laws require electors be voted by a plurality of those voting for them , that would be the law of the land .
Simply because the Supreme Court decides to override the Constitution and the dumbass cowards in Congress decide to go along with it , does not make the fact that more people voted for Al Gore than George Bush ( including in the state of Florida ) any less true .
It 's a done deal .... deal with it .
Yes , it was done and illegal .
And I deal with it every day .
We all do .
As do you .
We 'd likely not be in the mess we 're in were it not for that .
We 'll likely be dealing with it for decades to come .
Hence , following the rule of law and the Constitution is far better than not doing so in such cases .
But I presume this means the done deal of Obama as President is one you 've dealt with as well , and that you are calling on the " birthers " to deal with it ?
That seems in opposition to your earlier comments .
I 'd say that makes you a super ' wingnut ' to be whining nearly a decade after the fact .
You may say whatever you like , of course .
Saying something , however , does n't mean you 're right , does n't mean there is evidence to support your position ( where there is evidence to support mine , of course . )
Last I heard we elected a President by electoral vote , not popular vote
Wishing and whining does n't change the fact , or the law .
Right .
And Al Gore , were it not for the illegal intervention of the Supreme Court , ordering that legal votes NOT be counted in FL , would have enjoyed his victory by electoral vote , since he won the popular vote in FL .
Wishing and whining does n't change that fact .

" No court or judge has seen the documents .

As long as we 're splitting hairs fine , most of the cases have been dismissed as being without standing , meaning that the " victims " can't show that they 've actually been harmed by . . . whatever the misfeasance is alleged to be .
You 're right that judges have n't seen the evidence -- whatever it 's imagined to be -- because there is no prima facie case that would cause them to require confidential records be made public .
One judge , as I recall , suggested the case he heard was no more than harassment .
" I hate being on this side of the argument but all of the high paid legal obfuscation raised many red flags with this reader . "
Who 's high paid ?
I 've never seen the salaries of Obama 's attorneys published , and , given the frivolity of the cases , I would n't be surprised if some are working pro bono .
And where 's the obfuscation ?
In mounting a legal defense when you 're taken to court ?
The funniest thing about the birther theory is that there 's no reason whatsoever to believe any of it .
People simply latch on to any number of claims with no documentary support .
Then they insist that the actual evidence , experts and independent verifications are wrong , because they have to be wrong in order for the birthers to keep believing what they want to believe .
In short , birthers are n't treated like reasonable people because they do n't have a reasoned position and are therefore immune to evidence and reasonable debate .
2 + 2 = 4 .
They just do n't want to believe 4 .

Building 7 is the gateway to busting the myths of 9/11 embraced by the discredited 9/11 Commission .
Dr. Griffin talks about how Van Jones was vilified just for signing a petition calling for a new investigation , and about the effort to pass a NYC referendum enabling a new inquiry .
He offers many examples of the NIST reports exagerrations and fabrications , and concludes that WTC was brought down in a controlled demolition .
In the bin Laden book , he details all of the reports of bin Laden ’s death , evaluates the credibility of video and audio releases attributed to bin Laden , and concludes that he is probably dead .

First off , all I did was ask a simple question about using the label ' wingnuts ' , and people start foaming at the mouth like rabid dogs , jumping to conclusions without ANY merit at all .
I 'm not a troll , or a Republican , or a supporter of George Bush , I do n't watch FOX News , I have been loud and angry at the Government for Constitutional reasons , and not just the last 8 years , closer to 25 years , and lastly , I DO think George Bush stole the 2000 Election , I think it was stolen in OHIO for sure , and possibly in Florida also .
So you 're all beating the wind fighting a ghost in your arguments , because I 'm not whoever or whatever you think I am .
I asked a simple question about the ' wingnut ' term and immediately you think you have me pegged , and go off ranting with your standard anti-FOX , anti-Rightwing , anti-Republican bs .
I was pointing out the irony in you labeling the birthers ( a derogatory term itself ) as ' wingnuts ' because you incorrectly believe it has been proven that Obama is a natural born citizen , and it 's been less than a year in trying to see the proof .
Yet you are crying over an election that has been settled for nearly a decade , it 's over , it 's history , even the crook himself out of office , and somehow using the same standards in which you label others ' wingnuts ' , you are n't ' wingnuts ' yourself ?
And lastly , which statement is false A person born OUTSIDE of the United States can have a Birth Certificate of Live Birth , just like the one Obama showed online .
Dr Janice Okubo has never claimed Obama was a ' natural born ' citizen , her statement was that she has ' personally seen and verified that the Hawaii State Department of Health has Sen .
Obama ’s original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures . '
Barry Soetoro and Obama are both one and the same person .
His biological father was Kenyan , a citizen of Britain .
His father was married to more than one wife at the same time he was married to Obamas mother .
His stepfather was a citizen of Indonesia .
Obamas mother was known to have used AT LEAST 5 different names .
Obama went to school in Indonesia , with school records showing him to be a citizen of Indonesia .

If they wish to make a legal case about anything , that 's fine and up to them .
That they happen to be hard rightwing nuts , interested in political power above all , even to the detriment of the nation , is why I call them wingnuts .

As to calling for accountability ( you call it " whining " ) for an illegally installed " President " ( Bush ) , if there is not accountability , it is likely to happen again .

O could have been born anywhere as long as mom is a US citizen , he is too , period Link Who is a natural - born citizen ?
Who , in other words , is a citizen at birth , such that that person can be a President someday ?
The 14th Amendment defines citizenship this way : " All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside . "
But even this does not get specific enough .
As usual , the Constitution provides the framework for the law , but it is the law that fills in the gaps .
Currently , Title 8 of the U.S. Code fills in those gaps .
Section 1401 defines the following as people who are " citizens of the United States at birth : " #
Any one born outside the United States , if one parent is an alien and as long as the other parent is a citizen of the U.S. who lived in the U.S. for at least five years ( with military and diplomatic service included in this time )

Whether this is true or not ( I could n't say one way or the other ) , it 's entirely valueless .
Citizenships are not mutually exclusive , his parents could not have changed his status as a natural - born American citizen , and he was too young to change his own status as a natural - born American citizen .
There is a difference in a ' Certificate of Live Birth ' and a ' Certification of Live Birth ' , the latter does not prove a person is ' natural born ' .
This is a half - truth at best .
The difference is largely semantic ; one creates an official record of a birth , while the other is a statement of that record .
Both are government issued ; both are court admissible ; and both can prove natural - born status , since they both give the birth location .

When you 're buying fish , you may not get what you pay for .

Tilapia stood in for snapper and even white tuna .
" Bluefish " from a Chinatown shop turned out to be a species of herring that 's not even listed in the official database of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency .
About a quarter of 500 fish samples turned out to be misidentified or mislabelled .
They were genetically tested and matched using the world - famous Barcode of Life DNA database at the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario , University of Guelph .
The results are in line with previous , smaller studies , says Robert Hanner , global campaign coordinator of a Barcode of Life ( BOL ) project to identify genetically all the fish in the world , called FISH - BOL .
" Yes , we continue to see things that look fishy , " says Hanner , an assistant professor at the University of Guelph .
" It 's a problem across Canada .
It 's a problem across markets . "
Hanner is expected to unveil the findings Wednesday at the third international BOL conference in Mexico City .
He gave the Star a briefing in advance .
The fish samples were collected during 2008 and 2009 from supermarkets , fishmongers , restaurants and even frozen food boxes .
The investigation was conducted in conjunction with Bioscience Education Canada , with help from the Ontario Genomics Institute .
Both are based in Toronto .
To collect the fish , 166 high school and college students were recruited in Toronto , Riverview ( N.B. ) , Halifax , Kanata ( an Ottawa suburb ) , Guelph , Saskatoon , Edmonton , Spruce Grove ( an Edmonton suburb ) and Richmond ( B.C. ) .
The Toronto contingent included gifted students in the science club at Northern Secondary School and students in the computer bioinformatics program at Seneca College .
It was more of an educational exercise than a scientifically rigorous study because background information and collection methods were " spotty , " Hanner cautions .
" This is an investigative report , not a scientific study . "
However , he says , the results do put the spotlight on a widespread problem .
Implications of misidentified fish include consumer fraud , food safety issues and ecological concerns .
In most cases , Hanner says , cheaper fish are being substituted for pricier species .
" The bottom line is that there is a lot of market fraud . "
Food safety concerns range from the fear of unsuspectingly being sold goods from a polluted Asian fish farm to the fear of unknowingly biting into a fish one is allergic to .
The fear of ending up with a poisonous fish in your soup is not far - fetched , either .
That happened three years ago .
An investigation was launched in three U.S. states after a few consumers fell ill .
They had bought what was marketed as headless , gutted monkfish from China .
Barcode of Life testing proved it was puffer fish , or fugu , which contains a neurological toxin that can cause respiratory paralysis and even death .
Mislabelling and misidentification in the marketplace is a sign of overfishing , Hanner says .
He points out that trawlers " hammer " fish stocks , then move to new areas where they land similar but different species .
With 90 per cent of fish stocks in trouble , Hanner says , accurate tracking of species being caught and sold is crucial .
A diner , however , is not likely to be able to tell the difference .
Shauna MacKinnon of the Living Oceans Society says misidentification of fish is " a huge problem " because it undermines the efforts of conscientious consumers and buyers .
" If you 're a supermarket or a chef , you might be trying to make a sustainable choice , " she says .
" When there 's so much mislabelling or misidentification , you can't be sure . "
For example , Chinese tilapia is considered a poor choice because of concerns about chemical use in vast fish farms .
MacKinnon says it is substituted for U.S. tilapia , which is farmed with more concern for the environment .
Hanner says tilapia , a freshwater fish , is the most common stand - in for other , more expensive fish .
The most misidentified fish remains red snapper , an endangered ocean fish .
Earlier this year , a Toronto Star investigation revealed widespread substitution of tilapia for the promised snapper at Toronto sushi restaurants .
Of samples collected from 12 restaurants across the city , 10 were actually tilapia .
In Guelph 's cross-Canada investigation , tilapia was sold as white tuna , as well as snapper .
Catfish was replaced by inferior Asian basa ; this is officially allowed in Canada but not the United States .
And even though 7,175 fish species have been genetically bar - coded , one sample sold as sea bass did n't match anything in what Hanner calls " the most comprehensive database that has ever been constructed . "
About 100 main market species end up on our dinner plates .
Types of fish collected by the students included halibut , turbot , cod , Caspian loach , dried capelin , butterfish , corvina , mackerel , pike , monkfish , Alaskan black cod , blackjack , swordfish and mahi mahi .
There are an estimated 31,300 fish species on the planet , which in turn have 279,500 names .
Monikers include scientific names , common names , marketing names and cultural names .
Fish are even renamed for better PR ( would you rather eat slimehead or orange roughy ? ) .
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency maintains a list of " acceptable common names " for seafood .
Like the miracle of the loaves and fishes , the list of seafood names keeps growing – and so does consumer confusion .
" It keeps expanding , with more names , and more and more ambiguity , " Hanner says .
What is a poor consumer to do ?
Richard Fung , a Toronto artist , writer and academic , eats fish about four times a week .
Recently , he swears he has seen endangered Chilean sea bass " under strangely new fish names , " and has been perturbed by the sale of basa identified on separate occasions as turbot and sole .
" I 'm suspicious of a lot of fish sold as turbot in T.O. , " Fung says in an email .
" It 's like sole – anything flat seems to be sold as sole . "
Nowadays , Fung puts suspicion on his shopping list .
" I find fish labelling vague everywhere and I never know if to trust it , not just species but when a shop says `wild salmon , ' for example , " he says .
" I would like to see provenance and price listed with fish . "
That 's what they are doing in Europe .
MacKinnon says merchants there are required to provide a common name and country of origin , and to reveal whether fish is wild or farmed .
Canada is way behind , she says , with its poorly regulated seafood labelling and traceability .
For instance , fish sticks that say " made in Canada " might only be breaded here , according to MacKinnon .
The fish could come from three different countries .
" Seafood , more than many other products , has a long supply chain that can be very complicated , " she says .
Conservationists have asked the government to take stricter action , MacKinnon says .
" This is an ongoing discussion because Canada is behind other countries .
The CFIA has been really unresponsive . "
The agency , meanwhile , suggests that disgruntled fish buyers can email an area recall coordinator , at cfiamaster@inspection.gc.ca , or telephone the agency at 1-800-442-2342 .
At press time , it was formulating a response on questions of policy changes .
Amid a growing interest in what we are consuming and where it comes from , Hanner notes that initial anger over consumer fraud is shifting to dismay that the government is not protecting fish consumers .
" Translating basic research into public policy – I do n't know how to do that , " he says .
" That 's the missing link . "
DNA bar - coding could help consumers , he says , but analysis time has to go from days to minutes , and the price has to drop from dollars to pennies .
" The technology has got to become faster and cheaper , " Hanner says .
Northern Secondary School science teacher Jane Lee says students who participated in the investigation were fascinated by the potential for Star Trek - style " tricorder technology " – a riff on Hanner 's dream that DNA bar codes would one day shrink to the size of hand - held devices .
" That puts the power into the hands of anyone who has the device , " says student Eric Yam .
In the meantime , Hanner suggests buying whole fish instead of fillets , which are harder to identify on the plate .
Fish caught by Canadian trawlers in Canadian waters are more " likely to be accurately labelled , " he adds .
Better still , try fish caught nearby , such as pickerel plucked from Lake Erie .
" How do I avoid being duped ? " Hanner asks .
" Buy something local . "
Get right with Google
How smart entrepreneurs are dealing with the online Goliath that can make a small business -- or break it .
MOUNTAIN VIEW , CALIF .
( FSB Magazine ) -- Allan Keiter awoke one recent morning to the scary news that his Atlanta company 's website was nearly impossible to find on a Google search .
MyRatePlan.com helps consumers compare cellular calling plans .
Until that morning , the site had often ranked in the top - ten nonpaid results for search terms such as " free cell phones " and " family plans . "
And like thousands of other businesses , Keiter 's company relied on free Google searches to drive customers its way .
Keiter had fallen victim to what 's known as the dreaded Google dance : sudden , seismic shifts in search results that occur whenever Google 's engineers decide , without warning or explanation , to tweak the software algorithms that determine how the mighty search engine processes keywords .
It 's like owning a shop on a busy street corner where all the pedestrians suddenly and mysteriously vanish .
In the months after he fell prey to the Google dance , Keiter saw his revenues plunge some 20 % .
When he contacted Google for an explanation he was simply told that the algorithm was secret sauce .
" There was nothing I could do , " he says .
" They make changes in their ivory tower , and it ripples through to the little guy . "
When FSB asked Google spokesperson Barry Schnitt to comment on Keiter 's experience , he responded with a written statement : " Just as the web changes constantly , Google continues to modify and refine our algorithms to improve the quality of our objective search results . "
In the lives of small - business owners , Google ( Charts ) looms as the new Wal - Mart ( Charts ) .
Many entrepreneurs fear and despise the retailing giant for mistreating vendors and vaporizing small competitors and entire business districts .
Yet Wal - Mart also is lauded for delivering a vast range of consumer goods at rock - bottom prices .
Supplier contracts with Wal - Mart represent a boon to thousands of entrepreneurs and a dream to many more .
Whatever one 's attitude , the wise small - business owner learns as much as he can about Wal - Mart and its ways - and weaknesses .
He adapts or dies .
Smart entrepreneurs are taking a similar approach to Google , which can decimate their sales through a whim of search - engine coding , or deliver a flood of new customers and ad revenue .
How Google affects your company depends on how quickly you accept its power and how cleverly you accommodate it .
As moving targets go , Google is a blur , perpetually ranging into new territories , from free software to classified ads to telephony .
And while most large companies are tight - lipped , stealth is the very cornerstone of Google 's corporate culture .
" Google is virtually impenetrable , " says Dave Taylor , an Internet consultant in Boulder .
" It 's ironic , because the company is all about transparency and openness on the web . "
Still , FSB set out to take a snapshot of this protean company in full flight .
Our goal was to gauge how Google is affecting small - business owners in America today , and what entrepreneurs can expect from future versions of Google .
We reached two main conclusions .
First off , Internet search is going through a transitional period .
Small online businesses in particular are starting to chafe at the rising cost of search - term advertising .
Some of them may soon seek alternatives to a marketing strategy based solely or primarily on search .
Also clear in our snapshot :
To many small businesses , Google is both friend and foe .
Thousands of entrepreneurs now find most of their customers via search - based marketing .
Other businesses - niche software and book publishers , for example - risk imminent extinction thanks to Google 's free software releases and ( shall we say ) innovative approach to copyright law .
Hanging in the lobby of building 43 , an airy , modern structure on Google 's sprawling Mountain View campus , is a giant screen that displays a dynamic map of the world .
Every single Google search undertaken by anyone anywhere registers on this map in real time .
Map of the world
Silk - thin lines emanate from places such as the Marshall Islands , where it's the middle of the night and only a few Internet surfers - maybe even just one - are currently using Google .
Meanwhile , fat , colored pipelines rise from high - traffic areas such as China ( teal ) , Germany ( green ) , and the East Coast of the U.S. ( red ) .
There are still large blank spots across sub-Saharan Africa and other regions that remain terra incognita on the Google globe .
For many entrepreneurs here in the U.S. , Google has helped make the Internet a viable place to do business .
Roughly 500,000 U.S. small businesses rely on unpaid or " natural " search for the bulk of their revenues , according to John Battelle , author of The Search : How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture .
Another half - million firms participate in Google 's paid - search advertising program .
Two - thirds of those are small businesses that collectively contributed $ 2 billion to Google 's total revenues of $ 6 billion last year .
Thanks to Google , many startups have reached profitable niche markets at little cost .
Take Shark Diver , a San Francisco adventure - travel company that Patric Douglas founded in 2000 .
Shark Diver ( sharkdiver.com ) arranges tours to tropical locales worldwide where shark fans can frolic underwater with their favorite predators .
Douglas , 38 , estimates that at most , 100,000 people in the U.S. possess the requisites for this pursuit : diving experience and a crazy streak .
By bidding on search terms such as " cage diving " in Google auctions , he has been able to zero in on his target market .
Shark Diver is now a profitable business with 20 employees and about $ 1 million in annual revenues , according to Douglas .
His thoughts on Google ?
" They 're gods .
Back in the day , there 's no way I could have drilled down to a niche this small . "
More established businesses have been able to slash their marketing budgets by switching to search - term advertising .
Ray Allen , 64 , quit the cutthroat New York City advertising industry to start American Meadows ( americanmeadows.com ) , a wildflower - seed company based in Williston , Vt .
Ten years ago Allen was spending $ 300,000 a year on magazine ads and print catalogs to generate about $ 1 million in annual revenues .
Today he spends just $ 120,000 a year ( mostly with Google , but also with Yahoo's ( Charts ) competing pay - per- click ad service ) to generate more than $ 2 million in revenues .
" This is a total revolution , " crows Allen .
Yet Google 's stated goal of organizing all the world 's information is almost guaranteed to give its advertisers headaches .
If Google has its way , every word ever written and every image ever created will one day be cataloged on its servers .
From a business - PR perspective , that means good press will show up in search results .
So will corporate scandal coverage , leaked proprietary information , bad product reviews , blogger rants - you name it .
As the volume of searchable information swells , advertisers will increasingly find themselves in a bind .
As night follows day , embarrassing content will pop up next to their ads .
Google may yet devise software that will allow companies to choose what sort of search results they wish their ads to be associated with .
Meanwhile , do n't be surprised to see advertisers squirming under Google 's digital hoof .
One likely trigger is rising search - term rates .
Today hot terms such as " medical malpractice lawyer " and " debt consolidation " routinely auction for $ 10 a click or more .
According to Jupiter Research , the average cost for a paid - search keyword rose from 39 cents in 2004 to 44 cents in 2005 and is expected to hit 58 cents by 2010 .
( These are industry averages ; Jupiter does not break out Google from Yahoo and other search competitors . )
Google generates nearly all its revenues by selling ads .
But businesses may soon balk at seeing Google leech away an ever - increasing share of their revenues .
Yes , paying Google only if someone actually clicks on an ad is more efficient than a traditional TV or magazine ad , where you pay for eyeballs .
Studies show that 1 % or 2 % of clicks generate paying customers .
While more than double the typical conversion rates for print and TV ads , that 's still a low percentage game .
" I predict a rebellion , " says Jakob Nielsen , principal with Nielsen Norman Group ( nngroup.com ) , an Internet - user research firm in Fremont , Calif .
" People are going to tire of spending so much for web traffic . "
Expect many businesses to seek other , cheaper marketing techniques .
" Search - based advertising has been all the rage , but that does n't mean there are n't other options , " says Guy Creese , an analyst with Burton Group ( burtongroup.com ) in Midvale , Utah .
As the blogosphere expands and matures , more entrepreneurs could discover that blogging is an efficient way to attract customers .
Other small businesses may find that it pays to purchase ads directly from website owners rather than through Google .
Say you run a home - building company .
Placing an ad on a popular real estate industry site might be cheaper than paid search - and might prove a more direct route to your target audience .
Competing with the Goliath
Travel agencies .
Newspapers .
Realtors .
Advertising firms .
Software makers .
What do these industries have in common ?
All face a serious competitive threat from Google .
" Google is the new Microsoft and then some , " says Mark Stevens , CEO of MSCO ( msco.com ) , a marketing firm in White Plains , N.Y .
" Google poses a threat to more companies in more industries than anyone else in history . "
When Mike Landis learned that Google had started offering free web - traffic monitoring software , he knew it spelled trouble for his company , Mach5 Development , based in Asheville , N.C. Landis , 41 , sells a similar application and now finds himself competing with a behemoth .
Once again , Google responded with a canned statement .
This one reads in part : " We believe there is room for many players in this space . "
Landis is n't so sure .
Mach5 ( mach5.com ) has five employees and just $ 300,000 in annual revenues .
" Obviously Google is going to bleed away a lot of our sales , " says Landis .
" We 're not as attractive to our customers anymore . "
He 's not alone : Numerous software publishers have been threatened by Google 's habit of releasing freeware that competes with their products .
Google makes no apologies for crushing small competitors .
" This company is organized to be disruptive , " CEO Eric Schmidt said in a telephone interview with FSB .
Google , which had amassed a $ 2.9 billion war chest as of this spring , has been on an acquisition rampage of late , buying up companies that make software for everything from mapping to photo editing .
That 's a boon for Google users , but it puts many software vendors in the unfortunate position of trying to sell a product that Google is offering gratis .
Mega-library
Google 's recent move to assemble a vast digital library of books is viewed as a threat by much of the global publishing industry .
Google decided to forgo the usual process of obtaining permissions from thousands of book companies .
Instead it executed a nifty end - run around the publishers , cutting deals with five large libraries - including the New York Public Library and the University of Michigan library system - to digitize their entire collections .
In exchange , the libraries will get digital versions of their holdings .
Google will walk away with the ability to provide brief excerpts ( so - called snippets ) from millions of books in its search results .
Google will also sell ads against these results .
Snippets or no , many publishers contend that Google plans to pirate a universe of copyrighted material .
Last October , five large publishing companies - including McGraw - Hill ( Charts ) , Penguin Group , and Simon & Schuster - sued Google for copyright infringement .
" We believe what we 're doing is legal and consistent with copyright law , " says a Google spokesman .
Google stresses that any publisher can keep its books from being digitized simply by sending a list of titles to Google .
But that 's not good enough for Lynne Rienner , whose Boulder - based book publishing company ( Lynne Rienner Publishers ; rienner.com ) is 22 years old , has 20 employees , and books less than $ 5 million a year in sales .
" Google is trying to turn the copyright laws on their head , " she says .
" Why should I have to let Google know which books they can't copy ?
They should be seeking permission from me regarding which books they can copy . "
Rather than compiling a list of her company 's 1,200 titles ( " a waste of my staff 's time " ) , Rienner fired off an angry letter to CEO Schmidt .
Google responded with a letter agreeing not to copy any of her books .
Rienner is unmollified .
She worries that she will be cut out of some future digital moneymaking opportunity .
" Books are my unique content , " she says .
" I 'm sure the smart people at Google are busy dreaming up all kinds of ways to make money off them . "
For now Rienner has found a symbolic way to register her displeasure :
She has started using Yahoo's search engine instead of Google's .
Bull in a china shop
" Google is not yet a mature business , " says CEO Schmidt .
" Our pace of innovation is not slowing down , I assure you .
If anything , it 's accelerating . "
In effect , Schmidt 's company is many - tentacled and moving at light speed .
Small businesses race to keep up .
Neil Kugelman , founder of Goldspeed.com , an online jewelry business based in Lynbrook , N.Y. , has his computer programmed to alert him to any news about Google .
He 's especially on the lookout for announcements about new software .
To run his business , Kugelman uses a variety of free software programs offered by Google , and the company is constantly adding to its slate of offerings .
As long as you 're giving away software , why not hand over the whole box ?
The argument : Computer hardware prices are plummeting in any case .
Experts say Google may one day start giving away PCs , reducing them to the equivalent of the free calculator you get when you open a bank account .
The Google PC would come loaded with ad - supported software designed to keep people Googling - and not necessarily doing their work .
A recent study by the Nielsen Norman Group found that employees spend 11 seconds a day , on average , glancing at ads surrounding free software .
Clicking on ads wastes another 15 seconds a day .
These are tiny increments of time , but they add up .
Over a year , Nielsen Norman estimates , a free computer could easily cost a company $ 100 an employee in lost productivity .
Another new frontier for Google is cellphones .
Already the company is delivering services such as traffic updates to phone screens .
Many analysts expect Google to team up with a cellular service provider such as Sprint ( Charts ) or Cingular to offer a mobile pricing tool .
Cellphones already have cameras , goes the reasoning .
So why not add a bar - code scanner ?
You could walk into an electronics store and scan a DVD player .
Up would pop the price , along with Google ads for various area merchants , touting their lower prices on the very same item .
" This is a logical direction for Google , " says Roger Entner , a telecom analyst in the Boston office of Ovum , a research firm .
" It would extend their advertising reach out onto the actual floors of merchants . "
Or what if Google offered a certified same - day international digital document - delivery service ?
That 's eminently doable , given Google 's massive server farm .
America 's entrepreneurs would turn cartwheels in their Dockers if Google figured out a way to beat FedEx ( Charts ) and other couriers on both price and speed .
Or what about an e-mail translation service ?
Simply send an English e-mail to your Chinese supplier via google.chinese.com .
Google would translate the message into Chinese and forward it to the addressee - in real time .
If nothing else , expect Google to continue challenging established ways of doing business .
For good and ill , Google is one of the most awesome forces ever to be unleashed on the business world - or rather the Google world in which all business owners now live .
