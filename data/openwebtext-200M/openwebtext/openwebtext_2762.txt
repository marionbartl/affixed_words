Why the S&P 500 Stock Market Index Could Crash Another 50 %
With the words “ green shoots ” and “ bull market ” getting more and more coverage in the mainstream financial press , it ’s worth considering if this current market / economy is actually improving .
Personally I do n’t know what data the folks at CNBC are looking at .
Because to me , all signs point to further wealth destruction and great economic contraction to come in the months ahead .
For starters , there ’s the issue of sentiment .
Many commentators have made a big deal out of the fact the Chicago Board of Options Volatility index ( VIX ) ¾ a common measure of investor sentiment¾ recently fell below 30 for the first time since the Market Crash in October .
However , a VIX reading of 30 only indicates that investors are back to normal “ bear market ” freak out mode as opposed to full - blown “ the world is ending ” crisis hysteria : remember the VIX was at 30 during the recession of 1990 - 91 and during the Tech crash .
So this hardly indicates things are getting much better .
Moreover , from a valuation perspective , stocks are nowhere near cheap .
During the recessions of the early ’ 70s and ‘ 80s , stocks fell to trade at single digit Price - to - Earnings ( P/E ) ratios .
With this current recession obliterating earnings every month , P/E ratios are actually rising , NOT falling .
Consider that earnings estimates for the S&P 500 in 2009 currently stand at $ 28.51 .
With the S&P 500 trading at 887 , this values the stock index at 31 !
That ’s the kind of valuation seen during bubbles , NOT bear markets .
For the S&P 500 to trade at a P/E of 7 ( where it did during the last two major bear markets ) , the S&P 500 would have to fall to 200 ( I ’m not saying this will happen , but simply pointing out how expensive stocks are ) .
Even a P/E of 15 would put the S&P 500 at 382 : a more than 50 % decline from where the market trades today .
Of course , this is assuming that the current earnings estimates are accurate : as recently as Feb 9 , 2009 , earnings estimates for the S&P 500 in 2009 were as high as $ 42 .
It ’s also worth mentioning that earnings are generally massaged to be higher than real profits via various accounting gimmicks .
REAL corporate profits ( cash flow ) are likely to be even lower .
No , if this bear market goes the way of others , we ’ve still got quite a ways to fall .
Indeed , as far as bear markets go , we ’re currently right in the middle based on the number of weeks declining and the price decline ( see the chart below ) .
Bottomline : Do n’t trust the mainstream financial commentators or government officials .
We may be seeing “ green shoots , ” but remember that green shoots can spring up even in barren parking lot .
This does n’t mean you ’ve got the makings of sustained growth .
Instead , it ’s far more likely that this market has a looooong way to fall .
We ’re certainly long overdue for a correction of 10 % or so .
I would n’t be surprised if we got this in the next four weeks .
Prepare your portfolio accordingly .

Most people assume that their trash ends up in a landfill somewhere far away ( if they think about this at all ) .
But growing concern over the environmental impact of waste — discarded electronics , in particular — has prompted a team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( M.I.T. ) to take a high - tech approach to studying exactly what people are tossing out and where those items are ending up .
The researchers , part of M.I.T.'s Senseable City Lab , have developed electronic tags that they 're hoping as many as 3,000 volunteers in Seattle and New York City will affix to different items they throw away this summer as part of the Trash Track program .
These tags will contact cell phone towers they pass as they flow through the trash stream to their final destinations , helping the researchers monitor the patterns and costs of urban disposal .
The tags are battery - powered microprocessors with the ability to send out cell phone signals , says Assaf Biderman , associate director of Senseable City Lab .
The lab 's computer servers will track these signals as they are picked up by cell phone towers ( each of which has an address ) , using the strength of the signal to determine the tag 's distance from each tower and triangulate the approximate position of the trash .
Although some signals might be blocked as a result of tagged items being hauled or stored in steel or aluminum — conducting materials that block electrical fields —
Biderman says the tags will resume functioning once the items are moved someplace more open .
If the items do n't move , then the lab 's trash trackers will mark the spot where they lost the signal as the final resting place .
Of particular interest to the researchers are electronic waste ( including computers , monitors and iPods ) and plastics ( which exist in a variety of forms , many of which are recyclable ) , not to mention all - time enemies of the environment such as Styrofoam and tires .
" Some of these things are interesting to tag because of their impact on the environment , others because of their volume in relation to overall domestic waste , " Biderman says .
The best way to improve the sanitation system , he adds , is to look at how it functions and how objects move through its garbage trucks , trash barges , incinerators and landfills , among other components .
The researchers will present the results of their study at events held on September 17 at both the Seattle Public Library and the Architectural League in New York City .
Each location will also feature an Internet - based presentation that lets attendees see tagged trash moving in real time .
Trash Track is just one example of " Internet of things , " Biderman says , which is " what happens when every object is addressable . "
Since its birth in 1994 , Javascript has come a long way .
Today it is one of the most popular programming languages on the web .
Javascript has been on the rise and is growing faster since AJAX based applications reignited professional developer interest .
It is now possible to it to write applications on the server , the mobile devices , on the browsers ( add ons and plugins ) , inside PDF documents , even in some remote controls and many more to come .
Javascript application development in Mobile devices
Palm ’s new OS is the first mobile platform to be built from the ground up to combine standard technology , innovation and integration .
At its core , webOS leverages several industry - standard technologies , including web technologies such as CSS , XHTML and JavaScript .
You can think of webOS applications as native applications , but built from the same standard HTML , CSS and JavaScript that you ’d use to develop web applications .
Palm has extended the standard web development environment through a JavaScript framework that gives standardized UI widgets , and access to selected device hardware and services .
Javascript can be used on the iphone too .
The HTML 5 specification provides a new mechanism for client - side data storage : JavaScript database support .
This feature shipped originally with iPhone OS 2.1 .
When you use “ Add to Home Screen ” from the “ + ” button on Safari for iPhone , a web application with a manifest defined ( per the HTML5 spec ) will be saved with any cached resources .
It is also worth noting that these features have not been added to Safari on Mac OS X or Windows .
Desktop Application development using Javascript
Adobe AIR is a cross- platform desktop runtime created by Adobe that allows web developers to use web technologies to build and deploy Rich Internet Applications ( RIAs ) and web applications to the desktop .
This means what you can write you application using Javascript and then let AIR to figure out how to run your code in Windows , Linux , Mac and future operating systems .
The application shown in the pic is written using Javascript , HTML and CSS .
It uses the ExtJS library .
Javascript can be used to dock the application in the taskbar , delete and modify files on the hard drive , communicate to different server , use AJAX , etc .
You can even use flash within your app to make the application look and feel much better .
This gives the web developer good access to a desktop .
Server side Scripts using Javascript
Server side JavaScript has been around for a long time and potentially offers some unique and interesting advantages over other languages ( like PHP , ASP , etc ) because the same language is spoken by both client and server .
There are numerous attempts to bring server side javascript to the masses .
Server side Javascript has to do much more than what it has to do at the browser level with access to databases , files , and networking , as well as logging , process management , scalability , security , integration APIs , and extensibility .
You can even use your own javascript libraries on the server jQuery , dojo , Ext JS , prototype , etc .
Javascript in other places
– Adobe reader ( from v3.02 ) supports Javascript for forms and basic operations .
SOAP support has also been included since version 7.0 .
There is also access to the entire 3D Javascript API .
More details on using Javascript is available here
– Open office application suite supports Javascript to write macros .
This move looks like a sensible addon given the usage of VBScript in MS Office suite .
– Apple ’s Dashboard Widgets , Microsoft ’s Gadgets , Yahoo !
Widgets , Google Desktop Gadgets are implemented using JavaScript .
– The oddest one in this list will have to be the Philips Remote Control which uses Javascript
ECMAScript 4 ( ECMAScript Harmony )
Javascript has been relatively stable since the third edition of ECMAScript published in 1999 .
Features under discussion for a future edition originally ECMAScript 4 now ECMAScript Harmony include Classes , a module system , static typing and Optional type annotations , Generators , Iterators , Destructuring assignment , algebraic data types .
Well if you think this is ambitious you should see the original ECMAScript 4 which had more semantic and syntactic innovation .
Packages , namespaces and early binding from ECMAScript 4 are no longer included for planned releases with ECMAScript Harmony .
The intent of these features is partly to better support “ programming in the large ” , and to let programmers sacrifice some of the script ’s ability to be dynamic for performance .
So yes as a web developer who uses Javascript on a daily basis , I am excited to watch Javascript grow and be available in more places .
Japan 's Prime Minister is determined to push ahead with plans to build a $ 150 million museum dedicated to comics , despite the country 's dire economic situation .
The Japanese economy is in its worst recession since World War II and Taro Aso , a self - declared Manga comic fan , is facing his own political downturn .
Ever since Astro Boy blasted on to western TV screens in the 1960s , Japanese Manga comics and animation , or anime , has been recognised worldwide as a distinct cultural art form .
In Japan , children and adults alike can be seen reading Manga comics in cafes and on trains .
Mr Aso 's decision to construct the so - called Manga museum has drawn mockery from the opposition .
In Parliament , opposition leader Yukio Hatoyama said he knew Mr Aso was a big fan of Manga , but he questioned why the state should be spending $ 150 million to build the museum .
" Is n't this just a colossal waste of money ? " he said .
" This is n't just some spur of the moment idea that I dreamed up , " Mr Aso said .
" It was planned by the previous administration and I am implementing it . "
Pushing pop art
The issue is so serious that Mr Aso 's coalition partners called a cartoonist to their party room to explain why a Manga museum was needed .
" Some of the original Manga cartoons are in real bad shape and need restoration and protection , " award - winning cartoonist Machiko Satonaka says .
" A museum would be the perfect place for them . "
But for many Japanese , the idea of spending $ 150 million on a building dedicated to cartoons and animation beggars belief , especially given the country is in recession and has just recorded its worst slump on record .
" Of course Japanese comics are popular here and abroad , but why are we spending so much money on a museum for them ? " one woman asks .
" This issue needs more debate ; It 's a lot of money , " one man says .
But for Manga - mad Mr Aso , the museum is an important shrine to home - grown pop art .
It is doubtful , though , that it will help him rocket up the opinion polls like his hero Astro Boy .
Is your Web site primed for any viewer ?
How do you know ?
The nicest thing about a usable Web site is that it ’s just a good thing to do for others so they can easily read your online information .
The other side to usability is that it can increase your search engine standings so more people can find your Web site .
The following list of cheat sheets and checklists are fairly recent ; however , some older usability checklists are useful for older sites that have n’t been upgraded .
You can find cheat sheets and checklists for forms , blogs and more below , all listed in alphabetical order .
A person is tended or prone to commit a mistake or crime or unlawful act in terms of sex , when he / she does not have proper knowledge regarding the importance of sex .
This can be easily avoided if parents and teachers take due care in teaching a child about sex , its importance , advantages and disadvantages in a right age at a right point of time .
Most of the parents and some of the teachers at school level hesitate to discuss or educate the child about sex and its importance and other related factors in life .
If a boy or girl attains the physical maturity age of 13 or 14 , they face physical changes such as development of sexual organs in the body .
They feel shy about asking or enquiring their parents or teachers about the new development they face in their physical structure .
In this situation , parents or teachers should take proper initiative and educate the child about the cause or nature ’s law regarding the new physical development that has come up in their physical body .
The teachers or parents should communicate in a smooth and easily understandable but try to avoid using any vulgar or embracing language .
They can easily teach children by beginning with the basics of the biological science and showing the human body structural pictures and diagrams , which will keep both the teacher and student or parent and child comfortable enough to discuss the intricacies and understand the sex education in most comfortable way .
As most of the parents and some of the teachers do not feel the importance of this kind of tactical education imparting to their children , some of the shy filled boys and girls do not feel the importance of sex in their live and almost fill their life with sorrow and hatred that is shown from their life partners .
This in turn becomes a root cause to various mental and physical distress and signs or causes of various suicide cases in under developed countries .
In order to overcome this kind of stressful life , a person should have proper understanding towards the sex education and importance of sexual factors in life .
In fact the internet facilities have grown up to such a extent that any child or student , they themselves can learn many things with out taking any one ’s support .
However , due to adult rated content being freely available on internet , it is again a big threat of totally spoiling a child or student to make him or her learn themselves over internet with out proper guidance from teachers or parents .
Meet Lee Hadwin , by day a nurse , at night he 's a " sleepwalking artist " who produces strange and fantastical artworks which he has no recollection of drawing when he wakes up the next morning .
Dubbed ' Kipasso ' , he says he is utterly mystified by his nocturnal talent , while at the daytime he shows no interest or ability in art whatsoever .
Major galleries have been asking for examples of his work , which they hope to market on its artistic merit as well as its novelty value .
Hadwin first started sleepwalking when he was four years old , but his parents believed it was a normal childhood phase .
When he was in his teens , he began producing artwork while asleep , at first on his bedroom walls .
Once , staying over at a friend 's house , he covered the kitchen walls with doodles in his sleep , an embarrassing discovery at breakfast time the next day .
In his late teens and early 20s , the intensity of his sleepwalking increased and Hadwin would wake to find everything in the vicinity : tableclothes , newspapers , clothes and walls , covered in artwork .
Hoping to harness the strange ability , he started leaving artists ' materials out when he went to bed and , sure enough , when he awoke he says he would find full - blown pictures beside him .
Now , he leaves his home prepared for nocturnal wanderings , with sketchbooks and charcoal pencils scattered around the house , particularly under the stairs , a favorite venue .
Some bands go through protracted courtships before they ever play a note of music together .
Mackintosh Braun was not one of those .
" We started writing and recording together the first day we met , " recalls Ian Mackintosh , one - half of the indie / electro - pop duo from Portland , OR .
" We could n't stop it . "
Their musical ideas and beliefs were too simpatico not to .
" We were so on the same page it was kind of stupid , " concurs Ben .
" We met at the perfect time in our creative journeys . "
Together they compose perfect pop songs , succinct and compellin… read more

In this video , Rainforest Action Network executive director Michael Brune hosts a fireside chat directed specifically at the wife of Royal Bank of Canada CEO Gordon Nixon .
RBC is one of the leading financial supporters of the tar sands project in Alberta , widely regarded by environmentalists as the most destructive project on earth .
Brune explains that he is addressing Mrs. Nixon because RAN has been unable to grab her husband ’s attention .
My colleagues and I distribute leaflets , maybe dangle banners off buildings and collaborate with RBC shareholders , but you , Janet , you ’re obviously a lot closer .
You have his ear .
So please , Janet , tonight would you ask your husband to stop RBC from financing this horiffic project ?
Accompanying this rather humorous video was a stunt at RBC headquarters in downtown Toronto yesterday , where two Indigenous Canadian women scaled flagpoles in front of the main entrance before dropping a banner that read : “ Please Help Us Mrs Nixon.com . “
Janet Nixon is known to have played a key role in the development of RBC ’s Blue Water Project , which is giving out $ 50 million over the next 10 years “ to help foster a culture of water stewardship . ”
While the clear issue involved with the tar sands oil extraction is global warming , RAN has been clever , given Mrs. Nixon ’s interests , to stress the clean water implications as well .
As Brune notes in the video , “ It ’s polluting Canada ’s clean and precious water rescources . ”
More specifically , according to RAN ’s website , “ Indigenous First Nations communities downstream [ from the tar sands project ] have experienced polluted water , water reductions in rivers and aquifers , increased cancer , and declines in wildlife population that threaten to destroy their traditional ways of life . ”
Although the banner dropping created quite a stir during the two hours it remained hoisted — drawing crowds of people , including RBC public relations executives —
Mrs. Nixon has yet to issue a response .
In fact , considering the video and the action were the culmination of a month - long guerrilla advertising campaign by RAN — which saw them plaster Toronto with posters calling on Mrs.
Nixon to help — she ’s actually been silent for quite a while .
It will be interesting to see how this plays out .
Will Mrs. Nixon feel forced to make some sort of public effort to be consistent with her environmental beliefs ?
That ’s certainly the hand RAN is forcing by being so determinedly earnest in their appeal .
If she does n’t show an effort then it will reflect poorly on the Blue Water Project .
If she does , but her husband fails to listen , then her perceived power and influence are weakened ( hope you like the doghouse Mr. Nixon ) .
That leaves the final option of RBC actually withdrawing support from the tar sands .
Even if it ’s only a small amount , I think RAN could call this campaign a victory .
No one expects a CEO ’s wife to singlehandedly take down the biggest financial boon Canada has ever seen .
But any concession on her or RBC ’s part would help strengthen the stigma of being involved with the tar sands and thereby help future campaigns against supporters .

Revelations that the Central Intelligence Agency launched a world - wide assassination program , and then concealed its existence from the U.S. Congress and the American people for eight years , carries an implication that death squads may have been employed against political opponents .
The Wall Street Journal reported July 13 that “ A secret Central Intelligence Agency initiative terminated by Director Leon Panetta was an attempt to carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives , according to former intelligence officials familiar with the matter .
Investigative journalist Siobhan Gorman writes ,
“ The precise nature of the highly classified effort is n’t clear , and the CIA wo n’t comment on its substance . ”
The Washington Post however , revealed July 16 that the assassination plan was sanctioned by President Bush .
Unnamed “ intelligence officials ” told the newspaper that “ a secret document known as a ‘ presidential finding ’ was signed by President George W. Bush that same month , granting the agency broad authority to use deadly force against bin Laden as well as other senior members of al - Qaeda and other terrorist groups . ”
According to Post reporter Joby Warrick , Bush ’s finding “ imposed no geographical limitations on the agency ’s actions ” and that the CIA was “ not obliged to notify Congress of each operation envisaged under the directive . ”
This implies that targets could be hit anywhere , including on the soil of a NATO ally or inside the United States itself .
According to the Los Angeles Times the program “ was kept secret from lawmakers for nearly eight years at the direction of former Vice President Dick Cheney . ”
Despite these reports and hand - wringing amongst congressional Democrats , there ’s something fishy here .
After all , is n’t the whole point of America ’s “ global war on terror ” to “ capture or kill ” al - Qaeda suspects ?
What ’s so secretive or controversial about that ?
The descriptions of the operation that have so far emerged however , bear a striking resemblance to charges laid earlier this year when investigative journalist Seymour Hersh said that the Bush administration stood - up an “ executive assassination ring . ”
During a “ Great Conversations ” event at the University of Minnesota in March the veteran journalist told the audience : “ After 9/11 , I have n’t written about this yet , but the Central Intelligence Agency was very deeply involved in domestic activities against people they thought to be enemies of the state .
Without any legal authority for it .
They have n’t been called on it yet .
That does happen . ”
The program was allegedly shut down by Panetta on June 23 , a day after leaning of the agency ’s clandestine initiative .
What make these revelations all the more significant is that the CIA Director only learned of the program fully four months after assuming office .
“ The implications , ” socialist analyst Bill Van Auken writes , “ are clear .
The CIA maintained the secrecy ordered by Cheney even after the latter had left office , and continued to conceal the existence and nature of the covert operation not only from Congress , but from the Obama administration itself . ”
But was the program shut down ?
The Washington Post further revealed that the plan , allegedly “ on the agency ’s back burner for much of the past eight years , was suddenly thrust into the spotlight because of proposals to initiate what one intelligence official called a ‘ somewhat more operational phase ’ . ”
Col .
Lawrence Wilkerson , a former top aide to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell hints that the program was in a “ somewhat more operational phase ” years earlier , despite repeated denials by CIA officials and congressional staffers .
Wilkerson told MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow Show July 14 , “ What I suspect has happened is what began to happen while I was still in the government , and that was we ’re killing the wrong people .
And we ’re killing the wrong people in the wrong countries .
And the countries are finding out about it , or at least there was a suspicion that the countries might find out about it , and so it was shut down .
That ’s my strong suspicion . ”
According to Wilkerson , the teams may have been dispatched under deep cover , using Joint Special Operations Command as a cut - out , a confirmation of charges made by Seymour Hersh in March .
When U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was queried by the State Department , “ after some hemming and hawing , which was Rumsfeld ’s forte , he finally admitted that he had dispatched some of these teams , ” Wilkerson explained .
Powell ’s former aide told Maddow , “ It ’s laughable that the CIA has never lied to Congress .
“ They lie to Congress on a routine basis . ”
Much the same can be said of General Powell who lied to the entire world “ on a routine basis ” during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
It must also be said there is precedence for the CIA ’s alleged death squad activities during the Bush era .
In Vietnam for example , the CIA and U.S. Special Forces jointly ran a secret assassination program that targeted Vietnamese dissidents .
As author Douglas Valentine revealed in his definitive study , The Phoenix Program , Operation Phoenix “ was a computer - driven program aimed at ‘ neutralizing ’ , through assassination , kidnapping , and systematic torture , the civilian infrastructure that supported the insurgency in South Vietnam . ”
Those programs never died and have since morphed into above top secret “ Special Access Programs ” used with deadly effect in Central - and South America during the 1980s and across the Middle East today .
The latest scandal comes on the heels of revelations that the Bush administration ’s massive secret surveillance programs targeting the American people went far beyond well - publicized warrantless wiretapping .
A new 38 - page declassified report issued July 10 by inspectors general of the CIA , National Security Agency , Department of Justice , Department of Defense and the Office of National Intelligence , collectively called the acknowledged “ Terrorist Surveillance Program ” and cross-agency top secret “ Other Intelligence Activities ” the “ President ’s Surveillance Program . ”
The IG ’s report failed to disclose what these programs actually did , and probably still do today under the Obama administration .
Shrouded beneath impenetrable layers of secrecy and deceit , these undisclosed programs lie at the dark heart of the state ’s war against the American people and perhaps , other regime opponents .
The CIA ’s Office of Inspector General said that “ the program was an additional resource to enhance the CIA ’s understanding of terrorist networks and to help identify potential threats to the U.S. homeland , ” and that the “ PSP was one of many tools available to them , and that the tools were often used in combination . ”
However , “ some officers told the CIA OIG that there was insufficient legal guidance on the use of PSP - derived information . ” ( pp. 33 - 34 )
But with a thin reed provided by President Bush ’s executive orders , presidential findings and 2001 congressional authorization for war against al - Qaeda , why would there be “ insufficient legal guidance ” ?
If “ PSP - derived information ” was used to target alleged al - Qaeda operatives there would n’t be need for additional legal guidance .
If however , the CIA “ was very deeply involved in domestic activities ” as Seymour Hersh averred , and used NSA information for political dirty tricks it would be a violation of the CIA ’s charter , one that comes with serious consequences including jail time .
Investigative journalists James Risen and Eric Lichtblau , who broke the NSA spy story in The New York Times in 2005 , reported July 11 that intelligence officials “ ‘ had difficulty citing specific instances ’ when the National Security Agency ’s wiretapping program contributed to successes against terrorists . ”
True enough as far as it goes , but perhaps these programs were highly efficacious in silencing those who were deemed politically suspect , even within the defense and security apparatus itself .
While major media in the United States insist that the Agency ’s assassination program was meant to target al - Qaeda assets , one question inevitably raises its head : did the CIA and allied intelligence services murder political opponents ?
Were covert actions carried out by the CIA–at home or on the soil of America ’s allies – “ against people they thought to be enemies of the state , ” as Hersh revealed ?
More pointedly , was the British bioweapons expert Dr. David Kelly , who leaked information to the press that the British and American governments had falsified the case for the 2003 invasion of Iraq , murdered for exposing the fraudulent evidence for war or worse , planning an exposé on the West ’s continued development of offensive biological weapons ?
Dr. David Kelly was an unlikely dissident .
In fact Kelly was n’t a dissident at all , but a prominent figure in Britain ’s bioweapons defense establishment .
The former head of the microbiology department at Porton Down , the UK ’s secret biological and chemical warfare research facility , at the time of his 2003 death Kelly was a consummate insider , a trusted keeper of state secrets ; dangerous and deadly secrets that could topple governments .
A civilian employee of Britain ’s Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) , Dr. Kelly was a biological weapons expert and former United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq .
His off - the - record conversations with journalist Andrew Gilligan about the British government ’s fraudulent claim that Iraq possessed “ weapons of mass destruction ” set off a firestorm that continues to smolder .
While David Kelly was n’t a spy , he did enjoy unprecedented access to the world of secret intelligence .
Indeed , according to author Gordon Thomas , Kelly had helped orchestrate the defection of a top Russian microbiologist Vladimir Pasechnik ( who turned up dead in 2001 , allegedly from a stroke ) and played a part in the FBI ’s investigation into the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States by trying to identify the origin of the Ames strain used in the fatal mailings .
In 2008 , the multiyear , multimillion dollar “ Amerithrax ” investigation was closed when the Bureau claimed that Dr. Bruce Ivins was the killer .
Ivins , a top anthrax expert at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) at Ft. Detrick in Maryland committed suicide .
According to the FBI version , the scientist killed himself just as the Bureau was about to arrest him for the crime .
Many were unconvinced that Ivins was the anthrax “ lone gunman . ”
Indeed , Sen. Patrick Leahy , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a target of the 2001 attacks , charged FBI Director Robert Mueller with staging a cover-up .
During 2008 hearings , Leahy angrily chided Mueller : “ If he is the one who sent the letter , I do not believe in any way , shape or manner that [ Ivins ] is the only person involved in this attack on Congress and the American people .
I do not believe that at all .
I believe there are others involved , either as accessories before or after the fact , I believe there are others who can be charged with murder . ”
Richard Spertzel , Ivins ’ former boss at Ft. Detrick told investigative journalists Bob Coen and Eric Nadler , “ He ’s dead and they can close the case and he ca n’t defend himself .
Nice and convenient is n’t it ? ”
Thomas claims that Kelly had worked with two American scientists , Benito Que and Don Wiley , who also turned up dead under highly suspicious circumstances .
It was originally claimed by authorities that Que was bludgeoned to death during an attempted carjacking in Miami .
“ Strangely enough , ” The Toronto Globe & Mail reported in 2002 , “ his body showed no signs of a beating .
Doctors then began to suspect a stroke . ”
Wiley , according to the Canadian newspaper “ was an expert on how the immune system responds to viral attacks such as the classic doomsday plagues of HIV , ebola and influenza . ”
After planning a trip to Graceland with his son police “ found his rental car on a bridge outside Memphis , Tenn .
His body was later found in the Mississippi River .
Forensic experts said he may have had a dizzy spell and have fallen off the bridge . ”
As it turned out , the pair were “ engaged in DNA sequencing that could provide ‘ a genetic marker based on genetic profiling ’. ”
Thomas writes :
“ The research could play an important role in developing weaponized pathogens to hit selected groups of humans–identifying them by race .
Two years ago , both men were found dead , in circumstances never fully explained . ”
Coincidence , or something more sinister ?
By summer 2003 , it was obvious that Saddam Hussein ’s regime did not possess WMDs and that the entire pretext for invading Iraq was based on a lie , concocted by the American regime , and in particular by Vice President Richard Cheney and the neoconservative mafia in control of America ’s defense and security apparatus .
Tasked to the Defence Intelligence Staff , Kelly read a draft of the Joint Intelligence Committee ’s ( JIC ) dossier on Iraq ’s reputed WMDs .
He was unhappy with many of the report ’s conclusions , according to multiple press reports .
He disputed the infamous claim that the Iraqi Army was capable of launching battlefield biological and chemical weapons within “ 45 minutes ” of an order from Saddam .
This dubious claim , one of many , was inserted into the report at the insistence of MI6 political masters acting through the JIC .
During a trip to Iraq in June 2003 , Kelly inspected what were alleged by the Bush administration to be “ mobile weapons laboratories , ” a claim infamously made by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell at the United Nations in February 2003 .
The Observer reported that a British scientist , who turned out to be David Kelly , told the newspaper : “ They are not mobile germ warfare laboratories .
You could not use them for making biological weapons .
They do not even look like them .
They are exactly what the Iraqis said they were –facilities for the production of hydrogen gas to fill balloons . ”
One of the key pieces of evidence to emerge was the JIC’s , and Kelly ’s , involvement with Operation Rockingham , a secret program for weapons inspections in Iraq .
Former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter told the Sunday Herald that Operation Rockingham was a “ dirty tricks ” unit “ designed specifically to produce misleading intelligence that Saddam has weapons of mass destruction to give the UK a justifiable excuse to wage war on Iraq . ”
Describing the unit as “ dangerous , ” Ritter told investigative journalist Neil Mackay , “ Rockingham was spinning reports and emphasizing reports that showed non-compliance ( by Iraq with UN inspections ) and quashing those which showed compliance .
It was cherry - picking intelligence . ”
A political firestorm ensued , which threatened the viability of Prime Minister Tony Blair ’s Labour government .
Heads would have to roll ; one of those heads as it turned out , would be David Kelly’s .
After an appearance before Parliament ’s Foreign Affairs Select Committee on July 15 , 2003 , Kelly was visibly upset by his shoddy treatment by MPs .
In an email to New York Times reporter Judith Miller , a serial - fabricator who had stitched - up evidence that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program , Kelly said there “ were many dark actors playing games . ”
During the whitewash known as The Hutton Inquiry , a British ambassador David Broucher reported a conversation he had with Kelly in Geneva .
The ambassador asked Kelly what would happen if Iraq were invaded ?
The bioweapons expert replied , “ I will probably be found dead in the woods . ”
Two days after giving testimony before Parliament he was .
“ A Wet Operation , a Wet Disposal ”
In The Strange Death of David Kelly , Liberal - Democratic MP Norman Baker builds a strong case that the scientist was murdered .
Despite Lord Hutton ’s dubious findings that Kelly killed himself , several troubling facts intruded to upend the British government ’s apple cart .
To summarize :
The lack of fingerprints found on the knife allegedly used by the scientist to slit his wrists ; the lack of blood found at the scene , despite a verdict that he had sliced open an artery ; unexplained contusions on Kelly ’s scalp ; the position of the body discovered by searchers differed markedly from that alleged by detectives ; bottled water , knife and wristwatch said to be found by detectives were not observed by the searchers who actually discovered the body ; eight computers removed from Kelly ’s home and office by MI6 agents ; missing dental records ; the level of painkillers found in Kelly ’s stomach was “ less than a third ” of what is considered a fatal overdose by medical experts .
On and on it goes …
One source told Baker that Dr. Kelly ’s death was “ a wet operation , a wet disposal , ” a term used in intelligence circles to denote an assassination .
Six years after Kelly ’s murder , a group of British doctors have announced that “ they were mounting a legal challenge to overturn the finding of suicide , ” The Mail on Sunday reports .
A 12 - page opinion concludes : “ The bleeding from Dr Kelly ’s ulnar artery is highly unlikely to have been so voluminous and rapid that it was the cause of death .
We advise the instructing solicitors to obtain the autopsy reports so that the concerns of a group of properly interested medical specialists can be answered . ”
One motive which may have led to Kelly ’s murder was that the scientist was writing a book “ exposing highly damaging government secrets before his mysterious death , ” The Sunday Express reported July 5 .
According to published reports , Kelly intended to reveal that he had warned Prime Minister Tony Blair “ there were no weapons of mass destruction anywhere in Iraq weeks before the British and American invasion . ”
Despite warnings that the book would breach Britain ’s draconian Officials Secrets Act , Kelly sought advice on how he might bring his findings into a publishable form .
These reports also suggest that Kelly threatened to “ lift the lid ” on a larger scandal , “ his own secret dealings in germ warfare with the apartheid regime in South Africa . ”
Investigative journalists Bob Coen and Eric Nadler in their book Dead Silence : Fear and Terror on the Anthrax Trail and a companion 90 - minute documentary , Anthrax War , provide startling evidence that Kelly ’s death is linked to a secret world of germ warfare research .
Indeed , according to Coen and Nadler , David Kelly ’s secret dealings included a connection with Dr. Wouter Basson , the cardiologist who was the former head of the South African apartheid regime ’s clandestine biological and chemical warfare program , Project Coast .
During Basson ’s 1999 trial and subsequent acquittal , evidence presented by some 150 witnesses , including operatives linked to South African snatch - and - kill squads , tied Basson to chemical and biological research used in extrajudicial executions by the apartheid regime .
It was further alleged that Project Coast had conducted active research into the fabrication of “ ethnic weapons ” that would specifically target South Africa ’s black population .
In Anthrax War , Basson states that his findings were shared with foreign scientists , including those affiliated with weapons research in Britain and the United States .
According to a 2001 piece in The New Yorker ,
Basson had already put the fear into American intelligence during his T.R.C. [ Truth and Reconciliation Committee ] appearance , where he handed over fourteen pages of notes from a visit to the United States in 1981 .
American Air Force officers had been eager to develop joint “ medical projects ” with South Africa , he wrote .
…
Basson says that in 1995 his life was threatened on the street by a C.I.A. agent .
The American Embassy in Pretoria admits privately that the United States government is “ terribly concerned ” that Basson may start talking about his sources of information and technology .
The Embassy hopes that an impression of “ unwitting coöperation ” is all that emerges in the way of an American connection .
( William Finnegan , “ The Poison Keeper , ” The New Yorker , January 15 , 2001 )
Coen and Nadler uncovered evidence that Kelly had discovered a “ Porton Down - South Africa connection ” linked to a global bioweapons black market .
The investigative journalists told the Express , “ We have proved there is a black ­market in anthrax .
David Kelly was of particular interest to us because he was a world expert on anthrax and he was involved in some degree with assisting the secret germ warfare programme in apartheid South Africa . ”
Andrew Mackinlay , a British MP blamed for humiliating Kelly “ to the point of suicide ” started “ asking questions in the House of Lords ” after the scientist ’s death “ about Kelly ’s relationship with these bad actors in Pretoria , even making inquiries about South African links to Pasechnik ’s Regma firm . ”
Founded in 2000 by the deceased scientist , Regma Bio Technologies was headquartered on the Porton Down campus and had signed a contract with the U.S. Navy for anti-anthrax research .
What Mackinlay discovered about the entire operation was highly disturbing to say the least .
His inquiry sparked “ the convening of an extraordinary ‘ handling strategy meeting ’ involving thirteen officials from different government agencies .
But any and all information about UK - South African germ work was withheld from the MP . ”
Mackinlay told Coen and Nadler , “ This is one of the most closely guarded secrets of the British government . ”
The question is , did David Kelly threaten to reveal these “ closely guarded secrets ” in the book he was preparing , and was this a motive for certain “ dark actors ” to eliminate a person now considered “ an enemy of the state ” ?
These programs are not Cold War relics .
Biological weapons research continues today and remain one of America ’s most deadly secrets .
As the 2001 anthrax attacks which employed a weaponized version of the bacteria to sow terror , and subsequent FBI cover - up illustrate , such programs remain fully operational .
The evidence suggests that Dr. David Kelly , as Norman Baker avers “ may have signed his own death warrant ” by threatening to reveal this secret underworld menacing all humanity with unimaginable horrors .
That an out - of - control agency like the CIA has the means , motives and opportunity to silence critics and that “ no geographical limitations ” were placed “ on the agency ’s actions , ” should give pause to a society that considers itself a democracy .
Media revelations so far have suggested that the CIA and Special Operations Forces were assembling teams to “ put bullets in [ the al Qaeda leaders ’ ] heads ” as The Wall Street Journal reported .
But perhaps the Obama administration ’s trepidation in exploring this and other Bush - era programs through congressional hearings or the mechanism of a special prosecutor has much to do with fear of opening a proverbial can of worms .
One never knows where such an investigation might lead .
Millionaire Migrations
The world ’s rank and file of millionaires are in for quite a shake - up .
Here ’s some takeaways from our latest read :
The 2009 World Wealth Report , by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini .
First , the number of global millionaires fell at a record rate in 2008 , led by North Americans .
The credit crisis wiped out 15 % of the world ’s millionaire population , now at just 8.6 million “ high net worth individuals ( HNWI ) , ” as Merrill puts it .
The total worth of the world ’s wealthy fell about $ 7 trillion last year , to $ 32.8 trillion .
North America was the greatest victim of 2008 , shedding 600,000 millionaires and roughly $ 2.8 trillion in HNWI wealth .
Of course , we ’re still at the top … but for how long ?
Check out this chart :
We should hedge this chart a bit : First , it ’s from Merrill Lynch … need we say more ?
They use some rosy projections for global economic and market recovery for the next few years .
Expecting the coffers of HNWI to grow at an annualized rate of 8.1 % over the next four years is the same kind of Ivy League MBA thinking that caused Merrill ’s collapse and subsequent fire sale to Bank of America .
That being said , we would n’t be surprised if their forecast comes true .
Simple ratios alone make an Asian takeover seem inevitable : One out of every 195 North Americans are millionaires .
One in about 1,700 are Asian .
( This would be one of many reasons we ’re burning the midnight oil on a BRIC report , just for you … stay tuned . )
Chris Floyd Published : 16 June 2009 Hits : 12538
Events are unfolding in Iran rapidly and chaotically , with no clear indication yet where they may lead .
( In the short term , that is .
One is always mindful of Zhou Enlai 's response when he was asked for his opinion on the historical impact of the French Revolution : " It 's too early to tell . " )
Solid information is still scanty and piecemeal , so it is difficult to offer any telling insights on the developments and their possible implications .
So the following are just a few tentative observations .
It does seem clear , by all the evidence so far -- particularly studies of past voting patterns -- that the final vote totals were rigged and padded rather clumsily ( much as they are in Russia , for example ) , although that does n't necessarily mean that Ahmadinajad actually lost .
Again , we just do n't have enough information on this point yet .
It would be good if he did lose and had to step down -- but I think it 's highly unlikely that the powerful elites who back him will allow this to happen .
Then again , the Iranians are in general a braver , bolder people than some other peoples we might mention , who in recent memory sat slack - jawed and supine when their franchise was stripped from them in broad daylight by powerful elites .
The Iranian people have already overthrown one seemingly powerful and permanently entrenched regime in the last 30 years , and could well do so again -- or at least force the current regime to become more open and humane .
In any case , the hundreds of thousands of ordinary Iranians who have taken to the streets , risking -- and in some cases , losing -- life and limb to demand their rights shame the bloated , bored , distracted masses of the American empire ( and its British satrapy ) , who have watched numbly and dumbly as their liberties have been systematically dismantled , their public treasuries looted by plutocrats and war profiteers , and their own children thrown into murderous wars of aggression and occupation .
But while the Iranians continue to work out their own destiny , coverage of the events in the Western press has largely fallen into the expected -- indeed , predestined -- patterns .
Western media have swiftly fitted the Iranian unrest into the now - standard " color revolution " template -- seen in Serbia , Georgia , Lebanon , and other -- where plucky , pro-Western ( i.e. , reliably pliable to American interests ) forces rise up against their oppressors .
The leaders of these forces are invariably depicted as " moderates " committed to installing Western - style governments and liberal , Western - style social orders , etc .
For example , the recent election in Lebanon was presented as a great triumph for the " pro-Western March 14 Faction " led by the son of slain tycoon Rafik Hariri -- even though this " pro-Western " faction includes Sunni extremists aligned with Osama bin Laden .
Similarly , the Iranian opposition leader Mir Hussein Moussavi is universally depicted as a " moderate . "
Yet , as Professor As'ad AbuKhalil points out , when Moussavi was Iran 's prime minister under Ayatollah Khomeini , he " presided over a regime far more oppressive than Ahmadinajad's . "
AbuKhalil 's take on the hypocrisy of the Western media coverage on Iran is worth quoting more fully :
... there is so much hypocrisy in the Western coverage and official reactions to the developments .
Most glaring for me was the statement by the secretary - general of the UN who insisted on the respect of the will of the Iranian people .
Would that US designate utter such words , say , about Egypt , Iraq , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Morocco and other dictatorships that are approved by the US ?
... I am in no way sympathetic to Moussavi .
He is a man who suddenly discovered the virtues of democracy .
When he was prime minister back in the 1980s , he presided over a regime far more oppressive than Ahmadinajad's .
And why has no Western media really commented on his rhetoric during his own campaign : the man kept saying that he wants a " return " to the teachings of Khomeini .
I in no way support a man who wants a " return " to the teachings of Khomeini .
Of course , Moussavi -- like some other politicians we could mention -- has now become , for millions of people , an emblem for genuine changes and reforms that he probably has no desire or intention to enact , even if given the chance .
Like Barack Obama , he is of the power structure , and would , in end , no doubt act for the power structure .
( Albeit with minor mitigations which , as we 've often noted in regard to American politics , can also mean real differences in the lives of many individuals , and thus are not to be airily dismissed -- although such an acknowledgement in no way requires an endorsement or acceptance of the overall power structure in which these mitigations occur , or of any particular mitigator in that system . )
But as we noted above , the Iranian people have already demonstrated the courage to stand up for their rights .
Unlike the acquiescent Americans , seemingly content with cosmetic makeovers of the imperial management , the Iranians may yet force their emblem to more fully inhabit the role that the times -- and their own ardent desires for change -- have created for him .
COLUMBIA , South Carolina ( CNN ) --
The attorney general of South Carolina on Tuesday asked the state law enforcement division to review Gov. Mark Sanford 's travel records after the governor admitted to more visits with his mistress than previously disclosed .
Gov. Mark Sanford has said it 's better for him to keep his governorship to " learn lessons . "
" In light of the governor 's disclosure of additional travel today , I have requested that SLED conduct a preliminary review of all Governor Sanford 's travel records to determine if any laws have been broken or any state funds misused , " Attorney General Henry McMaster said in a statement .
After returning last week from a secret trip to Argentina that his staff and wife did n't know about , the Republican governor admitted to an extramarital affair and said he had seen his mistress three times in the past year .
But he told The Associated Press on Tuesday he had met with Maria Belen Chapur seven times , including five visits in the past 12 months .
Sanford also told the AP he'd " crossed lines " with other women , although Chapur was the only one he had sex with .
Watch what Sanford plans to do with wife »
The review by law enforcement officials would be the first formal probe into whether Sanford abused his power while carrying on his affair .
McMaster , a Republican , has so far been reluctant to move forward with calls for an investigation into Sanford , saying he is wary of mixing legal matters with political score - settling from longtime Sanford opponents .
McMaster is running for governor next year .
His opponents say his hesitancy to investigate Sanford is meant to prevent a Sanford resignation , which would elevate Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer to the top office .
Bauer , also mulling a run at the governor 's mansion , would then be able to run as an incumbent in next year 's race .
Sanford said in a statement Tuesday that he 's " pleased that SLED will look into this matter . "
" There 's been a lot of speculation and innuendo on whether or not public moneys were used to advance my admitted unfaithfulness .
To be very clear : no public money was ever used in connection with this . "
Sanford spokesman Joel Sawyer confirmed Tuesday that Sanford had met with his mistress more times than he originally admitted .
Two of the meetings in the past year included multiple - night stays in New York , Sanford told the AP .
Sanford told the AP he met with Chapur a third time in New York on what was intended to be a goodbye visit .
Sanford was accompanied by his spiritual adviser , the AP reported .
Sanford also told the AP of two nonromantic encounters , including their first meeting in 2001 in Uruguay and getting coffee in New York during the 2004 Republican National Convention .
" There was some kind of connection from the very beginning , " he told the AP .
He said his experiences with other women took place outside of the United States while he was married , but before he knew Chapur , the AP reported .
Since Sanford 's admission last week , there have been growing calls for him to step down , with critics saying he 's not able to steer the state out of its economic crisis .
Republican Larry Grooms , who is running for governor in 2010 , told CNN Tuesday that Sanford " is incapable of leading because of his behavior . "
Unlike many of his colleagues in the chamber , most of whom have remained silent on the resignation question , Grooms , a key conservative ally of the governor , has been a supporter of Sanford 's fiscally conservative agenda in the Senate .
But Grooms said he told Sanford by phone last Thursday that he thought the governor should resign .
Sanford said he disagreed .
" He indicated he believed that his only chance for redemption was to stay in office , " Grooms said .
" To me that does n't serve any purpose well .
That does n't serve the people .
It 's not about him ; it 's about governing the people of the state . "
On Monday , three Republicans in the South Carolina state legislature spoke out against Sanford , saying the best thing for him to do in the wake of last week 's scandal is resign .
Sanford wrote in a message to his political action committee e-mail list on Monday that while he considered resigning , " I would ultimately be a better person and of more service in whatever doors
God opened next in life if I stuck around to learn lessons rather than running and hiding down at the farm . "
In addition , the governor made a round of phone calls to county GOP chairmen around the state to apologize and ask them for a chance to work together over the next 18 months to help restore the public trust , according a Republican source .
State Rep. Nikki Haley , another Sanford ally running for governor next year , said last week that the governor should stay in office because otherwise , Bauer would assume the top office .
Haley said that would be a step backward for the conservative reform movement in the state .
Anti-Sanford sentiment is also set to play out in the public eye next week .
Glenn McCall , one of South Carolina 's three Republican National Committee members , told CNN that he and other conservative activists are organizing a rally for Wednesday or Thursday at the State House in Columbia to demand Sanford 's resignation .
McCall said he has lined up nearly 400 people ready to attend the rally .
McCall said the event is being organized , in part , because not enough Republican leaders in the legislature have publicly called for Sanford to step down .
" There is no leadership out of our Republican majorities in the House and the Senate , so we have to go down to the State House steps and have a rally , " he said .

A fejlesztést megkísérelték Chrome - ra is , egyelőre sikertelenül .
Any time a motorist is stopped by a police officer , insists Shreveport , Louisiana Mayor Cedric Glover , “ Your rights … have been suspended . ”
This includes not only the freedom of movement , but also , in the event the officer inquires as to whether the driver is carrying a weapon , “ Your right to be able to hold on to your weapon and say whether [ you ] have a weapon or not ” — as well as the right to retain possession of that weapon , should the officer decide to confiscate it from you .
Should you choose not to answer the question , or answer it in the negative , the officer could still choose , “ in the interest of officer safety , to secure you in a safe position ” — this most likely means outside the car with your hands cuffed behind your back — “ and then do an appropriate inspection of your vehicle . ”
The phrase “ appropriate inspection ” is more honestly rendered “ Unconstitutional warrantless search . ”
Should the police officer then turn up a firearm or other weapon in the car , the driver “ would be guilty or potentially guilty of even a more severe offense ” than whatever he had allegedly done to precipitate the traffic stop , according to Mayor Glover .
Police officers , according to Glover , are invested with “ a power that the President of the United States does not have … and that is the ability to be able to suspend your rights . ”
This is “ one of the things that I say to each and every one of the police officers who graduates from the Shreveport Police Academy since I ’ve been mayor . ”
Fortunately for the public , one supposes , Mr. Glover remembers the lesson that Peter Parker learned from his kindly and sagacious uncle Ben — that is , with great power comes great responsibility .
“ You have to understand there is a great deal of power that is vested within … the law enforcement personnel of this country , ” Glover insists .
“ It ’s why there is a great deal of responsibility that has to go along with it . ”
Glover offered those remarkable observations , and many others like them , in a recorded phone call with Shreveport resident Robert Baillio .
The Making of a Police ...
Lawrence , Steve Best Price : $ 18.39 Buy New $ 23.95 ( as of 01:45 EST - Details )
Mr. Baillio had called to complain about a recent traffic stop in which an SPD officer , who — before dealing with any other matter of business — asked if Baillio had a firearm , then temporarily seized it from him .
Louisiana law recognizes the right of the state ’s residents to carry loaded weapons in their vehicles , and Baillio has a state - issued concealed carry permit — that is , a piece of paper in which the state generously recognizes one facet of Baillio ’s innate right to bear arms .
According to Baillio ’s account , he was cordial and polite when he was stopped after supposedly neglecting to use a turn signal .
That this was almost certainly a pretext stop is illustrated by the fact that Baillio never received a ticket .
Supplemental evidence is offered by the fact that the conversation between the officer and Baillio focused entirely on the issue of gun ownership , including a question about Baillio ’s membership in the National Rifle Association .
Baillio does n’t conceal his NRA membership ; it ’s advertised by a sticker on the rear windshield of his truck , as are his very passionate views of the right to armed self - defense .
“ Armed We Are Citizens !
Un - Armed We Are Subjects ! ” exclaims another bumper sticker , expressing a core truth of our republican heritage .
Yet another sticker displays various kinds and grades of ammunition captioned by the directive , “ Celebrate Diversity . ”
It ’s the safest of bets that what triggered the stop , as it were , was not a traffic infraction by Baillio , but rather the police officer ’s conditioned reflex to treat the public expression of pro-gun ownership sentiments as innately suspicious .
Terrorism and Tyranny : ...
Bovard , James Best Price : $ 3.78 Buy New $ 14.51 ( as of 01:40 EST - Details )
In brief , Baillio was a victim of political profiling of the sort being encouraged by the Department of Homeland Security and the totalitarian “ watchdog ” groups who have spent decades indoctrinating the police .
In his telephone chat with Glover , Baillio — who was persistent but unfailingly polite — pointed out that he “ answered the [ officer ’s ] question honestly and he disarmed me . ”
“ Which would be appropriate and proper action , sir , ” replied Glover .
“ The fact that you gave the correct answer — it simply means that you did what you were supposed to do and that is to give that weapon to the police officer so he could appropriately place it in a place where it would be no threat to you , to him , or to anyone in the general public . ”
“ Well , you know , he still had a gun , ” observed Baillio , hoping to underscore the fact that guns — as objects , rather than actors — do not pose a “ threat ” in and of themselves .
“ How is he — “
“ Because he ’s a police officer , ” interjected Baillio before he could finish the question .
“ As I ’ve just related to you , that police officer has powers , sir , that you do not have . ”
Let ’s unpack that reply , shall we ?
From Glover ’s perspective , it is only when firearms are in the hands of people other than the state ’s uniformed enforcers / oppressors that they constitute a threat , not only to the public and those in charge of exercising official violence but also to the private gun owner himself .
Glover , a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns , clearly believes that any firearms in civilian hands should be considered illicit .
This is , in both a cultural and constitutional sense , entirely un-American .
Interestingly , it is in harmony with the UN ’s position , however , as summarized in the world body ’s 2000 agitprop film Armed to the Teeth : The World - Wide Plague of Small Arms .
That film insists that the only “ legal ” weapons are those “ used by armies and police forces to protect us ” — as if the word “ protection ” describes the uses to which weapons are put by the enforcement organs of the criminal states that compose the UN .
It is his attitudes toward civilian firearms ownership and the plenary power of police , not his ethnicity or any similar accident of birth , that would make Glover a very suitable ruler of any of the scores of squalid Third World thugocracies represented in the UN .
According to Glover , a police officer may properly disarm any civilian at any time , and the civilian ’s duty is to surrender his gun — willingly , readily , cheerfully , without cavil or question .
This is because police officers , as numinous beings anointed by the Holy State , exude the essence of pure goodness and would never commit acts of criminal violence against disarmed civilians .
Tell that to Angela Garbarino , a woman who was arrested by the SPD last year for DWI and wound up lying in a pool of her own blood after being “ subdued ” in a police holding cell .
Gaps in the security camera record of the incident occur at convenient intervals , so it ’s not clear exactly how Garbarino wound up bloodied on the floor .
In a photograph taken later Angela displays the marks of a severe beating , including two black eyes , a broken nose , and a cut on the forehead that required stitches .
The Best of William Norman Grigg
New Zealand man Nai Yin Xue , who abandoned his young daughter at a Melbourne train station in 2007 , has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife An An Liu .
Xue still protests his innocence but did not react as the judge handed down the sentence in Auckland this morning .
Justice Hugh Williams ordered the martial arts expert to serve a minimum non-parole period of 12 years for strangling his wife .
After dumping her body in the boot of his work car , Xue flew to Melbourne , where he abandoned his daughter .
He then fled to the United States , where he was caught by a group of Chinese - Americans who recognised him from the TV show America 's Most Wanted .
Justice Williams told Xue he subjected his wife to excruciating terror .
" There is also the cruelty you displayed in abandoning your daughter , " he said .
Xue told his lawyer he now regrets leaving the child in Australia .
The five - year - old is now being raised by her maternal grandmother in China .
Xue 's lawyer , Chris Comeskey , has indicated he will lodge an appeal for his client .
Earlier this week it was revealed that New Zealand authorities warned Xue was capable of killing his wife a year before he committed the murder .
In 2006 , he appeared in an Auckland court after punching his 27 - year - old wife in the face .
He held a knife to her stomach and told her " I 'm going to kill you " .
But according to New Zealand 's Sunday Times newspaper , the judge let Xue off with a warning .
Police told the court Xue was " fully capable of killing the victim due to his training and discipline " .
They also said pictures of Xue in the family 's home striking martial arts poses had " created a climate of fear " .
In an interview in Mandarin to the New Zealand Chinese Herald earlier this month , Xue said he was innocent and would write a book so people could know the truth about what happened .
Xue said he passes the time in prison playing pool and cards , and says once he accepted the fact that he was in prison , it became just like another nine - to - five job .
He also said he was developing new martial arts moves in prison .
More than 30 people were injured in the Baghdad bomb blast
At least six people have been killed and about 40 injured in a series of bomb attacks in Iraq , officials say .
At least four policemen were killed by a roadside bomb in a village near the town of Falluja , west of Baghdad .
A car bomb killed at least two people at a bus terminal in a Shia district in the south of the capital .
The attacks come less than a week before US soldiers pull out of Iraqi cities , and a day after a bomb blast killed nearly 70 people in Baghdad .
More than 130 people were injured in the blast in a market place in Sadr City , a predominantly Shia area of the Iraqi capital .
Under an agreement with the Iraqi authorities , most of the 133,000 US troops in Iraq are due to leave the country 's cities and towns and withdraw to military bases by 30 June .
Combat operations across Iraq are due to end by September 2010 and all US troops will be out of the country by the end of 2011 .
Surge in violence
In the Falluja attack , the policemen were killed when an improvised explosive device destroyed their patrol vehicle , officials said .
Falluja , in Anbar province , was once a major bastion of the insurgency , but the security situation has improved there in recent years .
The Baghdad car bomb , which killed two people , exploded in a bus station in the Baya district .
About 31 people were injured .
Nine US soldiers were also injured on Thursday when two roadside bombs hit their patrol in eastern Baghdad , the US military said .
Despite a recent surge in violence , the US military has said American troops would leave Iraqi cities as planned next Tuesday .
The Associated Press has an ongoing problem with misappropriation of AP articles .
Facts are not copyrightable , but the AP says they find entire articles reprinted by websites that are n’t licensed to publish AP stories .
So the AP made a confusing announcement this week , outlining a new approach in protecting its content .
To some , the AP seemed to be suggesting they could actually prevent people from copying their articles the way DRM can prevent copying of movies and music .
But it was pointed out that copying text is pretty trivial , so this sort of “ DRM for text ” is not possible .
But what if there were something low - tech the AP could include in its articles that actually made a difference ?
It wo n’t physically prevent copying , but it just might deter it .
There was quite a buzz in the news a few years ago when a Newcastle University research team discovered that people are more honest when eyes are watching them , even if the eyes are fake .
At the time , psychologists said , “ It does raise the possibility that you could get people to behave more cooperatively … by putting up pictures of eyes , ” and , “ It would be interesting to know how one can apply these sorts of findings more generally in organisational structures and in society in general to maximise upon honourable and altruistic behaviour . ”
In the original test , a photocopy of eyes placed above an “ honesty box ” in a canteen made people more likely to pay when taking a drink .
If a mere photocopy will make people honest , maybe a more abstracted set of eyes can still have an effect .
I propose an experiment .
This is how the AP currently formats its datelines :
NEW YORK ( AP ) — A judge ruled Thursday …
I propose a small change :
NEW YORK ( AP ) Ó › Ò — A judge ruled Thursday …
Yes , that ’s right .
I ’m suggesting that the AP begin putting a little face in all their datelines .
It ’s the Smiley as copy protection .
The AP could come up with their own set of ascii eyes , brand it , and include it in every dateline from now on .
They could even pretend it has some other official function , like it symbolizes the AP keeping its eyes out for news .
But people would see it and know what it means : “ This is an AP article .
Please do n’t steal it unless you would do so even with your own mother watching . ”
Then , when wayward bloggers prepare to copy and paste an AP article , they will be faced by those staring eyes .
Maybe they ’ll think twice .
Maybe they wo n’t even know why .
And then , when they choose to summarize the facts of the article instead of copying and pasting it , the smiley as copy protection will have done its job .
When Microsoft launched their much - touted new search engine Bing last week it generated a lots of press and despite a somewhat muted expectations , it turned - out to be something of a hit .
But lost in all the broader buzz about Bing was some news for developers : Bing has an API .
We 've now added a new Bing API Profile with technical details .
Like the Bing service itself , the API is a re-branded and enhanced version of the Microsoft 's Live Search API .
Just days before the official Bing launch , the API was updated with many of the features of the new Bing service .
That earlier announcement for Live Search 2.0 has the highlights :
Developers can now request data in JSON and XML formats .
The SOAP interface that the Live Search API required has also been retained .
Requested data can be narrowed to one of the following source types : web , news , images , phonebook , spell - checker , related queries , and Encarta instant answer .
It is now possible to send requests in OpenSearch - compliant RSS format for web , news , image and phonebook queries .
Client applications will be able to combine any number of different data source types into a single request with a single query string .
The Bing API is part of a larger set of web application development services called " Project Silk Road . "
Microsoft 's Bing Developer Center describes how Bing fits into the Silk Road project :
A key part of Project Silk Road is a re-architected Bing API that offers open , flexible options for building or enhancing your site or applications .
Developing an application with the new API is straightforward : Choose a SourceType ( or SourceTypes - you 're not limited to one ) , choose an output protocol ( JSON , SOAP , or XML ) and then customize according to your needs .
All you need to get going is an AppID .
More detailed information on features specific to the various data source types can be found at the MSDN website .
In a world where APIs are often limited in many ways , it 's notable that in addition to these technical updates that Microsoft has removed the API usage quotas found in the Live Search API , with the requirement that it be used for " user - facing applications " only .
Note that the terms of use have also been loosened to allow more flexible presentation options such as " no restrictions on ordering and blending search results " .
To access the service , developers must create an AppID using an ( anachronistically named ) Windows Live ID login .
US - based developers may also choose to participate in a pilot program to generate revenue from their search applications .
Given that Microsoft has often found themselves a distant third in search queries behind competitors Yahoo ! and Google ( Microsoft recently accounted for just over 8 % of all search queries , compared to Google 's 64 % ) , the prospect of a better search engine could be good for search competition .
And with the new Bing API there 's also more opportunities for developers who opt to build on this new feature rich and standards - aware API .
A chihuahua - cross by the name of Jack bore the full wrath of the Cincinnati police department , when he was tased and then shot three times after biting an officer on the hand .
Scott and Sharon Bullock returned home from a funeral to find the dog ’s blood and three bullets on their front porch .
Police claim that they had “ no option ” but to shoot the dog , which had been a present to their 12 - year - old son , after it attacked people in the neighborhood and then bit an officer multiple times .
Lieutenant Paul Hartinger of the Blue Ash police department told WCPO :
As badly as the officer was getting bitten , he had to do something to protect himself .
They first chose physical means , then a Taser , and when those two did n’t work , he had no option but to shoot the dog .
According to Scott Bullock , the couple ’s five - year - old son has been left distraught by the incident :
He ‘ barks ’ for him .
He ’d ‘ bark ’ and Jack would always come to him , so he ’s outside going ‘ Bark bark bark , ’ hoping he ’s gonna come back .
It ’s heartbreaking .
The police officer in question was allegedly bitten 17 times on one hand and 9 times on the other .

Hearing about new social networks usually makes us cringe .
Surely by now , all relevant communities of people have a place to share ideas , photos and blogs .
But at this years DEMOFall , Seattle ’s LiveMocha launches with a interesting twist .
The company mainly focuses on teaching you a new language using the do - it - yourself immersion methods of the popular Rosetta Stone software , but it has blended in a social network to enrich the experience .
LiveMocha is not the only start - up hovering around this concept .
It has a competitor , Mango , that also offers free courses , 100 lessons each , in over 13 different languages .
But even though Mango offers more languages ( LiveMocha ’s got six right now ) it ’s the social network , paired with its VoIP capabilities and chat rooms , that sets it apart .
The key is that , unlike so many of the wannabes in the social network game , LiveMocha ’s social network is not the central focus of the site but simply a feature .
The bulk of LiveMocha ’s site shares much with Mango , offering around 160 hours of content per language , spread across a number of increasingly advanced courses designed to totally immerse you in a new tongue .
Each course will take a dedicated student about a trimester to finish , but , thanks to LiveMocha ’s social networking features , the learning can extend far beyond the structured content , into online conversations with native speakers .
The social networking is designed to foster a tit - for - tat exchange : if I want to learn French and you speak French and want to learn English , LiveMocha uses a very basic search that makes it easy for us to connect .
You can , of course , create a profile , upload your picture , add some contact information and interests , add friends , and so on , but really , the only important part is what language you speak and what language you want to learn .
However , the company has added some small but nice touches .
For example , when you add friends , you can see how far along they are in their lessons and compare your performance to theirs , creating social pressure to push yourself forward .
Refreshingly , LiveMocha is not hinging its business model on advertising .
Instead , the site intends to add content accessible only by subscription , and may open up a virtual marketplace for language tutors and take a percentage fee of the transactions .
Of course , this all assumes that LiveMocha will be able to attract enough users worldwide to fill out the ranks of people willing to help each other learn languages — no mean feat .
In its press materials , LiveMocha notes that no real innovations have occurred in the self - taught language - learning market since the advent of CD - ROMs .
Indeed , Rosetta Stone , the market ’s dominant player , is still pushing its product on CDs , and charging a bundle for them .
Considering that the language - learning market ( on and off computers ) is an estimated $ 20 billion , there ’s no shortage of demand .
It was only a matter of time before someone would leverage the web ‘s new technologies to take a shot at the old guard .
( CNN ) --
We all know what happens when urban sprawl gets out of control : Commutes back up , smog thickens , and concrete suburbs gobble up green spaces .
But what about " ocean sprawl " ?
Until recently , no one gave that idea much thought .
But the oceans , like the land , have gotten crowded , and now scientists and policy makers are looking for ways to plan ocean development -- with the aim of preventing our public - owned seas from turning into sprawling , watery versions of Houston , Texas , or Atlanta , Georgia .
" The oceans are kind of the last frontier for use and development , " said Amanda Leland , ocean policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund , an advocacy group .
" Even in the 1970s we thought that the oceans were limitless resources of fish .
We know today now that fisheries are collapsing all around the world . "
In an attempt to address this and other crowding problems , governments are for the first time devising comprehensive plans for their marine waters .
The Obama administration on June 12 announced a task force devoted to federal ocean planning .
By September , the group must recommend a national policy on the subject that 's designed to protect ocean ecology , address climate change and promote sustainable ocean economies .
A handful of states , including Massachusetts and Rhode Island , are charting similar courses .
Massachusetts on June 30 published a draft plan for its coastal waters , which is scheduled to be finalized by the end of the year .
One of the state 's main aims is to make space for two ocean wind farms -- taking up 2 percent of the state 's waters -- without angering fishing industries , killing whales or harming ecosystems .
Internationally , several European countries , including Denmark , Belgium , the United Kingdom and France , are pioneering the new field , said Fanny Douvere , a co-principal investigator at UNESCO 's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission .
Ocean advocates say these planning processes are urgently needed and have been a long time in coming .
One reason it 's taken so long is that people can't see that the oceans are filling up , said Sandra Whitehouse , a marine biologist and senior adviser at the Ocean Conservancy , an environmental group .
" The majority of the ecosystem is under the water , " Whitehouse said .
" So it 's out of sight , out of mind .
We 're only looking at the surface . "
Beneath the water , though , overfishing has caused some fish stocks to collapse .
By one report , wild fish could disappear by mid-century .
The energy sector threatens to take up large chunks of water .
Shipping lanes cross the paths of endangered whales .
Fish farms are growing in some countries .
Climate change is altering ocean chemistry .
And power lines , reefs , lobster traps and sunken ships compete for seafloor space .
In Europe 's North Sea , expanding industries have tried to claim three times the amount of ocean space than is available , said Douvere , of UNESCO .
What happens on land also affects the oceans .
A 2003 report by the Pew Oceans Commission says that each year , coastal development destroys 20,000 acres of estuaries and near - coast fish habitat .
Furthermore , pavement on land creates " expressways " for oil and other pollutants to run into the ocean .
" Every eight months , nearly 11 million gallons of oil run off our streets and driveways into our waters -- the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill , " the report says .
When the renewable energy sector started trying to move into the sea , the situation went from crowded to unmanageable and without a clear plan , said Whitehouse , of the Ocean Conservancy .
" There 's a lot of pressure to be able to harness this energy , " she said , " but it 's very important that this be done in a proactive and comprehensive way , because we also have so many important economic aspects of our oceans . "
Since there are new uses but not new space , planning is necessary , said Charles Ehler , another co-principal investigator at the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission .
He added , " There 's not enough space for everything , and there are going to have to be trade - offs that are made . "
Current efforts focus on broad public interest rather than specific conflicts , Ehler said .
Until now , the ocean primarily was divvied up in a sort of " free - for - all " in which " whoever gets there first gets the access , " he said .
Leland , of the Environmental Defense Fund , said the patchwork of federal agencies managing the oceans in the United States contributes to the problem .
More than 140 federal laws govern the ocean 's use ; and six federal departments , along with dozens of agencies , are in charge of implementing those laws , according to the Pew Oceans Commission report .
Charles M. Wahle , a marine ecologist and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , said Obama 's ocean - planning efforts are a complete shift in thinking .
" We 're acknowledging that we want and need to use the ocean in a lot of different ways , " he said .
" They all have standing , and we need to figure out a way to allocate them fairly and sustainably . "
He added , " Fifty years from now , you should be able to go to a place [ in the ocean ] and know what will be happening there . "
There are skeptics of the shift .
Commercial fisheries are hampered by current regulations and could be further harmed if the ocean is divided up among too many groups , said Jim Ruhle , president of Commercial Fishermen of America , an industry group .
" We make our livelihoods from that ocean , and we want to make sure that we have reasonable plans in effect to allow that to take place , " he said .
Some other fishing groups oppose new ocean uses , like offshore wind energy , entirely .
Despite this new emphasis on planning , there 's still a chance that ocean waters could go the way of haphazard cities .
" The proof will be in the pudding , " said Wahle , of NOAA .
But he said it 's exciting that so many groups are on board for a new way of thinking .
" If we do our jobs right , overall , the oceans will be healthier , ecosystems will be more productive , people will derive more services and benefits and value from those ecosystems , " he said , " and industry will be able to plan and commit and invest in ways that actually work . "

¿ Utopía o cambio de mentalidad ?
Así es como se presenta el concepto más radical del lado sostenible .
El decrecimiento toma por bandera “ lo suficiente es lo mejor ” lo cual implica el no crecer por crecer , sino intentar cambiar nuestros valores y necesidades .
Y desde esta nueva actitud poder consumir menos y en consecuencia , entrar en otra dinámica vital , mucho más en sintonía con la naturaleza , que no cree desigualdades y podamos conseguir un mundo más justo .
El mayor exponente de esta filosofía es el protagonista de la entrada de hoy , Serge Latouche .
La idea que nos presenta este movimiento no es vivir peor para salvar el planeta .
El concepto va mucho más allá .
La sociedad se ha abandonado a los designios de la economía capitalista , con el consumismo por bandera , lo cual está provocando gente tremendamente infeliz .
Además de esta infelicidad causamos un grave problema al planeta y en consecuencia a nosotros mismos , de alguna forma nos convertimos en verdugos a la vez que victimas .
Lo que nos propone Serge Latouche es vivir mucho mejor , pero con mucho menos , y esto sólo es posible desde un cambio de raíz , volviendo a poner en juego los valores de amistad , familia , solidaridad y cooperación .
Esta evolución no vendrá desde la cúspide de la pirámide , sino desde abajo , desde asociaciones , y entidades con una escala intermedia que se puedan autogestionar , que permita relocalizar la economía , cuestionando los mercados financieros y encontrando el sentido en una producción local y ecológica .
De hecho , los gobiernos no hacen sino lanzarnos otra vez contra el mismo muro , ya que se vuelven a activar los mismos sectores que nos han llevado a la crisis .
El decrecimiento nos recuerda que el petróleo se está acabando y no se ha apostado de una manera seria por otras alternativas ( en quince años un barril costará 400 dólares ) , y hará inviable cosas tan comunes hoy , como la aviación civil .
Mientras tanto seguimos gastando 6 litros de gasolina por cada kilo de carne que se consume .
Serge apunta “ estas vacas son viables debido a que fuera de Europa se usan extensos territorios para cultivar sojas y otros forrajes para sus piensos , cuya superficie equivale a siete veces la de Europa .
A cambio nosotros les exportamos residuos ”
Serge también nos habla de cómo en el día a día se pueden hacer cosas muy sencillas como “ no cojo el avión , prefiero el tren .
Si cogemos la bicicleta , mejor .
No me gusta beber el agua en botellas de plástico , prefiero las biocooperativas a los grandes almacenes . ”
El pensador francés nos recuerda que la corriente del decrecimiento , no quiere un crecimiento negativo .
El nombre no es la explicación directa de su concepto , de hecho Latouche habla de cómo sería más ajustado decir acrecimiento en vez de decrecimiento .
Como resumen del planteamiento podríamos decir que viene a defender cómo el desarrollo sea sostenible o no , no es posible , pues directamente hace daño a la madre naturaleza .
Plantean el ejemplo de que no se debe matar o robar , y si matas o robas la mitad , está igual de mal .
De esta corriente se pueden rescatar conceptos fundamentales como volver a tener una relación sana con la naturaleza y sobretodo aprender a vivir mejor con menos pues cada vez debiera estar mas claro que lo suficiente es lo mejor .
Desde stepienybarno vemos que pesar de sus buenas intenciones , aparecen dos problemas casi irresolubles .
Por un lado , la utopía del planteamiento que imagina que todos los hombres volveremos a vivir como se vivía antes de todo este invento de la sociedad del bienestar , y pensando que el 80 % del planeta que en pocos años vivirá en grandes urbes , parece que el decrecimiento no aporta soluciones si este presagio se consuma .
Por otro lado , la renuncia que se hace al desarrollo tecnológico hace que no se planten soluciones serias a problemas como qué hacer con las cabezas nucleares existentes , y que con un mínimo error humano , todo dejaría de existir , o cómo desmantelar en un futuro las centrales nucleares y gestionar sus residuos .
Y si os apetece saber más sobre este agnóstico del crecimiento , nada mejor que ver este par de videos subtitulados en castellano .

A lot of speculation has been going on in the blogosphere about the commitment Pawlenty has in listening to the Minnesota Supreme Court since he announced that he would n't seek a third term in office .
Many feel he 'll just ignore the ruling of the court and let it drag on for years to placate the right wing base .
Andrea Mitchell just about finished up an interview with Gov. Tim Pawlenty when she asked him if he would be signing the certificate which would in all likelihood make Al Franken the next Senator after the Minn .
Supreme Court ruling is handed down .
He said he would abide by the court 's decision and take swift action and sign the certificate .
Mitchell : I know you 've said you 'll abide by the Supreme Court decision on the Franken Coleman race , do you expect that that will by all accounts lead to Al Franken being the next Senator from Minnesota ?
Is n't it time to get this resolved ?
Pawlenty : Yea , we 're anxious to get it resolved but I can't sign the certificate until the State court process is complete , we do n't know who the winner is , but as soon as that process is complete and they give direction as to signing the certificate , I 'm going to sign it , there 's not going to be any undue delay or tactics like that so we 'll follow the direction of the court .
We can only hope he 's telling the truth and will sign the certificate even if Coleman takes it Federal .
The Supreme court will be handing down their decision very soon .

That seems to be the lesson KFC is learning after talk - show titan Oprah Winfrey took to the airwaves Tuesday with an offer of a free grilled chicken two - piece meal .
Hungry consumers could visit Oprah.com , where for the next 24 hours they were supposed to be able to download a coupon for the meal that included two pieces of the company 's new grilled chicken menu item , two side orders and a biscuit .
What ensued was a coupon craze that was for some a headache .
Customers flooded KFC restaurants , and many had long lines and even longer wait times .
iReport : Watch a video on the frenzy
Bloggers took to the Web in waves to report on the frenzy .
Customer complaints ranged from the inability to download the coupon because of the site 's high traffic to some restaurants simply not honoring the deal .
" I'm a big girl , " Shannon Edwards told CNN affiliate WBAL - TV in Baltimore , Maryland , on Thursday after she was turned away from a KFC .
" I like to eat .
So I 'm kind of disappointed I have to go to McDonald 's now . "
Do n't Miss Oprah.com
Charlotte Beal , a food and beverage consumer strategist at the consumer insights firm Iconoculture , said it was a perfect storm of the astronomical influence of Winfrey and the recession .
" In this economic environment , anything free you can't beat it , and it 's just so enticing , " said Beal , who added that her company has been tracking the increase of coupon usage , especially those available online .
" It 's a well - known fact that Oprah 's been transparent about her own struggles with weight and diet so when she partners with a company that 's trying to offer a healthier product , consumers really listen . "
Watch Winfrey discuss the reaction »
" Not only are you attracting the people who are strapped for cash and want a free meal , but you also are enticing the whole Oprah audience that relates to her own struggle of trying to find something healthy to eat , " Beal said .
Alan C. Marcus , president and chief executive officer for public relations firm the Marcus Group Inc. , said the situation had all the ingredients of a public relations nightmare .
" If you make a commitment and you do n't produce on that commitment , you lose your credibility and that ripples throughout the company , " Marcus said .
" It hurts your brand , and it hurts your position in the marketplace . "
Winfrey is " a powerhouse " whose fans cannot be denied , he said .
" I think they underestimated Oprah , " Marcus said .
" She 's got a lot of influence , and she has earned a following over many years . "
In a press release Thursday night , KFC said that after the " unprecedented and overwhelming response " restaurants would no longer honor the coupon but would provide a rain - check program for customers .
" We would like to apologize to our customers who have been inconvenienced by the overwhelming response to our free Kentucky Grilled Chicken offer , " said Roger Eaton , president of KFC U.S.
" The lines of customers wanting to redeem their coupons have been out the door and around the block , so we 're unable to redeem customer coupons at this time . "
Eaton appeared on Winfrey 's show Friday via Skype to sort out what she referred to as the " chicken caper . "
Winfrey acknowledged some of the issues surrounding the campaign , and called the download of 10.5 million coupons and giveaway of $ 42 million worth of free food from KFC " quite a hookup . "
Eaton said 4 million meals had been redeemed by using the coupons , with 6.5 million meals from rainchecks still needing to be distributed .
Winfrey said the reaction to the chicken coupon surpassed even her giveaway of cars to audience members a few years ago .
" I was really deeply moved , first of all , by all the people who sent thank you 's for the chicken , " Winfrey said .
" You know , I actually got more thank you 's for the chickens than we did for the cars , which is so amazing . "
The coupon craze is not the first time chicken lovers have gotten fried over a good deal .
Recently , KFC competitor Popeyes experienced a similar problem when some of its franchises ran out of chicken during a promotional eight - piece deal for $ 4.99 .

A quarter of private school places will be reserved for poor children
The Indian government is expected to introduce a landmark education bill in parliament after it was delayed due to procedural difficulties .
The bill seeks to guarantee universal , free and compulsory education for children aged between six and 14 .
It was originally set to be discussed by lawmakers on Thursday .
The government estimates that at present 70 million children do not go to school and more than a third of the country is illiterate .
The bill has been listed for discussion in parliament 's schedule later on Friday .
It would set up new state - run local schools and force private schools to reserve at least a quarter of their places for poor children .
It will also end widespread practices by which schools impose admission fees on parents to guarantee their children a place and bureaucrats enjoy discretionary powers on deciding who to let in .
Correspondents say the government is keen to introduce the legislation into the lower house of parliament quickly , as the current parliamentary session ends next week .
Achieving universal education is one of the UN's Millennium Development Goals to be met by the year 2015 .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says it is not clear to many critics how the government plans to pay for this .
At the moment India spends a little over 3 % of its GDP on education .
Critics of the bill also say it does not cover children below the age of six and therefore fails to recognise the importance of the early years of a child 's development .
They say it also does little to address India 's inequitable school system under which there are vast discrepancies between well - funded private schools and state - run schools with poor quality teaching staff and infrastructure .

For some background , I 've been working with Django for a few years now and for the past year have been a developer on a rather large django application at work .
I did a few projects with SQLAlchemy about 2 years ago when I was put on a project whose requirements seemed to imply the need for a database but had no web component .
I know of and have used other python ORMs ( notably SQLObject ) , but this post is about SQLA and Django 's ORMs , and how I consider the differences between them to be important but also neutral .
I started a small project recently that was going to require some light querying , and have had aborted re-starts on the business logic layer using first Elixir , then SQLObject , and now going straight ext. declarative with SQLAlchemy .
The project has relatively few tables , with only a couple one - to - many and a single many - to - many relationship ; as such it probably represents a fairly standard use case of an ORM .
I 've learned a lot about these different projects in the process , but was finally able to formalize some thoughts I 've had with respect to SQLA and Django 's ORMs .
The major takeaway from all of it is that SQLAlchemy 's ORM and Django 's ORM solve different problems .
They are n't completely different problems , but they are different enough that you should have a completely different approach using each .
SQLAlchemy is a toolkit for python programmers who want or need to use a database to write programs that do so .
Django's ORM is a tool for python programmers to quickly model business - level data relationships and use a database for persistent storage .
This is really an important distinction ; the Django ORM interface is focused on the application 's data model , whereas SQLAlchemy 's interface is focused on the underlying data store .
In Django , your application is first class ; in Alchemy , it is n't .
As an example , look at a simple usage of a many - to - many relationship in each :
Django : Book.objects.filter(author__age=27 )
SQLAlchemy : session.query ( Book ) .join( Book , Author ) .filter ( Author.age==27 )
Note that Django 's API is entirely concerned with the relationship between the application - level abstractions ' Book ' and ' Author ' , whereas the Alchemy version includes far more details about what is actually going to happen when executed .
This example exposes the different assumptions the ORMs have to live with , as well : implicit within Django 's design are decisions on the way connections are made to the database , how to evaluate queries ( lazily or eagerly ) , whereas in SQLAlchemy these details are in plain sight .
There 's a large degree of negative / positive choice tradeoff going on between the two ORMs that took a while to dawn on me .
As an application developer first and a database administrator and tuner maybe 5th at best , I tend to lean towards Django 's ORM as the type of thing I 'd rather use .
I see that as a result of familiarity , my own weaknesses , and also the strengths of the Django ORM to do a good enough job most of the time .
Of course , there are things you can't do easily with Django 's ORM , like fetch all books with 2 authors , or fetch all authors whose first and last names are the same , that are relatively simple to do in SQLAlchemy .
The conceptual leap , of course , is understanding how to answer these questions from the standpoint of your database , not your data model .
There 's a case to be made that , if you have not already made this leap , your ability to solve problems will be constrained by the tools the Django ORM gives you , and I can see some truth in the blame critics place on Django 's ORM for keeping some folks unenlightened .
I still think that in the end , the python programmer is better off having both of these projects to learn from , and the python world better for having both to choose from .
update :
This post got a bit of action at reddit .
The comments there rightly pointed out that the examples I pointed to above that were ' not easily done ' via Django are fairly easy to do with the new aggregation features in Django 1.1 .
It was a mistake not to acknowledge the improvements in the Django ORM post - 1.0 .
My main point was n't to highlight a laundry list of things that are hard with Django or easy with SQLAlchemy ; I 'm not really qualified to do this , but I felt that a couple examples of this would perhaps illustrate the differences I saw better than mere exposition .
They also pointed to the fact that ' natural orm ' features are available via SQLAlchemy .
The code examples I included above are already using relations , and at least according to the latest documentation they are the canonical way to deal with these types of relationships in SQLA 0.5.x .
However , the fact that there are multiple ways of doing this speaks to the main point of this post ; that the focus of SQLAlchemy is to allow you to do whatever it is you want without touching raw SQL , and the focus of Django 's ORM is to provide your application with an easy - to - use data model .
The fact that Django 's ORM is heavily influenced by the relationships SQL is good at is to me an unavoidable impurity ; you could provide a Django - orm style data model for a non RDBMS , but SQLAlchemy outside of that context is completely meaningless .
Which is fine ; the difference is neutral , and SQLAlchemy is meant to be the best there is within that context .
In fact , I think it clearly is ; the whole point is that Django 's ORM is only incidentally playing in the same sandbox , and is focusing on solving a slightly different problem .
Wrongfully jailed man sues Houston , seeks millions Wrongfully convicted man takes city to court
George Rodriguez leaves from the Federal Courthouse with supporters , Rodriguez is suing the city of Houston over a 1987 rape conviction .

George Rodriguez ’s lawyer asked a federal jury Monday to make the city pay “ tens of millions of dollars ” for the disgraced Houston Police Department ’s crime lab ’s pivotal role in the wrongful conviction that put his client behind bars for 17 years .
“ What was taken away from him was his youth , ” said attorney Barry Scheck , whose Innocence Project works on behalf of convicts in similar circumstances .
Rodriguez went to prison wrongly at age 26 and walked out at 43 to find his three daughters grown and his father dead , the lawyer said .
In opening statements Tuesday afternoon , Scheck told jurors about the loneliness , fear and depression his client suffered in prison after being wrongly convicted of raping a 14 - year - old girl .
This happened , he said , because policy makers at the city of Houston were deliberately indifferent to rampant under funding , under staffing and a lack of supervision at the crime lab that created a high risk an innocent person could be convicted or the guilty one could go free .
“ We will prove that a false and misleading serology report violated ( Rodriguez ’s ) constitutional right to a fair trial , ” Scheck told jurors in U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore ’s court .
A key piece of evidence in the criminal case was a pubic hair found in the girl ’s underwear .
A Houston police crime lab specialist testified falsely that the serology report on that hair eliminated another suspect , Isidro Yanez , but not Rodriguez .
The case was tried before DNA evidence was used in court .
DNA tests done 17 years later showed the hair belonged to Yanez .
Brown , Holmes blamed
Scheck said evidence will show the lab specialist had a pattern of changing findings to match what the police and prosecutors wanted .
One of the policy makers Scheck blames is Lee P. Brown , the former Houston mayor who was police chief in 1987 when Rodriguez was convicted .
Brown is scheduled to testify in the case , as is former Harris District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. , who was top prosecutor at the time of the trial .
Rodriguez originally sued Harris County and others but dismissed all parties except for the city of Houston , who his lawyers say is most clearly culpable .
But Robert Cambrice , a lawyer for the city , told jurors that it was bad lawyering by the prosecutor and Rodriguez ’s late defense attorney that led to the false conviction , not an unquestioned lie by a city employee .
He said there was no city policy that led to the error in this case and under funding did n’t cause the employee to lie .
“ No city policy makers approved of unconstitutional fabrication of evidence , ” Cambrice said .
Cambrice asked the jury not to be overcome by the emotion surrounding Rodriguez ’s ordeal .
The trail is likely to last two weeks .
The five - woman , three - man jury heard from an assistant police chief late Tuesday about how the city did n’t closely investigate crime lab problems until after a 2002 local television report .
That finally led to a $ 5 million independent investigation that highlighted Rodriguez ’s case and others , she said .
It was n’t until 2004 that a local court ruled Rodriguez should be freed because of the inaccurate trial testimony .
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals later vacated Rodriguez ’s conviction .
He has never received an official pardon and thus has received no compensation from the state .

Wireless providers must have the technology to locate Canadian 911 callers by next February , but most cellphone users wo n't be covered , a new study suggests .
The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunication Commission requires that wireless service providers have systems that provide emergency responders with the location of 911 calls made from a cellphone by Feb. 1 , 2010 .
A number of Canadians have died after making 911 calls because the dispatcher could not tell where they were calling from .
A study released by the technology market intelligence firm IDC Canada Inc. this week estimates that as few as 30 per cent of wireless devices in Canada will be able to provide accurate location data to emergency responders by February of next year .
About the study
The IDC study was commissioned by the public relations firm Media Profile on behalf of a location technology company whose identity was not disclosed to the study authors .
IDC based its findings on a survey of literature on enhanced 911 service in Canada , the United States and the European Union , including the new CRTC guidelines for enhanced 911 service , as well as interviews with public safety organizations .
The report said based on guidelines released by the CRTC , enhanced 911 service wo n't be mandated for :
People who have prepaid , pay - as - you - go cellphone service or unsubscribed phones .
Foreign visitors using roaming cellphone service , including tourists attending the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver .
People with certain handsets , especially older , cheaper ones , depending on their carrier .
" It 's basically saying there 's a whole , huge universe … whose location information wo n't be captured and transmittable , " said Lawrence Surtees , vice - president of communications research and principal analyst for IDC Canada .
In addition , the study suggests there is no guarantee that carriers will meet the CRTC 's location accuracy guidelines as the commission will not be doing accuracy tests .
The guidelines require accuracy within 150 metres or 300 metres , depending on the technology used .
The report also criticized the guidelines for not requiring the ability to track a caller during the call , as may be required in the case of a kidnapping or abduction .
Overall , it said , the guidelines are " deficient " compared to the services currently provided to U.S. wireless users .
Surtees added , " It may be time that the CRTC take sort of firmer charge of this , take a more activist leadership role at setting very strong and clear implementation timelines , as well as policy and strategy going forward . "
More than half of all 911 calls in Canada are now made from cellphones and about a fifth of cellphone customers are on prepaid plans , confirmed the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association , which represents the industry .
95 % of cell users will be locatable : CRTC
The CRTC disputed the findings of the study Tuesday , estimating that more than 95 per cent of cellphone users will get enhanced 911 service .
Prepaid , pay - as - you - go services , and roaming phones are not currently included in the guidelines because the CRTC is waiting for a report from a working group that includes the wireless industry about whether it is technically possible to include them .
That report is scheduled to be delivered in August .
However , the commission said that as of Tuesday , there was no indication that including those services would be a problem and they may be added before the guidelines are implemented in February .
The CRTC admitted that it has a limited ability to enforce the new guidelines , as it has no fining powers , but expects emergency dispatchers to report any concerns once the guidelines go into effect .
Limitations apply : wireless industry
Bernard Lord , president and CEO of the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association , admitted that there will be gaps in the service regardless .
" There will still be some limitations , " he said .
One is that there are two location technologies being rolled out , and it's up to the carrier to decide which to use in which parts of the country :
Assisted GPS only works with handsets that have assisted GPS capability .
Triangulation with multiple cell towers only works in parts of the country where there are multiple cell towers .
In some places , there may only be one cell tower nearby .
If a carrier has decided to use assisted GPS technology , many customers who have older or cheaper phones wo n't have enhanced 911 service , Lord confirmed .
He added that consumers need to be aware of that when they choose what handset to buy .
Surtees said he is concerned that many Canadians might be slow to change handsets , as they may be reluctant to buy a new one while in the midst of a two or three - year contract with a particular wireless service provider .
Lord noted that even when location data is fairly precise , there can be complications .
For example , triangulation cannot pinpoint what floor of a highrise tower someone is on .
He added that even though the wireless industry is spending millions to upgrade their systems , that 's only half the equation .
" It 's being done for the wireless providers across the country but not necessarily for the public safety agencies across the country , " Lord said .
The association said wireless carriers are working to provide enhanced 911 for all wireless services , including prepaid , by February , but there are some complications .

A SECOND look at sunspot drawings from the 1700s has clarified a puzzling episode in the sun ’s history , and could lead to more accurate forecasts of dangerous solar outbursts .
The sun sometimes hurls clouds of plasma our way , which can fry satellites and knock out power grids on Earth .
The outbursts are most common during solar maxima , when the dark blemishes of sunspots appear in greatest abundance on the sun .
Although there is an average of 11 years between solar maxima , predicting the exact timing and height of each …
The blasphemy law has now been passed in the Dail , as part of Defamation Act , with no debate on the blasphemy amendments .
The debate was restricted to an hour ( for the full Defamation Bill ) .
Justice Minister Dermot
Ahern said that extending time for the blasphemy amendments would just be regurgitating what has been discussed ad nauseum .
There was an average of six TDs in the Dail during debate .
The law now only has to pass through Seanad before being signed into law by President .
It is scheduled for 10.30 am tomorrow morning in the Seanad .
The Atheist Ireland AGM will plan a response to this blasphemy law , between 2 - 5 pm this Saturday in Wynns Hotel Dublin .

Why There Will Never Be Another Walter Cronkite
With the passing of Walter Cronkite , who died yesterday at age 92 , we not only lose a major figure in broadcast journalism ( and journalism period ) , but we see another nail being driven into the coffin of integrity and fairness .
The acclaimed and award - winning reporter was once called “ The Most Trusted Man in America , ” known for his in - depth , insightful and impartial reporting .
Reportedly demanding off camera , he was calm , likeable and authoritative on camera .
He covered many of the major events of the 20th century , including the Moon Landing , Vietnam and the assassination of JFK , during the announcement of which he fought back tears .
We felt like he was one of us .
When I was young and watched Cronkite on television I never thought about politics .
My parents never influenced me on that topic nor even discussed who they voted for , and I simply tried to interpret things in my own way , eventually developing my own set of beliefs as I grew older .
Even though in later years Cronkite evidently became less shy about expressing his liberal opinions , he almost never brought them into his reporting , the lone exception being a rare editorial such as one about the futility of the Vietnam War that made President Lyndon Johnson exclaim : “ If I ’ve lost Cronkite , I ’ve lost Middle America . ”
The media has taken a lot of hits throughout the ’00s , for reasons that should be fairly obvious , but I ’ll recap quickly : the War on Terror , corporate control and the gossip glut that clogs our media pipeline on a daily basis .
Often times the factual , nonpartisan reporting of important news gets buried under a deluge of political propaganda , the nattering of dunderheaded pundits and the reporting of celebrity - focused non-items .
In Cronkite ’s day there were n’t vapid reality series , endless talk shows , relentless teaser trailers for mere 15 second news pieces , nor 24 - hour news channels always hungry for content in any form .
Back then people really did tune in to watch the news together and pay attention to what was going on in the world .
And reporters like Cronkite were not easily bullied by politicians or their administrations , as Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew learned .
One wonders what Mr. Cronkite must have thought of the ascension of online news , with its instantaneous delivery , lack of proper - fact checking and frequently erroneous information .
Or the way that television news has become more personality driven and , in some cases , sexed up with many of “ the beautiful people ” serving in place of more qualified individuals .
News has become a commodity for advertising revenue , not the public service it was between the years of 1962 and 1981 , when Cronkite presided over the CBS Evening News .
As an intellectual commodity the news has lost ground in the new millennium .
We absorb things in sound bytes now rather than longer reports .
Much of that has to do with the fact that the pace of American life has increased immeasurably .
We do n’t tend to congregate at the dinner table , the television or generally at home the way we used to .
We ’re too busy texting , chatting online or multitasking ourselves to death with numerous distractions .
We have become impatient as a society and let our knee - jerk emotional responses override the rational choice to wait until all of the facts have been collected to make reasonable judgments on various issues and events .
If we should learn anything from the life of Walter Cronkite , it is that one does not earn trust simply by being connected to a major television network , through the famous friends you have or how big of a mouth you shoot off .
A newsman earns our trust through respect , which comes from doing his or her job well — taking it seriously by triple - checking facts , talking to multiple sources and taking time to do research , thus ensuring integrity and fairness .
Of course , with all of the multi-corporate interests connected to television now , that golden standard has become harder and harder to uphold and may be impossible to retrieve without a complete separation of corporations and newsrooms .
That is unlikely to happen .
I believe that bias has always existed in the news , even to a small degree , but it has never been as strong as it is today .
We live in an MSNBC versus Fox world now , and while that works if you always like your side ’s opinion being expressed , that means there is less impartiality .
It is truly sad that some of the best news one can get now comes from Comedy Central ’s “ The Daily Show ” .
While I think the show is hilarious and often quite insightful , there is rich irony to be found in the success and influence of an award - winning show that is at heart a satire .
I 'm shocked it 's this high really .
A new PPIC Poll in California shows Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's ( R ) job approval rating dropped to a new low of 28 % .
The last time a California governor 's approval rating was that low was in 2003 when then - Gov. Gray Davis faced a recall election and was in a budget standoff with the Legislature .
A record - low 14 % of Californians believe the state is headed in the right direction .
Can we find out who the 14 % are that believe CA is headed in the right direction .
Atrios reminds us about the media obbsession over Arnold .
It 's important to remember just how large a role our Village media had in promoting Arnold back in the day .
I wonder how many people that wanted to change the constitution so the Terminator could run for president now are birthers .
I 'm one of the nearly 50 million Americans who do n't have health insurance .
I do n't want it , either .
But the bill the House of Representatives is debating would force me to buy it .
How good can any product be if Congress compels me to purchase it ?
Politicians and interest groups have been trying virtually all my life to foist medical insurance on me .
But their proposals rest on mistaken and even insulting assumptions .
First , they presume that everyone wants , needs , and should have abundant medical attention .
But I come from a long - lived and healthy family , I 've been a vegetarian since childhood because I 've never liked the way meat tastes , I do n't smoke , and I love to hike – the more miles the better .
I am disgustingly healthy , so much so that the only doctors I see – or try to : I 'm near - sighted – are ophthalmologists .
Could I be hit by a bus tomorrow when I head out for my daily walk ?
Possibly .
But that 's such an unlikely disaster that I 've chosen to spend my money on more personally pressing needs than medical insurance .
On the other hand , unlikely disasters do happen .
So I might purchase catastrophic coverage if it were reasonably priced – just as I might visit doctors for lesser complaints if their care were reasonably priced .
But the government 's meddling is what helped mess - up the medical market to begin with .
The federal government perverts costs with its Medicare and Medicaid programs : Recipients of this largess have no incentive to save money since someone else pays their bills .
In fact , the incentives run the opposite way as patients demand more procedures and tests while magnifying problems I resolve out of my medicine cabinet into emergency - room runs .
Doctors who get away with charging Medicare hundreds for diagnosing Grandpa 's indigestion would charge me the same .
Meanwhile , state governments shackle the insurance industry , mandating that policies cover everything from chiropractic care to hormone replacement .
These launch premiums into the stratosphere .
I 'd much rather pick and choose the coverage I want at a price I 'm willing to pay than buy the plan bureaucrats and special interests decree .
But the universal - healthcare crowd thinks it knows better than I do how to spend my money .
Why can't they leave me alone ?
I 'm not forcing them to eat flaxseed and bike to meetings instead of hopping into their limousines .
It 's time for them to return the favor .
Besides , if that bus does hit me tomorrow , I want – and will pay for – top - notch care .
And that 's not what government - run medical systems dispense .
Delays , expedient rather than proper treatment , and double standards of care depending on who you are and whom you know characterize universal - healthcare systems .
Which makes sense .
We live in a world of finite resources and infinite desires , where medical care must be " rationed " like all other products and services .
Though we can't choose whether goods are rationed , we can choose how they are .
Either the politicians and bureaucrats who bring us long lines at DMVs , failing public schools , and the endless war in Iraq will decide who gets what kind of treatment , or the free market will .
Fans of universal healthcare deride the market :
They say it 's cold and cruel because we each have to pay for the care we demand .
But government healthcare can be far colder and crueler .
Its care is inferior : Contrast an inferior , run -down veteran 's hospital with a general one .
And it 's expensive .
Dr. Jeffrey Anderson recently wrote in Investor 's Business Daily , " Since 1970 ­– even without the prescription drug benefit – Medicare 's costs have risen 34 percent more , per patient , than the combined costs of all health care in America apart from Medicare and Medicaid … . "
Absent such meddling , the price of medical care would return to reasonable levels .
It benefits no provider of any service to charge such astronomical fees that customers can't afford to patronize him .
Then , too , in a market free of the state 's stranglehold , doctors and hospitals would compete with one another to lower prices and attract the ill or injured .
That does n't mean everyone could finally buy all the procedures they wanted or even needed – but that 's where private charity would come in .
Humanitarians who send inner-city kids to summer camp and volunteer their time or money at soup kitchens would strive to ensure that needy Americans received medical care .
President Obama says , " We have no choice but to fix the healthcare system because right now it 's broken for too many Americans . "
But the only fix we need is for government to get out of medicine .

( circa 2650-2600 BC )
( Egyptian meaning " the one who comes in peace , is with peace " ) was an Egyptian , who served under the Third Dynasty king Djoser as chancellor to the pharaoh and high priest of the sun god Ra at Heliopolis .
He is considered to be the first architect and engineer and physician in early history though two other good physicians , Hesy - Ra and Merit - Ptah lived around the same time .
The full list of his titles is : Imhotep was one of very few mortals to be depicted as part of a pharaoh 's statue .
He was one of only a few commoners ever to be accorded divine status after death .
The center of his cult was Memphis .
From the First Intermediate Period onward Imhotep was also revered as a poet and philosopher .
His sayings were famously referred to in poems : " I have heard the words of Imhotep and Hordedef with whose discourses men speak so much .
" The location of Imhotep 's self - constructed tomb was well hidden from the beginning and it remains unknown , despite efforts to find it .
The consensus is that it is hidden somewhere at Saqqara .
Imhotep 's historicity is confirmed by two contemporary inscriptions made during his lifetime on the base or pedestal of one of Djoser 's statues ( Cairo JE 49889 ) and also by a graffito on the enclosure wall surrounding Sekhemkhet 's unfinished step - pyramid .
The latter inscription suggests that Imhotep outlived Djoser by a few years and went on to serve in the construction of king Sekhemkhet 's pyramid which was abandoned due to this ruler 's brief reign .
says of Imhotep :
As one of the officials of the Pharaoh , he designed the Pyramid of Djoser ( the Step Pyramid ) at Saqqara in Egypt in 2630 – 2611 BCE .
He may have been responsible for the first known use of column s in architecture
As an instigator of Egyptian culture , Imhotep 's idealized image lasted well into the Ptolemaic period .
The Egyptian historian Manetho credited him with inventing the method of a stone - dressed building during Djoser 's reign , though he was not the first to actually build with stone .
Stone walling , flooring , lintel s , and jambs had appeared sporadically during the Archaic Period , though it is true that a building of the Step Pyramid 's size and made entirely out of stone had never before been constructed .
Before Djoser , pharaohs were buried in mastaba tombs .
Imhotep is credited with being the founder of medicine and with being the author of a medical treatise remarkable for being devoid of magical thinking ; the so - called Edwin Smith papyrus containing anatomical observations , ailments , and cures .
The surviving papyrus was probably written around 1700 BCE but may be a copy of texts a thousand years older .
This attribution of authorship is speculative , however .
The Papyrus can be viewed at , The Brooklyn Childrens Museum , 145 Brooklyn Avenue brooklyn , NY .
The 48 cases contained within the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus concern : 27 head injuries ( cases # 1 - 27 ) 6 throat and neck injuries ( cases # 28-33 ) 2 injuries to the clavicle ( collarbone ) ( cases # 34 -35 ) 3 injuries to the arm ( cases # 36-38 ) 8 injuries to the sternum ( breastbone ) and ribs ( cases # 39 - 46 ) 1 injury to the shoulder ( case # 47 ) 1 injury to the spine ( case # 48 ) Descriptions of Imhotep by James Henry Breasted et. al :" In priestly wisdom , in magic , in the formulation of wise proverbs ; in medicine and architecture ; this remarkable figure of Zoser 's reign left so notable a reputation that his name was never forgotten .
He was the patron spirit of the later scribes , to whom they regularly poured out a libation from the water - jug of their writing outfit before beginning their work . "
'' Imhotep extracted medicine from plants .
'' Imhotep was portrayed as a priest with a shaven head , seated and holding a papyrus roll .
Occasionally he was shown clothed in the archaic costume of a priest .
'' Of the details of his life , very little has survived though numerous statues and statuettes of him have been found .
Some show him as an ordinary man who is dressed in plain attire .
Others show him as a sage who is seated on a chair with a roll of papyrus on his knees or under his arm .
Later , his statuettes show him with a god like beard , standing , and carrying the ankh and a scepter .
'' He is represented seated with a papyrus scroll across his knees , wearing a skullcap and a long linen kilt .
We can interpret the papyrus as suggesting the sources of knowledge kept by scribes in the " House of Life " .
The headgear identifies Imhotep with Ptah , and his priestly linen garment symbolizes his religious purity .
' According to myth , Imhotep 's mother was a mortal named , elevated later to semi-divine status by claims that she was the daughter of Banebdjedet .
Conversely , since Imhotep was known as the " Son of Ptah , " his mother was sometimes claimed to be Sekhmet , the patron of Upper Egypt whose consort was Ptah As Imhotep was considered the founder of medicine as a discipline , he was sometimes said to be the one who held up the goddess
Nut ( the deification of the sky ) , as the separation of Nut and Geb ( the deification of the earth ) was said to be what held back chaos .
Due to the position this would have placed him in , he was also sometimes said to be Nut 's son .
In artwork he is also linked with the great goddess , Hathor , who eventually became identified as the wife of Ra .
Imhotep was also associated with Ma'at , the goddess who personified the concept of truth , cosmic order , and justice — having created order out of chaos and being responsible for maintaining that order .
Two thousand years after his death , Imhotep 's status was raised to that of a deity .
He became the god of medicine and healing .
He later was linked to Asclepius by the Greek s. He was associated with Amenhotep son of Hapu , who was another deified architect , in the region of Thebes where they were worshipped as " brothers " .
According to the , " The evidence afforded by Egyptian and Greek texts support the view that Imhotep 's reputation was very respected in early times ...
His prestige increased with the lapse of centuries and his temples in Greek times were the centers of medical teachings .
" It is Imhotep , says Sir William Osler , who was the real " Father of Medicine " , " the first figure of a physician to stand out clearly from the mists of antiquity .
" The Upper Egyptian Famine Stela , dating from the Ptolemaic period , bears an inscription containing a legend about a famine of seven years during the reign of Djoser .
Imhotep is credited with having been instrumental in ending it .
One of his priests explained the connection between the god Khnum and the rise of the Nile to the king , who then had a dream in which the Nile god spoke to him , promising to end the drought .

People grumbling their way through the grimness of winter have better recall than those enjoying a carefree , sunny day , Australian researchers have found .
The University of New South Wales team used a Sydney news agency to test whether people 's moods had an impact on their ability to remember small details .
Researchers placed 10 small items on the shop counter , including a toy cannon , red bus and a piggy bank , and quizzed shoppers about what they remembered seeing upon their exit .
Lead researcher Joseph Forgas said subjects were able to remember three times as many items on cold , windy , rainy days when there was sombre classical music playing as they were when conditions were sunny and bright .
Rainy - day shoppers were also less likely to have false memories of objects that were n't there , said Forgas .
" We predicted and found that weather - induced negative mood improved memory accuracy , " he wrote in the study , which was published in the latest edition of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology .
" Shoppers in a negative mood showed better memory and higher discrimination ability . "
Forgas said a worse mood helped to focus people 's attention on their surroundings and led to a more thorough and careful thinking style , while happiness tended to reduce focus and increase both confidence and forgetfulness .
" This finding suggests that some allowance for such mood effects could be incorporated in applied domains such as legal , forensic , counselling and clinical practice , " he said .

Oakland , CA : Women ’s Choice Clinic of Oakland , the venerated feminist health clinic
that has provided non-judgmental , culturally sensitive abortion and reproductive health care services to Bay Area women for 36 years is closing its doors ( Press Conference , Wed. April 8 : Oakland City Hall , 1:00 ) .
WCC is the oldest feminist health center providing abortions in the nation .
However it is not anti-abortion protests that are forcing the clinic to close , nor is it a decline in demand for services .
California ’s chronic low and slow reimbursements for MediCal services , and the current freeze on reimbursements is the culprit .
“ The final straw is the state of California ’s deep cuts in funding and insufficient and terminally slow reimbursement process .
To balance the state budget California has frozen payments for services already provided , and for us , that is a fatal decision , ” says WCC Executive Director Linci Comy who has been with the clinic since 1977 . “ Unlike other clinics , we never turned women away if they were on state aid or did n’t have insurance to cover their medical treatment .
We saw people for less than actual costs because it was the right thing to do .
But more and more women are unable to pay for services .
Ten years ago it was half the people needed help , now 90 % of our clients need help .
” Women ’s Choice Clinic began in 1972 as an independent feminist women ’s health clinic with a mission to provide quality affordable reproductive health care .
In its 36 years WCC served over 64,000 clients and until its close was seeing approximately 2,000 clients a year .
The closing of Women ’s Choice Clinic is being mourned by community members , health and women ’s groups alike .
“ Women ’s Choice Clinic was a safe haven for underserved women , a place where women knew they would receive health care with dignity , ” according to Destiny Lopez , Executive Director of ACCESS , which connects poor women throughout California to reproductive health information and services .
“ This is truly a sad day for Oakland .
We are losing an independent community clinic that made comprehensive reproductive health services available to all women .
” “ Women ’s Choice Clinic showed us a whole new way to approach health care that valued patient education and empowerment .
And they have left an important legacy -- there are literally hundreds ofhealth care professionals now in the field who did their clinical hours and certifications at Women ’sChoice Clinic .
We are better off for WCC ’s work , and it is a crying shame that they can’t continue . ”
Said Kim Barstow from Street Level Clinic in Fruitvale .
“ This is a wake up call for feminists old and young and anyone who cares about women ’s empowerment , abortion services and health care , ” said Rachel Jackson , community activist .
It doesn ’ treally matter if we have a pro-choice president when real women in need ca n’t access abortion services .
We ca n’t sit idly by .
The years of antiabortion propaganda and the insufficient reimbursements from the state are strangling our community health centers and it has to stop .
” Despite its closure , clinic has a responsibility to maintain medical records and respond to medical record requests for a minimum of seven years and therefore continues to need funds to maintain this responsibility .

" It has been a life saver so many times I have lost count .
Business - in - a- Box has saved me so much time and as you know , time is money . "
David G. Moore Jr. Owner - Upstate Web ( Spartanburg , South Carolina )
Federal officials Wednesday notified more than 650 businesses around the country , including nearly 50 in Los Angeles , that their records will be audited as part of a widening effort to find companies that hire illegal immigrants .
The number of notices issued is the largest ever in a single day and exceeds the total sent out in all of fiscal 2008 , Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said .
“ Part of the strategy is to let businesses know we mean business , ” agency spokeswoman Pat Reilly said .
The Obama administration has made tougher enforcement aimed at employers a cornerstone of its immigration policy .
In April , the federal government issued new guidelines to immigration agents instructing them to focus on employers who hire illegal immigrants rather than just to arrest workers .
The government is also working to improve and expand an employment verification program .
The targeted companies , which include firms in New York , San Antonio , Seattle and San Diego , were identified through tips and leads , officials said .

The notices are the government ’s first step in what could be a lengthy investigation .
Immigration agents plan to review the I - 9 forms and identification documents at all 652 companies .
Those with significant numbers of undocumented workers may be fined .
And if agents believe the businesses knowingly hired illegal immigrants or find “ a pattern of egregious violations , ” criminal investigations could be launched , Reilly said .
The government did not release the names of any of the companies to be audited , but Reilly said they represent a broad range of industries .
The immigration agency also notified 80 companies , including three in Los Angeles , that it planned to fine them because they employ large numbers of people who do not appear to be authorized to work in the U.S. Immigration agents had earlier conducted audits on those companies ’ records and , in many cases , determined that the Social Security numbers listed for employees either did not exist or did not belong to the employees specified .
A government audit of one such company , Los Angeles - based American Apparel , showed that 1,600 of its roughly 10,000 employees may not be authorized to work and the employment status of 200 others could not be verified , according to Peter Schey , an attorney for the company .
The fine , which could exceed $ 100,000 , will become final in 30 days unless American Apparel requests a court hearing .
If the company continues to employ people who have no work authorization , it could face criminal action .
Schey said the government audit , which began in early 2008 , did not disclose any exploitation or any intent to violate immigration laws .
American Apparel is working with the government and the company ’s employees to clear up the discrepancies , he said .
The attorney said many of the issues may be a result of typographical errors or honest mistakes but that employees who cannot prove they are authorized to work will be let go .

“ Any manufacturing company in an area with a large immigrant community is inevitably going to have employees using unauthorized documents , ” Schey said .
“ It does n’t take a rocket scientist to determine that .
That is just a reality in life today in light of the broken immigration system . ”
Businesses are forbidden by law to hire illegal immigrants but often do so unwittingly .
Employers are required to review , and keep , identification and work authorization documents and to complete a form , called an I - 9 , recording that information for each employee .
They are not required , however , to determine whether those documents are valid .
Companies can check the employment status of new hires through E - Verify , the online verification system , but the program is voluntary in California and most other states .
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has called the program an “ essential tool ” for employers trying to maintain a legal workforce and is trying to expand its use across the country .
The new employment enforcement strategies , including the increased use of I - 9 audits , mark a shift from the George W. Bush administration , said Stephen Lee , a professor at UC Irvine School of Law who has written about immigration enforcement against employers .
Under President George W. Bush , work - site raids and arrests of illegal immigrant workers were common .
The Obama administration has criticized those raids as ineffective and harmful to families .

“ What is very clear is that the Obama administration is sending a signal , ” Lee said .
“ Gone are the days where only the unauthorized workers will be punished .
Employers who hire these workers are going to be on the hook as well . ”
Lee said the pending audits may prompt unauthorized workers to go home and not return to work the next day .
He said they could also result in more discrimination , as employers try to avoid hiring unauthorized immigrants and shy away from anyone who could be undocumented .
Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce president and Chief Executive Gary Toebben said in a statement Wednesday that ICE should concentrate efforts on companies that have a “ clear history of worker exploitation ” of wage - and - hour and health - and - safety laws .
“ Mass enforcement actions against employers who are complying with their I - 9 obligations can be devastating to these businesses and our overall economy , ” he said .
In any kind of work - site immigration enforcement , employees are particularly vulnerable , and the latest cases are no exception , said Angelica Salas , executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles .
Salas said she was concerned that employers with pending audits would fear further immigration enforcement and fire workers , including those who have the legal right to work .

“ At the end of the day , these workers are losing jobs , ” Salas said .
“ Instead of focusing so much attention on audits , the government should really focus on passing immigration reform . ”
L.A. attorney Carl Shusterman , who has represented numerous employers , said the audits may get unauthorized workers out of specific businesses but wo n’t solve the problem of illegal immigration .
“ If they are trying to drastically cut down on illegal immigrants living in the U.S. , ” he said , “ the I - 9 audits are n’t effective , because the workers will just simply find another job . ”

President Barack Obama proposed last month that the Fed act as an overall “ systemic risk ” regulator , with consolidated supervisory responsibility over “ large , interconnected firms whose failure could threaten the stability of the system . ”
Now William C. Dudley , the ex-Goldman Sachs economist just appointed president of the New York Federal Reserve , has upped the ante .
He thinks the Fed should be responsible for identifying and preventing asset - price bubbles .
Considering that the Fed ’s track record reveals more skill at causing bubbles than preventing them , this is a very dangerous idea .

As The Clash reminded us , Know Your Rights !
A good friend whom I trust implicitly recently told me of a disturbing conversation that had taken place between a DBA acquaintance friend of his and a Sun sales engineer .
Disturbing enough that it prompts me to remind everyone what your rights and obligations are when you use the community edition of MySQL that is licensed under the GPLv2 .
Apparently , this friend of a friend needed some performance tuning done on a MySQL Community Edition installation that spans several servers , and serves up their proprietary , commercial web application .
They contacted Sun in order to see about getting some work done on a contractual basis .
In other words , they wanted to pay Sun for performance tuning .
They were then contacted by a Sun sales engineer who , upon hearing they have multiple servers running the Community Edition of MySQL serving up a proprietary web app , told them :
1 ) . They were in violation of the license .
2 ) .
They would need to release their proprietary app under the GPL , since it uses MySQL client libraries .
3 ) . They could avoid having to GPL their application by paying Sun licensing fees for every server .
Now , I ’m not a lawyer .
But , in my legally uneducated but GPL - savvy opinion , there is a simple term for this .
It ’s extortion .
“ Pay us , or we ’ll make sure you have to GPL your proprietary work . ”
If someone admitted to the bar in any US state wants to correct my opinion that this is extortion , chime in .
I may be confusing terms .
However , I am not confused about the rights and obligations granted and ensured by the GPL .
Let me cast some light into the darkness created by this Sun salesman .
First , this company uses the Community Edition of MySQL .
Therefore , they are bound by the terms of the GPL , and NO other license , be it from Sun or elsewhere .
Full stop .
Sun can have whatever convoluted license they please for MySQL Enterprise , but if you use the Community Edition you are bound solely by the GPL .
The GPL ensures that anyone that releases code that touches GPL code must also use the GPL .
The key word here is “ releases . ”
Let ’s give two examples .
First , Linksys recently settled a lawsuit brought against them by the Software Freedom Law Center .
They use Linux kernel code in some of their router firmware , and had not released the source code to that firmware .
Why did they have to ?
Because the firmware shipped to end users .
They released code to the public in binary form that touches the GPL Linux kernel .
Thus , they need to GPL their firmware .
Second , it ’s no secret that Google uses MySQL extensively .
So why are n’t GMail , Google Reader , Google News , or other such services released to the public under the GPL ?
It ’s simple .
They are n’t released at all !
These are proprietary applications that are not released in either binary or source form .
If your code touches GPL code , but you do n’t release your code in binary or source form , you do not have to use the GPL for your code , nor do you run afoul of the GPL itself .
So , let ’s go over the three points the Sun sales engineer made above .
1 ) . They were not in violation of the license of the Community Edition MySQL server software they were using .
To imply differently is at best misinformed , and at worst FUD .
2 ) .
They do n’t have to release their code at all !
Now , if they do decide to release their code , because it touches the MySQL client libraries they will have to use the GPL .
But if they keep it a closed - source , proprietary , commerical app , with no public releases , they are well within their rights .
Their application , developed in - house and run as a service on top of the MySQL Community Edition , is not released to the public in any form .
Therefore , they do not have to use the GPL with their application or service , nor do they have to acquire commercial licenses from Sun .
End of story .
3 ) . They wanted to pay Sun for performance tuning .
Sun decided to go for a bigger paycheck .
In the end , Sun probably will not get a dime .
Smart .
Really , really smart .
Glad I do n’t own stock .
If Sun contacts you or someone you know and begins talking about license violations , read this post again carefully .
Know your rights .
And if you ’re not sure , contact the Software Freedom Law Center .
Or contact us at Monty Program ; our staff was responsible for putting MySQL under the GPL .
We know the terrain better than Sun .
If you have had a similar experience , I ’d sure like to know about it .
I ’m curious as to how widespread this “ tactic ” is , and how people are responding to it and dealing with it .
Let me know via comments .
And while we ’re at it , if you need MySQL or MariaDB performance tuning , why contact a company that instead of seeing an opportunity to make a client happy while earning money instead sees an opportunity to extort money from a heretofore satisfied user ?
Contact the Open Database Alliance .
We have people that can get the job done , and that do n’t care about your licensing .
Ubisoft has agreed to develop a new video game based on the hit US TV series Crime Scene Investigation .
The French publisher will oversee the development of CSI : Deadly Intent , which is orientated around season nine of the Las Vegas version of the show .
As with previous CSI video games , the player will engage in a range of evidence collection measures to solve some mysterious murders , with storylines being provided by the actual series writers .
Developer Telltale Games has introduced new gameplay mechanics for the latest title , including the chance to help out fellow detectives to earn their respect .
An improved witness interview system will also feature , alongside the latest forensic technology imaginable .
Ubisoft 's senior vice president of US sales and marketing Tony Key said : " CSI : Deadly Intent 's intriguing cases , realistic graphics , enhanced character acting and precise lip sync with the voices of the actors from the show will provide fans the life - like experience they are looking for in a video game based on a television show . "
The game will be released on Xbox 360 , PC , Wii and DS in the autumn .
Other Ocean Interactive is looking after the DS version , which will apparently include " additional bizarre cases " and a unique storyline to make players " feel like a real CSI character " .

Bernie Goldberg has a theory about why there 's been a significant controversy over Lou Dobbs ' promotion of the " Birther " conspiracy theory :
It 's all an evil plot by the Obama White House to string the story along indefinitely so as to make his right - wing opposition look like a nuttier bunch than a PayDay bar .
Goldberg :
Well , let 's get the easy part out of the way first .
CNN should not , repeat , not fire Lou Dobbs for talking about this .
Lou Dobbs did n't say Barack Obama was n't born in the United States , he said just the opposite !
He said he was born in the United States .
But then he said he should produce his birth certificate .
Now let 's think about this for a second .
Why would n't President Obama release his birth certificate ?
He was born in Hawaii , Hawaii last I checked is in the United States , and -- why in the world would n't he release his birth certificate ?
O'Reilly : Can I answer that question ?
Goldberg :
Well , let me answer it first .
OK ?
Let me just answer my own question first .
O'Reilly : OK , you answer it , and then I 'll have the correct answer .
Goldberg : I have a theory .
And the theory is this :
That the Chicago Mafia inside the White House want to keep this crazy controversy going .
Because the longer it goes , the better the chance that they will conflate the crazy right - wing fringe with regular conservatives and regular Republicans .
O'Reilly :
That 's not a bad theory .
But from dealing with the Obama White House , now , for almost , more than a year , I will tell you they are , uh , as every White House I 've ever experienced , they 're arrogant , they 're arrogant .
And they 're saying to themselves , ' We 're not gonna let Lou Dobbs tell us what to do .
We 're not gonna let these cranks on talk radio tell us what to do .
They want the birth certificate released ?
Tough .
We 're not going to do it , because we have the power , and we do n't like that . '
That 's what it 's all about -- it 's a ' Ha ha , we 're not gonna do what you say . '
Interesting theories , gentlemen .
Unfortunately , they both tend to run aground on a simple fact : Obama actually released his birth certificate in June 2008 .
It reads , " Certification of Live Birth . "
Now , as FactCheck.org 's definitive piece on the certificate issue explains , this is in fact the " short form " of Obama 's birth certificate , not its long form , which is filled out by the hospital and kept in its records .
So why does n't Obama release the long form ?
Because Hawaiian law does n't give him that option :
The document is a " certification of birth , " also known as a short - form birth certificate .
The long form is drawn up by the hospital and includes additional information such as birth weight and parents ' hometowns .
The short form is printed by the state and draws from a database with fewer details .
The Hawaii Department of Health 's birth record request form does not give the option to request a photocopy of your long - form birth certificate , but their short form has enough information to be acceptable to the State Department .
We tried to ask the Hawaii DOH why they only offer the short form , among other questions , but they have not given a response .
Now , if Goldberg and O'Reilly are so concerned that the public might conclude that mainstream conservatives are prone to far - right conspiracy theories and various other forms of wingnuttery , they might look in the mirror .
It 's the virtual definition of wingnuttery to even be asking why Obama wo n't release his birth certificate when he has in fact done so .
There 's no Obama conspiracy keeping this garbage alive and tying it around the necks of mainstream conservatives .
They 're doing a very fine job of that themselves .
Get Thick , Shiny Hair
The average woman spends hundreds of hours washing , drying , and styling her hair each year , and yet 81 percent of women report that they 're not always happy with their coif .
What are the most common complaints ?
Most of us wish our locks were either fuller or shinier ( or both ) .
It should come as no surprise then that more than half of all styling products sold are designed to make tresses either glisten or thicken up .
Before you run out and buy another serum or spray , read on to learn the inside scoop : which products really work , the tools worth your investment , and the styling strategies used by the pros .
Shiny Hair Secrets
1 . Go natural .
Daily brushing and styling can take a toll on your tresses , robbing them of natural oils and leading to breakage .
Trade in your plastic brush for one with natural bristles ( look for boar ) , which redistribute oils throughout hair as you brush , boosting shine .
" The only time I use anything but a boar - bristle brush is to detangle wet hair , " says Harry Josh , creative consultant for John Frieda Collection .
Natural bristles are also less likely to break hairs .
Use them consistently for fewer flyaways .
Try the Mason Pearson Sensitive Boar Bristle Brush ( $ 130 ) .
2. Avoid alcohol - laced products .
" Alcohol , pollution , and humidity all rob hair of its natural shine , " notes Arsen Gurgov , a top hairstylist at the Louis Licari salons in New York City and Beverly Hills , whose clients include Susan Sarandon and Melanie Griffith .
" Most mousses contain alcohol , so if your hair is dry , try a cream or serum instead , " adds Josh .
All of the shine - enhancing products in Aveda 's Brilliant line are blissfully alcohol free ( $ 12 - $ 23 ) .
3 . Wash the right way .
Though many of us lather up daily , experts insist that washing a few times a week is sufficient .
Skipping shampoo helps hair retain shine but can also leave it limp .
" I tell my clients who wash every day to apply conditioner first , keeping it away from the roots , " says Gurgov .
" Then , without rinsing in between , apply shampoo just to the roots , lather , and rinse everything out , " he instructs .
" Your roots will be lifted , but the rest of your hair will retain its shine . "
Try L'Oréal Paris Vive Pro Nutri Gloss Conditioner ( $ 4.99 ) .
4 . Rinse with cold .
Rinsing hair with cold water closes the cuticle , leaving a smooth , shiny surface .
Blasting with cold air after a blow - dry has a similar smoothing effect , and most dryers have a cold setting for this purpose .
5 . Fight frizz .
Hair is porous , absorbing moisture from the environment , which is what causes it to frizz in humid climates .
To prevent midday flyaways , make sure your hair is dry before you head out ; any water left in your locks can lead to frizzing later on .
Gurgov recommends using a flatiron on the hair that frames your face after you blow - dry , which will remove any excess moisture .
6. Smooth with silicone .
Products with silicones lie on top of the hair shaft to seal the cuticle and create a barrier between styling tools and hair , reducing friction and limiting heat damage .
Try John Frieda Frizz - Ease Thermal Protection Serum ( $ 9.99 ) .
But like many other things , silicone works best in moderation .
" Use too much of it and your hair will fall flat or begin to look greasy , " warns stylist Tommy Buckett , a spokesman for Kérastase Paris .
Buckett advises his clients with thinner tresses , like Rachel McAdams , to use a misting of a silicone shine spray instead .
Try Kérastase Paris Vernis Nutri-Sculpt ( $ 29 ) .
7 . Try a heat treatment .
" Many women think of heat as something that dries out hair , " says stylist Orlando Pita of New York 's Orlo salon .
But used the right way , it can give your hair incredible shine , especially if it 's damaged .
" The reason stylists put clients under heat during deep - conditioning treatments is that it opens up the cuticle , allowing a mask or oil to penetrate the hair shaft at a deeper level , " explains Pita .
If you can't get to the salon , apply a mask or a hot - oil treatment at home once a month .
" After you 've applied the product , wrap a really hot towel around your head , " instructs Victoria 's Secret spokesman Italo Gregorio , who creates the hair for the brand 's annual fashion show and has shared this tip with A - list clients like Gwyneth Paltrow .
Try Rene Furterer Karité Intense Nutrition Oil ( $ 36 ) .
8. Invest in ionic tools .
Dryers and irons that are worth the investment not only protect tresses from frizz and flyaways , they also improve hair health .
While traditional tools get hotter as you work , ionic ceramic tools maintain constant heat and pump hair full of cuticle - smoothing negative ions , which improve strength and shine over time .
Try the T3 Bespoke Labs Evolution Dryer ( $ 300 ) .
9 . Care for curly hair .
Wavy hair tends to be much duller and drier than straight hair .
" Curly hair usually grows slower than straight hair , " explains Buckett , " so the ends are much older and need considerably more moisture than the roots . "
If your hair has some natural wave , make sure you get a trim every six to eight weeks , and always use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner .
After styling , apply a serum like TIGI S - Factor Dream Drops Shine On ! ( $ 30 ) to the ends to lock in moisture and shine .
10 .
Get glistening waves .
" Shine is about alignment , " notes Proctor & Gamble senior scientist Leslie Bride .
" Light hits each individual hair and reflects back in a certain direction , " she ex-plains , " so when neighboring hair strands are aligned , the reflections all come back to the eye in the same direction , resulting in a crisp shine band . "
Curly hair looks shinier when it's all going in the same direction , which is why big , smooth , structured curls reflect more light than lots of little ringlets .
" Wrapping curls that are already dry around a barrel curling iron for a few seconds will align them and make them look more polished , " notes Buckett .
Try the Conair BaByliss Pro Tourmaline Ceramic One - Inch Curling Iron ( $ 99.99 ) .
11 . Tried and tested .
Here are the best shine - boosting products for your hair type .
Normal / fine : Shampoo : Origins Clear Head Mint Shampoo ( $ 11 ) .
Conditioner : Nexxus Headress Volumizing Leave - In Conditioner ( $ 11 ) .
Styling product : Matrix Sleek.look Styling Crème Lite ( $ 14.95 ) .
Textured / curly : Shampoo : Aveda Smooth Infusion Shampoo ( $ 20 ) .
Conditioner : Kérastase Paris Masque Oléo - Relax ( $ 44 ) .
Styling product : Phyto Phytolisse Finishing Shine Serum ( $ 30 ) .
Get Volume & Thickness
1. Use protein products .
Add body with protein - based products .
" Hair is made of keratin protein , " says Pita , so volumizers with protein attach to hair fibers and build body .
Look for wheat , soy , and silk proteins .
Try Ojon Hydrating Thickening Shampoo ( $ 22 ) .
Beware of overuse , though , as too much protein can make hair brittle .
2 . Try a diffuser .
Most dryers blow air in a stream , which robs curls of their spring .
" For fuller waves , use a diffuser with prongs , " says Buckett .
Dry your hair upside down , using the prongs to massage your roots .
3 . A better blowout .
Blow - drying gives limp locks a lift .
" If your hair is fine , begin by drenching the roots in thickening spray while it 's damp , " instructs Gregorio .
Try Victoria 's Secret So Sexy Volumizing Spray ( $ 12.50 ) .
Then , starting from the front and moving back , dry one - inch sections of hair .
" Using a round boar - bristle brush , pull each section up toward the ceiling , keeping your dryer aimed at the brush , " he says .
" When you reach the ends , curl hair around the brush and roll it back toward the scalp . "
When all of the sections are dry , blast your hair with cold air to set the style .
4. Layer your locks .
Fullness starts with the right haircut .
If you have curly hair , layers will take it to new heights .
" Shorter layers underneath really boost body , " says Gurgov .
" But make sure your stylist cuts with scissors rather than a razor , which creates frizz . "
5. Try Velcro rollers .
Setting hair with Velcro rollers will give you an unbeatable boost of volume .
" Six rollers at the crown make a huge difference , " says Josh .
After hair is dry ( but still warm ) , wrap one - inch sections of hair around each roller , following the direction of growth .
Leave them on for at least 10 minutes .
( Longer yields a bigger body boost . )
" The key is to roll them really tight , " says Josh .
Brushing after you 've taken the rollers out can cause volume to deflate , so just shake hair out and spritz with Herbal Essences Body Envy Hairspray ( $ 2.99 ) .
6 . Lose some length .
Chopping your locks can make them look fuller .
" Bobs , particularly blunt bobs , make hair appear thicker and look modern now , " advises Josh .
7 . Add some color .
Coloring hair fattens up every strand for an overall volume boost .
" Processes that involve peroxide or ammonia yield the most dramatic results , pushing the hair shaft open to fluff up even the finest strands , " Josh explains .
Semipermanent color also has favorable effects on fullness , though it 's not as noticeable to the naked eye .
Simply adding a few highlights can give the appearance of volume , texture , and movement .
8 . The high - tech future .
Hair - thickening treatments may soon come to your dermatologist 's office .
Light BioScience has a new LED light treatment in the works that has docs talking .
" This will be the next big thing in hair rejuvenation , " says New York dermatologist Fredric Brandt .
" The light penetrates deep into hair follicles to stimulate growth , and I have seen promising results . "
9 . Tried and tested .
Here are the best body - boosting products for your hair type .

The Obama administration is making a last - minute effort to fix the controversial Real ID
Act before the program 's deadline is reached in December .
Changes to the measure , which will be introduced soon in Congress , could add additional privacy safeguards and remove some of the program 's most costly requirements .
The Real ID Act , which was passed as a rider on a 2005 military spending bill , aims to create a standardized national ID card and a system of interconnected state identity databases that would be fully accessible by the federal government .
The law requires state ID cards to have a machine - readable mechanism that can be used to electronically extract information about the card - holder .
The cards would be required in order to gain access to federal buildings and security - sensitive locations , such as airports .
Real ID has faced intense criticism from privacy advocates and state governments .
The implementation costs are far exceeding Congressional estimates and states are facing enormous technical challenges as they attempt to boost the interoperability of their legacy identity database systems in order to meet the law 's requirements .
Not a single state was able to implement the program by the original May 2008 deadline , forcing the government to extend the deadline to the end of 2009 .
The new deadline is approaching swiftly and the vast majority of states are still not on track .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , the former governor of Arizona and a vocal critic of Real ID , is said to be drafting a new proposal that will scale back the law 's requirements so that it can be reasonably accomplished by states within the allotted time .
The Washington Post reports that the new proposal , which is called Pass ID , could boost the program 's privacy safeguards and eliminate the costly national database requirements .
The law would still require the identity cards to include a machine - readable mechanism .
According to the Post , the Obama administration has been in talks with the National Governors Association for months in an effort to devise a reasonable compromise .
The Republican leadership in Congress , however , is voicing preemptive opposition to the changes .
Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner ( R - WI ) , one of the original authors of the Real ID Act , criticized the governors who are struggling to implement the program and argued against weakening the law .
" [ If Real ID is weakened ] we go right back to where we were on Sept. 10 , 2001 , " Sensenbrenner told the Post .
" Maybe governors should have been in the Capitol when we knew a plane was on its way to Washington wanting to kill a few thousand more people . "
As no state has been able to implement the Real ID Act , the condition of identity validation in the United States is arguably already exactly the same today as it was roughly ten years ago , so the soundness of Sensenbrenner 's criticism is questionable .
Shrill invocations of 9/11 aside , the database plan was flawed to begin with and its demise marks a significant improvement .
Update
The Pass ID bill was introduced this morning by a bipartisan coalition of senators .
It will be reviewed next month by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
Citing a nationwide survey of state DMV agencies that was conducted in 2006 , the supporters of Pass ID say that the original Real ID plan would have cost $ 11 billion to implement over five years and was not a viable solution .
They contend that Pass ID offers a more tenable approach that will improve identification practices without significantly degrading privacy .
" The PASS ID Act does exactly what the 9/11 Commission recommended : it sets strong security standards for the issuance of identification cards and driver 's licenses .
What it does not do is go far beyond that recommendation by requiring the collection of Americans ' personal information and storing it in a centralized repository accessible by any State DMV , " said Senator Daniel K. Akaka , a Hawaiian Democrat who backed the new proposal , in a statement .
" REAL ID called for all States to store copies of individuals ' documents such as birth certificates and their photographs in databases and to provide all other State Departments of Motor Vehicles with access to that information .
REAL ID did not require any privacy protection of these State databases , which would contain massive amounts of personal information .
These databases could provide one - stop shopping for identity thieves and the backbone for a national identification database .
PASS ID addresses those privacy and costs concerns while providing the ID security called for by the 9/11 commission . "

PyCon ORM panel liveblog
I ’m sitting about five rows back in the ballroom at the Hyatt , waiting for the ORM panel to begin .
Panel ’s starting .
Moderator Alex Gaynor introduces himself and panelists :
Guido van Rossum ( App Engine )
Jacob Kaplan - Moss ( Django )
Massimo diPierro ( web2py )
Ian Bicking ( SQLObject )
Mike Bayer ( SQLALchemy )
First question : brief history of your ORM
SQLALchemy : wanted to do a CMS , but never ended up writing it .
Had idea for a modular library to talk to databases , different bits you could use or not use — connection pooling , SQL expressions , ORM — as you liked .
Background was from previous work doing stats and content management for major - league baseball , which involved lots of complex SQL .
Django : began life at a small family - owned newspaper in Kansas , as internal content - management system .
Jacob says it ’s really been through three versions .
First version was inspired by SQLObject .
Second version was rewritten by magic - removal effort .
Third , current version came from major refactor by Malcolm Tredinnick .
Jacob says he ’s “ far from qualified ” to speak about ORM .
SQLObject : Ian started working on it in 2001 , first release 2002 .
It was something he found handy as an abstraction on top of the Python DB - API .
Realized later he was doing Active Record pattern .
Originally did code generation , which offended his sensibilities , so he started using metaprogramming instead .
Eventually passed maintenance on to another developer .
web2py : In 2007 started using Python in classes at DePaul University .
Wanted to have class on web frameworks , looked into using existing frameworks but decided to build a new one the students could study — existing frameworks were still changing too quickly .
Ended up gaining drivers for many databases .
ORM layer was meant to express any possible SQL statement , and express syntax with operators instead of keyword arguments .
App Engine : Guido ’s not sure why he’s on this panel , he ’s never written or used an ORM .
App Engine is n’t relational , so “ the R is not relevant ” .
Originally had low - level API built around dictionaries , but that was cumbersome , so a layer was written on top of that which introduced App Engine ’s model class .
Supports a very minimal subset of SQL to do some types of queries , but most queries are done by writing method calls .
Second round
What should the relationship be between ORM and non-relational DBs ?
SQLAlchemy : People should be able to use whatever they want , but SQLAlchemy has chosen to focus on SQL and will never implement a backend for a non-relational store .
Easily switching an existing project from , say , an RDBMS to Couch DB does n’t seem possible .
And at any rate , a goal of SA is to keep things explicit and out where you can see them ( non-relational support might not be able to do this in the same library ) .
Django :
We ’ve never viewed what we have as an “ ORM ” , we ’ve viewed Django ’s model layer as a model layer : objects and operations on sets of objects , happen to be backed by an RDBMS .
So the model layer should work well on a non-relational DB ; it ’s theoretically possible , but nobody ’s done the work to find out where the problems would be .
Would take someone doing the work to find where bugs are .
Jacob agrees that writing an application first in a relational frame of mind , then deploying non-relational probably wo n’t work — need to choose one up - front when writing an application .
web2py : Already ported DB abstraction layer to work on App Engine .
Committed to supporting more functionality — sees commonalities rather than differences .
Not every query expression will work on App Engine , but that ’s OK ; things that do n’t work on a given backend ( e.g. , App Engine does n’t have a concept of transactions ) just do n’t work .
App Engine : Give users what they want .
Hopes someone will get Django models working on App Engine .
Chatter ( Jacob , Massimo , Guido ) about different mindsets involved in relational and non-relational application design .
Guido agrees that porting from one to the other with the same app is a non-starter , but choosing a framework should n’t tie you into one option .
Mike brings up the distinction between a model and a representation of a query .
Even if you could , say , map a SQLAlchemy class on to a non-relational DB , you ca n’t still do the same types of queries , can you ?
Massimo says no , he ’s interested in the types of things you can do on both .
Round three
Should tools for working with databases map exclusively to what exists in the database , or should it be more full - featured ?
Guido starts to say something , there ’s an interruption about ZODB .
Guido likes explicitly stating schema definition ( as opposed to ZODB mapping Python objects into data store ) .
Massimo agrees .
Jacob takes a “ very slightly ” different viewpoint : there ’s value to declaring models in Python because you can have metadata and constraints the DB ca n’t support .
Mike says models should do more than just talk to DB — they ’re supposed to have business logic .
Audience questions
Question : Cite a feature or concept from someone else ’s ORM that you think is well - done and you ’d like to adopt ?
Guido : Django ’s admin .
Jacob says the fact that it ’s tied to models is a bug .
Ian : SQLAlchemy ’s separation of concepts .
Jacob : “ Expando ” feature from App Engine .
But relational DBs ca n’t do it .
Massimo : SQLAlchemy ’s support for existing database schemas .
Question :
This panel ’s about design decisions .
What benefits / drawbacks do you see from design choices like Active Record or Data Mapper patterns , lowest - common - denominator support , etc. , especially with DBs adding new features all the time ?
Jacob : Django does n’t have , say , an IPV6 field , but you can define one if your DB supports that data type .
That ’s important .
Mike : SQLAlchemy has a lowest - common - denominator way to use , but that ’s not what they aim for .
If you want to tie yourself to advanced Postgres features , SQLAlchemy will let you and will support them .
( Massimo gave a short answer I did n’t quite hear )
Question : Running on alternate Python VMs ?
Mike : Targeting Python 3.0 , Jython and IronPython .
Broke up DB dialect support from code that knew DB API quirks .
Important to do this since on alternate VMs you use different adapter modules .
Jacob : Django runs ( or is meant to run ) on all the major VMs .
Support for VM - specific DB adapters is up to community , though .
Talking about similar breaking up of information to avoid duplicating code between backends which use different driver models on same DB .
Massimo : Built - in web server in web2py and built - in DB drivers do n’t work on alternate VMs .
Anyone an expert on Jython and JDBC ?
Guido :
No plans for App Engine to run on alternate VMs .
Question :
Any frameworks addressing things like OLAP / data warehousing ?
Should frameworks do this ?
Mike : says he does n’t really have an answer , he does n’t work with that stuff .
Jacob agrees , saying he ’s unqualified .
Ian passes , as does the rest of the panel .
Question :
What are your plans for migrating to Python 3 ?
Mike : SA has 2 - to - 3 converter .
Jacob : Django supports older Pythons and has to manage transition steadily / gradually .
Excited about proposed “ 3t o2 ” project .
Ian : Does n’t maintain SQLObject anymore , does n’t know its roadmap .
Massimo : Python 3 poses both technical and social problems .
Technical problems are minor .
Social problem is the main thing : web2 py has a backwards - compatibility commitment for applications , need to be careful about breaking it .
Guido :
Google tends to lag a bit on versions because it ’s hard to switch .
App Engine is n’t completely tied down , but porting will be a very large project , akin to supporting another whole language ( and they ’re already working on other languages , but Python 3.0 is n’t one of them ) .
And with that Alex says we ’re out of time .
Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi is being held in the notorious Insein jail in Rangoon , after being charged with violating the terms of her house arrest .
Human rights campaigners say incarceration at the top security prison , which is known as the " darkest hell - hole in Burma " , could be tantamount to a death sentence - especially as the 63 - year - old 's health is known to be fragile .
Bo Kyi , now joint secretary of Assistance Association for Political Prisoners ( Burma ) , has first - hand experience of life in Insein jail .
He was jailed for more than seven years for political dissent , and was kept in solitary confinement for more than a year , in a concrete cell that was about 8 ft by 12ft ( 2.5 m by 3.5 m ) .

There was no toilet in the cell - just a bucket filled with urine and faeces .
He slept on a mat on the floor .
Mr Kyi says he was tortured and beaten by the prison guards .
He was shackled in heavy chains , with a metal bar between his legs , which made it difficult to walk .
Every morning for about two weeks , he says he was made to " exercise " - forced to adopt awkward positions and if he failed he was brutally beaten .
During this time he was not allowed to shower and was forced to sleep on bare concrete .
Disease rife
He was later moved from isolation and shared an overcrowded cell with four other political prisoners .
He says the prison has the capacity to house 5,000 - 6,000 prisoners .
He estimates there are currently some 10,000 in detention .
The fact that Aung San Suu Kyi now might be subject to a life - threatening detention condition - it 's totally unacceptable
Debbie Stothard
Human rights activist
Once a week they were able to wash their clothes .
But during the stifling summers he said there was no water to bathe .
With only three prison doctors to treat 10,000 inmates , he says diseases such as tuberculosis , scabies and dysentery were rife .
Mental illness was also widespread .
Bo Kyi says Aung San Suu Kyi is most likely being held in a special compound built for her detention in 2003 , which has a wooden bed and a toilet .
Although the conditions there are probably not as bad as in the rest of the prison , he says he is still extremely concerned for her well - being .
' Totally unacceptable '
Ms Suu Kyi has spent more than 11 of the past 19 years in some form of detention under Burma 's military government .
She was jailed at Insein prison in May 2003 , after clashes between opposition activists and supporters of the regime .
Her latest period of house arrest was extended last year - a move which analysts say is illegal even under the junta 's own rules .
It is due to expire on 27 May .
Human rights activist Debbie Stothard , from the pressure group Altsean - Burma , has urged the international community to intervene in trying to secure Ms Suu Kyi's release .
" Many people have died when they have been detained in Insein , that 's a proven fact .
" The fact that Aung San Suu Kyi ... now might be subject to a life - threatening detention condition - it 's totally unacceptable , " she said .
" It 's totally unjust and it's time that Asean , China and the rest of the international community finally put their foot down . "
Many analysts believe that pro-democracy leader 's arrest is a pretext by the military regime to keep her detained until elections expected in 2010 .

Based in Copenhagen , Denmark , the Wrenchmonkees was founded in 2008 by Anders Ingvartsen , Nicholas Bech and Per Nielsen .
After a few years Anders left , leaving Nicholas and Per to develop the company further .
In the early years , most activity was around bike builds , with a shop and an online store added later to meet the demand for aftermarket parts .
The Wrenchmonkees were one of the pioneers of the ‘ new wave ’ custom scene in Europe , and inspired many private and professional builders .
They rebuild and customize old and new motorcycles , and design bolt - on parts for contemporary motorcycles such as the Yamaha SR500 , XSR900 and XJR1300 .
The overall design philosophy is simple : clean lines and colors , with mechanical parts to the fore .
Visual balance and proportions are the key elements , with respect for the origin and legacy of the bike .
These elements led Yamaha Europe straight to the Wrenchmonkees in 2011 when the Yamaha Yard Built project started .
Four more projects followed during the next five years .
By 2016 , the Wrenchmonkees had built more than 80 bikes .
These days , production has reduced a little , as the company focuses on more refined bike builds and designing aftermarket parts .
The Wrenchmonkees also have their own clothing line , Wrenchmonkees Apparel , which started out with work and outer wear , but now also includes normal street wear .
The Westside of Los Angeles is the perfect region for real estate neurosis .
Bubbles play on human nature ’s manic tendencies and nothing is more volatile than real estate in the Westside of Los Angeles .
I ’ve written a couple of pieces highlighting homes in Culver City and Santa Monica and discussed why these regions are prime candidates for the destruction that the Alt - A and option ARM tsunami will unleash later in 2009 and 2010 .
Just to give you a perspective , in May only 219 homes sold in the Westside of Los Angeles while the entire county had 6,521 homes sold .
The 29 zip codes that make up the Westside of L.A. make up only 3.3 percent of all total sales for the county but there are probably more per capita articles written on this region than any other .
Call it the “ MTV Cribs ” obsession .
Now in this article , I want to examine data from March of 2009 and compare it to data from May of 2009 .
I will also pull up current MLS data and distressed property information to show how a silent tsunami is building up in these areas that many people seem to be in denial with .
California with a $ 26.3 billion deficit and pumping out IOUs , yet some people still think that their region is locked in a tiny silo that protects their pseudo housing wealth .
Some people are still in the mania phase of the bubble , ( as hard as that it to believe ) .
Let us first examine data from March :
This is important information .
What you ’ll see is that 14 zip codes are reporting year over year declines in their median price while only 6 are reporting an increase .
Even in March , the Westside only made up 170 sales of the 5,971 sales in Los Angeles County .
Let us now see what occurred in the period of two months :
What you now see is more year over year price declines .
In this latest data , you will see that for the Westside 18 zip codes are reporting year over year declines while only 2 zip codes show any increase .
I ’ve also included a comparison from March to May and you ’ll see how extremely volatile this region is because of the tiny subset of sales .
Sales did increase from March but that has to do with falling prices .
Just look at Westwood for example .
The median price fell by $ 1.125 million from March but this is only based on 9 homes sold .
This also occurred in Beverly Hills ( 90212 ) where the median price fell by $ 503,000 in two months but is also based on 4 homes sold .
Yet the overwhelming trend is to lower prices .
What else would one expect in a region littered with Alt - A and option ARM products ?
People sometimes need examples so we ’ll take a look at a home not in the Westside , but in Southern California which exemplifies what is going on .
The former New York Mets and Phillies baseball player Lenny Dykstra recently filed for bankruptcy protection .
He had purchased Wayne Gretzy ’s gorgeous Thousand Oaks home for $ 17.5 million .
The home was recently on the market for $ 25 million then dropped to $ 16.5 million .
* Source : Zillow
“ ( ESPN ) Walter Hackett , a lawyer for Dykstra , said the event triggering the bankruptcy filing was a planned foreclosure sale of a southern California residence that Dykstra bought from hockey legend Wayne Gretzky for $ 17.5 million in 2007 .
Dykstra is “ in good spirits , ” Hackett said in an interview .
“ He understands now that bankruptcy is truly a protective act .
I do expect that Lenny is going to emerge from Chapter 11 , and make those people whole who have legitimate claims . ”
According to the bankruptcy petition , Dykstra ’s largest unsecured creditors include units of JPMorgan Chase & Co. , owed $ 12.9 million , and Bank of America Corp , owed a combined $ 4.2 million .
Hackett said Washington Mutual , now part of JPMorgan , was the main lender on the 2007 home purchase , and that the bank misled Dykstra about his ability to afford the property .
The lawyer said the bank deserves nothing on its claim .
JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly said : “ We do n’t comment on individual cases , but we expect our customers to repay their legal obligations under their mortgages when possible . ”
Bwahaha !
$ 12.9 million plus $ 4.2 million comes out to $ 17.1 million !
You mean to say on a $ 17.5 million dollar place Washington Mutual and Bank of American allowed virtually a zero down play ?
I was searching for the home in the MLS but it does n’t seem to be there given the bankruptcy filing which will now forcibly sort things out .
In April it was reported by Zillow that Sotheby ’s International had the home listed at $ 25 million which obviously did not sell .
The current Zestimate is $ 13.1 million .
Apparently , multi-million dollar properties are not immune to the busting housing market .
And if you want to see leverage , take a look at this :
“ The 46 - year - old has no more than $ 50,000 of assets and between $ 10 million and $ 50 million of liabilities , according to a petition filed Tuesday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Central District of California . ”
Maximum leverage .
I find it hard to believe that there is still a sizable contingent of anti-math folks that believe this entire global credit mess was created by subprime borrowers .
They think that poor people in the inner city somehow led to $ 13.87 trillion in household wealth being wiped off the balance sheet .
Try telling these people that some $ 1 trillion in subprime loans does not equal $ 13.87 trillion in wealth destruction .
The reality is much of this is a distraction from their puppet masters on Wall Street and the true crony - banking machine .
Now moving back to the Westside you can rest assured the likes of WaMu , Countrywide , and IndyMac made plenty of maximum leverage loans that will end horribly in the next 6 to 18 months .
Now let me give you a glimpse of the shadow market that is developing in the Westside .
Take for example the community of Palms .
If you look at the March to May data , you will see a slight increase in the median price from $ 560,000 to $ 609,000 but this does n’t tell you much since the increase in sales went from 7 to 9 .
It is a small sample size .
However , if you look at the MLS there are currently 94 listed properties .
Not bad right ?
Well that would probably be true if there were n’t 95 distressed properties !
That is right , in the zip code of Palms with 94 listed MLS properties there are now 95 distressed properties .
Westside L.A. immune ?
You can rest assured that the conversation in the summer of 2010 will be extremely different .
But let us keep our focus on Palms .
With 95 distressed properties , you would assume that many would show up in the MLS right ?
Nope .
Only 3 of these properties are listed as foreclosure or short sales even though 43 of the 95 distressed properties are bank owned or geared up for auction .
Welcome to the shadow inventory world .
The other 42 properties are in pre-foreclosure .
But let us look at one of the places that is currently listed as a short sale :
This is a nice 5 - bedroom home with 3 bathrooms .
It is definitely a good home for a higher income professional .
Yet even these kind of homes are not immune to the housing bubble bursting .
The home has been on the MLS for 67 days .
It is currently a short sale but at this range , you do n’t have a big client base like you would with some Real Homes of Genius .
It is a larger home with 3,017 square feet and is listed as being built in 2005 .
This home has a last sale in 1992 for $ 206,000 .
But once again like the Culver City home example , it looks like this home was the ultimate California equity withdrawal machine :
This home was tapped out like a keg .
Keep in mind the last sale occurred in 1992 for only $ 206,000 and somehow managed to end up with a $ 1,030,000 first mortgage on the place .
Looking on the history you will see how notorious Wells Fargo was in this California housing bubble but also First Federal Bank , an option ARM specialist .
The notice of default was filed on July of 2009 so this is a fairly new listing but given the enormous amount of notice of defaults being filed , we are going to have an epic Alt - A and option ARM wave hitting like a ton of bricks later in 2009 and into 2010 .
The public - private investment program better stay away from these California loans because you can rest assured these are the kind of loans that will be pushed into it .
As you can see , the current borrower is now behind by $ 19,395 and this of course will be growing each day the home does n’t sell .
And it is n’t selling :
Price Reduced : 06/02/09 — $ 1,199,000 to $ 1,099,000
Price Reduced : 06/11/09 — $ 1,099,000 to $ 999,000
As you can see from the tiny number of sales in the Westside that there are still people buying in the Westside who still believe in the pagan god of real estate .
Yet many will be stunned when the Alt - A and option ARM wave strikes .
I have never seen such a massive pent up wave of problem real estate and this current pattern is very similar to what occurred in 2007 with the subprime bust .
We all know what damage that is ravaging in the Inland Empire and Central Valley for example .
Take a look at the NOD chart :
The home currently has a $ 1,030,000 first and is selling for $ 999,000 .
If it would sell today the loss would be :
$ 1,030,000 – $ 999,000 = -$ 31,000
-$ 59,940 ( 6 % commission )
-$ 19,395 ( missed payments )
Total loss = $ 110,335
The lender should count their lucky stars if this sale goes through at this price .
Yet the homes that sold in Palms are for much less .
From the latest 9 homes that sold the median price is $ 609,000 .
The Westside is now standing in the direct pathway of the Alt - A and option ARM tsunami .
It is much too late to get out of the way .

During the presidential campaign , Mr. Obama suggested that a broadly available public plan could resemble Medicare , the existing federal health - insurance program that is only open to the elderly and certain other groups .
Now , a Medicare - like plan is highly unlikely , Senate aides say .
White House officials also have signaled they are open to other approaches .
Two other options are still on the table .
One is to create a public insurance plan run by multiple regional third - party administrators .
The other is to have states create their own insurance plans , possibly by allowing people to buy policies through the plans available to state employees .
The idea is that state plans would n't have the clout that would enable a national plan to muscle out private insurers .
Yet another option , proposed by Sen. Charles Schumer ( D. , N.Y. ) , is to create a public plan that pays for itself and adheres to private - insurance rules .
If Senate Democrats and Republicans can't reach a compromise on the public plan , there are still several ways it could make its way into legislation .
Although leading Democrats have said they want a bipartisan deal , they could forgo that and push through their own measure using a tactic known as " reconciliation , " which shields bills from procedural delays and requires just 51 votes in the Senate to pass rather than a filibuster - proof 60 .
We must make it CLEAR that we will NOT accepted mandated health care insurance WITHOUT a strong , robust Medicare - like public option .
The White House has to hear from us that we wo n't ACCEPT mandates without a strong , robust Medicare - like public option .
CALL the White House at : 202-456-1111 and E - MAIL them as well !
These Senators also have to hear from us that we WANT a strong , robust Medicare - like public option , and that we will NOT accept their so - called health care plan without it .
The public option is the line in the sand for me .
Is it the line in the sand for you as well ?
Then let 's fight to have the BEST possible public option , which is a Medicare - like public option , as outlined in the white paper proposal released by the Senate Finance Committee .
In that white paper , there were three proposals for the public option :
Approach 1 : Medicare - Like Plan
This proposal would establish a " Medicare - like " public health insurance option to be offered through the Exchange .
The public option would be administered by a new agency within the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) .
Eligibility rules , markets , and income - related tax credits for the public option would mirror those for all other plans offered through the Exchange .
Medicare providers would be required to participate in the public option , and would be paid Medicare rates plus 0 - 10 % .
Rating rules would apply to the public option in the same way that they apply to plans offered through the Exchange in the non-group and small group markets .
( Rating rules restrict the variation in price of insurance policies according to the risk of the person or group seeking coverage and are explained in the section on non-group market rating rules and risk adjustment . )
Risk adjustment would apply to the public option in the same way that it applies to plans offered through the Exchange in the non-group and small group markets .
( Risk adjustment is an adjustment in the payment for an insurance policy which reflects the expected variation in expenditures of sicker or healthier individuals .
See the section on non-group market rating rules and risk adjustment . )
The public option would incorporate any medical delivery system reforms adopted from the overall reform effort .
The public option would not have solvency requirements .
The public option would start and accept enrollees on the same date that the Exchange begins .
Approach 2 : Third Party Administrator Proposal 2 would be similar to Proposal 1 with the following differences .
First , instead of being operated by HHS , the public option would be administered through multiple regional third - party administrators ( TPAs ) who would be required to report to the Secretary .
This governance structure will be separate from the agency overseeing competition among other private plan options .
Second , the TPAs would be required to establish networks of participating medical providers .
Payments for participating providers would be negotiated by the TPAs .
Lastly , the public health insurance option would be required to have reserve funds .
Approach 3 : State - Run Public Option Proposal 3 envisions a State - run public option .
This option could either be mandatory or optional for States but the details of its administration will be left to the States .
One possible option for the States might be to allow individuals to purchase coverage through the State employee plans .
As was written about earlier , we have 21 Democratic senators out of 59 Democratic senators that have come out in support of the public option .
Here are the names below :
Please CALL these senators listed above and thank them for supporting a strong , robust Medicare - like public option .
When you call , please ask them not to support legislation that has a watered - down public option or does not have a Medicare - like public option .
Ask them to oppose the so - called Schumer public option compromise .
We need them to have stronger leverage in the Senate when it comes to the ultimate passage of health care reform , instead of allowing the Senate Blue Dogs , led by Senator Bayh , to have that leverage .
It 's also sad that we only have 21 Democratic senators in the Senate in support of a public option in health care reform .
And that these senators below , led by that odious Senator Bayh , might block the inclusion of a Medicare - like public option in favor of the so - called Schumer compromise .
Sens. Mark Udall ( Colo . ) ,
Evan Bayh ( Ind . ) ,
Michael Bennet ( Colo . ) ,
Mark Begich ( Alaska ) ,
Tom Carper ( Del. ) ,
Kay Hagan ( N.C. ) ,
Herb Kohl ( Wis . ) ,
Mary Landrieu ( La. ) ,
Joe Lieberman ( Conn . ) ,
Blanche Lincoln ( Ark. ) ,
Ben Nelson ( Neb . ) ,
Bill Nelson ( Fla . ) ,
Jeanne Shaheen ( N.H. ) , and
Mark Warner ( Va. ) .
Can you please CALL these senators above and ask them to support a strong , robust Medicare - like public option and to oppose the so - called Schumer compromise ?
Here 's the link which has their office phone numbers , so just scroll down the list and call their offices .
And do n't forget to call Senator Kennedy 's office at ( 202 ) 224-4543 and ask him to fight with us for a strong , robust Medicare - like public option in health care reform .
I get tired sometimes when I think about the odds facing us in passing a strong , robust Medicare - like public option , but I know I 'll feel even worse if I do n't try to stand and FIGHT for the BEST public option possible .
We have until June for the public option in health care reform .
That 's when the initial legislation gets dropped .
That 's when the huge mother - of - all - battles begin between us , the lobbyists , and Congress .
We 'll have to fight the Blue Dogs , the New Democrats , Republicans , and the lobbying ads .
I 'm going to fight every day for the best public option possible , and I ask you to please recommend this diary so that more people can help join in the fight by using these numbers of Senators that I 've provided above .
As I 've said before above , the public option is the line in the sand for me .
Is it the line in the sand for you as well ?

Security camera photo of Burgess from previous break - in
The burglar killed in a gunfight that also claimed a sheriff ’s deputy last week has been identified as the prime suspect in the killing of a young couple in Canada 27 years ago .
However his death leaves unresolved a possible link to the 2004 murder of another young couple , this time in California , leaving the father of one of the victims still waiting for justice .
New Mexico State Police said the Jemez Mountain burglar known for years only as the Cookie Bandit was Joseph Henry Burgess .
He ’d been wanted since Canadian investigators tied him to the 1972 murders of a young couple camping near Tofino on the west coast of Vancouver Island .
“ We were quite surprised , ” New Mexico State Police Lt. Eric Garcia said .
“ No one knew . ”
Burgess , 62 , died early Thursday morning in a shootout with Sgt. Joseph Harris and Deputy Teresa Moriarty in a cabin in La Cueva .
Harris was fatally wounded in the femoral artery during the skirmish while Moriarty was not injured .
The two Sandoval County Sheriff ’s Department officers had staked out the cabin hoping to capture the mysterious burglar known for breaking into local cabins to get food , clothing and occasionally liquor .
Burgess was identified through his fingerprints .
They were in a national database from the 1972 murder case .
Investigators said they found his prints on the Leif Carlsson and Ann Durrant ’s belongings .
Burgess has been described as religious fanatic who often ended his phrases in , “ Amen . ” Canadian investigators suspected he may have become outraged because Carlsson and Durrant were sharing a tent but were n’t married .
His name also surfaced in the similar killings of a young couple camped out on a northern California beach in 2004 …
Until now many who knew of Burgess thought he was hiding out in Canada or the Pacific Northwest .
Joe Harris never thought of this creep as a cutesy Cookie thief .
He always suspected the crook they were tracking , the thief they lay in wait for – was dangerous .
He was correct .
I tire of amateurs who always think every Mountain Man is a romantic , heroic figure .
They are as likely to be disturbed and dangerous as any other misfit .
I can say that with a smile after all my years of railing against conformity .
The question does n’t have to do with non-conformity , it ’s what you refuse to conform to that matters .
In this case , it was a fanatic whose religious belief said it was OK to kill people having non-marital sex .

HOW many times have you seen the Dems smugly congratulating themselves about being intellectually superior to all those primitive , knuckle - dragging Republicans ?
After all ( the Dems tell each other ) those awful Republicans are a bunch of creationists , and — gasp ! — they even deny global warming !
How dumb can they get ?
( They say this , while cheering Obama ’s economic policies . )
That ’s their position .
But if you bear with us , you ’ll see that that when you dig down a bit , there ’s not much consistency to it .
Before we ’re done with this post we ’ll explain why — at least in our opinion — there ’s no rational relationship between evolution and global - warming ( GW ) .
Evolution is good science , and GW may be good science also , but … well , as we said , stay with us here .
There are people who deny both evolution and GW .
You ’ll find them in both parties , probably — alas ! — more among Republicans ; but those two positions are politically in conflict .
The mentality that denies both evolution and GW , as if doing so were some kind of clever intellectual package , is so messed up — both scientifically and politically — as to be beyond hope .
We ’ve been waiting for some pro-evolution commentator to clear the situation up , but it never seems to happen .
So your Curmudgeon will step in to fill the void .
Our readers already know that evolution is good science , and we ’ve never hesitated to express our opinions about creationism ( see : Ignorant , Stupid , Insane , or Wicked ) .
But we may seem to be superficially on the “ wrong ” side of the GW issue .
We freely admit that we lack sufficient knowledge of climatology , so we ’re almost always silent about our GW opinions .
Our scientifically un-informed attitude is to be exceedingly skeptical of GW .
This is n’t because of our scientific knowledge , but because of the political company that GW keeps .
That ’s not scientific and we know it , which is why we stay out of the debate .
We summarized our position on GW once before , here , but we ’ll repeat it to have it all in this one post :
If you want to skip the next few indented paragraphs , that ’s okay .
For at least a century there has always been a political faction in the US that seeks to increase governmental control of the economy , to the detriment of property rights and ultimately to the detriment of individual freedom .
The justification for such movements varies with the times , like the width of neckties .
In rough historical sequence the justification for government growth ( aside from war ) has morphed from the Marxist forces of history to workers ’ rights , the necessities of the Great Depression , worker safety , product safety , consumer protection , environmental pollution , the War on Poverty , racial equality , women ’s rights , unemployment , for the children ( that ’s obscure , but it had its day ) , social justice , income disparity , et cetera , ad nauseam , ad infinitum .
No matter what the justification , or the “ crisis ” of the day , the solution is always the same — more taxes , more regulations , more controls , and less freedom .
With each passing phase in this long process , the adherents to the justification of the day have been fanatically convinced of the righteousness of their cause , unaware that they were mindless pawns in a much larger game .
We may have it wrong this time .
Perhaps the world really is gradually warming , and maybe we really are to blame .
But in the absence of a solid understanding of the science , we see the global climate “ crisis ” in the historical context of a long series of dubious justifications for increasing government power at the expense of individual rights .
We ca n’t help but notice how the same old activists who previously took up the cause of earlier “ crises ” seem to fit so comfortably into ranks of global warming alarmists and “ save the planet ” activists .
Anyway , if there really is a problem , we do n’t like the proffered solutions .
We ’ve seen them many times before , and they ’ve never yet solved any problems .
Free markets will deal with the situation far better than governmental bureaucracies .
That ’s our view of things .
But we freely acknowledge that it ’s not a scientific opinion .
Addendum :
We said much of this in the “ comments ” section , but we like it well enough to tweak it a bit and add it here :
There ’s an analogy ( a weak one ) between today ’s global warming gang and the former nuclear disarmament gang — and also the former nuclear winter gang .
Both of those older movements had some science going for them .
They were hot stuff during the Cold War .
Yes , bombs are bad , yes , radiation sickness is nasty stuff , yes , we would n’t want to be nearby when a bomb exploded , and yes , a lot of bombs might cause a new ice age , however … we ca n’t disarm in a dangerous world .
Interesting science , but the science was being used to generate fear , which was then exploited for a partisan political purpose .
As we said , this kind of argument is an ongoing technique .
So we favor evolution because it ’s good science ; and we ’re dubious of GW because we do n’t trust Al Gore and his friends .
And yet we think we ’re being consistent .
Stay with us a bit longer and all will be clarified .
Well , here ’s a hint :
Teaching evolution does n’t interfere with anyone ’s freedom — no more than does teaching astronomy — but the GW advocates have a political agenda .
It ’s true , of course , that the creationists are indeed anti-science , and they too have a political agenda .
They have an array of views about private behavior that they want to impose on others ( see : Creationism and In - Your - Underwear Politics ) , and this is a great embarrassment to traditional Republicans .
We ’ve addressed this before , here : Open Letter to the Republican Party .
But the Dems are also anti-science .
There ’s no way to deny their anti-scientific objections to nuclear power , oil - drilling , or anything else that conflicts with their environmentalism .
And they ’re always asking why we spend money on the space program and weapons research — or national defense in general .
After all , they argue , who needs science , engineering , or a strong military , when that money could be better spent on food stamps ?
So neither party has a clear , pro-science attitude , and they ’re both politically confused .
How then , do we make sense out of this mess ?
It ’s simple .
The key issue that cuts through everything is freedom .
An advocate of freedom should oppose both the theocracy of the creationists and the socialism of the GW gang .
We ’ll keep an open mind on the science of GW — it may be real .
But even if there is an actual climate problem , we ’re not open - minded about the proposed governmental “ solution . ”
If free enterprise ca n’t solve the situation , then it ca n’t be solved — and we ’re toast .
So be it .
That ’s our position , which — although politically consistent — pretty much leaves us on our own .
That ’s okay .
We ’re do n’t mind .

SAO PAULO -- Former boxing champion Arturo Gatti , one of the most exciting fighters of his generation , was found dead in a hotel room in the posh seaside resort of Porto de Galihnas early Saturday .
Police investigator Edilson Alves told The Associated Press that the body of the former junior welterweight champ was discovered in his hotel room at the tourist resort , where Gatti had arrived on Friday with his Brazilian wife Amanda and 1 - year - old son .
Alves said police were investigating and it was unclear how the 37 - year - old Canadian died .
Foul play is suspected in the death , the CBC reported .
Arturo Gatti celebrates his win over Thomas Damgaard in 2006 .

" It is still too early to say anything concrete , although it is all very strange , " Alves said .
A spokeswoman for the state public safety department said Gatti's wife and son were unhurt .
The women declined to give a name in keeping with department policy .
" There were no bullet or stab wounds on his body , but police did find blood stains on the floor , " she said .
Brazilian boxer and four - time world champion Acelino " Popo " Freitas told the G1 Web site of Brazil 's largest television network Globo that he was a close friend of Gatti and his wife , and that he " knew they were having some sort of problem and were about to separate , but I did n't know they were in Brazil . "
Francisco Assis , a local police investigator , told G1 that Gatti could have died up to eight hours before his body was found early Saturday .
Gatti ( 40 - 9 , 31 KOs ) , nicknamed " Thunder " , was best known for his all - action style , which was epitomized in his classic trilogy with Micky Ward in 2002 and 2003 .
It 's why Gatti was a fixture at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City , N.J. , where he drew huge crowds and fought many times , including the final nine fights of his career .
" His entire boxing career he fought with us , we 've known him since he was 17 , " Kathy Duva of promoter Main Events told The Associated Press .
" It 's just an unspeakable tragedy .
I can't even find words .
It 's a horror . "
He won two world titles in his 16 - year pro career .
In 1995 , he won his first one , outpointing Tracy Harris Patterson to claim the IBF junior lightweight title .
In his first fight after the Ward trilogy -- which Gatti won 2 - 1 -- he captured a world title in his second division , outpointing Gianluca Branco for the vacant WBC junior welterweight title in January 2004 .
Gatti made two defenses before losing the title to Floyd Mayweather Jr. via sixth - round TKO in June 2005 .
He returned to defeat Thomas Damgaard but lost his final two bouts , a ninth - round TKO in a challenge to then - welterweight champion Carlos Baldomir in July 2006 followed by a one - sided beating from former " Contender " star Alfonso Gomez in July 2007 .
In the dressing room following the seventh - round knockout loss to Gomez , Gatti announced his retirement .
Referee Randy Neumann said it was tough for him to end that fight , simply because of Gatti 's incredible ability to come back in fights .
" I could n't stop that fight , simply because he was Arturo Gatti , " Neumann said .
" He was much more dignified to go out that way .
He had to be counted out .
When he fought , you never knew if he could come back .
He looked beaten and still came back . "
With that loss , Gatti acknowledged the end of all his travails and triumphs .
" I remember walking away from his last fight , and somebody walked up to him in the casino late at night and congratulated him , " Duva said .
" And he said , ' Why did he congratulate me ? '
And I said , ' He was excited to meet you . '
And he kind of looked very surprised by that .
" He had no idea what an icon he was or how much he meant to people . "
More than his titles , Gatti will be remembered for the slugfests .
He was half of the Ring magazine fight of the year four times for two the Ward fights as well as his 1997 fifth - round knockout of Gabriel Ruelas to retain the junior lightweight title and a 1998 decision loss to Ivan Robinson .
Gatti had two memorable battles with Robinson as well as dramatic fights with Wilson Rodriguez , Angel Manfredy and Calvin Grove -- all before the trilogy with Ward that defined his career .
Gatti was a staple of HBO 's boxing broadcasts , appearing on the network 21 times .
" HBO Sports is tremendously saddened by the passing of Arturo Gatti , " HBO Sports president Ross Greenburg said .
" He was one of the legendary warriors in boxing , and his three epic battles with Micky Ward will live on in the sport 's rich history .
All of us at HBO Sports will miss his warm and friendly presence , and our deepest sympathy goes out to his manager Pat Lynch , promoter Main Events , led by Kathy Duva , and the entire Arturo Gatti family .
Boxing has lost a great and humble man . "
Gatti had been working in real estate in Montreal following his retirement , but still attended fights , as he did in April for the Timothy Bradley - Kendall Holt junior welterweight unification bout at the Bell Centre in Montreal .

OVER the past two years , as much as 20 m hectares of farmland — an area as big as France 's sprawling farmland and worth $ 20 billion - 30 billion — has been quietly handed over to capital - exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and China .
They buy or lease millions of acres , grow staple crops or biofuels on it , and ship them home .
The countries doing the selling are some of the world 's poorest and least stable ones : Sudan , Ethiopia , Congo , Pakistan .
Usually , when foreigners show up in these places , it is with aid , pity and lectures ( or , in one instance , arrest warrants for war crimes ) .
It must make a nice change to find their farms , so often sources of failure and famine , objects of commercial interest instead .
Yet while governments celebrate these investments , the rest of the world might reasonably ask why , if the deals are so good , one of the biggest of them helped cause the overthrow of the government that signed it — the one in Madagascar .
Will this new scramble for Africa and Asia really reduce malnutrition , as its supporters say ?
Or are critics right that these are “ land grabs ” , “ neocolonialist ” rip - offs , different from 19th - century colonialism only because they involve different land - grabbers and enrich different local elites ( see article ) ?
Protectionism or efficiency ?
It would be graceless to write off in advance foreign investment in some of the most miserable places on earth .
The potential benefits of new seeds , drip - feed irrigation and farm credit are vast .
Most other things seem to have failed African agriculture — domestic investment , foreign aid , international loans — so it is worth trying something new .
Bear in mind , too , that worldwide economic efficiency will rise if ( as is happening ) Saudi Arabia abandons mind - bogglingly expensive wheat farms in the desert and buys up land in east Africa .
Yet these advantages cannot quell a nagging unease .
For a start , most deals are shrouded in mystery — rarely a good sign , especially in countries riddled with corruption .
One politician in Cambodia complains that a contract to lease thousands of acres of rice contains fewer details than you would find in a house - rental agreement .
Secrecy makes it impossible to know whether farms are really getting more efficient or whether the deals are done mainly to line politicians ' pockets .
Next , most of these deals are government - to - government .
This raises awkward questions .
Foreign investment helps countries not only by applying new technology but also by reorganising the way people work and by keeping an eye on costs .
Few governments do this well , corrupt ones least of all .
One of the biggest problems of large - scale commercial farming in poor countries is that well - connected farmers find it more profitable to seek special favours than to farm .
These deals may exacerbate that problem .
Worse , the impetus for many of them has not been profit - seeking by those who want to turn around failing farms .
Rather , it has been alarm at rising food prices and export bans .
Protectionism , not efficiency , has been the driving force .
It would be better to liberalise food markets and boost trade than encourage further land grabs .
Third , there are serious doubts about whether countries acquiring land are paying the true cost of it .
Host governments usually claim the farmland they offer is vacant , state - owned property .
That is often untrue .
It may well support smallholders who have farmed it for generations .
They have no title , only customary rights .
Deals that push them off their land or override customary rights cannot be justified .
International bodies , such as the African Union , are drawing up codes of conduct to limit such abuses .
They are sorely needed .
Even then , land deals will never help the poor as much as freer trade and stronger property rights .
But if the deals eventually raised yields , spread technology and created jobs , that would at least be some cause for celebration .
At the moment too many seem designed to benefit local elites more than local farmers ; they use foreign labour and export most of their production , harming local food markets .
Until they show otherwise , a dose of scepticism should be mixed with the premature hopes the land deals have engendered .

Brett Favre 's determination to play quarterback this season for the Minnesota Vikings prompted him to undergo arthroscopic surgery to repair his injured passing shoulder recently , according to two sources .
However , Favre remains unable to make a commitment because subsequent throwing sessions indicate the shoulder is not yet 100 percent .
While Favre has now clearly demonstrated his interest in coming out of
retirement for a 19th season in the NFL , it seems equally obvious that he will not
do so unless convinced he has recovered fully from the torn biceps tendon
that undermined him last year with the New York Jets .
Favre began considering options to repair the shoulder last month when he sought
advice from acclaimed orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews .
Favre and Andrews
discussed surgical and non-surgical options .
When cortisone injections and
exercise therapies that included weight lifting failed to release the damaged
tendon naturally , Favre consented to the arthroscopic surgery .
Favre has thrown on a limited basis since the surgery , which occurred last month , but has not felt close to " 100 percent " and would not come back unless he makes significant progress , sources said .
Favre 's agent , Bus Cook , would not confirm or deny the surgery , saying " That 's a confidential client privilege . "

What dog owner has not come home to a broken vase or other valuable items and a guilty - looking dog slouching around the house ?
By ingeniously setting up conditions where the owner was misinformed as to whether their dog had really committed an offense , Alexandra Horowitz , Assistant Professor from Barnard College in New York , uncovered the origins of the “ guilty look ” in dogs in the recently published “ Canine Behaviour and Cognition ” Special Issue of Elsevier ’s Behavioural Processes .
Horowitz was able to show that the human tendency to attribute a “ guilty look ” to a dog was not due to whether the dog was indeed guilty .
Instead , people see ‘ guilt ’ in a dog ’s body language when they believe the dog has done something it should n’t have - even if the dog is in fact completely innocent of any offense .
During the study , owners were asked to leave the room after ordering their dogs not to eat a tasty treat .
While the owner was away , Horowitz gave some of the dogs this forbidden treat before asking the owners back into the room .
In some trials the owners were told that their dog had eaten the forbidden treat ; in others , they were told their dog had behaved properly and left the treat alone .
What the owners were told , however , often did not correlate with reality .
Whether the dogs ' demeanor included elements of the " guilty look " had little to do with whether the dogs had actually eaten the forbidden treat or not .
Dogs looked most “ guilty ” if they were admonished by their owners for eating the treat .
In fact , dogs that had been obedient and had not eaten the treat , but were scolded by their ( misinformed ) owners , looked more “ guilty ” than those that had , in fact , eaten the treat .
Thus the dog ’s guilty look is a response to the owner ’s behavior , and not necessarily indicative of any appreciation of its own misdeeds .
This study sheds new light on the natural human tendency to interpret animal behavior in human terms .
Anthropomorphisms compare animal behavior to human behavior , and if there is some superficial similarity , then the animal behavior will be interpreted in the same terms as superficially similar human actions .
This can include the attribution of higher - order emotions such as guilt or remorse to the animal .
The editor of the special issue , Clive D.L. Wynne of the Department of Psychology , University of Florida , explained , “ this is a remarkably powerful demonstration of the need for careful experimental designs if we are to understand the human - dog relationship and not just reify our natural prejudices about animal behavior . ”
He pointed out that dogs are the oldest domesticated species and have a uniquely intimate role in the lives of millions of people .
Recent research on dogs has indicated more human - like forms of reasoning about what people know than has been demonstrated even in chimpanzees .

Brazil 's government says it wants to protect the rainforest Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has approved a controversial bill allowing Amazon farmers to acquire an area of public land larger than France .
But the president vetoed some of the most contentious clauses that would have enabled absentee landlords and companies to benefit from the measure .
Smaller parcels of public land will be handed over for free , and larger ones at reduced or market rates .
Critics say it will amount to an amnesty for illegal land - grabbers .
The law is intended to end the chaotic state of land occupation in the Amazon .
Hundreds of thousands of farmers have no legal title over their land , with claims often dating back decades .
President Lula vetoed changes to the bill made during its passage through congress , which he claims would have altered the original aim to benefit smaller farmers .
But he has left in a clause that allows larger properties to be sold on within three years , instead of requiring the new owner to hold on to the land for at least a decade .
Environmental groups fear that could lead to a heating up of land speculation in the Amazon and encourage occupation of new forest areas .
Among the critics of the measure have been federal prosecutors in the Amazon , who claim it is unconstitutional because it enables land to be given to people who have acquired it illegally , and because it could infringe the rights of traditional and indigenous communities .

HIV / AIDS is a worldwide pandemic disease , but I would wager that few people ( even among our esteemed readers ) really understand it at all .
You may be aware that Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( or AIDS ) is a disease that results from an HIV infection .
To most , HIV / AIDS is a frightening scourge that notably affected the gay community in the 1980 ’s and then spread to most other population groups in America .
Now the largest concerns lie in Africa , where the virus runs rampant .
Having recently taken a number of courses about HIV , I thought I would share some information .
As a biologist , my primary area of knowledge centers around the virus itself and how it infects the body .
It would be difficult to cover both the biology and the socio-political implications of HIV in one article , so I will stick to the former , but keep in mind that the science will aid you should you wish to learn about the latter as well .
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( or HIV ) is a staggeringly simple virus , containing only 9 genes and a relatively small number of viral components .
What makes HIV so formidable is its ability to make the most of each protein and systematically invade your body ’s cells .
Leaving genetics out of it for the moment , the most useful things to know about the HIV particle ( called a “ particle ” because it is a virus and therefore not a “ cell ” ) are its targets and its structure .
Targets of HIV
HIV tends to go after helper T cells ( CD4 + is another name ) .
While HIV infects other cells , such as the big macrophages that digest foreign material in the body , most research focuses on helper T cells because the progression of the disease is believed to be most heavily linked with these types of cells .
It is difficult to explain the roll of the helper T cell without delving into immunology , but essentially the body has many different tools with which to fight the disease and helper T’s crucially regulate these tools .
Not only do these cells activate or suppress the immune response as needed , but they also influence which parts are right for each job .
After HIV has taken over and destroyed almost all of the body ’s helper T’s , it is very hard for the body to mount an immune response to even seemingly harmless diseases like the common cold .
This state or syndrome is called AIDS .
Preventing the final stage of AIDS ( and hopefully even the initial infection ) is a major research target .
Structure of HIV
Working our way in , the exterior of the virus consists of a lipid membrane , similar to that of a human cell ’s membrane .
The reason for this is that HIV steals the membrane of its host as it leaves old , infected cells .
But we ’re getting ahead of ourselves … just remember that this stolen membrane is called the “ viral envelope . ”
Around the outside of the envelope are proteins called Env proteins ( gp120 and gp41 ) .
These are some of the most important viral proteins because they allow docking with human cells .
As the video below points out , interrupting the fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane ( with drugs called “ fusion inhibitors ” ) is a very active area of research .
Within the viral envelope lies the core of the virus , the capsid .
After the virus enters the cell , the outer layer becomes absorbed into the cell membrane and only the capsid remains .
For this reason , everything of import for re-creating the virus lies within the capsid .
These components consist of two single strands of RNA , reverse transcriptase , integrase , and protease .
Do n’t get too hung up on the big words .
Watch the following video ( * wheels in TV cart * ) and check back in with me afterward :
There was a lot going on in that video , to be sure , but here are the key points :
Once inside the cell , the HIV RNA ( a molecule similar to DNA that can carry genetic information ) is converted into double stranded DNA by reverse transcriptase .
This new DNA strand is very similar to the DNA found in human genomes .
The viral DNA is carried into the cell nucleus by integrase and added to the genome of the cell .
When done en masse , the viral genes can be considered part of the body ’s overall genome .
Once this occurs it ’s very difficult to remove it or stop viral products from being produced .
Lastly , the cell translates the viral genes into viral proteins which are created by the cell ’s own machinery outside the nucleus .
The proteins are briefly modified by protease and begin to assemble themselves into new viral particles , eventually bursting from the cell .
After learning all about HIV , you may be thinking , as I once did , that HIV will never be cured .
It uses the body in such a cunning way ( destroying the defenses that might be used to stop it ) that scientists must truly think outside the box .
Fortunately , I know first - hand that there are a great number of people working tirelessly to treat and cure the infection and the disease .
Speaking of treatments and cures , let ’s briefly discuss the differences between the two .
Treatments vs. Cures
While all research grows knowledge , when it comes to HIV research there are generally two paths for a project to take .
Treatments are conceptually easier to understand because ( as the video points out ) any active step in the HIV replication process is a potential drug target .
If a drug was 100 % effective , the disease would stop in its tracks , but any damage might be lasting and the virus would probably persist in the genome of the patient .
Thus far , most research that has moved into clinical trials has been treatment research .
Thanks to this branch of experimentation , many HIV patients have been able to control their disease and prevent its devastating effects .
Drug treatments are a double - edged sword , though , as the side effects are often harsh on the patient .
If you recall my previous article , The Cure for Cancer , I described cancer as a phenomenon that will not be solved with a magic bullet .
HIV on the other hand , while by no means an easy target , might be susceptible to such an approach .
The virus has the ability to mutate and evade the body ’s defenses , but there are certain core facts about the virus that will not likely change .
Attacking cells that have been infected but ignoring all others , for instance , might be an approach for clearing one ’s genome of the viral DNA .
The trick is , how might this be accomplished ?
Also , a vaccine preventing initial viral infection would be wonderful , but the nature of the virus makes a vaccine unlikely .
Engineering either a vaccine or a cure will undoubtedly be the most challenging part of this research .
One Word of Warning …
Hopefully some who read this article will not feel satisfied with the simple overview given above and seek out more knowledge .
During your intellectual journey you may discover people who claim any or all of the following :
HIV does not exist .
HIV may or may not exist , but it does not cause AIDS .
AIDS is a gay disease ( yes , there are still some who believe this )
AIDS medication only hurts patients and does absolutely no good ( the suggested alternatives are decidedly more new - age )
These statements are generally circulated by “ HIV Deniers : ” people who for some reason or another believe scientists are either stupid , wrong , or part of a plot with the government .
You can make up your own mind , of course , but if this stuff is true , what keeps my friends in virology so busy then ?
Does the above information affect your understanding of HIV ?

Buzz of the Week
How the Open Government Dialogue got slimed
Let ’s cut to the chase :
The — theadministration ’s much - ballyhooed initiative to engage with the public in an online forum — got slimed .
The brainstorming forum , managed by the National Academy of Public Administration , was designed to allow the public to provide input on how to make government operations and information more transparent .
Participants were invited to submit ideas and rate other people ’s ideas with a thumbs up or thumbs down .
The system would tally the votes and assign a score to each suggestion .
This mechanism would make it possible for the public at large to identify the most important issues and police the site for off - point or abusive content .
That was the theory anyway , and it worked for nearly a week , but then WorldNet Daily ’s editors got wind of it .
The folks at WorldNet Daily , an online political publication , have been trying to drum up national interest in a topic that the mainstream media generally ignores :
Was the president born in the Unites States , and does he have the birth certificate to prove it ?
The Open Government Dialogue provided WorldNet Daily ’s editors with a perfect forum , one that was highly visible and only lightly moderated .
Go get 'em , they told their readers .
And it worked .
“ Hours after [ WorldNet Daily ] alerted the public to a White House Web site on ‘ open government dialogue , ’ most participants are calling on Barack Obama to release his elusive ‘ long - form ’ birth certificate to establish his constitutional eligibility to serve as president , ” the editors wrote in a May 31 article .
Of course , the Open Government Dialogue was intended to explore the process by which government ensures transparency .
But that is not how WorldNet Daily posed it : “ Obama asks which public records you want to see , ” the first headline read .
No matter .
The article was picked up by various blogs with similar interests , including Morality 101 , Free Republic and The Ron Paul War Room .
The topic also hit Twitter , with numerous tweeters encouraging readers to keep the birth certificate issue alive at the Open Government Dialogue .
“ Looks like Obama 's Open Government Dialogue site is being commandeered by folks like myself who are using Obama 's own website to help make people , who for one reason or another , are unaware of Obama 's missing birth certificate issue aware , ” wrote blogger Chicago Ray , adding “ Here 's your chance to tell the White House directly whether you think the birth certificate issue is important . ”
However , the NAPA team also provided dialogue participants with the ability to flag entries that were off point or that duplicated other entries .
In the final days of brainstorming , site managers began reviewing and , in many cases , removing the long stream of repetitive posts .
The outcry was immediate .
“ Let ’s fight back by inundating the White House ’s phony ' open government dialogue '
Web site with questions about Hussein ’s birth certificate ! ” wrote someone called Eowyn at Giovanni ’s World , using Obama 's middle name and providing readers with the link to the Web site .
The birthers , as they have been dubbed in the blogosphere , proceeded to flood the site with more posts .
“ I 'm sitting here looking at all the people who've had their posts deleted because they are raising a legitimate issue : Where 's The Birth Certificate , ” wrote Scott Lanter .
“ And at the top of the page it reads , ‘ Open Government Dialogue . ’
It 's not dialogue when people are silenced .
What exactly is this site 's definition of ' dialogue ? ' ”
All interactive sites are vulnerable to gaming , writes Micah Sifry at the TechPresident blog .
“ But what the ‘ birthers ’ are doing is the equivalent of spamming up a public bulletin board and reducing its utility for everyone else . ”
NAPA and the Obama administration have moved into the next phase of the Open Government Dialogue , focusing the conversation on a handful of specific issues .
But looking ahead to the prospect of similar endeavors — and the administration has made clear that engagement will be part of its standard operating procedure — it seems fair to question the viability of such forums .
Is it possible to conduct a national online dialogue that is civil and productive ?
Or will any online public discourse inevitably be smothered by slime ?
Tech President ’s Sifry is hopeful .
“ Presumably , the more often government invites public participation and the lower the visibility of the results , the less often these nuisances will occur , ” he wrote .

Editor 's note :
We will not post any comments regarding Obama 's birth certificate .
Nor will we post comments that are abusive .
But we encourage your comments on how the process used to manage the Open Government Dialogue or other aspects of how the government should interact with the public online .
Please note that comments posted after 9 p.m. on Friday will be reviewed for posting on Monday .
In late June , the Air Force awarded Northrop Grumman a $ 280 - million contract to install a range of electronic systems on three Bombardier business jets and two RQ - 4 drones .
Collectively , the installed systems are known as Battlefield Airborne Communications Node , or BACN .
( Yes , that 's pronounced " bacon . " )
It might look and sound hopelessly obscure , but BACN is a big , big deal : a sort of " universal translator " for the vast array of drones , jets and ground forces deployed by the U.S. and its allies .
The explosive growth in communication technology over the last several decades has resulted in military units that , as often as not , ca n't talk to each other .
Add civilians , attached to the military , and you 've got an even more confused comms situation .
If you 're a State Department reconstruction team carrying just cell phones and satellite phones , and you get ambushed in southern Afghanistan , you normally wo n't be able to talk to the Air Force A - 10s flying overhead .
Enter BACN , which " extends communications ranges , bridges between radio frequencies and ' translates ' among incompatible communications systems , " using Internet Protocols , according to Defense Industry Daily .
" That may sound trivial , but on a tactical level , it definitely is n’t , " DID notes .
BACN is also a clue to possible , secret developments in air power .
The prototype BACN Bombardier plane was spotted at Kandahar , in southern Afghanistan , around the same time pictures surfaced , from the same base , of an apparent , top - secret , flying - wing drone that Bill Sweetman dubbed " The Beast of Kandahar . "
Could BACN be helping Beast spot Taliban fighters for NATO ground troops ?
The translator plane might also be the key to turning the F - 22 Raptor stealth fighter – usually a solitary hunter – into a true team player , and even a close - air - support bomber like the A - 10 .
Most fighters and bombers use the Link - 16 datalink to swap targeting data , but Lockheed left Link 16 out of the F - 22 , instead giving the Raptor a special " stealthy " datalink that only connects to other F - 22s .
But in a demonstration last year , the Air Force used BACN to plug an F - 22 into a Link - 16 network .
" The question now is whether the F - 22 bridging demonstration last year has become an operational capability , " writes Steve Trimble .

Its lurid pink cars and women drivers were launched to provide a safe and hassle - free service for women of all ages worried about getting into taxis driven by men .
But the women - only cab company Pink Ladies is being threatened with closure after its founders were taken to court this week by Warrington council in Cheshire and charged with operating an unlicensed private hire company .
The Warrington - based firm , which was launched four years ago , said it could close if the council won its case because if they registered under the taxi licensing system , sex discrimination laws would force its drivers to pick up male customers .
" We will fight this all the way to the high court , " co-founder Andrea Winders said yesterday .
" We are not a taxi service .
We are a unique organisation .
We do not fit within current legislation , therefore Warrington council has decided to issue court proceedings against us personally . "
Winders and her business partner , Tina Dutton , set up the service after their daughters and friends spoke of their unease at being the last one left in a taxi with a male driver after a night out .
" The council 's actions could mean the closure of Pink Ladies and this would put safety of women at risk , particularly at night , " said Winders .
Their private members ' club status means their drivers only pick up women members and can turn down male customers .
Their 14 Renault Kangoo vehicles are , in effect , owned by club members who pay to hire a driver when they use the car club .
The club produces its own magazine and organises days out for its 14,000 members – 15 % of the women in Warrington .
" Women feel safer when they go out after dark , " said Dorothy Davies , a pensioner who regularly uses the service .
" They are a great asset to this town .
They are irreplaceable . "
According to Pink Ladies , all its drivers have enhanced criminal records bureau checks and their cars meet the government 's safety and MoT requirements for private hire vehicles .
" Of our own volition , we are complying with the regulations the council would put on us , " said Winders .
The case against the firm began when council officials posed as customers last November using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act , designed to combat terrorism and serious crime .
Pink Ladies claimed the operation was " an ambush " .
The full trial will be heard at Runcorn magistrates court in July .
James Parry , a solicitor for Pink Ladies , said : " We 've got a good legal case that this is not a private hire company .
It is a great shame that the council is wasting taxpayers ' money in pursuing this matter . "
Bruno better watch his back .
Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen has beefed up his security thanks to a veiled threat from an organization upset about its portrayal in his new flick " Bruno , " the New York Post reported .
The al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades , a militant group of Palestinians located on the West Bank , issued a statement to a Jerusalem reporter saying the group was livid about being featured in the film , which features Baron Cohen as a homosexual Austrian fashionista .
The Martyrs ' Brigades are part of a scene in which Bruno attempts to get himself kidnapped by the group , as he makes reference to " King Osama " while addressing the organization 's leader , Ayman Abu Aita .
" " We reserve the right to respond in the way we find suitable against this man , " the statement said .
" The movie was part of a conspiracy against the al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades . "
" According to what we checked , there was no meeting about the real context of the film , " it said .
" This was a dirty use of our brother , Ayman , and we do n't accept that the al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades is part of the film . "
Baron Cohen took the veiled threat seriously , the Post reported , bumping up security for himself and his family after the statement was issued .
Abu Aita said he is seeking legal action against Baron Cohen and Universal Studios for airing the interview , which he claims was n't cleared with him before being shown on - screen .
The dirt road is frozen .
I hear the geese first in my lungs .
Faint hieroglyphic against the gray sky .
Then , the brutal intervention of sound .
All that we experience is a message , he wrote .
I would like to know what it means if first one bird swims the channel across the classic V , the line flutters , and the formation dissolves .
In the end , the modernists must have meant , it is the human world we are weary of , our arms heavy with love , its ancient failings .
But that was before the world wars , in 1800 , when a young German poet could pick at the truth and collect the fragments in an encyclopedia of knowledge .
There is a V , then an L , each letter forming so slowly that the next appears before it is complete .
The true philosophical act is the slaying of one 's self , Novalis wrote , and died , like Keats , before he was thirty .
They have left me behind like one of their lost , scratching at the gravel in the fields .
Where are they once the sky has enveloped them ?
I stand in the narrow cut of a frozen road leading into mountains , the morning newspaper gripped under my arm .
But to give up on things precludes everything .
I am not -I , Novalis wrote .
I am you .
If , as the gnostics say , the world was a mistake created by an evil demiurge , and I am trapped in my body , abandoned by a god whom I long for as one of my own , why not follow the tundra geese into their storm ?
Why stay while my great sails flap the ice as if my voice were needed to call them back in the spring , as if I were the lost dwelling place for the flocks ?
Enlarge Presidencia , AFP / Getty Images Venezuela President Hugo Chavez has repeatedly accused the U.S. of plotting to overthrow him or to invade Venezuela , without offering proof .
CARACAS , Venezuela ( AP )  President Hugo Chavez on Tuesday alleged that U.S. intelligence agencies were behind a purported assassination plot that prevented him from visiting El Salvador .
Chavez had planned to attend the inauguration of leftist President Mauricio Funes in the Central American nation on Monday , but canceled his trip due to the alleged plot .
" I do n't doubt that the intelligence organizations of the United States are behind this , " Chavez said , accusing them of plotting with Cuban militant Luis Posada Carriles to murder him .
He said Venezuelan intelligence services have " very precise information " that they were planning to launch rockets at the Cubana de Aviacion plane he was going to travel in .
Venezuela has asked the U.S. to extradite Posada , an opponent of former Cuban president Fidel Castro and a former CIA operative accused of plotting the 1976 bombing of a Cuban plane in Venezuela that killed 73 people on board .
The 81 - year - old Posada denies involvement in the bombing .
Chavez has repeatedly accused the U.S. of plotting to overthrow him or to invade Venezuela , without offering proof .
The U.S. State Department has denied such accusations in the past .
Nobody at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas was immediately available to comment Tuesday .

George Lucas is an evil genius .
There is simply no other reasonable explanation for what has just occurred in my formerly contentedly geeky family .
I can barely bring myself to write this ...
Earlier this week , my kids decided that they think Jar Jar Binks is great .
I 'd tried to bring up my kids ( who are eight and six ) the right way , with regard to Star Wars .
I showed them the first movie , which is to say Episode IV , first — followed , of course , by Episodes V and VI .
They loved them , even going as Darth Vader and Princess Leia for Halloween last year , and my wife and I got them some toys , and all was going well .
Then they started watching the " Clone Wars " TV show , which was n't so horrible even if it did have Ahsoka Tano and sometimes Jar Jar .
Whenever there was an episode with Jar Jar , I would try to explain that he 's annoying and idiotic without actually saying so , and dissuade my kids from imitating his style of speech .
But they still had n't seen the prequel trilogy , and I was just fine with that .
They knew the basic stories , having read books based on parts of them and played the LEGO videogame versions of them , but , since we do n't own DVDs of Episodes I - III , they knew that begging to see them would get them nowhere .
I suppose in the long run it was inevitable , though : My kids were over at my parents ' house while my mom watched them , and Episode I happened to be on TV .
And that , sadly , is how the tragic story unfolded :
By the time I came home from work they were not only talking like Jar Jar but also writing phrases as Jar Jar would speak them , and talking animatedly with each other about how funny Jar Jar was .
My kids are pretty smart — I do n't like to brag , it 's just the truth .
And up to now they 've had pretty good geek sense :
We 've read , as a family , The Hobbit and the Narnia books , and we 're more than halfway through the Harry Potter books , and they 've loved them all .
They would probably watch Phineas and Ferb all day if we'd let them .
So why , then , are they so drawn to a character that causes near - universal revulsion in those past puberty ?
Yes , exactly : Because George Lucas cleverly designed Jar Jar Binks so that kids would love him but adults would hate him .
Why would he do that ?
Because it 's part of an evil scheme to take over the world , of course .
Yes , Lucas is an evil genius .
Maybe he really can't write dialog better than a marginally talented twelve - year - old could , or maybe it 's just a ruse .
Maybe he deliberately picked really bad actors to play Anakin Skywalker as a boy and young man .
Maybe the plot is already complete and we just do n't realize it because he 's just that devious .
Or maybe the final stage of the plan has yet to be sprung .
I know it sounds like a strange idea , but it 's the only reasonable explanation for my kids latching on to Jar Jar , right ?
It would fit right into a Pinky and the Brain episode , so it must be true !
( Thanks to fellow GeekDad Chuck Lawton for the tweet that helped me with the idea for this post . )
How effective are charity trustees ?
We may be about to find out
Many charities are not effectively governed , says a typically provocative and timely new report from New Philanthropy Capital ( NPC ) .
Should we be worried ?
Being badly governed is not the same as being badly managed .
Charities , after all , can carry weak boards of trustees and still thrive , so long as there 's a fair wind and directors keep their eye on the ball .
" In practice , " says the report , " many large charities are run exclusively by their management . "
It 's when the fair wind turns foul that the problems start , points out NPC .
The banking crisis has shown it is only when catastrophe overtakes us that weakness and failures in corporate oversight reveal themselves .
So , as the effects of the recession start to cause more havoc in the charity sector , will its trustee standards prove to have been similarly lax ?
Interestingly , trustees themselves seem to think they are doing a good job , at least according to one survey cited by NPC .
That 's not a view universally shared .
A separate survey , of charity chief executives , revealed much less confidence in the robustness of boards .
And when NPC raised the issue with charity funders , they were left in no doubt that trusteeship generally was not up to scratch .
It quotes one funder saying : " If we insisted on good standards of governance , then we would n't give many grants . "
Few seem to hold boards to account , the report suggests , not even the funders who invest in the charity .
It explains : " Boards in the private sector answer directly to their shareholders .
But it is not clear to whom charitable boards are accountable .
Beneficiaries , funders and regulators all have some part to play in this but none of these groups currently exert enough pressure on boards to improve . "
Charities – particularly the bigger ones – need to " get more serious " about evaluating their own performance , says NPC , and that should include board performance .
It cites a recent charity fiasco , Age Concern 's ambitious but ultimately disastrous membership scheme , Heyday , which bombed after burning through £ 22 m in four years .
The Charity Commission 's report into the affair , NPC points out , was scathing of Age Concern 's governance shortcomings , noting that the trustees did not " exercise sufficent oversight and critical challenge [ and ] fell short of the standards we would have expected of trustees of a large national charity " .
Many charities are seeing their business models come under huge strain as the government funding tap gets tighter , income from corporates and legacies shrinks , and black holes start to open up in their staff pension funds .
Strong governance , oversight and accountability is needed .
As NPC puts it : " If the board has been sleeping while on watch , something that begins as a short - term crisis can quickly prove disastrous . "
Egyptian caterer busies himself collecting body parts from young maidens in order to bring Ishtar , an ancient goddess of good and evil back to life .
When he has prepared enough parts for the ceremony , he hypnotizes a woman giving an engagement party for her daughter , at which he plans to perform the ancient rites of summons , using the daughter as his final sacrifice .

Help support Density Church 's bid to end all homosexuality in sheep .
This is a plague of epidemic proportions .
Buy a T - Shirt or Bumper Sticker now , and let others know that " Sheep are Sheep " ( not Gay ) .
Thousands of Density Church members , clad in black t- shirts , marched on Parliament on Friday to voice their opposition to the " growing numbers of homosexual sheep in New Zealand " .
The march was organised after a recent scientific study found that 8 % of sheep were homosexual .
The study , which discovered a link between homosexual orientation and the volume of oSDN cells in sheep , has outraged members of Density Church , who consider it to be evidence of moral decline amongst sheep communities .
The protestors were joined in their march by a number of sheep " of heterosexual orientation " .
Pastor Brian Tamariki of Density Church addressed the anti-gay sheep protestors at the steps of Parliament , and was met with rapturous applause by his congregation .
" It 's just not natural , " Tamariki claimed in his address .
" My grandfather was a farmer in the King Country in the 1950s , and he says there certainly were n't any gay sheep in his day .
He told me himself that there was none of that sort of carry on amongst his flocks .
So you have to ask why 8 % of sheep have suddenly gone gay today . "
" To my mind , there is only one reason for this , " continued Tamariki .
" Sheep are not being as strongly disciplined as in the past .
Through lax standards , too many sheep are being given the run of the land , and have fallen into moral degeneracy . "
" New Zealand was once famous for its sheep population .
But how can Kiwis be proud of nancy - boy rams which would rather commit perverse abnormalities with other rams , than tup a lovely fluffy ewe ?
For these reasons , we call for Parliament to legislate tougher standards for sheep management , so that this moral degeneracy may be eliminated . "
The Density crowd were confident that tougher sheep legislation could put an end to this outbreak of ovine homosexuality .
" Yeah , sheep should n't be gay .
Sheep are sheep , " commented one of the marchers , Wiremu Johnson ( aged 6 ) .
Onlooker Rob Goddard said he had some sympathy for the stance .
" I used to run a sheep farm in the McKenzie country , and it was a real bugger when one of my rams turned out to be gay .
I 'd pay out good money for the ram to service my ewes , and - blow me down - it would turn out to be a bloody chocolate speedway racer .
I 've got no idea if this 8 % figure is right , but a good proportion of them turned out that way - about 1 in 12 , I reckon .
So anything Parliament can do to decrease the number of gay sheep would be a big help to farmers . "
Prime Minister Helen Clark came down to meet one of the gay sheep brought along by Density Church , and spent some time with the animal in front of photographers , but refused to enter into discussions with the Density Church protestors themselves .
MP David Benson - Pope was more outspoken , dismissing Density Church 's stance as " out of touch in today 's world " .
" Instead of discriminating against sheep who have a homosexual orientation , I urge New Zealanders to show an acceptance of the diversity that Nature has provided us .
And I am sure that the vast majority of New Zealanders will get right behind gay sheep , just as they have always got behind sheep throughout the history of our nation . "
Despite a small counter - protest from members of the Gay Animal Rights Group of the SPCA , Density Church members were undeterred .
With clenched fists raised high , the Density Church protestors chanted their slogan " Sheep are sheep - not gay " and sang songs of praise to Jesus , throughout the afternoon .
" You know , Jesus was the Good Shepherd , and he sure would n't have let any of his flock go gay , " commented Brian Tamariki .
" So if Jesus could have had 100 % straight sheep , then so should we .
Let 's bring this country back to normality .
Let 's return to the way things were back in the 1950s , when nobody spoke of homosexual sheep , because there were none !
Let 's remember : sheep are sheep ! ! "

In yesterday ’s post about the actuarial necessity of Pre-Existing Conditions exclusions , someone left a comment here accusing me of not knowing what “ adverse selection ” is1 , and that maybe Politicians do know .
So it was fortunate for me , that my friend Zach e-mailed me this article from this morning ’s NYT , which gives me the opportunity to demonstrate yet again that politicians either do n’t know anything about the industries they ’re attempting to regulate , or , if they do , they ’re more than willing to sell us out to the highest bidder .
In fact , I propose that one of the only things politicians are any good at , is colluding with Big Business in order to steal from the rest of us .
The article describes how some of the big players in the Insurance industry have pulled an about - face , and are now prepared to drop their policy of charging higher premiums to those people with existing conditions or poor health histories , otherwise known as actuarially sound risk management :
Insurers said they were willing to discard an element of their longstanding business model — pricing insurance policies , in part , on the basis of a person ’s medical condition or history .
To review : broadly , there are only two types of people who do n’t have insurance :
Those who want it , but ca n’t afford it Those who can afford it , but do n’t want it .
When insurers are able to charge premiums based on risk , and some choose not to , low - risk customers will defect to companies willing to accurately price them , and high - risk customers will for the most part flock to the companies that neglect risk - management in favor of non-discriminatory pricing .
This is a move that guarantees bankruptcy for any company which practices it .
Because of this , no insurer can individually pursue a policy of ignoring very relevant factors , like medical history , existing / pre-existing conditions , etc. , because the non- or the not - as - risky policy holders will defect to another company willing to pool their individual risk with others who are more similar .
Competition and knowledge generally render null any attempt to secure profits by adverse selection .
What insurance companies all would like to do , is insure as many low - risk ( and as few high - risk ) individuals as possible .
But they ca n’t do this , unless they also control prices , and the only way they can come close to controlling price is if everyone , or nearly everyone has to buy policies from them .
So there ’s one very important caveat to Big Insurance ’s “ concession ” .
They want Congress to do some favors for the insurance industry .
They need the strong arm of the government to force these people ( and there are a lot of them ! 1 ) to buy from them .
… In the past , insurers have warned that if they could not consider a person ’s health status in setting premiums , the rates charged to young , healthy people would need to soar .
But they said Tuesday that they were exploring ideas to prevent such sharp increases by spreading the risk and costs broadly across a larger population , including the healthy and the unhealthy
Translation : all your money are belong to us .
In exchange for risk - rated pricing the insurance industry would like Congress to adopt “ A comprehensive plan requiring all Americans to carry insurance . ”
Think about what that means for a moment : Businesses are willing to give up otherwise sound business practices in exchange for Oligopoly / Monpoly market power , and the rents that might be extracted from the people , if they can get their way , which would allow them to “ spread the risk and costs broadly across a larger population ” .
And they probably will , what with “ Universal Coverage ” being politically à la mode .
In their letter to Congress on Tuesday , Ms. Ignagni ( of America ’s Health Insurance Plans ) and Mr. Serota ( of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association ) said that if Congress enacted an enforceable requirement for everyone to carry health insurance , “ we could guarantee issue of coverage with no pre-existing condition exclusions and phase out the practice of varying premiums based on health status in the individual market . ”
Risk should n’t be “ spread across the whole population , ” especially when it ’s distinctly identifiable and largely controllable .
Otherwise , it destroys any incentive for people to be responsible for their own actions ( encouraging socially undesirable behavior and consequences .
It breeds contempt for others , who have no more regard for their fellow man .
It violates every notion of justice and equity in the name of “ fairness ” and “ progress . ”
And this so - called “ progress ” destroys charity , compassion , and community .
If this becomes law , that choice currently exercised by 28 million people will become a punishable offense .
Most of them will “ consent ” and buy whatever minimum policy they can get away with .
Thus , “ universal ” coverage is achieved when those people who do n’t want it ( but can afford it ) are forced to pay premiums in order to support the others who want it ( but do n’t want to pay for it ) .
This is not a free market , it ’s fucking fascism .
And when it fails ( and it will fail ) do n’t you dare make a scapegoat out of the “ free market ” , because I told you so .
Whenever you see the word “ require ” or “ enforce ” especially when it pertains to your health and well - being , you should be very afraid .
+++++
1. Adverse selection can be summarized thusly : when insurers can’t charge premiums based on risk , all insurers seek to only insure those individuals who are the least exposed to potential loss .
In theory , at some point the market disappears , because insurers are only willing to underwrite people who have little to no probabilistic need for coverage .
2 . One popularly cited figure is that “ 46 million ” American ’s do n’t have health insurance .
Except that a quarter of the people counted in that figure are n’t even citizens .
The remaining 36 million are disproportionately young and a majority of them ( 61 % ) earn more than $ 50,000 per year — above the median income .
This proposal would require all 28 million of these folks to buy something that they are already free to purchase , if they ’d like — they just choose not to .
Summer Reading : Banquo ’s Ghosts , by Richard Lowry and Keith Korman , Vanguard Press ( 2009 ) , 352 pages .
You have to feel a little sorry for the two neocons who co-wrote Banquo ’s Ghosts .
The idea seems simple enough : a Tom Clancy - style thriller about a plot to kill an Iranian physicist before he can cook up a nuke for the mullahs .
The problem is , where do you get your hero these days ?
Back in the day , when Clancy was keeping Reagan awake way past 9 pm with Hunt for Red October , it was easy to make US agents like Jack Ryan look good ; after all , they were going up against the dregs of the poor old USSR .
It ’s not anywhere near as easy to convince readers nowadays that our spooks are superhuman , not after Iraq and especially not where Iran is concerned .
The grim fact is that Iran has outplayed us since I was a kid .
I mean that literally .
Some of my earliest and nastiest memories are from the hostage crisis in 1979 , scared blindfolded hostages , then the wreckage of Desert Storm , a greasy mullah holding up the roasted arm of a dead American solder .
From Carter to Bush Junior , it ’s been one embarrassment after another at the hands of those sneaky Persians .
So Lowry and Korman have changed with the times .
Their patriotic agent characters , Banquo and his lieutenant Wallets , are sort of tired and weak in this book , bummed about the way Iraq turned out .
When you meet Banquo , he ’s looking over a lot of high - tech surveillance of Nasrullah , the Hezbollah leader — except Banquo realizes the guy wearing the chemically - dyed turban may be a body double , or a nobody .
Banquo is bummed , realizing all the satellites in the world wo n’t make up for the fact we ’ve got no humint worth mentioning in the Middle East : “ ‘ We ’re losing , ’ Banquo whispered to the walls . ”
Yes , Banquo ’s world , Tom Clancy ’s world , is going to Hades .
The CIA is n’t what it used to be , thanks to all this new touchy - feely crap :
… ’voluntary ’ sexual harassment and racial sensitivity seminars .
…
Delays and overruns had slowed the men ’s bathroom renovations — an installation of two hundred quality Care Bear changing tables ‘ for your convenience . ’
When what — Mr. Mom wet himself ? …
And … at 4:30 pm , the Agency employees lined up in the Langley parking lot , shuffling off to their minivan carpools for their suburban commute home .
Minivans !
Diaper - changing tables !
Car pools !
With friends like that , it stands to reason that poor Banquo ca n’t count on the usual allies to take on the Iranians .
But the biggest blow to Tom Clancy ’s world is pretty clear , as this book admits in a weird , very interesting way .
We ’re in Banquo ’s office , while the depressed old agent thinks about why “ we ’re losing . ”
He settles on a poster :
A couple of years back one of Banquo ’s staff hung a framed replica of Fox Mulder ’s famous alien saucer poster on the wall .
…
Except this poster showed Saddam ’s noble profile superimposed over a mushroom cloud .
The caption stayed the same though , a comment on the Agency ’s egregiously wrong ‘ slam dunk ’ insistence that Iraq had WMD ’s when none could be found :
“ I Want to Believe . ”
So for the good of the firm and reasons of professional grit , the senior and only partner of Banquo and Duncan had left it there .
To hang forever as a warning .
I was amazed to read that bit in a novel by the editor of a neocon outpost like National Review .
It ’s about as close to admitting , “ We messed up , ” as these guys are ever going to come .
And it helps to explain the big plot twist in the novel .
Since the neocons and the CIA are so bummed , depressed , and discredited , you ca n’t just find a Jack Ryan and put him on the bad guys ’ trail .
You need to find a new kind of hero .
And that ’s where these two co-author dudes really outdid themselves .
See , they need someone to kill that pesky Iranian physicist , but their boys are weak , car - pooling losers .
Where ’s the energy , the drive , these days ?
Why , across the aisle , among those damn lefties and peaceniks .
They ’re the ones on the attack .
So Banquo recruits an antiwar Lefty , a Brit reporter named Peter Johnson , who took Saddam ’s money and spends most of his time telling TV audiences that Iran is harmless , and only wants nukes for peaceful energy .
It ’s pretty clear , if you ’re an old CNN fan like me , than this Johnson character is a pretty obvious take on Peter Arnett , the reporter who got fired after the first Iraq war .
Johnson character is a drunk , a slob , an all - around mess , and an America - hater from way back — all the stuff the Pentagon said about Arnett .
But Johnson is only a leftie on the surface .
Inside , he ’s sick of himself , ashamed of having served the forces of evil all his life .
And just in case you were in any doubt that they really are the forces of evil , there ’s a long scene at a snooty Manhattan dinner party where the reader meets Johnson ’s lefty boss , Josephine Parker von Hildebrand .
Josephine is just about the evilest witch - queen since Snow White : “ Josephine had practically every desirable personal characteristic , except wisdom and mercy . ”
Gee , that sounds like she actually is n’t a nice person at all !
Well , this is n’t one of those subtle type novels .
If it had a soundtrack , it ’d be heavy on the Count Dracula organ notes every time Josephine appears .
The scene at her snooty dinner party is maybe the worst in the novel .
Basically , all the cool lefties at the party turn into rabid Jew - hating Nazis after their second glass of wine .
It ’s the old line that anybody who ever criticizes Israel can’t really mean what they say ; they must be secret Nazis just waiting for some pretext to spew up their hate .
Even Johnson , the peacenik , is outraged at what he hears : “ But of all the Jew - haters he despised — more than any neo - Nazi skinhead — were the pointy - headed intellectuals , the sophisticated , sleight - of - hand Jew - haters , the let ’s - adopt - the - Saudi - peace - plan , and gosh - are n’t - these - people - awfully - pushy - and - greedy - for - such - a - little - country ?
Jew - haters . ”
Right .
Meaning , anybody who ever quibbled with any Israeli policy .
Ever .
Well , that settles that .
To show you how evil these non-neocons truly are , they start talking like little Hitlers .
Now , I ca n’t speak from personal experience here — contrary to what you might expect , I do n’t get invited to all that many cool Manhattan parties — but it ’s a little hard to believe that this New York leftist magazine is secretly staffed by a bunch of Hitlerites .

Regulators have been largely supportive of the credit default swap market ’s efforts to move all standard CDS ( a.k.a. “ vanilla ” CDS ) contracts onto a central counterparty ( CCP ) .
Within a relatively short amount of time , the CDS market garnered the support of both the SEC and the Federal Reserve , setup shop , and executed CDS transactions totaling $ 71 billion in notional amount on ICE Trust LLC ( ICE ) , the first of what could be a handful of CCPs .
Given that the CDS market is still serving time on the pillory , this kind regulatory largess seems to imply that a CCP must undoubtedly be a good thing .
However , not everyone is convinced .
In a recent paper , Darrell Duffie and Haoxiang Zhu of Standford University described the state of affairs with and without a CCP in mathematical terms , proposed a measure of efficiency which they use as a proxy for counterparty risk , applied this measure to each state of affairs , and came to conclusions that are surprising , but not counterintuitive once you take a moment to consider the trade - offs between a distributed dealer system and a CCP .
There are two central points in their paper : ( 1 ) the benefits of having a CCP compared to not having a CCP ( the distributed dealer system ) is a function of the number of dealers ( i.e. , the more dealers , the more the system benefits from having a CCP ) and that the current number of CDS dealers might be too small to realize any benefits from a CCP ; and ( 2 ) even if having a single CCP is more efficient than not having one , having more than one CCP is never more efficient than having none at all .
The assumption underlying these two points is that having a CCP as opposed to not having a CCP is in essence a choice between ( i ) multilateral netting across a single asset class and ( ii ) bilateral netting across multiple asset classes .
After a bit of back and forth with Duffie , I agree that this is the case , but only in the short term .
That is , there is nothing about a CCP that precludes netting across asset classes , even if the current model does n’t facilitate it .
I also disagree with the two central conclusions , mostly due to shortcomings of the model that the authors acknowledge in their paper .
Specifically , they acknowledge that their model does n’t deal with so called “ knock - on effects , ” or simply put , how one dealer default can lead to another .
I also disagree with how Duffie and Zhu measure the benefits of netting , but we ’ll spare our brains the heavy lifting and focus on the more practical issues .
In this article , I ’ll focus on explaining why a CCP does not preclude netting across asset classes .
In a follow up article , I ’ll explain how a CCP mitigates counterparty risk by facilitating trade compression .
What Is A Central Counterparty ?
Rather than provide a one line , academic definition , I ’ll proceed gradually , and by way of example .
For starters , a CCP is not an exchange .
Even with a CCP , inter - dealer trades will still be entered into between dealers , and price discovery will still take place across dealers .
That is , dealers will still trade with each other , at least initially .
After two dealers enter into a CDS trade , they will transfer , or “ novate ” their positions to the CCP .
For example , in the prototypical CCP transaction , if Dealer A sells protection to Dealer B , each dealer would then novate its position to the CCP .
After the novation , the state of affairs is such that A sells protection to the CCP and the CCP sells protection to B .
When payments are made on the CDS , they get made to the CCP and then passed on to the parties .
At first blush , it might seem like all we ’ve done is throw an extraneous and useless 3rd party into the transaction that does little more than operate as a conduit .
However , this is not the case .
The CCP is a distinct entity that has an interest in its own survival , and since the CCP is now liable to both dealers , it has an interest in being well - capitalized .
While individual dealers also have an interest in being well - capitalized , they are unable to determine whether the CDS market as a whole is well - capitalized .
And even if they were able to determine whether or not that is the case , each individual dealer has no power to convince others to increase the capital allocated to their positions .
By centralizing all of the trade information into one entity and giving that entity control over the levels of collateral that dealers must post , we have created a method through which we can better ensure the adequate capitalization of the entire CDS market .
For example , if one dealer is unable to fully collateralize its positions , the CCP can draw on its own capital and the capital of the other dealers to make up for the shortage .
Without a CCP , that shortage of collateral would probably trigger events of default , which could “ knock - on , ” or cascade through the market .
But as always , there ’s no free lunch , and despite all of this upside , we have also concentrated the risk of counterparty failure .
Payment Netting And Payment Settlement
As Duffie and Zhu note , dealers net their payments and collateral across different types of vanilla swaps .
So , for example , if Dealer A owed Dealer B $ 5 under a vanilla interest rate swap on some payment date , while Dealer B owed Dealer A $ 3 under a vanilla CDS , A would simply pay B $ 2 .
This type of bilateral netting across asset classes reduces the risk that dealers will default when compared to not having such netting because it reduces the total amount of cash that is needed to meet payment obligations .
Duffie and Zhu argue that because CCPs segregate vanilla CDS trades from all other types of vanilla swaps , we miss the opportunity to net across asset classes .
This is not necessarily the case .
First , we need to distinguish between the entities that are liable for the trades ( i.e. , the dealers and the CCP ) and the entities that actually process the trade information and payments .
In the case of ICE , trade information is processed by DTCC .
After that trade information gets processed , DTCC submits payment instructions to CLS Bank , which actually handles the payments .
So , the CCP itself is not able to net payments across various asset classes , since it only handles CDS trades and moreover does n’t actually settle the payments .
However , DTCC will submit payment instructions to a settlement agent , CLS Bank , that actually handles the cash payments .
CLS
Bank could also receive payment instructions for other asset classes from the dealers ( i.e. , payment instructions on interest rate swaps , etc. ) and net the payment instructions from the DTCC against the payment instructions from the dealers ’ other activities .
In fact , CLS Bank is also a leading settlement agent in the FX market .
In short , netting CDS contracts first does not preclude you from netting against other swaps later , especially since trading and settlement are handled by distinct entities .
A recruiter who left Google last year says that the company had maintained a “ do not touch ” list of companies including Genentech and Yahoo , whose employees were not to be wooed to the Internet search giant .
That revelation could be significant in light of this week ’s disclosure that the U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether Google , Yahoo , Apple , Genentech and other tech companies conspired to keep others from stealing their top talent .
Although Google declined to comment on the list or other aspects of the investigation , Palo Alto attorney Gary Reback , who has been involved in a number of high - profile antitrust cases , said having such a list is not unheard of and not necessarily illegal .
He noted that some companies might keep such a list to avoid upsetting a valued business partner that would n’t want to lose its workers , for example .
However , if two or more companies agree to avoid poaching employees from the same list of companies , Reback added , that could constitute anti-competitive collusion under federal law .
Not the valley way
Some recruiters and others were surprised by the allegations , saying they conflicted with the valley ’s freewheeling and hotly competitive image .
“ It does n’t fit , ” said Joe Maxwell of Santa Clara - based Silicon Talent , who like several other recruiters said he had never heard of any scheme by companies to keep their employees from going elsewhere .
The former Google recruiter said the do - not - touch list was periodically refreshed and was understood to be a “ courtesy ” to the companies on the list .
“ When you are recruiting talent out of companies you do business with , you are hurting them , ” said another recruiter who did not work at Google but confirmed that such practices are common .
Tina Duccini , a former technical recruiter for Yahoo , said Yahoo had no restrictions about hiring people from other companies .
“ Of course we went after Microsoft , Google and eBay , ” she said .
“ We prided ourselves on competing . ”
Occasionally , Yahoo recruiters would hear that the company ’s legal department had received a cease - and - desist letter from another company , Duccini said .
But recruiters who poached continued to be praised , she said , noting that some managers once gave a standing ovation to recruiters who had successfully persuaded a competitor ’s entire engineering team to join Yahoo .
Geoffrey Teeter , a spokesman with Genentech , a South San Francisco biotechnology company recently taken over by Swiss drug firm Roche , acknowledged that Genentech has received a Justice Department request for information related to the investigation .
He noted that “ Genentech is cooperating and will respond to the request in due course , ” but declined to provide details .
The Justice Department and Yahoo would not discuss the investigation , although Yahoo confirmed it had received a request for information .
Apple officials could not be reached for comment .
The hiring investigation is part of the federal government ’s intensified scrutiny of Silicon Valley business practices .
The Federal Trade Commission is looking into the makeup of Google ’s and Apple ’s boards , as well as claims that Intel has engaged in monopolistic practices .
In addition , the Justice Department is examining a proposed settlement between Google and a group of authors and publishers that allows the Internet search company to sell digital copies of out - of - print books .
Few details on probe
Few details have been disclosed so far about the hiring - practice probe , which The Washington Post first reported in a story on its Web site late Tuesday .
Citing two unnamed sources , the newspaper said the Justice Department was examining the possibility that the four companies and other unnamed firms may have violated antitrust laws by “ negotiating the recruiting and hiring of one another ’s employees . ”
Making it harder for employees to jump to another company could seriously hinder innovation in a place like Silicon Valley , said Bert Foer , president of the American Antitrust Institute .
“ That area has been famous for people moving around from company to company , and when they do that they pollinate the new company with new ideas , ” he said .
Moreover , by potentially limiting the career opportunities of employees , “ at a certain point it becomes indentured servitude ” for the workers .
Over the years , a number of employers have been accused of engaging in anti-competitive hiring practices .
A 2001 federal appeals court decision written by Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor , for example , found that oil companies had conspired to keep wages artificially low .
On the surface , employees at major Silicon Valley companies appear to have had no problem finding jobs at other firms , including their competitors .
A number of key employees recently have left such companies as Yahoo and Google , in some cases finding work at competing firms .
Last year , Bradley Horowitz , head of Yahoo ’s advanced development division , became Google ’s vice president of product management .
And in May , Yoelle Maarek , engineering director at the Google Haifa Engineering Center , became senior director of Yahoo research .
California has especially tough rules barring companies from restricting their employees ’ job hunting .
Many companies across the country require employees to sign so - called noncompete agreements , in which the worker agrees not to be hired by a competitor within a certain period of time .
But California law generally regards such pacts as unenforceable , said Bob Taylor , a Palo Alto attorney who specializes in antitrust law , among other areas .
As a result , Taylor said , California “ is one of , if not the most , difficult states for employers to prevent employees from taking jobs with competitors . ”

Forget Batman , Spiderman , and Iron Man , the next big superhero who ’s destined for the big screen is Sananguaqatiit , the star of The Adventures of Sananguaqatiit .
The comic features Charlie Kavik , a mild mannered Inuit carver who ’s imbued with superpowers in order to stop unsafe carving practices in the Arctic .
According to the comic ’s publisher , the Inuit Art Foundation — which published the comic between 1992 and 1996 — Sananguaqatiit is Inuktitut for : " your carving buddy . "
Even the writers can't keep the spelling of " Sananguaqatiit " consistent .
We understand the importance of teaching safe carving practices , but did anybody ever take this comic seriously ?
For starters it ’s boring .
Besides talking endlessly about carving safety , Sananguaqatiit really does n’t do anything .
He does n’t save lives , he just kinda shows up and people listen to him .
He could just be a normal , but knowledgeable guy , and it would n’t make a bit of difference .
His flying snowmobile , Super Qamutilk ( yes , he rides a fucking flying snowmobile ) , lets him travel places quickly , but that ability is hardly essential to the plot - less stories .
Surprisingly , this kind of weird message - driven aboriginal - comic is n't even that unusual .
In 1973 , the Canadian government created a comic called , The Incredible Coming of Al Cohol , in an attempt to teach Inuit communities about the evils of drinking .
The comic starred Al Cohol , an alien with a drinking problem .
Like The Adventures of Sananguaqatiit , The Incredible Coming of Al Cohol is extremely ham - fisted and somewhat racist in its portrayal of Inuit people .
All of the issues of The Adventures of Sananguaqatiit are available here , but we do n't recommend reading them .
Intelligence Minister Ejeie has been summarily dismissed
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has sacked one of his ministers , a day after he was forced to cancel the appointment of his vice - president .
No reason was given for the sacking of Intelligence Minister Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejeie .
Meanwhile , the culture minister quit , saying the government was weakened .
The president is due to announce a new cabinet after he is sworn in for a second term in 10 days ' time , following a disputed election victory .
Amid the turmoil , Mr Ahmadinejad 's office also denied reports that three other ministers were sacked .
One of those reported dismissed , Culture and Islamic Guidance Minister Mohammad Hossein Saffar Harandi , said he was resigning because of the confused reports .
" Unfortunately due to the recent events which shows the esteemed government 's weakness , I will no longer consider myself the minister of culture and will not show up at the ministry as of tomorrow , " he said in a letter of resignation carried by the Fars news agency .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's decision to give up on the appointment of his First Vice - President , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaie , was prompted by the publication of a letter from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei telling him his choice was unacceptable .
On Saturday , however , Mr Ahmadinejad appointed Mr Mashaie as his chief of staff , setting up another potential confrontation with conservatives .
Mr Mashaie had angered hardliners last year by saying Iranians and Israelis were friends .
Enlarge By Saul Loeb , AFP / Getty Images President Obama , answering a question from cancer patient Debby Smith at a forum in Annandale , Va. , on July 1 , says health care " is no longer a problem we can wait to fix . "
HOW MUCH IS $ 1 TRILLION ?
HOW MUCH IS $ 1 TRILLION ?
It 's a huge sum -- a " 1 " followed by a dozen zeroes : $ 1,000,000,000,000 .
For some perspective , here are some comparisons .
One trillion dollars is : • The annual gross domestic product of South Korea •
The combined net worth of the world 's 90 richest people • Enough to buy 222 U.S. Navy Nimitz - class aircraft carriers • Enough to give $ 325.50 to everyone in the USA each year for 10 years •
The combined market capitalization of Google , Apple , Microsoft and Intel , plus enough to buy an iPhone for everyone in China and India Reported by Blair Brettschneider HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER WASHINGTON 
The White House and Democratic congressional leaders , scrambling to pass health care bills within the next few weeks , are trying to keep the cost of legislation that expands coverage and controls costs to about $ 1 trillion over 10 years — a benchmark for moderates in both parties .
So what can you buy for $ 1 trillion ?
Although the eye - popping price tag would help boost insurance coverage to 95 % or more of the public , it 's not enough to do everything advocates initially want .
The proposals being shaped in Congress — including the $ 1.042 trillion bill unveiled by House Democratic leaders Tuesday — offer subsidies to fewer moderate - income families than originally intended , bar most workers from choosing to leave their employer - provided plans and likely drive up Medicaid costs for states .
THE PLAN : House Dems ' health bill would tax rich
At the end of a decade , 15 million to 20 million would remain uninsured , according to assessments by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office — a sticking point for critics who argue the whole enterprise does n't get enough bang for the buck .
Nearly 50 million now lack coverage .
" One of the major concerns that Americans have about health care reform is the price tag , " Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell said Monday on the Senate floor .
" Every proposal we 've seen would cost a fortune by any standard . "
President Obama defends the overhaul as a critical investment to fix a dysfunctional system he says is hobbling many families and threatening the nation 's fiscal future .
" This is no longer a problem we can wait to fix , " he said Monday at the White House .
" Inaction is not an option . "
Here 's the squeeze for policymakers :
Allow the price tag to grow much past $ 1 trillion and you risk losing the support of fiscal hawks in Congress and voters alarmed by the costs of stimulus spending and corporate bailouts .
Because the president has promised the health care plan wo n't increase the deficit , a bigger bottom line means more taxes would have to be raised , or spending cut , to offset it .
On the other hand , cut back too far and you imperil the legislation 's fundamental goal of giving everyone access to health insurance they can afford .
That could undermine support from the strongest advocates for change .
The battles roiling the negotiations — and threatening Obama 's call for votes in the House and Senate before their August recess — center on which taxes should be raised to finance the bill and whether the plan should include a public , government - run option to compete with private insurers .
There is much less debate about how the money should be spent , though the details differ .
The plans emerging in the House and Senate envision three big - ticket items that would consume the lion 's share of the money : subsidies to help low - and moderate - income Americans buy insurance on new health exchanges ; a dramatic expansion of Medicaid to cover the poor ; and incentives to encourage small businesses to offer health insurance to their workers .
" It 's all these moving parts , " says Judith Solomon of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
" When you move one , you get pressure on something else — that 's what they 're facing . "
In the House , the Education and Labor Committee opens hearings on the House bill today , and the Ways and Means panel begins work Thursday .
In the Senate , the Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee is in the middle of hearings marking up its version .
And the Senate Finance Committee is discussing options while closed - door negotiations continue .
Its bill could be unveiled this week .
Here 's a look at where the money would go .
1 . Helping to pay premiums
There 's general agreement on how to guarantee that nearly everyone has health insurance : pass a law that says they have to have it , just as automobile owners have to have car insurance .
To make the mandate work , the government would set up insurance exchanges where individuals and small businesses could shop among competing plans .
Low - and moderate - income workers would get subsidies to help pay the premiums .
Those sliding subsidies are by far the biggest single cost in the health care plans — perhaps two - thirds of the total .
The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) pegged the House and Senate health committee versions at more than $ 700 billion .
Economist David Cutler of Harvard cites two main reasons why it 's expensive : First , health insurance costs so much that even some middle - income families need help to afford it .
Second , the subsidies would go to everyone who meets the income guidelines , even if they already have coverage .
That 's good news for them , of course , but it adds to the legislation 's cost without affecting the overall number of uninsured .
As congressional negotiators try to meet the trillion - dollar benchmark , the number of people eligible for the subsidies has been scaled back and the size of the subsidies trimmed .
That is likely to add to the number of Americans who remain uninsured :
Those for whom coverage is judged " unaffordable " — based on what proportion of their income would have to go to premiums — would be exempt from having to buy insurance .
The House bill would offer subsidies to those who earn up to 400 % of the federal poverty level .
( That 's $ 43,320 for an individual and $ 88,200 for a family of four . )
The Senate health committee initially proposed subsidies for those making up to 500 % of poverty but pared it to 400 % .
Under those plans , up to 30 million people would buy insurance on the exchanges , the CBO estimates , and more than eight of 10 would be eligible for subsidies .
By 2019 the subsidy would average about $ 6,000 per person .
House Democrats and the Senate panel also have moved to limit who could use the exchanges .
People who have the option of buying affordable insurance at work would n't be able to use the exchange , even if they thought it would be a better deal for them .
That 's another way to hold down costs .
Without those limits and some other steps , the CBO estimated that the Senate subsidies would cost nearly $ 1.3 trillion over 10 years .
Limiting the ability of workers to move to the exchanges and get the subsidies helped reduce that expense to $ 723 billion — still a sizable sum .
The second - biggest cost is a significant expansion of Medicaid , the federal - state health care program for the poor .
2 . Expanding Medicaid
Under the proposals being discussed , anyone with annual income that puts him or her at the federal poverty level or slightly above it would be eligible to sign up for Medicaid .
Now , states set rules about who is eligible to sign up , but none allows all poor adults to enroll .
At the House threshold of 133 % of poverty , CBO estimates an additional 11 million people would sign up for Medicaid .
Raising the limit to 150 % of poverty , as the Senate panel envisions , means an additional 15 million to 20 million people would enroll .
The estimated 10 - year cost : $ 500 billion .
Some governors are raising alarms that the measure will increase the burden on their hard - pressed states , which pay part of Medicaid 's costs .
The House bill calls for the federal government pick up all the new Medicaid expenses , and it promises to enact big savings in the program .
The Senate Finance Committee has suggested the federal government would help states with their extra costs only for the first five years .
" This would be a haymaker thrown right at our taxpayers , " says Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels , a Republican and former budget director in the George W. Bush administration .
He says expansion of Medicaid to 150 % of poverty could increase the state 's costs by $ 750 million a year — 5 % of the state budget — and wipe out an innovative Indiana health care program .
Although Indiana is now solvent , unlike California and some other states , " that would be a monster of a mandate , " Daniels says .
Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , chairman of the Republican Governors Association , says the expansion would swell his state 's Medicaid rolls by about one - third , to 900,000 from 600,000 , and risk crowding out spending on things such as education .
" The proponents in Washington say , ' Do n't worry , the federal government is going to pay for it all , ' " Barbour says .
" Forgive me if I 'm skeptical . "
State costs are likely to increase even if the federal government covers the cost of recipients who were n't eligible for Medicaid before .
In Massachusetts , which has become a kind of testing ground on health care , passage of an individual mandate for health insurance in 2006 prompted thousands of people who already were eligible for Medicaid but had n't signed up to enroll .
3 . Boosting small businesses
The House and the Senate health committee plans include play - or - pay provisions that require employers to offer health insurance for their workers ( " play " ) or pay a government fee ( " pay " ) .
Small businesses would be exempt .
The Senate committee defines that as a company employing fewer than 25 people ; the House bill exempts companies with payrolls of less than $ 250,000 .
Both plans include incentives — subsidies or tax credits — for small businesses to use the new insurance exchanges to buy coverage for their workers .
Companies with low - wage workers are targeted .
The CBO estimates the cost of the provisions in each bill at more than $ 50 billion over 10 years .
There are other costs with the health care blueprints — the House bill runs more than 1,000 pages — including the task of setting up the exchanges and devising a government - run plan , if there is one .
( The administrative costs for both eventually would be covered largely by the premiums paid . )
And the health care bills are laced with spending that reflects the particular interests and concerns of key members of Congress .
" There is the usual sausage - making aspects of this , " says Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute .
" Special grants to constituencies , money for rural health care , money for inner-city hospitals ... payments to particular diseases . "
The other items do n't come close to the price tags for the three big - ticket items , though .
" That 's chump change , " Cutler says .
At least it is in the context of $ 1 trillion .

There has been some discussion in recent days regarding Object - Relational Mappers ( ORMs ) , Drupal , and why the latter does n't use the former .
There are , actually , many reasons for that , and for why Drupal does n't do more with the Active Record pattern .
Rather than tuck such discussion away in an issue queue , I figured it better to document a bit more widely .
On ORMs in Drupal
I highly recommend that people read The Vietnam of Computer Science .
It does an extremely good job of laying out why OO <-> SQL mapping is a fundamentally intractable problem .
We can do some , in some cases , but it very very quickly becomes very very ugly .
The only viable solution is to rely on SQL as the primary system and treat the object structure as a secondary add - on , or to treat the object structure as the primary system and the data persistence system as an unstructured data store .
Because of its stateless nature , PHP does n't lend itself well to the latter method .
Anything done in - memory needs to be completely reinitialized on every page request .
That means you need to move the entire data storage and searching ( never forget searching / querying / slicing / dicing ! ) into a separate persistent storage engine akin to an SQL database .
Such systems do exist , but have three important problems where our usage is concerned :
They 're still relatively immature and have not stabilized , and most have not proven themselves capable of scaling very large and very small .
They are not at all standardized between vendors and implementations , meaning we would need to pick one and hope that it would be the winning strategy later on .
They are not universally available , and universal availability is a key goal for Drupal .
In contrast , it is difficult to find a web host that does n't offer MySQL .
PostgreSQL is available on many , and anyone running their own server can install it .
SQLite requires effort to not have available in PHP 5.2 .
While there are big differences between different SQL implementations , they are far far more standardized than object databases are , especially if you include the new wave of " naive " databases .
The available tools to work with them ( both PHP - based tools like PDO and user - space tools like desktop GUIs ) are very mature and robust and widely available .
SQL is also a very widely available skill set .
You can pick it up anywhere ( to varying degrees of competency , of course ) , and any CS program in the world worth its salt includes at least one class in some SQL dialect .
So for now and for the foreseeable future , favoring relational data over object data for PHP , and Drupal in particular , seems the better strategy than gutting and rewriting Drupal entirely for CouchDB , Bigtable , Oracle - specific object stores , or whatever else .
Given that a relational database is still the most sensible primary storage system for Drupal to use , we should make it as easy as possible to leverage , but no easier lest we lose power in the process .
That fits with the Rasmus Lerdorf - coined term for PHP 's architecture of " Leaky Abstraction " .
We do n't want to prevent people from accessing the data store directly , which means giving them SQL access so they can do things we did n't think of when creating the API .
That precludes creating our own heavy ORM , as that 's yet another Drupal specific API people would need to learn .
While yes , it may be possible to create a Drupal - specific data access system that is easier to learn than SQL , there would be about 10 people who understood it and a few hundred who knew how to use it .
Compare that to the hundreds of thousands of people who already know SQL well enough to hit the ground running in Drupal .
I 'd like to use more conventional and standard approaches , patterns , and techniques in Drupal , not fewer .
There 's also the challenge of creating such an abstraction in the first place .
Currently , the trend in Drupal is toward a unified API and structure for primary data entities ( nodes , users , etc. ) that forces data into a very specific structure , fields .
Think " CCK everywhere " .
Now look at the hundreds of hours that have gone into CCK and Fields .
Now look at how messy the code for CCK is in Drupal 6 .
Now look at how the API breaks in so many places already when you do unconventional things .
Now look at how there are already massive performance issues that have n't been resolved yet , except with the cop - out of " uh , use caching " .
And the people working on this problem are really really smart people .
It 's really hard to do well , and that 's just for a small subset of the larger ORM problem .
Multiply all of those issues by 10 and you approach the challenge that is making Drupal all - ORM without someone else solving the problem for us already .
We did briefly consider Doctrine early in the DBTNG development life cycle .
( More specifically , some of the Doctrine folks tried for a few weeks to sell us on just using Doctrine . )
We decided against it on the grounds that Doctrine was way too big for us to include ( I think someone said the code base was larger than core , but I 'm not sure if that 's true ) , it was yet another custom string - based pseudo - language that people would have to learn ( whereas basic SQL is a widespread skill ) , and it did n't give us the flexibility to deal with non-primary - data entities whereas SQL allows all kinds of unexpected flexibility .
DBTNG , by contrast , is very thin , flexible , and for someone who already knows SQL is almost trivial to pick up even with the query builders .
Every abstraction layer adds a performance cost , too .
" Just add more abstraction " is not always a viable answer , as there are costs to any abstraction .
The DBTNG approach
When I started working on Drupal 7's new database layer , back before it was called " DBTNG " , my goal was to make writing secure , portable SQL easier , not easy :-) , and provide a lot of new features for SQL writers .
Although SQL is far more standardized than object databases are , it 's still an iffy standard at best .
Imagine trying to write a definitive grammar parser for English , in all its variants : British , Scottish , New Zealander , Outback Australian , plus the dozen or so distinct North American versions .
( Really , can anyone understand what someone from Brooklyn is saying ? :-) )
That 's what writing a truly vendor - agnostic SQL abstraction layer is like , except that you can't rely on the human brain 's ability to guess what is meant by context .
SQL servers do n't do fuzzy parsing .
Doing that at runtime in interpreted code like PHP is a recipe for performance disaster .
PDO takes care of a lot of the abstraction for us , by providing a layer , in compiled C code , where differences in prepared statements are normalized and abstracted .
Of course , even that is imperfect at times as we see from the need to provide alternate handling for BLOB and LOB data types in PostgreSQL and Oracle , or provide our own user - space buffering for SQLite .
The only viable solution that does not involve runtime parsing and re-creation of SQL strings ( which as noted above is slow , error - prone , and extremely hard to do ) is to require developers to provide a pre-parsed data structure that can be customized for each database .
That 's what the query builders are for , as they describe the SQL behavior in structured terms that are then fairly easily compiled to each target database .
In all modesty , I think we did a far better job there than I every expected us to on the first try .
( OK there were several iterations , but this approach has been fairly stable for over a year now . )
But even those introduce overhead .
SelectQuery - based queries are more verbose to write and slower to execute than just providing an SQL string , because they have to be built up ( a dozen or more method calls ) and then compiled before being executed .
Sometimes that is a very good trade - off , other times not .
Of course , that means there are many use cases for which we do not have a solution .
Not all queries are valid in all SQL dialects .
The only ways to ensure that such queries work cross - database are :
Parse all query strings and mutate them into DB - specific SQL .
As discussed above , this is simply infeasible due to both performance concerns and the shear effort involved .
Some databases have concepts that simply do not exist in other databases .
Require every single database query to go through a query builder so that we have a pre-parsed data structure to work with .
We do this already for modifier queries , but that 's pushing it .
Select queries are much more common , and the performance cost there much higher .
And even then , some mappings would be non-trivial .
Plus , writing a built Select query is indisputably more work for the developer than just writing a literal query in the majority of cases .
( Those cases where it 's not ?
Well , use the query builder .
It 's a worthwhile trade - off there . )
Require module developers to write portable SQL where possible .
The only performance cost here is on the developer , not at runtime .
Most queries are , in fact , reasonably portable .
The cost to the developer here , given that PDO handles prepared statements for us , is fairly low .
It 's only an issue on more complex queries .
The only option that does n't make Drupal Way Too Slow ( tm ) is # 3 : Write portable SQL where possible and submit bug reports where it has n't been done .
That 's the approach that Drupal has taken , since doing more would be cost prohibitive .
If someone manages to come up with a brilliant solution that lets us do # 1 without serious performance degradation , I 'm all for it .
However , I do n't see that happening until Drupal 8 , if ever .
Database vendors need to get their act together and better standardize their SQL dialects .
Some problems we simply cannot solve on our own .
Amid all of the new features highlighted Monday in Snow Leopard , iPhone 3.0 and Safari 4.0 were a few unpublicized retractions : Safari 4.0 has lost its " tabs on top " and returned to the old conventional tabs of the previous 3.0 version , while all mention of full ZFS support in Snow Leopard Server has been scrubbed .
When Safari 4.0 was released for free download yesterday , its provocative use of upward facing tabs was dropped along with its beta label .
For users who just got used to having their window tabs tucked into the dead space in the menu bar , the change back might seem disappointing .
After all , Apple promoted the idea of ' tabs on top ' as a clever way to minimize the impact of user interface elements on the browsing experience , a key design goal of Safari since its first release .
Why have tabs dropped back down to consume an extra strip of interface real estate ?
Perhaps the company though it was too confusing to new users , or that it simply was n't consistent or compatible with its own interface guidelines or those of Microsoft Windows , which the company is now trying to look native on with Safari rather than imposing its uniquely metallic Mac appearance .
Whatever the reason , the retraction of the bold design step by the typically safe , if not conservative , company is slightly disappointing and makes the new browser seem a big dowdy .
Users might forgive this due to Safari 's enhanced rendering speed .
The new - old tabs also still work the same , featuring the intuitive drag to reorder capability and the option to drag a tab outside the current browser to spawn a new window , or to drag a tab into an existing window to make it a component tab .
Apple claims 150 other features for Safari in its place .
Upward facing tabs under Safari 4 beta ( left ) compared to those implemented in the release ( right ) .
The conspicuously missing ZFS
The announcement of new support for Sun 's open source ZFS in Leopard drew a frenzy of attention that had pundits insisting that Mac OS X would quickly make the new file system its default in place of HFS + , a prediction that has not materialized .
Of course , while ZFS is positively dripping with easy to understand feature buzzwords , there 's no desperate , impending need to replace HFS + nor any likelihood that ZFS would really offer consumers , who make up the vast majority Apple 's target market , any tangible benefits .
For starters , the features of ZFS only really get started when you 're using multiple disks , and most of Apple 's users are now buying notebook systems , none of which ship with multiple drives .
Still , ZFS seemed to hold a lot of promise to Snow Leopard Server users , who might want to take advantage of the new file system 's support for features such as flexible volume management , continuous data integrity checking and automatic repair .
ZFS was formerly listed prominently among the scant new details offered on Apple 's next version of Mac OS X Server , but now the company 's entire site seems to be purged of any mention .
Sources have noted that the feature was pulled from the user interface of Disk Utility in recent developer builds .
While Apple probably is n't abandoning the technology , it has certainly slipped from the list of critical to deliver features for Snow Leopard .
The only mention of ZFS in the search results of Apple 's website is its inclusion as an open source project in Darwin .
Well , there 's always Mac OS X 10.7 .
The tight cluster of stars surrounding a supermassive black hole after it has been violently kicked out of a galaxy represents a new kind of astronomical object and a fossil record of the kick .
A paper published in the July 10 issue of The Astrophysical Journal discusses the theoretical properties of “ hypercompact stellar systems ” and suggests that hundreds of these faint star clusters might be detected at optical wavelengths in our immediate cosmic environment .
Some of these objects may already have been picked up in astronomical surveys , reports David Merritt , from Rochester Institute of Technology , Jeremy Schnittman , from Johns Hopkins University , and Stefanie Komossa , from the Max - Planck - Institut for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany .
Hypercompact stellar systems result when a supermassive black hole is violently ejected from a galaxy , following a merger with another supermassive black hole .
The evicted black hole rips stars from the galaxy as it is thrown out .
The stars closest to the black hole move in tandem with the massive object and become a permanent record of the velocity at which the kick occurred .
“ You can measure how big the kick was by measuring how fast the stars are moving around the black hole , ” says Merritt , professor of physics at RIT .
“ Only stars orbiting faster than the kick velocity remain attached to the black hole after the kick .
These stars carry with them a kind of fossil record of the kick , even after the black hole has slowed down .
In principle , you can reconstruct the properties of the kick , which is nice because there would be no other way to do it . ”
“ Finding these objects would be like discovering DNA from a long - extinct species , ” adds Komossa .
The best place to find hypercompact stellar systems , the authors argued , is in cluster of galaxies like the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters .
These dense regions of space contain thousands of galaxies that have been merging for a long time .
Merging galaxies result in merging black holes , which is a prerequisite for the kicks .
“ Even if the black hole gets kicked out of one galaxy , it ’s still going to be gravitationally bound to the whole cluster of galaxies , ” Merritt says .
“ The total gravity of all the galaxies is acting on that black hole .
If it was ever produced , it ’s still going to be there somewhere in that cluster . ”
Merritt and his co-authors think that scientists may have already seen hypercompact stellar systems and not realized it .
These objects would be easy to mistake for common star systems like globular clusters .
The key signature making hypercompact stellar systems unique is a high internal velocity .
This is detectable only by measuring the velocities of stars moving around the black hole , a difficult measurement that would require a long time exposure on a large telescope .
From time to time , a hypercompact stellar system will make its presence known in a much more dramatic way , when one of the stars is tidally disrupted by the supermassive black hole .
In this case , gravity stretches the star and sucks it into the black hole .
The star is torn apart , causing a beacon - like flare that signals a black hole .
The possibility of detecting one of these “ recoil flares ” was first discussed in an August 2008 paper by co-authors Merritt and Komossa .
“ The only contact of these floating black holes with the rest of the universe is through their armada of stars , ” Merritt says , “ with an occasional display of stellar fireworks to signal ‘ here we are . ’ ”
I 'm hoping President Obama realizes that some of the folks who 've been currying favor with him are not , as they claim , bringing " solutions " to the health care reform table .
Most Americans -- especially those who voted for him -- want nothing to do with the kind of " reforms " they are peddling .
If you watched the president 's televised Q&A on ABC last Wednesday night , you probably noticed that one of the people in the audience was Ron Williams , the chairman and CEO of Aetna , Inc. , the nation 's third largest health insurer , and currently one of the most profitable .
But there are a few things that you should know about Williams .
Back in the '90s , Aetna set out on an acquisition binge in its quest to become the biggest health insurer in the country .
It got there by the end of the decade after spending billion of dollars for several competitors .
By 1999 it had 21 million health plan members , the most any insurer had ever had at the time .
But , as often happens after buying sprees , Aetna soon came down with a bad case of buyers ' remorse .
As it turned out , some of the customers it had paid top price for were not as profitable as Wall Street analysts and the big institutional investors who owned most of Aetna 's stock expected .
When they took a closer look at what Aetna had bought , investors started deserting the company in droves .
As a result , the company found its stock price in a free fall .
As the Wall Street Journal reported on August 13 , 2004 , Aetna 's pretax profits as a percentage of revenues began falling dramatically after peaking at about 12 percent in 1998 .
By 2001 the company was a basket case as far as Wall Street was concerned .
It had to do something , and fast .
Probably the most important thing it did to turn itself around was recruit Williams from rival WellPoint , the ambitious for - profit company that was gobbling up Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans from coast to coast .
As the Journal reported , Williams promptly ordered a $ 20 million revamp of Aetna 's data systems .
Health care analyst Joshua Raskin told the Journal that the new system that emerged from that investment , which Aetna dubbed the Executive Management Information System ( EMIS for short ) , was " the single largest driver of the Aetna turnaround . "
Why ?
Because it helped Aetna " identify and dump unprofitable corporate accounts . "
How did it do the dumping ?
By jacking up premiums to unaffordable levels .
By the time the dumping -- or purging , as it is frequently called in the industry -- was done , Aetna had shed eight million of its 21 million members .
It shrank so much that by the time it emerged from the Ron Williams - led turnaround , it had fewer members than when the company started out on its multi-billion dollar buying binge .
While Aetna was shedding those eight million men , women and children , by the way , it also reportedly shed 15,000 of its employees .
Wall Street likes it when insurers dump employees , too , because the workers who do n't get the ax have to assume the responsibilities of their laid - off colleagues .
That theoretically boosts productivity , which Wall Street likes .
And reducing the payroll leaves more money for profits .
The health insurance industry and its allies are working hard right now to convince you that the creation of a public insurance option would put a government bureaucrat between you and your doctor .
As the 2004 Wall Street Journal article makes it clear , however , EMIS was at its heart a system that put corporate bureaucrats between people and their doctors .
Here 's what it saId :
Mr. Williams says EMIS helps him ferret out creeping costs so Aetna can react quickly .
Sitting in his first - floor office in Hartford overlooking the Aetna parking lot , he taps on his keyboard to see whether some of the health insurer 's members are visiting emergency rooms too much for nonemergency reasons , such as for the flu or a sprained ankle .
Did that send a chill up your spine like it did mine ?
And know this , if Aetna 's CEO can keep an eye on your trips to the doctor , so can the CEOs of all the other big insurers .
The insurance industry claims that this time it really and truly supports legislation to reduce the number of people without insurance , that they 've changed so much since 1994 -- when they said the same thing but did everything they could behind the scenes to kill reform -- that you can and should believe them now .
The next time you hear someone from the industry talking about how much they are committed to reform , remember that just a few years ago , the CEO of one of the biggest health insurers was the mastermind behind a business strategy that cost thousands of workers their jobs and millions of other people their insurance coverage .
That 's the real " solution " the industry is bringing to the table -- and the kind of reform Wall Street can really get behind .
Ron Williams has been richly rewarded by Aetna 's board of directors for leading the company back to a level of profitability suitable to Wall Street .
They tapped him to succeed Jack Rowe as CEO when Rowe retired in 2006 .
And they rewarded him with compensation totaling nearly $ 65 million over the past two years .
( Rowe , by the way , was paid $ 22.2 million in 2005 , his last full year as CEO .
He played a big role in hawking the high - deductible plans that Aetna and the other big insurers are now trying to push us all into .
He claimed that Americans enrolled in managed care plans have been too sheltered from the real costs of health care and that we need to have more " skin in the game , " by which he meant that we should have to pay a lot more out of our own pockets when we go to the doctor and pick up our prescriptions , even if we have health insurance .
The median family income in the United States is just $ 50,000 , which means that most of us already have a lot more skin in the game than Dr. Rowe and Ron Williams will ever need to . )
The insurance industry 's two biggest lobbying groups -- America 's Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association of America -- warned members of Congress in a joint letter a few days ago that the creation of a public insurance option would unravel the country 's employer - based system .
As they say where I come from , that dog wo n't hunt .
It is the insurance company executives -- in their never - ending quest to meet Wall Street 's profit expectations -- who are doing the unraveling by purging employers whose workers have the audacity to file claims when they get sick or injured .
A final point about Ron Williams :
Not only are he and his fellow CEOs trying to kill the idea of a public health insurance option -- a central part of candidate Obama 's health care proposal -- but he is the leading advocate of an idea Obama rejected and which differentiated his proposal from Hillary Clinton 's -- the imposition on all of us of an " individual mandate . "
Many insurance executives were wary of such a mandate because they do n't like the government mandating anything , especially those pesky state mandates that force them to include certain benefits in the policies they sell .
Advocates of an individual mandate eventually brought the skeptics , including many of AHIP 's board members , around to their way thinking by persuading them that insurers could make billions more in profits if every American had to buy an insurance policy from them .
Now you know the real reason behind AHIP 's shift from neutrality on the issue to full - fledged support .
It 's all about the money .

Der CDU - Bundestagsabgeordnete
Thomas Strobl sieht das von der Innenministerkonferenz geforderte Herstellungs - und Verbreitungsverbot von gewalthaltigen Spielen als bedenkenswerte Maßnahme an , es sei sorgfältig zu prüfen .
Auf dem Politiker - Befragungsportal Abgeordnetenwatch schreibt er darüber hinaus , in der Debatte zur Gewaltprävention sollte die von den Bundesministern Ursula von der Leyen und Wolfgang Schäuble vorgeschlagene Sperrung von kinderpornografischen Seiten im Internet " mit Blick auf Killerspiele neu diskutiert werden " .
Auch müsse das Zustandekommen von Alterskennzeichnungen solcher Spiele überprüft und die Arbeitsweise der Unterhaltungssoftware - Selbstkontrolle kritisch hinterfragt werden .
Der Heilbronner Rechtsanwalt Strobl betont , seine Ausführungen in dem Beitrag auf Abgeordnetenwatch seien ein grundsätzliches Statement .
Sie seien identisch mit Erwiderungsschreiben auf Bürgerbriefe zu dem Thema , die er in den vergangenen Wochen verstärkt bekommen habe .
Auf die Frage , wie es zu einem Amoklauf wie dem von Winnenden ( das in der Nähe von Heilbronn liegt ) kommen könne , gebe es nicht eine einzelne Antwort .
Es müsse unter anderem überlegt werden , ob der Konsum von Gewaltvideos und gewalthaltigen Spielen einem " verantwortlichen und selbstverantwortlichen Handeln " entspreche .
Die " virtuelle Brutalisierung " markiere bei vielen jugendlichen Gewalttätern und Amokläufern den Beginn der realen Brutalisierung , meint Strobl .
Innenminister von Bund und Ländern hatten sich vorige Woche auf ein schärferes Vorgehen gegen " Killerspiele " geeinigt .
Sie meinen , die Herstellung und Verbreitung von Video - und Computerspielen , " bei denen ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Spielhandlung die virtuelle Ausübung von wirklichkeitsnah dargestellten Tötungshandlungen " ausmacht , sollte schnellstmöglich verboten werden .
Diesen Beschluss kritisierte der Spitzenverband der Bundeskulturverbände , der Kulturrat , als " wahltaktischen Schnellschuss " .
Bei einem solchen Verbot , von dem auch Erwachsene betroffen wären , würden Kunst- , Presse - und Meinungsfreiheit elementar berührt .
Das Portal Abgeordnetenwatch war kürzlich Bühne für den Unmut des SPD - Bundestagsabgeordneten Dieter Wiefelspütz .
Dieser sah sich durch einen Bericht der Berliner Zeitung falsch wiedergegeben .
Auf Abgeordnetenwatch betonte er , es gebe weder in der SPD noch bei ihm Überlegungen , über Kinderpornografie hinaus bei anderen Internet - Inhalten Stopp - Seiten einzuführen .

Every year when I pay my taxes , I always hope that government money will be used by predatory banks to enrich their executives at my expense !
And it looks like my hopes finally came true :
Citigroup Inc. , one of the biggest recipients of government bailout money , gave employees $ 5.33 billion in bonuses for 2008 , New York ’s attorney general said Thursday in a report detailing the payouts by nine big banks .
The report from Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ’s office focused on 2008 bonuses paid to the initial nine banks that received loans under the government ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program last fall .
Cuomo has joined other government officials in criticizing the banks for paying out big bonuses while accepting taxpayer money .
Citigroup , which is now one - third owned by the government as a result of the bailout , gave 738 of its employees bonuses of at least $ 1 million , even after it lost $ 18.7 billion during the year , Cuomo ’s office said .
[ via AP ]
Think that ’s bad ?
Check out the full statistics below of banks that received TARP bailout funds and the bonuses they handed out :
[ Graph via Rolfe Winkler ]
All totaled , over $ 34 billion in bonuses were given out by banks during the financial crisis , or even though the banks lost over $ 80 billion and took over $ 175 billion in federal bailout funds via the TARP program .
Bonuses thus constitute 20 % of the bailout money received and almost half of the banks loses during this period .
Yes , you read that correctly : Banks lost over 80 billion dollars , took over 175 billion dollars in taxpayer bailouts , and yet still handed out 34 billion dollars in corporate bonuses .
And to add salt in the wounds , Visa profits jumped 73 % the last quarter !
Who needs credit card reform or bank regulations anyway ?

` If this debacle does n’t wake up the British left , absolutely nothing will '
[ See also ``European election : ` An alarm is ringing ' -- time `to build the broadest possible left unity ''' . ]
By Phil Hearse
June 8 , 2009 -- Marxsite --
The outcome of the county council and European parliament elections means that the British left -- the left to the left of New Labour -- has to wake up and break out of its dire sectarian , bureaucratic and factional mindsets .
Nothing is more shameful than the lack of of united left slate , around a minimal set of demands in the interets of the working class , in these elections .
The near absence of the left from the electoral field was one important reason -- though far from the only one -- that such a large number of the protest votes against the main parties went to the hard - right United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) and the fascist British National Party ( BNP ) .
It is shameful that the left abandons so much of the electoral field to the far right because of nothing more than hardened , bone - headed , factional idiocy -- topped off by bureaucratic exclusions and anathemas .
There was of course the No2EU slate ( more on No2 EU here ) , supported by the Communist Party of Britain ( CPB ) and Socialist Party and promoted by Bob Crow and the National Union of Rail , Maritime and Transport Workers ( RMT ) .
This made some impact , but not much -- around about 1 % in most places .
It 's very unfortunate name gave rise to wrong impressions and in its headline -- although not of course its policies -- seemed indistinguishable from the UKIP .
But more than this , the No2EU was a temporary lash - up , a new name and not something easily recognisable and established , as a real political party or long - term electoral front has to be .
In London the Socialist Labour Party ( sole proprieter A. Scargill ) got 17,000 votes , nearly as many as No2EU .
Scargill is playing the role of a spoiler and disrupter of real left progress in elections by using big money at his disposition to continually stand a party that does not in reality exist .
But why did the ``SLP '' get this vote -- because of the name , Socialist Labour Party .
In the absence of a credible united left slate , the field is not just open to the right , but many of the left 's core voters vote for the Greens as the least bad credible alternative .
Everyone but the left and the working class benefits from what Sheumas Milne described last week in his Guardian column as ' a prostrate left ' .
In his recent article replying to Francois Sabado and Panos Garganas , British Socialist Workers Party ( SWP ) leader Alex Callinicos strikes a realistic note :
" I also express my disagreements in some humility : the disastrous recent experiences of the radical left in Britain do not exactly set up any of the participants in these catastrophes to preach to their comrades elsewhere in Europe . ''
Quite so : these disasters are the experience of the Socialist Alliance , Respect and the split in the Scottish Socialist Party .
I will not dwell here on the role played by the SWP in each of these disasters : that is something that has to be put behind us .
The SWP was not uniquely responsible for these disasters either .
The problem is that they have led to a scepticism and disillusionment among many people who went through these experiences .
The legacy of the failure of these projects is that starting again to build something unified on the left that can seriously intervene in elections will be a difficult job .
But there is no option but to attempt it , and rapidly before the general election .
If the UKIP coming second to the Tories in England and Wales and the election of two BNP Euro MPs does n't wake up the British left , nothing will .
Fairy stories
In the face of events like these there is a temptation to take refuge in fairy stories , and myth number one is that we are on the verge of a huge industrial upsurge that will dwarf elections in its importance .
We are not .
Elections of course are not the final arbiters of the political outcome of social struggles , but they play an enormous role in modern bourgeois democracies .
Without solid electoral intervention the left fights with one hand behind its back .
It would also be quite wrong to take a quietist and resigned attitude , noting that more or less every kind of left has done badly in Europe and mostly ( though not in France ) the far right has done well .
It 's true that it 's mainly the right who have gained from the appalling crisis of pro-neoliberal social democracy .
That is something that is not inevitable , nor is it irreversible , but the left has to analyse its basis and social meaning .
In the next couple of weeks we shall post a further article here on the reasons for the success of the right and hard right .
For the moment we should note that the push to the right will not be prevented by abandoning the electoral field of battle .
A further temptation would be to think that the rise of the hard right could be thwarted by anti-fascist mobilisations and a repeat of the 1970s Anti-Nazi League .
Anti-fascist mobilisation will continue to be important , but in the long term only an alternative that can appeal to significant section of disilusioned working class voters can prevent the rise of the right .
Pitfalls and obstacles
Left sectarianism is not the only problem that has to be fought to build a united electoral front .
Exclusions and anathemas , especially coming from sections of the trade union leaderships , are also a major problem .
Hostility towards the SWP has reached irrational levels , especially among former revolutionary leftists who now try to act as advisors to left bureaucrats .
The SWP has in may ways itself to blame for its bad reputation ; it has alientated plenty of people by high - handed and undemocratic practices .
This is a problem that will not be easily overcome .
But the SWP in England and Wales is easily the most important part of the far left and in the medium term the construction of a new left alliance must engage them .
This problem shows that the issue of democracy is not a secondary consideration but a sine quo non of successful alliances .
Right now the leadership of every part of the left - of - Labour left has to stop and think .
Calculations on the basis of a ``small capital '' basis , eagerly counting the number of new recruits and papers sold , hopelessly fails to meet the situation .
Left leaders have to start talking to one another , irrespective of past conflicts and prejudices .
The left has many activists and immense resources of talent , experience and political capacity .
But being stuck in the narcissistic bunker of narrow minds and narrow organisations wo n't make any impression on the national political map .
Of course the left faces an almost total ban on publicity in the national media , and indeed the right - wing domination of the media more generally .
But we start from where we are , not from where we would like to be .
We are much further behind where we ought to be in building a united left alternative .
We now have to rapidly build a new Alliance for Socialism .
It 'll be the first name on any ballot paper .

No2EU calls for unity to defeat the BNP
No2EU : Yes to Democracy coalition convener Bob Crow has called for urgent discussions involving socialist organisations , campaigns and trade unions to build a concerted response following the election of two fascists from the BNP to the European Parliament .
No2EU was the first progessive EU - critical coalition to stand in Britain in any election and it gained 153,236 votes despite an almost complete media blackout .
The combined vote in Thursday 's poll for No2EU , the Socialist Labour Party and some of the smaller left parties stacks up to nearly a third of a million votes -- just over 2 % of the total .
In Scotland , the combined left vote was close to 4 % .
Meanwhile , the Labour share of the vote has dropped by a massive 31 % , the Lib Dems by over 7 % and the Tories , despite all the hype , have only managed a tiny increase in share with turnout collapsing to just over 30 % .
Bob Crow said today :
" There is no question that the BNP have benefitted from the collapse of the establishment political parties and from media coverage that has pumped them up like celebrities on `I 'm a Nazi -- Get Me Out of Here . '
" Sections of the press , which have deliberately ignored anti-establishment parties from the left , need to take a long , hard look at the way the blanket coverage they have given to the fascists from the BNP has contributed to their success .
" But it 's the collapse of public support for the three main parties - each of which is pro-business , pro-EU and supportive of the anti-union laws -- which has created the conditions for the scapegoat - politics of the BNP to thrive .
" The fascists support in former mining communities like Barnsley is shocking and throws down a massive challenge to the Labour and Trade Union movement .
" Along with our colleagues from the SLP and other left groups we won nearly a third of a million votes .
From No2EU we won over 150,000 supporters from a standing start in the teeth of a media blackout .
That gives us a solid platform to build from .
" We now need urgent discussions with political parties , campaigns and our colleagues in other unions like the CWU to develop a political and industrial response to this crisis .
" I also want to pay tribute to our colleagues from the Hope Not Hate campaign .
There is no doubt that without their tireless efforts the BNP would have won even more seats , " he said .
An open letter to the left from the Socialist Workers Party : it ’s time to create a socialist alternative
June 10 , 2009 -- Socialist Worker --
Labour ’s vote collapsed to a historic low in last week ’s elections as the right made gains .
The Tories under David Cameron are now set to win the next general election .
The British National Party ( BNP ) secured two seats in the European parliament .
Never before have fascists achieved such a success in Britain .
The result has sent a shockwave across the labour and anti-fascist movements , and the left .
The meltdown of the Labour vote and the civil war engulfing the party poses a question — where do we go from here ?
The fascists pose a threat to working class organisations , black , Asian and other residents of this country — who BNP führer Nick Griffin dubs “ alien ” — our civil liberties and much else .
History teaches us that fascism can be fought and stopped , but only if we unite to resist it .
The SWP firmly believes that the first priority is to build even greater unity and resistance to the fascists over the coming months and years .
The BNP believes it has created the momentum for it to achieve a breakthrough .
We have to break its momentum .
The success of the anti-Nazi festival in Stoke and the numbers of people who joined in anti-fascist campaigning shows the basis is there for a powerful movement against the Nazis .
The Nazis ’ success will encourage those within the BNP urging a “ return to the streets ” .
This would mean marches targeting multiracial areas and increased racist attacks .
We need to be ready to mobilise to stop that occurring .
Griffin predicted a “ perfect storm ” would secure the BNP ’s success .
The first part of that storm he identified was the impact of the recession .
The BNP ’s policies of scapegoating migrants , black and Asian people will divide working people and make it easier to drive through sackings , and attacks on services and pensions .
Unity is not a luxury .
It is a necessity .
If we do not stand together we will pay the price for a crisis we did not cause .
The second lesson from the European elections is that we need a united fightback to save jobs and services .
If Cameron is elected he will attempt to drive through policies of austerity at the expense of the vast majority of the British people .
But the Tories ’ vote fell last week and they are nervous about pushing through attacks .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne told business leaders , “ After three months in power we will be the most unpopular government since the war . ”
We need to prepare for battle .
But there is a third and vital issue facing the left and the wider working class .
The crisis that has engulfed Westminster benefited the BNP .
The revelations of corruption , which cabinet members were involved in , were too much for many Labour voters , who could not bring themselves to vote for the party .
One answer to the problem is to say that we should swallow everything New Labour has done and back it to keep David Cameron , and the BNP , out .
Yet it would take a miracle for Gordon Brown to be elected back into Downing Street .
The danger is that by simply clinging on we would be pulled down with the wreckage of New Labour .
Mark Serwotka , the general secretary of the PCS civil service workers ’ union , has asked how , come the general election , can we ask working people to cast a ballot for ministers like Pat McFadden .
McFadden is pushing through the privatisation of the post office .
Serwotka proposes that trade unions should stand candidates .
Those who campaigned against the BNP in the elections know that when they said to people , “ Do n’t vote Nazi ” they were often then asked who people should vote for .
The fact that there is no single , united left alternative to Labour means there was no clear answer available .
The European election results demonstrate that the left of Labour vote was small , fragmented and dispersed .
The Greens did not make significant gains either .
The mass of Labour voters simply did not vote .
We can not afford a repeat of that .
The SWP is all too aware of the differences and difficulties involved in constructing such an alternative .
We do not believe we have all the answers or a perfect prescription for a left wing alternative .
But we do believe we have to urgently start a debate and begin planning to come together to offer such an alternative at the next election , with the awareness that Gordon Brown might not survive his full term .
One simple step would be to convene a conference of all those committed to presenting candidates representing working class interests at the next election .
The SWP is prepared to help initiate such a gathering and to commit its forces to such a project .
We look forward to your response .
Yours fraternally ,
Socialist Workers Party
Respect : BNP victory shows the need for broad left to work together
Statement on the European election results by councillor Salma Yaqoob , Respect party leader
June 8 , 2009 -- Respect --
The historic scale of Labour ’s defeat at the ballot box is evidence of the deep betrayal felt by those who once voted Labour in the hope of a fairer society .
The depth of disillusionment with the mainstream parties is underlined by the shocking breakthrough made by the BNP .
Labour is wholly to blame for its own crisis and has to take a large share of the responsibility for creating the conditions in which the far right is growing .
Labour loosened the rules that gave licence to greedy bankers to gamble away our jobs and homes .
Labour failed to protect our public services from wasteful and costly privatisation .
Labour has overseen growing inequality and a chronic shortage of affordable housing .
And Labour failed to tackle the scandal of MP ’s expenses .
Labour ’s failure to deliver for its core support has helped the BNP win votes in deprived white working - class communities .
Labour ’s determination not to be outflanked by the Tories on questions of race and immigration has created fertile ground for racist arguments to win support .
Too many BNP arguments have been legitimised by a political consensus that treats asylum seekers and immigrants as a criminal threat .
The BNP has fed on the growth in Islamophobia , egged on by a barrage of racist coverage in national newspapers .
Political ground was conceded to the BNP , and they have occupied it to devastating effect .
Labour has betrayed the hopes of millions of people who believe in a fairer and more equal society and those who believe in an ethical foreign policy based on peace and justice .
These election results are a warning of the potential scale of the drift to the right .
This right - wing threat cannot be confronted by conceding the argument in advance .
There is every practical and political reason for tackling the recession by extending state intervention , piling investment into a massive programme of house building , taxing the richest to support the big majority of the population through this recession .
But a recent survey showed that more than half the working population have seen a cut in pay , reductions in hours or a loss of employment benefits since the recession began .
While bankers and shareholders have been bailed out , millions of workers are paying for the economic crisis through lower pay , longer hours or unemployment .
The Tories , Labour , Lib Dems and UKIP are all competing with each other on who will push through the most ruthless cuts to public spending .
Giving ground to a right - wing consensus will not undercut the growth of right wing parties .
It will only encourage them .
It is now critical that the broadest swathes of the left and progressive opinion in this country work together to lever the political agenda in the opposite direction .
We need an alternative to failed free - market dogma .
We need an alternative to an electoral system that disenfranchises the millions of people who do n’t vote for the winning party and consigns whole geographical areas to be taken for granted .
And we need a reassertion of a politics embedded in principles of peace , social justice , equality and anti-racism .
The broad left must work together , irrespective of party affiliation , to maximise the impact of the progressive vote at the next general election .
I am proud of the contributions that Respect members made by supporting Green candidates in the West Midlands and North West .
In the North West , with BNP leader Nick Griffin on the brink of a breakthrough , the choice was surely clear .
For those who would not give their vote to Labour , the Green candidate – Peter Cranie – was more than a credible alternative .
A left - wing Green candidate , with a principled record of opposition to racism , deserved our support .
The results are in , and Peter Cranie was less than 5000 votes away from stopping Nick Griffin ’s election .
Yet almost 50,000 votes were cast for the Socialist Labour Party and No2EU .
Together they amounted to just 3 % of the vote – nowhere near enough to make a positive impact .
The plain fact is that had even a minority of that left - wing vote gone to the Greens we would not be waking up to the fact that the North West is sending a fascist to the European parliament .
If nothing else , these results should spark a renewed and more energetic discussion about bringing the broad left together around a common agenda for progressive change .
I will be speaking at the very timely Compass conference next weekend , and I look forward to discussing these and other issues with Labour and Green supporters .
I do not believe that the British public have become hostile to basic progressive policies on the responsibility of the state in providing decent housing , protecting jobs , and regulating the economy .
But the retreat of Labour from even a modest social democratic alternative has led to a lack of connection in the public mind between the effects of the recession and the neo-liberal policies responsible for it .
The manner in which Labour has vacated the traditional ground of the left has served to weaken any convincing notion of a political alternative to neoliberalism .
This has created a dangerous vacuum which is in danger of being filled by hate fuelled simplicities of the far right .
The challenge for the left is to renew itself and reassert some basic socialist critiques and solutions into mainstream political debate .
Respect will be doing everything we can to contribute to the renewal of a progressive and left - wing politics .
But we need to broaden our challenge to the failed parties .
There will be many who want to see the values of peace , civil liberties and social justice represented at the ballot box , and in a fairly elected parliament .
I encourage them to put themselves forward for consideration as candidates at the next general election .
We need each other and this country badly needs a political alternative of the left .
It is not beyond our ability to create this alternative .
There are lessons we can draw from the anti-war movement .
In a hostile climate and against formidable obstacles , a clear message , delivered with determination and organisational verve , was able to influence , shape and organise public opposition to war .
We need a similar ambition to ideologically and practically build resistance to neoliberalism and racism .
Declaration of Renunciation and Severance of U.S. Citizenship by Jeff Knaebel , Sovereign Individual of the Earth
This Declaration , made at New Delhi , India on 19 June 2009 , WITNESSETH :
To the people of this Earth , my fellow human beings , my brothers and sisters , in memory of Black Elk and Chief Joseph , and with special respect to the Grandmothers and Elders of all indigenous communities ,
I , Jeff Knaebel , hereby make this Declaration of Severance and Dissolution of all bonds between myself and the Government of the United States of America .
I renounce my birth certificate — I renounce my citizenship — and reject all claims of whatsoever nature made by the United States against me .
I am not government property , and I am not a criminal .
I am a peace - loving human being who is finished with being a slave to the Corporate Warfare State .
I am not a citizen of any Government .
I renounce all of them .
I hereby destroy my United States passport by which the United States government claims control of my movement upon this earth , and thus lays claim upon my right to exist .
I will place the shredded remains of my passport upon the monument of Mahatma Gandhi .
I have chosen this monument because it is a symbol that all mankind can recognize : of nonviolent resistance to immoral , corrupt , and violent Governments .
By this deliberate act of rebellion and sedition , I hope to free myself and alert mankind to the dangers it has created by obeying Governments of the world .
My refusal to remain a tax - compliant accomplice to State murder will be considered treason against the United States .
The choice is this , or treason against human life itself .
My life is not about supporting the cold - blooded murder of women and children .
No permission is required to renounce that which I never sought in the first place , for which I never entered a contract , and which is imposed upon me against my will .
Having declared myself not a citizen , I am therefore not a citizen .
Citizenship is either voluntary , or it is forcible slavery .

The United States government is incomprehensibly malevolent and destructive .
It takes our money , our identities , and our lives .
It gives us back corruption , war , heinous crime , and lies .
This government has no moral right to exist .
It ought to be abolished without further human bloodshed .
The Nation State is a criminal organization which must be opposed in its very concept .
It is impossible to reform a system that is built upon a foundation of lies and violence — one whose health and continuance depends upon endless war .
The system must be altogether abolished .
It is irredeemably evil .
The State represents a terminal disease of human consciousness that is anti-life , anti-ethics , and suicidal for the human species .
It is a sick addictive co-dependency between its citizens and parasitic lying murdering psychopathic politicians .
Blind obedience to incompetent , deceitful , violent and morally depraved authority is a clear case of mental disease .
Eckhart Tolle , Gopi Krishna and other morally advanced beings have diagnosed the United States government as pathologically criminally insane .
All political authority is arbitrary : arbitrary as to the form it takes ; arbitrary as to the boundaries it establishes ; arbitrary as to the limits of its jurisdiction ; and arbitrary as to the taxation it collects .
If one refuses to bow , to obey , to pay one ’s taxes , to use Government travel documents , one will ultimately be placed in jail , or die resisting arrest .
Even in its most equitable form , it is impossible for government to disassociate itself from evil .
The State has been conceived in violence and is maintained by lies and violence .
Its every act can only be criminal .
Unless the right to ignore the State is recognized , its citizens become tainted accomplices in its deeds .
From the most democratic to the most totalitarian form of government there is ultimately no difference among the powers they exercise .
The essence of the State is the threat and use of deadly force against those who choose not to comply with its edicts .

No Government rightfully owns the territory it monopolizes .
It has stolen possession of whatever land it lays claims to .
Everything it has , the State has stolen or plundered .
It prevents peaceful people from establishing their own voluntary cooperative economic and social relationships .
The purpose of assigning nationality is to control a mass of captive taxpayers in order to maintain the large military establishment required to keep a citizenry in a state of fearful submission to the Power Structure of money .
Why should a system of structurally compulsively violent political authority be preferred to a cooperative system in which human beings live according to the Natural Law of equal liberty ?
A coercive government has no legitimate authority over me .
None .
Its only authority comes through the barrel of a gun .
Is the arbitrary " legal " construct of the Corporate State more precious than life ?
Is this guns - and - steel lifeless structure more precious than living , breathing beings ?
This killing machine fabricated of cunning deceitful words of legally piggily on corporate parchment …
Are we living beings or abstract symbols to be manipulated by the Money Power ?
What is the " National Interest , " other than the transfer of wealth and influence to the power elite ?
What about humanity ’s interest ?
I write against the oblivion of humanity .
I act in quest of goodness , beauty and truth , that we may yet live .
I am not Government property .
I bid farewell to the United States Government and to the citizenship it has imposed upon me against my will .
I love life too much to be forced to participate in its murder .
The United States government is a stain upon humanity .
It is a grotesque distortion of human relations and the human conscience .
It is ugly beyond the power of words to describe .
Only its end product speaks clearly for what it is and what it does .
" Shock and Awe " death raining from the sky .
Children ’s blood flowing in the streets .
Body parts strewn across wedding festival grounds .
A human genome corrupted by depleted uranium and Agent Orange .
Hiroshima .
Los Alamos Lab .
The science of death versus the art of life .
Torture .
Rape .
Ecocide .
Endless heinous crime .
The most terrible Merchant of Death in human history .
Human species suicidal .
If you , people of the world , wish to support Government , then so be it .
But leave me alone .
As a peaceful individual I reject your authority imposed by violence .
I reject all Government claims of legitimacy .
You and your Government do not have the right to do the things that you do .
Foremost among these tax - and - public debt financed activities are the waging of war ; the conscription of soldiers ; and the expenditure of citizens bread labor upon armaments which by now can destroy our earth many times over .
I call for an end to these activities .
I will not support such activities with my life , my money , or my energy .
The laws of our natural world , the laws of the Great Spirit , the five precepts of the Buddha , are morally and practically superior to political laws .
You must not kill and I must not kill .
We must not support killing .
We must love our neighbors as we love ourselves .
As the Hopi have said , " From this one commandment , to respect and revere life , come all the other commandments : to tell the truth , to share with others , to life together in mutual support , to take care of our children and old people , the sick and strangers , friends and enemies , to abstain from intoxicants and adultery , not to cheat , steal , or covet . "
It is up to the individual to discern his duty to his fellowmen and to act accordingly .
No other can know my moral conscience , let alone " represent " it in decisions of war and peace .
How can another " represent " me in voting to murder children ?
The first duty of love is to do no harm .
Therefore my duty of love is to renounce the State , to withdraw from it , to quit it , to abandon it , to refuse to pay its taxes , to refuse participation in its charade of corporate money controlled elections , and to live my own life in search of truth and righteousness .
What do you do when you awaken to the awfulness of the lies of the State and the State of the lie ?
How does one negotiate with pathological liars ?
How does one come to peace with his tax payment hiring of cold - blooded murder for oil and money ?
Against whom , then , shall I commit treason ?
The brotherhood of man ?
My rational mind and common sense ?
My moral conscience ?
Or the United States government ?
I prefer treason against the arbitrarily imposed rule of an organized crime syndicate to treason against humanity .
To suffer in tax compliant silence the heinous crimes against humanity perpetrated by the United States would be to negate whatever is within me that can be called human .
The shredding of my government permission - to - exist documents is offered as a prayer that the government of the United States — perceived to be a criminal organization of incomprehensible scope — may be without bloodshed dissolved and abolished from this earth forever .

I no longer have a Government name ; I have no country , no travel papers , no passport , and no Government identification .
Under the law of every Government , I am an illegal human being .
Against this arbitrary " illegality " I claim my right to exist as a free and sovereign individual .
What man — or group of men — can declare another to be " illegal ? "
Such men , who cannot give life , would yet take it , as lying murderers in God ’s own temple .
For Power , there is no tomorrow .
There are no grandchildren .
Of the good earth , there is none .
There is only Power .
Persons who aspire to this are degraded , deranged , diseased .
We are insane to submit to rule by the depraved .
What shall be done with me ?
If deported to the United States , the Government will subject me to draconian penalties .
Having destroyed my passport , having renounced my citizenship , having made this Declaration , I have become a seditious rebel to the United States Government .
The United States will have no choice but to harass , persecute , and ultimately jail me for speaking truth to power .
On the one hand , the natural wish to live , to grow , to move about , to be free , to act as a man .
On the other hand , in order to live in this manner with the ordinary amenities of livelihood , I am forced by taxation to finance the murder of children who have a sacred right to life — innocent small children who cannot conceive of the wish to harm me .
There comes a time when the abuses are so great , the mindless destruction so wanton , the suffering so stupidly unnecessary , that one must resist the Power of rulership with his life .
I love Life too much to participate in its murder .
I bid you farewell , those who would remain in voluntary bondage .
Go about your life peacefully , respecting yourself , all others , and the earth upon which we live .
Remember that means is to end as seed is to tree .
A violent means can never produce a good end .
The truth shall set us free .
My efforts shall not have been in vain .
Right always overcomes might , even though I may not live to see the day .
Whatever happens to me , may you remember my message : Awaken from your slumber .
Realize that Government depends upon your consent .
You control yourself .
You can withdraw your consent .
We must recover Respect — for life , and for each other .
Civilizations that get off the Path of Respect do not last , because when a people get off the path , they also remove themselves from the circle of life .
My prayer is to love and to serve .
From my heart I seek to act in a good way , in a sacred way , for the benefit of many , in support of life , that the seventh generation of children may yet live and be happy .
The " why " of what I do is put completely to rest by the statement , " I love . "
The final answer to any question about my actions is " I love . "
What is the value of human life — this is the real question .

Chile peppers have long played an important role in the diets of Mesoamerican people .
Capsicum annuum is one of five domesticated species of chiles and is one of the primary components of these diets .
However , little is known regarding the original location of domestication of C. annuum and the genetic diversity in wild relatives .
Researchers have now found a large amount of diversity in individuals from the Yucatan Peninsula , making this a center of diversity for chiles .
Without the process of domestication , humans would still be hunters and gatherers , and modern civilization would look very different .
Fortunately , for all of us who do not relish the thought of spending our days searching for nuts and berries , early civilizations successfully cultivated many species of animals and plants found in their surroundings .
Current studies of the domestication of various species provide a fascinating glimpse into the past .
A recent article by Dr. Seung - Chul Kim and colleagues in the June 2009 issue of the American Journal of Botany explores the domestication of chiles .
These hot peppers , found in everything from hot chocolate to salsa , have long played an important role in the diets of Mesoamerican people , possibly since as early as ~8000 B.C. Capsicum annuum is one of five domesticated species of chiles and is notable as one of the primary components , along with maize , of the diet of Mesoamerican peoples .
However , little has been known regarding the original location of domestication of C. annuum , the number of times it was domesticated , and the genetic diversity present in wild relatives .
To answer these questions , Dr. Kim and his team examined DNA sequence variation and patterns at three nuclear loci in a broad selection of semiwild and domesticated individuals .
Dr. Kim et al. found a large amount of diversity in individuals from the Yucatan Peninsula , making this a center of diversity for chiles and possibly a location of C. annuum domestication .
Previously , the eastern part of central Mexico had been considered to be the primary center of domestication of C. annuum .
On the basis of patterns in the sequence data , Dr. Kim et al. hypothesize that chiles were independently domesticated several times from geographically distant wild progenitors by different prehistoric cultures in Mexico , in contrast to maize and beans which appear to have been domesticated only once .
Geographical separation among cultivated populations was reflected in DNA sequence variation .
This separation suggests that seed exchange among farmers from distant locations is not significantly influencing genetic diversity , in contrast to maize and beans seeds , which are traded by farmers across long distances .
Less genetic diversification was seen in wild populations of C. annuum from distant locales , perhaps as a result of long - distance seed dispersal by birds and mammals .
Across the three loci studied , Dr. Kim and colleagues found an average reduction in diversity of 10 % in domesticated individuals compared with the semiwild individuals .
Domesticated chiles in traditional agricultural habits , however , harbor unique gene pools and serve as important reservoirs of genetic diversity important for conserving biodiversity .
This work was conducted primarily by Araceli Aguilar - Meléndez as her dissertation project under the guidance of Drs. Kim and Mikeal Roose in the Department of Botany and Plant Sciences at the University of California at Riverside .
The research was supported by the University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States ( UC MEXUS ) , El Coneso Nacional de Ciencia y Technología ( CONACYT ) , and a gift from the McIlhenny Company .
Aguilar - Meléndez , Kim , and their colleagues plan to continue research on this remarkably variable and economically important spice in Mesoamerica .
When the Guardian launched its Comment is free threads , it was one of the most exciting developments in journalism I had ever witnessed .
Suddenly , everyone could play .
Columnists and leader writers were no longer the voice of God : they could be immediately challenged , corrected , held to account .
People with something to say could say it , expertise from every field and every part of the world was harnessed .
The early discussions were invigorating , fascinating , thrilling .
They forced me to smarten up my act , to try to close the gaps in my thinking , to consider the argument more carefully before setting it out .
It seemed like an exercise in mutual education : a Frierian teach - in of the kind that I am too young to have experienced , but which always seemed to me to have been the way to go .
There is still something of this in the threads : whenever I have the stomach to read all the way through them I find a few comments which teach me something new , introduce me to interesting stories and links , or force me to challenge and reconsider the things I have said .
But such posts increasingly look like gems among dross .
On the Guardian 's environment site in particular , and to a lesser extent on threads across the Guardian 's output , considered discussion is being drowned in a tide of vituperative gibberish .
A few hundred commenters appear to be engaged in a competition to reach the outer limits of stupidity .
They post so often and shout so loudly that intelligent debate appears to have fled from many threads , as other posters have simply given up in disgust .
I 've now reached the point at which I can't be bothered to read beyond the first page or so of comments .
It is simply too depressing .
The pattern , where environmental issues are concerned , is always the same .
You can raise any issue you like , introduce a dossier of new information , deploy a novel argument , drop a shocking revelation .
The comments which follow appear almost to have been pre-written .
Whether or not you mentioned it , large numbers will concentrate on climate change – or rather on denying its existence .
Another tranche will concentrate on attacking the parentage and lifestyle of the author .
Very few address the substance of the article .
I believe that much of this is native idiocy : the infantile blathering of people who have no idea how to engage in debate .
Many of the posters appear to have fallen for the nonsense produced by professional climate change deniers , and to have adopted their rhetoric and methods .
But it is implausible to suppose that this is all that 's going on .
As I documented extensively in my book Heat , and as sites like DeSmogBlog and Exxonsecrets show , there is a large and well - funded campaign by oil , coal and electricity companies to insert their views into the media .
They have two main modes of operating : paying people to masquerade as independent experts , and paying people to masquerade as members of the public .
These fake " concerned citizens " claim to be worried about a conspiracy by governments and scientists to raise taxes and restrict their freedoms in the name of tackling a non-existent issue .
This tactic is called astroturfing .
It 's a well - trodden technique , also deployed extensively by the tobacco industry .
You pay a public relations company to create a fake grassroots ( astroturf ) movement , composed of people who are paid for their services .
They lobby against government attempts to regulate the industry and seek to drown out and discredit people who draw attention to the issues the corporations want the public to ignore .
Considering the lengths to which these companies have gone to insert themselves into publications where there is a risk of exposure , it is inconceivable that they are not making use of the Guardian 's threads , where they are protected by the posters ' anonymity .
Some of the commenters on these threads have been paid to disseminate their nonsense , but we have no means , under the current system , of knowing which ones they are .
Two months ago I read some comments by a person using the moniker scunnered 52 , whose tone and content reminded me of material published by professional deniers .
I called him out , asking " Is my suspicion correct ?
How about providing a verifiable identity to lay this concern to rest ? "
I repeated my challenge in another thread .
He used distraction and avoidance in his replies , but would not answer or even address my question , which gave me the strong impression that my suspicion was correct .
So what should we do to prevent these threads from becoming the plaything of undisclosed corporate interests ?
My view is that everyone should be free to say whatever they want .
I have never asked for a comment to be removed , nor will I do so .
I believe that the threads should be unmoderated , except to protect the Guardian from Britain 's ridiculous libel laws .
But I also believe that everyone who comments here should be accountable : in other words that the rest of us should be able to see who they are .
By hiding behind pseudonyms , commenters here are exposed to no danger of damaging their reputations by spouting nonsense .
Astroturfers can adopt any number of identities , perhaps posting under different names in the same thread .
We have no idea whether we are reading genuine views or corporate propaganda .
There is also an asymmetry here : you know who I am ; in fact some people on these threads seem to know more about me than I do .
But I have no idea who I am arguing with .
Some people object that verifiable identities could expose posters to the risk of being traced and attacked .
This is nonsense .
I make no secret of my whereabouts and attract more controversy than almost anyone on these pages , but I have never felt at risk , even when , during the first few months of the Iraq war , I received emails threatening to kill , torture and mutilate me almost every day .
For all the huffing and puffing in cyberspace , people simply do n't care enough to take it into the real world .
So how could it best be done ?
Amazon prevents people from reviewing their own work by taking credit card numbers from anyone who wants to post .
Is this the right way to go , or is there a better way of doing it ?
What do you think ?

And while I do n't think they 're at all right to be morally outraged , I do think they 're right to be afraid .
I think the act of looking at religion as just another hypothesis about the way the world works -- and asking it to defend itself with evidence and logic just like any other hypothesis -- is a radical act .
All by itself , completely apart from any of the specific arguments against religion 's accuracy and morality .
The mere act of shoving religion into the marketplace of ideas , and expecting it to fight it out with all the other ideas about why things are the way they are ...
I think people who are deeply attached to religion have every reason to be afraid of that .
I think that act has more potential to eventually dismantle religious beliefs than any of the specific arguments leveled against those beliefs .
But Senor McGenocide
Pants is n't alone .
A lot of religious believers are very angry and very upset over the fact that atheists are starting to speak out : not just expressing our own opinions and theories , but seriously criticizing theirs .
That 's the modern atheist movement , all right .
Trying to destroy all that is holy by , you know , arguing .
By trying to convince people that religion is mistaken .
By writing books , and blogging , and going on TV , and such .
Of course , this was the same guy who later tried to defend biblical atrocities by arguing that genocide and the infanticide of one 's enemies were , in some cases , morally defensible .
Thus earning him our household nickname " Senor McGenocide Pants . "
So it 's a little hard to take him seriously .
" What evidence do you have to support that ? "
As Richard Dawkins pointed out in a recent Free Inquiry article , the kind of critical language that 's considered shockingly offensive when it 's applied to religion is n't even blinked at when it 's applied to , say , political discourse or restaurant reviews .
But many believers are very serious about this .
Example : A recent visitor to my blog accused me of trying to force my atheism down everyone 's throat .
When I challenged him to find one place -- just one -- on my blog where I advocated forcing atheism on anyone , he replied that I was " trying to cow others into your restrictive view " and " forcing a materialistic , Godless view onto others by claiming that you know there is no God . "
Right .
The act of stating my opinion in public is the same as forcing that view onto others .
I do n't , in fact , claim that I know there is no God , but never mind that now .
I am cowing people into my narrow view through the awesome power of my blog .
Which is read by hundreds of people every day !
HUNDREDS , I tell you !
Flee before me , puny earthlings !
Look on my works , ye mighty , and despair !
I will cow you with the force of my opinions !
Resistance is futile , you will be assimilated into my materialist Godless view ; for while you may have the infinite power of the Almighty God on your side ...
I WIELD THE BLOG !

The thing is this .
When you start examining religion closely , you realize that it has a large number of very effective protective layers : tropes and memes that not only perpetuate it but that defend it , and that defend it not just against criticism but against the very idea that criticism is legitimate .
When non-believers talk about religion getting a free ride in our society and in the marketplace of ideas , these tropes are a big part of what we 're talking about .
A few examples :
1. Religious faith -- i.e. , believing in God despite the lack of evidence supporting the idea , despite the idea being inherently and by definition undemonstrable -- is not only acceptable , but virtuous .
Faith makes you a good person .
1a .
A subset of that one : Holding strong , passionate religious beliefs is by itself a good thing , and being a " person of faith " is an admirable trait , one you have to give at least grudging respect to ... regardless of what those beliefs are , regardless of whether they 're demonstrably untrue or demonstrably harmful .
1b . And a converse of that one : People with less spiritual faith -- or who deny spirituality altogether -- are cynical , untrusting , selfish , and / or lost .
After all , a person 's soul or spirit is the most central and important part of them , the part that makes them who they are , and denying it means denying your truest self .
2. Letting go of doubts and questions about your faith is an act of love and trust that will make your life easier -- and again , an act that makes you a virtuous person .
3 . The more apparently paradoxical or irrational a religious belief is , the more special it is to accept and believe it .
( The mysteriousness and paradoxy of the Trinity is , for many believers in it , one of the things that makes it magnificent ; and for some observant Jews , the very irrationality of dietary laws is what makes them a serious test of faith . )
4 . Faith is just a different way of knowing , separate from evidence or reason .
4a . Religion and science operate in different realms .
The spiritual realm is by its very nature beyond questions of evidence , and expecting it to stand up to inquiries based on evidence and reason is absurd .
5 . Religious leaders and teachers , such as priests , ministers , rabbis , etc. , should be given an extra level of social respect and deference .
( We see how well this one worked out in the Catholic priesthood pedophilia scandal ... )
6 . The objects connected with religion -- books , relics , devotional items , etc. -- should be given an extra level of respect and deference , greater than that of other historical or art objects .
7. Questioning people 's religion , and pointing out inaccuracies / inconsistencies / immoralities with it , is a heretical crime , punishable by exile , imprisonment , torture , or death .
8. Questioning people 's religion , and pointing out inaccuracies / inconsistencies / immoralities with it , is rude and intolerant , whether it 's done at the dinner table or in the op ed columns .
9 . Being tolerant of other people 's religion requires that you not criticize it .
And that 's not even a complete list .
That 's just what I came up with in an hour on a Saturday night .
If you accept and practice a religion , many of these ideas may seem self - evident .
But if you are a believer , I 'd like to ask you to step back from the tropes for a moment and see them from the outside , the way a non -believer would , or even simply someone who 's not sure what they believe .
Because if you do n't already start with the premise that God exists and religion is true , these tropes do n't look like self - evident truths .
They look like self - perpetuating protective layers that exist to shield religion from the necessity of defending itself against inquiries into its accuracy , consistency , and / or morality .
Look at them carefully .
The tropes are n't arguments for why religion is right .
They 're rationalizations for why religion should n't have to prove that it 's right , escape hatches for when it 's backed into a corner .
These tropes are , as you may have noticed , extremely circular .
And while that circularity is excruciatingly frustrating for anyone engaging in debate with a believer … well , that 's kind of the point , is n't it ?
The circular , self - justifying nature of these protective layers , while it makes them logically absurd , also makes them extremely resistant to logic , or to evidence .
And that 's why the very act of questioning religion -- of saying , " Okay , if you 're such a great and true idea , prove yourself " -- may be the single most important thing atheists are doing .
The act of asking --
" Is the emperor wearing any clothes ? "
" It sure does n't look like he 's wearing any clothes -- can you show me some evidence that he is ? "
" Invisible clothes -- that does n't seem to make sense .
Can you give me a good argument for why it does ? "
-- is , I think , even more powerful and more radical than simply saying , " The emperor has no clothes ! "
After all , if all atheists are saying is , " The emperor has no clothes ! " ... that 's just another opinion .
Another belief , in the great tapestry of beliefs about the magnificent and ultimately unknowable mystery of the emperor 's invisible garments .
And thus , it 's a lot easier to ignore .
But if what we 're saying is , " Is the emperor wearing any clothes ?
Can you show me some evidence that he 's wearing clothes ?
Can you give me a rational argument supporting the idea of invisible clothes ? " ... that changes the entire conversation .
It seriously chips away at the self - protective tropes to ask questions like these :
Why is faith -- believing in a supernatural entity for which there 's no evidence -- a good thing ?
Why is it a good thing to let go of questions and doubts about the supernatural entity ?
Why do the paradoxes and irrationalities in supernatural beliefs make those beliefs more special , when paradoxes and irrationalities in any other opinions undercut them ?
If people are really knowing and perceiving a real supernatural entity , how does that work -- and why do different people perceive that entity in such radically different and contradictory ways ?
If the supernatural entity acts on and interacts with the physical world , why should n't that be an observable phenomenon with results we can rationally investigate ?
Why should books and objects connected with a supernatural belief -- and people whose job it is to explain their supernatural belief to others -- deserve any more respect and deference than anybody or anything else ?
And why is asking questions and expressing disagreement with opinions about the supernatural entity any more rude or intolerant than asking questions and expressing disagreement with political or artistic opinions ?
All of these questions weaken the armor -- the automatic deference , the " get out of jail free " cards , the exemption from the rules that everyone else has to play by -- and bring religion back down to earth , to the level of any other hypothesis about why the world is the way it is , with the same rules of what constitutes evidence and morality and a good argument .
Where it does n't stand a chance .
Without all this protective shielding and special privileging , religion comes down to a hypothesis that an invisible supernatural entity brought all of the physical world into existence by magic ; shapes the progress of that world in invisible magical ways we can't perceive ; cares deeply about people but nevertheless fails to protect us from terrible suffering and often brings about that suffering on his / her / its own ; and will let us live forever in a state of bliss after we die , as long as we act according to the right set of wildly differing opinions about him / her / it .
And the only evidence we have for any of this is the evidence inside our own brains , and inside other people 's brains , and in the brains of people who wrote down their opinions in books hundreds or thousands of years ago .
It does n't stand a chance .
I could be wrong about that .
After thousands of years , you 'd think some convincing evidence for God would have come up by now ... but maybe it still will , and if it does , I 'll accept it .
And maybe the " you get to live forever if you do the right thing " trope is compelling enough to survive even without any evidence supporting it .
But I tend to doubt it .
I think that , if atheists succeed in stripping it of its self - protective armor , the God hypothesis will eventually dwindle into memory and history .
That 's not to say Senor McGenocide Pants is right .
Questioning religion and expressing disagreement with it does n’t force atheism down anyone 's throat .
But it does force religion to stand on its own feet and prove itself .
What I do n't understand is why that 's a bad thing .
Thanks to Daylight Atheism , in whose comment thread I developed these ideas ( as well as the " puny earthlings " rant ) .
And thanks to Daniel Dennet , who write a lot about religion 's self - protective tropes in " Breaking the Spell . "

British troops wounded in Afghanistan are enduring lengthy delays before receiving hospital treatment because of a shortage of helicopters , senior army surgeons have claimed .
Medics in Helmand province , where another soldier died yesterday , said a lack of British aircraft meant that bringing out wounded soldiers takes twice as long as when injured American soldiers were evacuated in Vietnam 40 years ago .
An experienced combat surgeon revealed that the lack of helicopters meant UK forces would find it " impossible " to transport their wounded if they did not have access to US Black Hawks .
One said that up to 50 % of all British " casevacs " - casualty evacuations - use American helicopters .
The surgeon , who asked for anonymity , also revealed that the Royal Army Medical Corps and senior military figures had been asking for a dedicated fleet of medevac helicopters since 2007 , but their pleas have been rejected by Whitehall .
Only two British helicopters , at most , are reserved for attending to wounded soldiers , according to medics , which is not enough to cover the battlefield of Helmand .
According to the Ministry of Defence , the average time from injury to handover at a field hospital is one hour 45 minutes , or an hour and 29 minutes for the most severe casualties .
In Vietnam , American troops arrived at hospital within 45 minutes , most of them within 25 .
Reports from surgeons currently based in Helmand to military colleagues have revealed the intensity of opposition facing UK forces .
They show that the major field hospital in Helmand , at Camp Bastion , has been using almost four times more blood for transfusions - 42 units a day - than an average general hospital .
Major Mike Taylor , medical liaison officer at Task Force Helmand , said helicopters are available 24/7 to evacuate wounded personnel .
He said that during current operations , there had never been an occasion where a clinical timeline to get a patient the treatment they required had been missed .
Amid increasing casualties , the MoD is to go to the court of appeal on Tuesday in a bid to overturn rulings that two injured troops should have their compensation increased following complications after initial medical treatment .
Other wounded soldiers could be in line for higher payouts if the appeal is unsuccessful .
• The MoD confirmed the death of another soldier in Helmand yesterday , the 20th to have died in southern Afghanistan this month .
The latest fatality , from the 40th Regiment Royal Artillery , died while on a vehicle patrol north of Lashkar Gah .
( CNN ) --
On July 23 , 1969 , as Apollo 11 hurtled back towards Earth , there was a problem -- a problem only a kid could solve .
At age 10 , Greg Force reaches his arm into a tiny hole to fix an antenna crucial to Apollo 11 .
It sounds like something out of a movie , but that 's what it came down to as Apollo 11 sped back towards Earth after landing on the moon in 1969 .
It was around 10:00 at night on July 23 , and 10 - year - old Greg Force was at home with his mom and three brothers .
His father , Charles Force , was at work .
Charles Force was the director of the NASA tracking station in Guam , where the family was living .
The Guam tracking station was to play a critical role in the return of Apollo 11 to Earth .
A powerful antenna there connected NASA communications with Apollo 11 , and the antenna was the only way for NASA to make its last communications with the astronauts before splashdown .
But at the last minute on that night , a bearing in the antenna failed , rendering it nearly useless .
To properly replace the bearing would have required dismantling the entire antenna , and there was simply no time .
So Charles Force thought of a creative solution :
If he could get more grease around the failed bearing , it would probably be fine .
The only problem was , nobody at the station had an arm small enough to actually reach in through the two - and - a - half inch opening and pack grease around the bearing .
And that 's when Greg was called in to save the day .
Charles Force sent someone out to his home to pick up Greg .
Once at the tracking station , Greg reached into the tiny hole and packed grease around the failed bearing .
It worked , and the station was able to successfully complete its communications role in the mission .
Apollo 11 splashed down safely the next day .
At the time , Greg did n't think what he was doing was a big deal , and 40 years later , he 's still modest about his role in the mission .
" That 's all I did , was put my hand in and put grease on it , " he says .
If he had n't been there , NASA would not have been able to make its last communications with the mission before splashdown , but Greg says " it was n't life or death , [ from ] my understanding . "
" My dad explained to me why it was important , " he says , " but it kind of caught me by surprise afterwards , all the attention . "
iReport.com : Read Greg 's firsthand account
That attention came from the media and even the astronauts themselves .
Greg 's small but important part in Apollo 11 was a story told by news outlets around the world .
He even got a nice thank - you note from Neil Armstrong , whom he met when Armstrong went on a tour of NASA stations with the other astronauts to thank the staff after the mission .
" To Greg , " reads the note , which Armstrong wrote on a newspaper clipping of Greg 's story , " with thanks for your help on Apollo 11 .
Neil Armstrong . "
Perhaps not surprisingly , like many other kids who grew up during the Apollo era , Greg dreamed of becoming an astronaut .
He says he remembers visiting his dad 's office to listen to astronauts communicating with NASA officials on the ground .
" We could sit and listen to the actual communication with the astronauts as it was happening , and it was hard to understand , but I loved to do that , " he says .
" On Guam we did n't have good television coverage , so I think I listened to the [ moon ] landing on the radio .
To me it was a huge thing . "
Greg pursued his dreams of space exploration all the way through college , where he majored in physics .
Unfortunately , he was unable to pass the vision test for the space program because of his colorblindness , but even that could n't squelch his interest .
Greg went on to get his pilot 's license , and even though his career now as a gymnastics school owner is n't exactly space - related , he says that " ever since then , I 've followed the space program . "
And as a lover of space exploration , Greg hopes to see more missions to the moon .
" I think it would be an important step as far as going further , like to Mars , " he says .
" I would love to see us go back to the moon . "
But for now , on the 40th anniversary of the moon landing , he can remember the small but crucial role he played in bringing Apollo 11 home safely .
" It kind of caught me by surprise , " he says , " but I 'm real proud to have been even a little tiny part of it . "

Phone freaks surely know about the Palm Pre , the first device to truly give Apple 's iPhone a run for its money .
And if AT&T 's network and service keeps sucking , you may see many more of these sexy mobile phones , available on Sprint 's service , around town .
The Pre has a hidden Dev Mode , which allows it to be connected to another computer running the Palm Mojo SDK to create new applications .
Nerdy stuff .
But what 's even more nerdy / cool is how this mode is unlocked .
Run this hidden app by typing “ upupdowndownleftrightleftrightbastart . ”
Does n't that code look familiar ?
You wo n't get 30 extra lives , but you could f*ck up your phone if you do n't know what you 're doing .
I wonder if there are any Contra fans in the Palm offices .

Wed 10 June 2009 | tags : design frameworks rest
This post is the third part of continuing series of articles on REST .
The first one was Why REST ?
and the next one was REST is the DBMS of the internet with hopefully some more to follow in the coming weeks .
Struts , Django , Ruby on Rails .
We 've worked with these and many other similar frameworks .
Some time back I started thinking of what would a completely new ground up REST / Resource oriented framework would look like ( ground up to ensure it had no legacy design to deal with ) .
Would such frameworks be similar to the ones dominantly used today ?
What about the ecosystem that surrounds and interacts with them ( client libraries ) ?
And finally what about the implications on the fine grained object model ( assuming there is one ) and its relationship with the resource model ?
This post deals with some of the thoughts .
There are some specifics the post does not address and is agnostic about :
Language : I shall be avoiding language issues as much as possible .
Wherever I do bring in code constructs these may be assumed to be in Java ( or pseudo - Java )
Convention or Configuration : I think both are valid choices in their appropriate contexts , and I do n't specifically emphasise one over the other in this post
The frameworks mentioned above are not the only ones out there .
There are many , and some actually are very REST specific eg.
Apache CXF JAX - RS or Restlet .
It would certainly be interesting to contrast my thoughts with these , but for reasons of insufficiently detailed knowledge about them , I shall choose to skip it ( better to not make any statements than making incorrect ones ) .
I shall be assuming a HTTP connector with GET , PUT , POST and DELETE as the constant set of operations .
These four operations shall be collectively referred to as Resource Operations .
We shall first start with the server side characteristics , and the term ROF shall refer to a Resource Oriented ( server side ) Framework
A ROF will have a resource oriented interface : Certainly not a profound statement , but it was important to lay that down upfront .
So what is a Resource Oriented Interface .
Given a particular resource , a Resource Oriented Software will support or consume end points which allow you GET , PUT , POST or DELETE the resource .
There is one reason why this particular constraint is relaxed just a little bit .
Modern browsers do not support all the four methods easily eg DELETE and make it just slightly hard to use the PUT method .
Hence these methods can also be invoked by using a URI segment containing the method name eg. delete .
A ROF will have an abstraction to represent a resource as an end point : Again , that seems to be pretty obvious .
But there is a reason why I make it explicitly .
In many situations we see controllers acting as end points .
To the extent a controller acts as an abstraction for a resource end point which essentially only has the resource operations as public methods , it would fit this requirement .
However if I was using an Order as a resource and if I introduced an approve method on the OrderController that would not be consistent with this requirement .
That would need to be modelled as an OrderApproval resource which may on successful completion , effect a state change on the Order resource to the status ' approved ' .
This is where a potential differences with conventional frameworks arise .
If I was to think of it from an EJB like perspective , I would model a OrderController as a Session bean and a Order as an entity bean .
In case of lightweight POJO based model , I would have an OrderController as the endpoint exposed by say using Struts and model the Order as a entity POJO and map it to the database using Hibernate .
In other non java frameworks , I would have a class to represent an OrderController and another one to represent the order along ActiveRecord pattern .
But I would argue this separation is not entirely necessary , since what we want is something that implements a single abstraction mapping onto a Resource which also support the primarily lifecycle methods or resource operations of GET , PUT , POST and DELETE .
But there is an issue to be worked through here .
These resource operations are actually class level and not object level methods .
Thus if we have an abstraction to represent the resource instance , the class level methods cannot be defined in the same class except as class level ( static ) methods .
This is a tricky problem , and I would submit the designer may make one of two choices ( a ) Implement the resource operations as class level methods on the Resource abstraction ( ie . they will get or return the resource references as method parameters and not rely on the ' this ' or ' self ' qualifier for getting access to the resource variables or ( b ) Implement the resource operations as methods on a separate one - to - one mapped class on the resource abstraction ( eg. an OrderHome in case of an EJB like analogy )
Given consistent expectations of the Resource Operations these will actually be auto- magically implemented :
Thats a bit of a turnaround from what I was just describing in the earlier paragraph .
What I mean to suggest is that the class level methods I just referred to will be implemented within the framework .
What the framework will allow are plugins to provide extended functionality at specific points .
Thus a " public static Order Order.put( Order order ) " method will be implicitly implemented by the framework .
But before a put can be processed it needs to be validated .
Thus the framework will allow the developer to plug in / override his own implementation for an Order.validate ( Order order ) .
There are multiple ways such plug-ins could be implemented .
Depending upon the nature of abstraction , it could be an overridden method as I just described , or it could be a standalone method that is registered into the overall workflow ( either through convention or configuration ) .
The latter might be especially useful in case one wants to implement the functionality as stand alone methods or in case of functional programming languages .
The plugin points provided could be framework specific .
eg ,
One may want to validate a resource for consistency even at it is being read from the database .
For the rest of the post I shall refer to these as plugins .
In addition , framework will most certainly provide methods for for downstream handling of impact of PUT , POST or DELETE .
This is covered in the next point .
In case the framework chooses to not deal with persistence , it may choose to allow capabilities for integration with other persistence frameworks .
A ROF will provide capabilities to a developer to override or register methods to handle downstream impact of PUT , POST and DELETE : Before I get into the details of this , I encourage you to take a look at my earlier post REST is the DBMS of the internet in case you have not already done so .
To summarise it quickly , I have drawn the analogy that a REST based system is like a DBMS where client applications can perform direct SQL such as SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE ( GET , PUT , POST , DELETE in case of HTTP / REST ) on the Tables ( Resources in case of REST ) , and the business logic is implemented as triggers .
Thus the framework will need to allow the developer to define such triggers .
Such methods will need to support ability to reject the request ( in case of downstream validation failures ) , and update the resource state ( to reflect the appropriate resource state after the completion of the downstream processing ) .
It is also feasible to imagine scenarios where such methods are triggered asynchronously .
Much of the logic of the traditional controllers which controlled interactions across multiple objects etc. is likely to now be shifted into these methods .
I have no particularly good name for such methods .
They could be referred to as triggers , event or message handlers , glue methods , extension points etc .
For the rest of this post I shall refer to these methods specifically as ' handlers ' .
Note that the actual invocations to select , insert , update , delete the resource are NOT to be programmed by the developer .
These are automatically handled by the framework .
The developer essentially fills in the necessary logic to the plugin methods ( eg. Order.validate ) or handlers ( eg. Order.onCreate )
A ROF will provide a mechanism to describe or map a resource abstraction to to the actual programming constructs :
There are a number of ways this could be achieved .
XML , YAML , DSL , Annotation - take your pick .
Also the actual class could be defined ( as in case of a POJO ) and the resource characteristics mapped onto it , or the class may manifest itself at runtime based on metaprogramming around the metadata .
Sample possibilities here are Hibernate like Resource - to - Object - to - Relation mapping ( using either Annotations or XML ) or a a completely metaprogrammed ActiveResource .
One important aspect that the framework will need to cover is the situations where a Resource is a composite of many or partial underlying business objects .
eg. an Order resource instance could theoretically span one Order instance and many OrderItem instances .
Thus a one to one relationship between a resource and underlying business objects ( or datastructures ) is not assumed .
What is assumed is that the framework will allow such relationships to be described or introspected .
A ROF will allow resources to be mapped onto URI or URI segments :
This is too obvious an requirement to be explained and is mentioned here only for completeness .
A ROF will allow foreign keys across resources which manifest themselves as URIs to be mapped onto the underlying business object references : Resources refer to each other through URIs .
The underlying business objects refer to each other through object references .
Given the resource descriptions and URI mappings , the framework should allow for a transparent referencing / dereferencing between such URIs and the object references .
A ROF will allow factory methods for locating or allow injection of other resources / business objects :
Within the handler functions , developers will need references to the associated resources or business objects .
I say resources or business objects , since the developer may choose to interact with these at a coarse grained ( resource ) or fine grained ( business object ) level .
The framework should allow the necessary support for such activities .
A ROF may provide additional support for typical aspects of lifecycle ( eg. validation ) :
While I mentioned validate as a possible plugin function .
However given the omnipresence of validations , the framework may provide additional support for such activities .
Thus the framework may choose to automatically implement such capabilities using the resource descriptions .
A ROF may provide capabilities for domain specific extension of resource capabilities : Certain domains have standardised mechanisms of working with resources .
As an example most banking systems based on the four eyes principle require approval activities .
While this particular aspect is much tougher than it seems , a ROF may choose to allow extension of such capabilities using template like functions or mix ins .
As an example in this situation , once an Order resource is defined , an OrderApproval resource will be automatically made available as will the GET and PUT methods on it ( POST and DELETE in this particular case may not be relevant ) , as will the necessary and appropriate handler functions on OrderApproval .
A ROF will provide capabilities for automatically generating the resource representation from the resource and vice - versa : Resources manifest themselves in multiple possible formats eg. XML , JSON etc .
An ROF will allow such transformations between the representation and the resource / business object instance automatically .
A ROF will provide capabilities for assembling more complex representations using templates :
In many situations , especially when the representations are being composed for manual ( browser based ) consumption , additional resources may need to be pulled into a view .
A ROF will allow for such assembly of resources to be composed into a final view using templates .
A ROF will allow for introduction of appropriate additional URIs in views using templates :
Thanks to HATEOAS ( I 've really avoided it thus far :) ) , the framework will need to allow some mechanism of describing what are the additional context specific URIs to be included in the final representation .
The template logic should allow the developer to specify such URIs .
A ROF should allow for the resource / media - type descriptions to be shipped in band with the resource representation :
Since REST allows media types to be auto discovered and auto described , the framework should allow for the metadata for such media types to be also presented to the client .
While I think it is essential that such in band information should be conveyed on demand , the framework may also optionally support upfront interrogation for media types and their details , which will require such information to be shipped out of band as well .
I am not aware of any specific standards around such interrogation APIs so the framework could implement a custom API for the same .
The actual metadata could be represented using any of the typical appropriate standards such as RDFa , XML Schema snippets etc .
A ROF should optionally allow support for auto generation of bindings for clients :
I really really cringe as I write this .
I cringe because to me the great attraction of REST is the simplicity and the ease of introducing incremental integration .
The client binding generation ( especially if it is statically generated ) flies in the face of many accepted lightweight design scenarios .
However I think there are likely to be some situation where availability of such client side bindings would be helpful .
When possible ( eg. with dynamically typed , metaprogramming capable languages like Python or Ruby ) , such bindings should be dynamic .
In such cases the client can automatically introspect the server side media types and make available the necessary client side objects on the fly .
In cases where statically typed languages such as Java or Scala are used , the client side may choose to expose everything as generic datastructures ( e.g trees of name value pairs ) or may allow for generation and compilation of client side bindings .
I have no specific thoughts around the API support needed on the client side , except that quite obviously this would include support for the resource construction , resource operations etc. and that they would allow the client to interact with the server using the underlying language constructs rather having to work at a raw HTTP level .
In addition to the characteristics described above , I suspect frameworks will have many other optional characteristics such as support for monitoring , auditing / logging , transaction management , object pooling etc. etc .
However these are unlikely to be particularly interesting when focusing on the framework aspects especially from a resource oriented perspective , which is indeed the focus of this post .

( Left ) A rotating space elevator and ( right ) a uniform stress rotating space elevator ( an RSE combined with an LSE ) .
The rotating systems can propel “ sliding climbers ” up the loops using the centrifugal force , similar to how stirred coffee can rise and splash out of a cup .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
The idea of the space elevator just got a little crazier .
While the “ traditional ” concept involved using rocket propulsion or laser light pressure to propel loads up a cable anchored to Earth , a new study shows that a rotating space elevator could do away with engines or laser light pressure application completely .
Instead , the unique double rotating motion of looped strings could provide a mechanism for objects to slide up the elevator cable into outer space .
The space elevator could launch satellites and spacecraft with humans , and even be used to host space stations and research posts .
Ever since Konstantin Tsiolkovsky first proposed the idea of a giant string connecting the Earth and the heavens in 1895 , scientists and sci - fi writers alike have been intrigued .
But it seems no one has yet suggested that a space elevator could propel its own load , without the need for internal engines , laser light pressure , or any kind of propulsion .
In a recent study funded in part by NASA , theoretical physicist Leonardo Golubović and his graduate student Steven Knudsen at West Virginia University have explained that this concept is possible , at least in theory .
Golubović and Knudsen have introduced the Rotating Space Elevator ( RSE ) , a rotating system of a floppy string that forms an ellipse - like shape .
Unlike the traditional Linear Space Elevator ( LSE ) made of a single straight cable at rest , the RSE rotates in a quasi- periodic state .
As the scientists explain , RSE motion is nearly a geometrical superposition of two components : its geosynchronous rotation around Earth ( which has a one - day period ) , and the internal rotation of the string system that goes on around the axis perpendicular to the Earth ( about a 10 - minute period ) .
This internal rotation of the string is especially important , as it provides a mechanism for objects to freely slide along the string , and also provides the dynamical stability to maintain the elevator shape .
“ The idea came by itself , ” Golubović told PhysOrg.com .
“ I was thinking how to make things move easily and quickly up the traditional Tsiolkovsky - type space elevators .
In my kitchen , I was mixing coffee in my cup too vigorously and the centrifugal force on the rotating coffee won over gravity to make some of the coffee lift and splash out the cup .
This was my ‘ eureka ’ that lead to adding a similar conceptual feature to the old space elevator idea , the internal rotation .
Indeed , much like the coffee would lift and splash out the cup if rotated fast enough , the climbers on our Rotating Space Elevator will be lifted up by the centrifugal force winning over gravity . ”
Like the LSE , the RSE is attached to the Earth to provide loading access .
To initiate the double rotational motion , the string system is given an initial spin .
Other than this initial spin , the RSE moves purely under the influence of inertia and gravity .
In simulations , Golubović and Knudsen show how a load starting at rest near the Earth spontaneously oscillates between its starting point near Earth and a turning point in outer space ( close to the top of the string ) .
Using a specially chosen variation of the tapered elevator cable cross-sectional area , the scientists could ensure that the RSE string will indefinitely maintain its initial looped shape .
Golubović said that , as far as he knew , this type of motion does not occur in any other areas of physics or astronomy .
“ There are no known astronomical size solid ( or floppy ) objects that are shaped as strings , ” he said .
“ It thus remains for humans to make them .
As stated by a referee of our paper ‘ No one is an expert on the ideas displayed in this paper . ’
At this moment , the only judge is pure mathematics and it shows that our RSE can work , in a fascinating fashion . ”
Golubović and Knudsen also proposed a slightly different form of the RSE , which combines an RSE with an LSE ( an ellipse - like rotating string is attached to a linear string ) .
This “ uniform stress RSE ” ( USRSE ) could be designed with its loop positioned above the Earth ’s surface , which might have advantages for launching satellites .
The scientists also show that stacking several USRSE loops could create pathways reaching deeply into outer space , and loads could cross from string to string at intersection points .
Through simulations , the scientists investigated the effects of changing the initial period of the RSE .
They found that this alteration causes a phase transition , creating tension that causes the elliptical RSE shape to narrow into two linear - type space elevators that fluctuate nearly independently .
Over a period of two weeks , the RSE ’s angular momentum decays to zero , causing the RSE top to drift away from its initial position to a higher position around which the RSE top continues to oscillate in a chaotic fashion .
When asked how far away current technology is from actually building space elevators or rotating space elevators , Golubović was hopeful .
“ Our USRSE is technologically not more demanding than the traditional space elevator that can be indeed made to stand high tensile pressure by using the existing carbon nanotube composite materials , ” he said .
“ I hope my children or grandchildren will see both the traditional and rotating space elevator one day , if not on the Earth than on other planets such as Mars , which is free of man-made space debris that can hurt space elevators .
“ Moreover , some new and related ideas may come up soon to aid space elevator technology .
It ’s not all about materials being used but rather about structures being employed and new ideas being propagated .
The very concept of ‘ simple rotation ’ is not so simple as commonly thought .
Our RSE is a good example of this within the non-relativistic theory of inertia and gravity .
Other fascinating examples involve rotating black holes in general relativity that are ( theoretically ) known to act as time machines .
Fortunately , unlike the black holes , the non-relativistic physics of our rotating space elevator is within modern - day technology limits . ”

H. Beatty Chadwick has been in a staring match with the judicial system for the past 14 years , and the system just blinked .
Chadwick was ordered to pay his ex-wife $ 2.5 million after their divorce .
He refused to pay saying that he could n't because he lost the money in a series of " bad investments . "
The judge in the case did n't believe him and sent him to jail for contempt .
That was 14 years ago .
Last week another judge let Chadwick go saying that " continued imprisonment would be legal only if there was some likelihood that ultimately he would comply with the order ; otherwise , the confinement would be merely punitive instead of coercive . "
Chadwick , now 73 , is believed to have served the longest contempt sentence in US history .

Glenn Greenwald was on NPR yesterday to talk about their policy of refusing to call torture by its proper name , and while he was waiting to go on he listened to NPR ’s ombudsman explaining their policy :
She also said — when the host asked about the recent example I cited of NPR ’s calling what was done to a reporter in Gambia “ torture ” ( at the 20:20 mark ) — that NPR will use the word “ torture ” to describe what other governments do because they do it merely to sadistically inflict pain on people while the U.S. did it for a noble reason : to obtain information about Terrorist attacks .
That ’s really what she said : that when the U.S. did it ( as opposed to Evil countries ) , it was for a good reason .
Jeez , that Glenn .
Always exaggerating .
For the record , here ’s what she actually said about NPR ’s piece on Gambia :
In that case , these were strictly tactics to torture him , to punish him , versus in the United States , and the way that it ’s used , these are tactics used to get information .
The Gambian journalist was in jail for his beliefs .
Wow .
She really did say that , did n’t she ?
When other people do it for other reasons , it ’s torture .
When we do it for our reasons , it ’s not .
You do n’t usually find people willing to say this quite so baldly .
Congratulations , Alicia Shepard .
Ah , summer .
The kids are out of school , which means it ’s time for my young sons to take up favorite vacation pastimes like baseball , bike riding , lemonade stands and duping the world with elaborate hoaxes about UFOs on YouTube .
It was a rainy day , and our three boys were confined inside the house doing what brothers usually do — socking one in the nose and blaming the other for the trouble .
I was used to this .
A few minutes later , however , came total silence .
If ever there was a sign that the boys were up to no good — the kind of no - good that usually results in a call to our homeowner ’s insurance agent — this was it .
I decided to poke around .
In the kitchen I found our 10 - year - old with a cheap plastic digital camera and our 4 - year - old with a circular LED light purchased from Wal - Mart for $ 4.88 .
The younger boy was reflecting the light off the kitchen window while the older boy shot a pixilated video clip .
I have to admit :
The reflection did look a little like a weird flying saucer , but the narration by my son sealed the deal .
“ It ’s an alien ! ” he exclaimed in his most dramatic , breathless voice .
“ Oh my God , look at that ! ” ( The video can be viewed below ) .
It all seemed so sweet and funny — two would - be Steven Spielbergs , one in pre-school and the other in elementary school , together serving up a Close Encounter of the Fraudulent Kind .
Mostly , I was grateful that they were entertaining themselves indoors , without bloodshed , on a rainy summer day .
And then they posted their video on YouTube .
Within an hour , they had their first 100 hits .
And then another hundred .
And another .
Before long , their 18 - second clip with the take - notice headline “ UFO Over the Rocky Mountains ! ” was the subject of an intense international debate .
Some viewers pronounced the video as conclusive proof of the existence of extraterrestrials .
Others denounced it as a fake , but with impressive and elaborate CGI imagery .
My little 4 - year - old and 10 - year - old hoaxsters were thrilled .
Adults from around the world were paying attention to them !
They went to bed that night with dreams of Hollywood in their heads .
When they woke up the next morning , though , they learned a hard lesson about the movie business :
Overnight they had been struck by pirates .
Their fake UFO video was so convincing that it was picked up by the Paranormal Network .
Shortly after , another UFO site copy - and - pasted the video , and another , and then even a foreign - language site calling itself UFO Video Italia .
Somebody else somehow stretched the 18 - second clip into a two - minute epic , complete with ultra-slow - motion zooms and dramatic backing vocals that seemed to come from a strange marriage of Jerry Bruckheimer and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir .
Boy , was I mad .
All this work by my own two sons and now all the glory , thousands and thousands of precious Internet hits , was being hijacked by some shameless YouTube pirates .
Oh , the nerve !
Surprising thing was , it did n’t bother my sons a whole lot .
As my 10 - year - old said : “ Do n’t worry so much , Dad .
It ’s the Internet .
These things happen . ”
And so here I was , the father of two baby - faced boys who fooled the world with a $ 99 camera and a $ 4.88 light from Wal - Mart .
And I could n’t help but think that summer vacations have sure changed a lot since I was a kid .

MOSCOW  Late last month , a group of Azeri bloggers posted their latest tongue - in - cheek opus , a video in which a donkey holds a news conference before a circle of gravely nodding journalists .
Dressed in a voluminous gray costume , Adnan Hajizada rhapsodizes over the lush life awaiting donkeys in Azerbaijan .
To his audience  cosmopolitan young Azeris following his commentaries on blogs and Facebook  the video was a sly send - up of the government , which had been accused in the local news media of paying exorbitant prices to import donkeys .
Mr. Hajizada , 26 , and his fellow activist Emin Milli , 30 , were arrested last week in Baku , the capital , in an event their supporters say could signal the beginning of a crackdown on online media .
Azeri authorities said the two physically attacked other men , though witnesses have challenged that account .
They are awaiting trial on charges of hooliganism , which carries a sentence of one to five years in prison .
According to a motion filed by Mr. Hajizada ’s lawyer , the two men were with friends at a restaurant last Wednesday , engrossed in political debate , when two strangers broke into their conversation and started a fight .
Mr. Hajizada and Mr. Milli went to file a complaint about the assault , but instead an investigator opened a criminal case against them , the motion said .
Ten infuriating MLB players to watch
Whether it ’s that reliever that always seems to blow tight games in late innings , that batter that leaves runners on the bases , or that starter that walks seven batters an inning , every team has at least one player that as a fan , you ’d rather set your eyelids on fire than watch trot onto the field for just one more inning .
I ’ve compiled a list of 10 infuriating , punch - a - hole - through - your - wall MLB players to watch .
Granted , this list is by no means all - inclusive ( and I implore you the reader to list the guys that drive you nuts in the comments section ) .
But these are the 10 that seem to make my blood boil on a consistent basis , whether they ’re playing for my favorite team or not .
Julio Lugo , OF , Red Sox
I would lose the respect of all Boston fans if I did n’t have Lugo ’s name on this list .
It ’s not only that Lugo ca n’t field and flails at pitches like a schoolgirl trying to swat away a bee on the playground , but also that he ’s being paid $ 9 million a year to look so bad .
He has zero range defensively and he also has a knack for turning double plays at a snail ’s pace .
Granted , he ’s been delegated a backup behind Nick Green at short , but just the mere idea that Lugo is still on the roster must make BoSox fans want to toss their last meal .
Whenever the BoSox do decide to get rid of him , Boston fans might try to make that day an official holiday .
The Cubs ’ outfield collection of Alfonso Soriano , Milton Bradley and Kosuke Fukudome
Nothing says overpaid and overrated like the Cubs ’ outfield .
Whether you love brutal defense , swing - at - everything offense , or just plain stupidity , the Cubs ’ outfield collection of Soriano , Bradley and Fukudome have it all .
Soriano can’t judge fly balls and even when he does , he ’s always prone to making an error with his unnecessary hop , skip and a jump catch .
Bradley has turned out to be one of the worst offseason signings of the year while failing to produce at the dish , fighting with manager Lou Piniella and forgetting how many outs there are in an inning .
Fukudome is fine defensively , but his mini - tornado batting approach is almost laughable to watch sometimes .
Whenever the trio is in the outfield at the same time , you ’d swear you ’re at the circus instead of the “ Friendly Confines . ”
Chris Duncan , OF , Cardinals
Despite currently owning the best record in the NL Central , the Cardinals actually have a couple of players that fans would n’t mind taking on a tour of the Arch , only to leave them at the top with no way down .
Reliever Dennys Reyes is one of those players , Joe Thurston is another , but Duncan takes the cake .
Not only is he brutal both offensively and defensively , but he also continues to bat in front of superstar Albert Pujols and not produce .
Pitchers give him hittable pitches on a nightly basis knowing that Pujols is behind him , yet the best Duncan can do is produce a sub -.250 batting average and a paltry five home runs .
Couple that with his brutal defense and it ’s amazing that he still has a starting job .
( Although he can thank a rash of injuries for that . )
Edgar Renteria , SS , Giants
At least twice this year I read that Renteria was a solid offseason signing for the Giants by two different media outlets .
If by solid they meant that the Giants once again overpaid for a free agent , then yes , Renteria was a solid signing .
Watching him trying to go to his left on a ball hit up the middle is like watching an insect trying to scramble to get out of water after you flushed it down your toilet .
Unless the ball is hit right at him , he ca n’t move and God help the first baseman when he tries to rush a throw .
He ’s still okay with the bat at times , but Bruce Bochy refused to move him out of the two - hole for most of the first half despite Renteria ’s willingness to suck .
At No. 6 or No. 7 in the lineup , he ’s serviceable .
At No. 2 , he ’s maddening .
Melvin Mora , 3B , Orioles
Whether it ’s at the dish , in the field or on the base paths , Mora seemingly makes a bone - headed play at least once a game .
He ’s 37 years old , his production is almost non-existent and he does n’t have much of a future in Baltimore past next year .
Yet he continues to take up space in the middle of the O ’s lineup because manager Dave Trembley refuses to play youngsters over the vets .
It ’s bad enough that Baltimore fans have to succumb to watching their team lose on a regular basis .
But to also make them watch old , crusty vets lose is just downright cruel .
Johnny Damon , OF , Yankees
Do n’t get it twisted – Damon is a fine offensive player .
I have no idea how he can still hit over 12 home runs almost every year despite his age , but he does and he ’s been a very good offensive player for the Bombers .
But his chicken wing has always been an issue and Yankee fans must cringe every time a ball his hit into left field .
He used to be able to make up for his little league arm with his speed , but he ’s definitely lost a step over the years and he has trouble making adjustments on balls hit over his head .
The Yankees will take his offensive production , but they ’d probably be better off with a scarecrow set up in left field .
Scott Kazmir , SP , Rays
Granted , Kazmir is starting to slowly turn things around since coming off the DL a couple weeks ago .
But he ’s got to be one of the most frustrating supposed - aces in baseball and what ’s maddening is that he has outstanding stuff .
But he ca n’t stay healthy and he ’s way too inconsistent to be counted on as a top - of - the - rotation pitcher .
If he were a No. 3 or No. 4 starter being paid No. 3 or No. 4 money , fans could deal with his ups and downs .
But he ’s Tampa ’s highest paid pitcher ( fourth highest player behind Carl Crawford , Carlos Pena and the equally - frustrating Pat Burrell ) and his ERA is almost 7.00 this season .
Magglio Ordonez , OF , Tigers
This is obviously in correlation to this year , because Maggs has been outstanding for the Tigers since he was acquired from Chicago in 2005 .
He ’s supposed to be a significant bat in Detroit ’s lineup , yet he ’s batting just .266 with four home runs and 28 RBI .
Worse yet , he ’s still collecting a massive paycheck ( he ’s the currently the Tigers ’ highest paid player ) and he ’s frightening to watch in the outfield .
Maybe he ’ll bounce back and I ’ll have to eat my words but until then , he has to be driving Detroit fans nuts right now , even with the Tigers in first place .
Russell Martin , C , Dodgers
What the frack happened to this kid ?
Once one of the most promising catchers in all of baseball , Martin is hitting just .
248 this season with one dinger .
At 26 , he still has a ton of potential and maybe with Manny Ramirez back in the Dodgers ’ lineup he ’ll turn it around in the second half .
But once a promising player with a decent amount of pop , Martin now he hits like Chone Figgins without the high average .
Bob Howry , RP , Giants
I went to a Giants - Cardinals game in St. Louis recently and wound up making small talk with a Red Bird ’s fan next to me .
The game eventually went into the tenth tied 1 - 1 and San Fran had two relievers warming up in the pen : Brian Wilson and Bob Howry .
I turned to my new Cardinals friend and said , “ If Bruce Bochy puts Wilson in we ’re looking at more baseball .
If he puts the black angel of death in , you ’ll be sucking down a cold one enjoying a Cards ’ victory in no time . ”
Lo and behold , Bochy put Howry in and against his first batter , he gave up a walk off to St. Louis centerfielder Colby Rasmus .
Granted , Pablo Sandoval dropped a pop up in foul territory during the at bat and the umpire squeezed him on a pitch that would have struck Rasmus out , but nobody is better at blowing late inning games than Howry .
Cub fans , you know what I ’m talking about .
Those are my ten …which players infuriate you the most ?
During this year ’s Computex 2009 show , NVIDIA took the stage with a number of new Ion - and Tegra - based products , showcased by some of the company ’s partners .
Despite rumors prior to the debut of the computer show in Taiwan , the Santa Clara , California - based graphics maker did n’t reveal any details regarding its much - anticipated 40nm - based graphics processing units .
However , the launch of the new Ion - based PCs , as well as the highly anticipated Tegra devices , confirmed NVIDIA ’s business orientation , becoming a company that is involved in more than just graphics .
While we were n’t able to make it to Computex ourselves , we looked for the chance to find out more about what the graphics maker is preparing in the near future , as well as the company ’s opinion on the current computer industry .
The opportunity was just around the corner , as NVIDIA was actively promoting its latest technologies around the world , holding press events to demonstrate some of the things that were on display at Computex .
We took this opportunity and sat down for a one - on - one with the company ’s Igor Stanek , Product PR Manager for our region .
We wanted to go through some of the most important aspects of the manufacturer ’s business , taking into consideration the latest rumors that surfaced on the Internet .
Mr. Igor Stanek was kind enough to provide us with a perspective on what NVIDIA is focusing on , as well as on what to expect from the future line of ARM - based Tegra devices .
Unfortunately , we could not find anything about the much - rumored next - generation GPU architecture , allegedly called GT300 , whose existence is still a mystery .
However , we do have some useful insights into what is to come from NVIDIA .
Now , without further ado , we will let you go through the interview itself .
NVIDIA is evolving from a company that was mainly focused on delivering graphics cards for computer enthusiasts and supporting the latest games in the industry to one that is set on providing solutions that could power a complete computer system .
What can you tell us about that ?
I.S : GPUs are used by gamers around the world to play the latest games at their best .
GPUs though have become a power warehouse , thanks to their parallel architecture .
The industry and the scientists have now realized that they can use this incredible parallel computing architecture to do other things than games .
CPUs are no longer increasing in clock speed yet consumers are demanding more from their PCs today than ever before .
In order to provide the much needed performance to deliver on these consumer expectations , the only path available is to go multi-core or parallel – i.e. , add more cores and split demanding workloads across them .
Due to the very nature of computer graphics , GPUs excel at doing many things at once and are ideally suited to this new heterogeneous computing environment .
If you look at what Microsoft and Apple are working on with their new OSes you understand how GPUs are rapidly becoming the most desired chip inside the PC ; the upcoming Windows 7 and Snow Leopard use GPU to full extent .
Scientists are using it to accelerate calculation by a factor they were never able to achieve before with CPUs .
We consider ourselves a company that provides specific solutions to the resolution of complex problems ; whether they are common or most complex ones in medical , astrophysics and more .
We develop tailored solutions in different fields ; one example is our Quadro business where we develop products that solve specific problems like SDI capture , multi display financial visualization .
Dedicated 1U GPU racks , etc .
After seeing all those new Tegra - based and ARM - based devices at Computex this year , can you project a future where an ARM - based device can provide users with everyday computing ?
I.S : It all depends on your definition of everyday computing .
When you use a Tegra chip your everyday computing is not limited to typing email and surf the web ; you expect things that you do on your regular PC but in a smaller footprint .
These devices deliver desktop - class Internet browsing with Flash video and animation acceleration and high - definition video playback , all with cell phone - class power management – making days of HD mobile Internet experiences a reality .
Consumers are looking for an always - connected device for social media applications such as Facebook and YouTube , as well as great multimedia performance for recording and watching HD movies and videos on the go .
Tegra includes an entire computer - on - a- chip , including an ARM 11 core processor , so to answer your question , yes Tegra , which includes an ARM process , is a fully capable and modern device that fits your communications and entertainment device in your pocket .
Putting that into perspective , can we think about a future without x86 ?
I.S : I do n’t think anybody is saying x86 is out of the picture , but CPUs are losing their breath and GPUs becoming much more important .
It ’s very simple .
Just check how much time you need for transcoding of video on ION and how powerful CPU you need to match ION speed .
I think that future is in well balanced PC with CPU and GPU living in harmony .
CPU will have more control tasks in operating system and GPU will be focused for most of visual computing staff including some heavy computational tasks .
This is the architecture of the future .
I believe that PC with 1000 USD CPU and Intel integrated graphics card is already history .
Tegra has been one of the main highlights at Computex this year .
How important is Tegra for your future product lineup ?
I.S : Tegra is a strategic line of products for NVIDIA .
The world is going mobile and expectations are for low power always on , always connected and powerful devices that can do HD is growing rapidly .
Should we expect more Tegra devices to become available in the near future ?
I.S : The response from our customers is phenomenal .
Tegra is strategic to us and we have a great roadmap that we are sharing with our ecosystem , as I said our partners are extremely satisfied with performance , features and especially the low power used by these devices .
We cannot announce products on behalf of our customers , but there are many coming
Do you think Microsoft will play a significant role in the adoption of Tegra ?
I.S : Microsoft Windows Embedded CE is a great operating system and we support it with our Tegra devices .
We do also provide support for Google Android .
Can you tell us something about the alleged GT300 that has been rumored in the media recently ?
I.S : I am not aware of that code name .
What can you tell us about your next - generation chips , transitioning from 55 nm to 40nm ?
I.S : We do n’t comment about unannounced products .
There were reports about TSMC ’s problems with their 40nm manufacturing node .
What can you tell us about that ?
I.S : That is a question you should ask TSMC .
We have new mobile parts being announced shortly that will be using 40nm process .
It ’s not all about process though ; it ’s also about efficiency of the architecture .
40 nm process coupled with this efficient architecture works well for Notebooks , so we are launching this first on notebook .
During Computex AMD took the opportunity to showcase the world ’s first 40nm DirectX 11 GPU , revealing a couple of videos with their next - generation solutions .
How do you comment on that ?
I.S : Simply , that we are thrilled about what we are working on .
Stay tuned !

While the global financial crisis has given weight to predictions that the Pax Americana is on its way out , to be replaced before long by a Pax China or multilateral control by powers such as the G20 , the status of English as the global language seems likely to prop up U.S. power for some time to come .
" Half the world 's people are projected to be speaking English by 2015 .
And so long as English is on track to become the world 's unofficial language , the United States will likely be center stage , " writes Ali Wyne , a junior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , in the journal Foreign Policy .
" English is a first language for 400 million people , and a fluent second for between 300 and 500 million more , " he quotes the International Herald Tribune .
" Add on top of that the 750 million who have studied English as a foreign language and you have well over 1 billion members of the English - speaking world . "
Most of world 's influential newspapers do have English editions , and more than 90 percent of the major science magazines in the world are published in English .
The driving force behind the growing influence of English is the quest for economic betterment , Wyne says .
" In China , America 's putative superpower replacement , learning English is considered a gateway to middle - class security ; 300 million people speak it there , and another 350 million people speak it in India . "
He predicts that English will become the second language in China , Japan , South Korea , Africa and Latin America .
" Language quite literally anchors human progress -- it allows children to learn , authors to write , consumers to buy , companies to produce , leaders to negotiate , people to travel , and enables just about anything else that you can imagine , " he concludes .
" Whether it 's Latin during the first century or French in the 18th , great powers and global lingua francas tend to go together .
So while the unipolar moment may be over , the growing influence of English will ensure that the United States does n't fade into the sunset anytime soon . "
The march of technology is supposed to make things better for consumers , but these days it seems videogame makers strive to find new ways to take more of our money and give us less in return .
We are not communists here at Game|Life .
We want publishers to make financially prudent decisions so they can continue to deliver games that fuel our addictions .
But some bone - headed business moves benefit everyone except us .
Here are the 10 worst offenders :
10 . Xbox 360's Expensive Memory
Want a bigger PlayStation 3 hard drive ?
Buy an off - the - shelf laptop drive and slap that baby in .
Need more room for all the WiiWare games you 've downloaded ?
Hot - swap a generic SD card .
Running out of space on your Xbox 360 hard drive ?
Bend over .
The biggest hard disk you can buy for Xbox 360 is the 120 - GB model , and it costs a whopping $ 140 .
For purposes of comparison , that 's the MSRP of Western Digital 's terabyte drive .
Need 512 MB of portable memory for your Xbox ?
Only $ 40 , which would buy an 8 - GB SD card .
9. DRM and Piracy
Digital rights management schemes , which limit the ways we can play legitimate copies of games , are annoying .
But piracy is worse .
If you think it 's a victimless crime , consider the case of publisher Stardock .
It releases its games without DRM , as a sign of courtesy and respect to its customers .
But the ambitious online mode of its recent PC game Demigod has been plagued with problems , partly because even though only 18,000 people bought the game in its opening weekend , 120,000 people have been logging in and playing .
Stardock has spent a lot of extra time and money supporting these freeloaders , and that sucks .
But what really sucks is that the pirates are mucking up the performance for those who bought the game legitimately .
Dear 100,000 people who pirated Demigod :
You are jackasses .
8. GameStop - Exclusive Powers
In Sony 's inFamous , Cole McGrath learns electric superpowers by frying enemies .
Except for the Gigawatt Blades power , which he learns by you paying money to GameStop .
Giving out plastic tchotchkes in return for putting down a reservation fee on an upcoming game is a nice touch , but working out a sweetheart deal with a retailer to hold back in - game abilities unless a player hands over five bucks ahead of time is downright sketchy .
Not to mention the fact that if you miss the preorder deal , it 's impossible to unlock the content at any time thereafter .
GameStop gets more preorders ,
Sony gets advertising sponsorship and the rest of us get a gimped game .
7. Old Game , New Price
We can argue all day about whether paying $ 8 for a Super Nintendo game download is worth it , but at least that 's the highest any game publisher charges for 16 - bit relics anymore .
Except for Square Enix , which took the 1995 game Chrono Trigger , slapped it onto a Nintendo DS cartridge with only the barest of extra features , then charged $ 40 for it — 10 bucks more than a standard DS game .
Icing on the cake : Complaining about the game 's sales , as if it 's consumers ' fault for having the audacity to spot a raw deal .
6. PSP Go
Are n't game machines supposed to get * cheaper * over time ?
Sony 's new PSP is microsized in every way except the price : $ 250 , an $ 80 premium over the current model .
The only advantage is the smaller form factor , and we doubt that the smaller screen counts as a gameplay plus .
Otherwise , the Go's features are downgraded over the original PSP's — no disc drive , no swappable battery pack ( and no upgrade to the expected battery life to counteract either of those ) .
So why is the price the same as when the unit launched in 2005 ?
Sony says it 's because retailers are taking a bigger cut off the top , since they wo n't be making money on sales of game discs .
No matter who is to blame , consumers lose with PSP Go 's price .
With any luck , the accompanying shift to downloadable sales will make the PSP 's software catalog cheaper than retail , but we 're not holding our breaths on that , considering ...
5. Downloads Priced Same as Discs
There are n't as many test cases here yet , because few console games have been released in both downloadable and disc versions , but the data we have is disheartening .
It 's much , much cheaper to sell a downloadable game :
You do n't have to print a disc , and middlemen do n't take a cut .
Win -win , right ?
More like win-lose .
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue costs the same $ 30 as a PlayStation 3 disc or a PlayStation Store download .
The disc is undeniably more valuable , since it can be resold .
If the prices are the same , digital versions give gamers less for their money .
( At least the IRS is n't taxing downloads — yet . )
4. Guitar Hero : Smash Hits
The ability to download in - game content was supposed to revolutionize music games , because you could add new songs to keep the experience fresh .
The makers of both Guitar Hero and Rock Band have embraced song downloads , but the gulf between the two companies ' approaches is staggering .
Harmonix gives gamers a better deal :
The company lets users add hundreds of new songs to existing Rock Band games on an a la carte basis , while Activision has minimized downloads while churning out disc after redundant disc .
Prime example : Guitar Hero Smash Hits , a $ 60 collection of previously released Guitar Hero songs that wo n't work with older versions of the game .
The result ?
Guitar
Hero players end up paying more for segregated song lists .
3. Nintendo Sitting on Games
Want to play the latest game in the Fatal Frame series ?
Too bad .
It 's just one of many Wii and Nintendo DS games that Nintendo holds the publishing rights to , but has refrained from bringing to America .
Disaster : Day of Crisis , Mother 3 , Soma Bringer and * Another Code * are other examples .
The rationale is almost understandable : Releasing niche titles like these is fine for smaller publishers with lower overhead , but Nintendo is the world 's biggest game publisher , and needs to focus its energies on surefire hits .
So why not license these games to smaller publishers ?
Why hoard publishing rights to so many quality games , especially when titles like Disaster are better than 99 percent of Wii shovelware ?
( To say nothing of the stranglehold that the company has on Virtual Console classic game releases . )
2. Region Locks
Releasing games only in certain regions would n't be so bad , if not for the region locks that restrict game machines to playing software from a single territory .
Concerns about language barriers and international shipping already keep the vast majority of gamers from buying titles from other regions , so arbitrary regional lockouts only serve to annoy those who want to experience games from all over the world .
Nintendo DS , PSP and PS3 have the right idea — the vast majority of games for those machines are n't region - coded .
If only Wii and Xbox 360 would follow suit .
1. Funny Money
The biggest rip - off of all is when game publishers take your money and give you nothing in return .
Want to buy a $ 2 app on the Nintendo DSi ?
Sorry , you 'll have to pony up the $ 10 minimum charge for 1,000 Wii Points .
Why should we give Nintendo $ 8 to sit in escrow while we wait for it to release something else we want on the download service ?
At least Nintendo uses a comprehensible exchange rate .
Xbox players are n't so lucky :
Ten bucks gets you 800 Microsoft points , a ridiculous exchange rate that makes it more complicated than necessary to figure out how much you 're really paying for the digital doodads you 're piling into your virtual cart .
Thanks ,
Sony , for using real - dollar transactions in the PlayStation Store — even though you can only add funds to your " wallet " in $ 5 increments .

In a blunt challenge to Canada and thousands of Canadian seal hunters , the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to ban the importing or sale of furs and other products from commercially harvested seals .
The ban would mainly affect Canada , where the government has allowed several hundred thousand young harp seals to be killed each year by commercial and traditional hunters on sea ice cloaking eastern and Arctic waters .
Canadian officials immediately criticized the ban , which could take effect within several weeks , for not exempting countries like Canada that have guidelines requiring humane , sustainable hunts .
Stockwell Day , the Canadian minister of international trade , said that if the European Union did not exempt Canada , it would challenge the ban at the World Trade Organization .
Makes clear he's not ' in league ' with ' lunatics ' on the Right , before attacking Dems , media , for abandoning Progressive values
' We have a center - Right party and a crazy party ' ...
Brad Friedman Byon 6/20/2009 , 12:01 pm PT
In last week 's " New Rules " segment on HBO's , Bill Maher blasted President Obama for " not getting the job done , " adding " this is not what I voted for . "
He had been critical of Obama 's lack of fight for health care reform , and " nibbling " that 's leaving insurance companies " still running the show , " bailed out banks " laughing at us about how easy it was to get back to ' business as usual , ' " and scientists ' vital warnings about serious climate change being largely ignored .
We ran that video last week , and found it was linked to by an enormous number of rightwing websites , using the opportunity to suggest that Maher now agreed with them about Obama .
This week ( video above - right ) Maher clarified the record .
He first noted : " Last week in this space , I criticized President Obama for not fighting corporate influence enough , and it made some Liberals very angry .
My phone rang off the hook . "
But he then removed any doubt about whether he was actually " in league " with those on the Right .
" As far as you folks on the Right that think that we 're somehow in league --- we 're not in league !
I was criticizing Obama for not being hard enough on the corporate douche bags you live to defend .
I do n't wanna be on your team .
Pick another kid . "
" So I stand by my words , " Maher said , before launching into a no-holds barred attack on the Democrats and Obama for their failings , yet again .
" There is another side to the story .
And that is , that every time Obama tries to take on a Progressive cause , there 's a major political party standing in his way --- the Democrats . "
" We do n't have a Left and a Right party in this country anymore .
We have a center - Right party and a crazy party .
And over the last thirty - odd years , Democrats have moved to the Right , and the Right has moved into a mental hospital . "
He went on to criticize Democrats for becoming the party of " hedge fund managers , credit card companies , banks , defense contractors , big agriculture and the pharmaceutical lobby [ who ] sit across the aisle from a small group of religious lunatics , flat - earthers , and Civil War re-enacters ... who mostly communicate by AM radio and call themselves the Republicans . "
The major concluding thesis in his scathing criticism : " Bottom line , Democrats are the new Republicans "
Diane Sweet of RAW STORY observed in her coverage : " If Maher had finished by declaring his candidacy for public office , by the sound of the applause in response to his monologue , he would have left the studio Friday evening with an audience full of supporters . "
If you 're unable to watch the video ( above right ) , a text - transcript of the key quotes from this week 's must - see monologue follow below .
As with last week 's , we find ourselves hard - pressed to disagree with a word of it ...
enough , and it made some Liberals very angry .
My phone rang off the hook .
...
As far as you folks on the Right that think that we 're somehow in league --- we 're not in league !
I was criticizing Obama for not being hard enough on the corporate douche bags you live to defend .
I do n't wanna be on your team .
Pick another kid .
Last week in this space , I criticized President Obama for not fighting corporate influence , and it made some Liberals very angry .
My phone rang off the hook .... As far as you folks on the Right that think thatsomehow in league --- we 're not in league !
I was criticizing Obama for not being hardon the corporate douche bags you live to defend .
I do n't wanna be on your team .
Pick another kid .
So I stand by my words .
But there is another side to the story .
And that is , that every time Obama tries to take on a Progressive cause , there 's a major political party standing in his way --- the Democrats .
...
We do n't need a third party , we need a first party .
You go to the polls and your choices are the guy who voted for the first Wall Street bailout , or the guy who voted for the next ten .
We do n't have a Left and a Right party in this country anymore .
We have a center - Right party and a crazy party .
And over the last thirty - odd years , Democrats have moved to the Right , and the Right has moved into a mental hospital .
So what we have is one perfectly good party for hedge fund managers , credit card companies , banks , defense contractors , big agriculture and the pharmaceutical lobby --- that 's the Democrats .
And they sit across the aisle from a small group of religious lunatics , flat - earthers , and Civil War re-enacters ... who mostly communicate by AM radio and call themselves the Republicans .
And who actually worry that Obama is a Socialist .
Socialist ?
He 's not even a Liberal .
I know he 's not , because he's on TV .
And while I see Democrats on television , I do n't see actual Liberals .
And if occassionally you do get to hear Ralph Nader or Noam Chomsky or Dennis Kucinich , they 're treated like buffoons .
... Should n't there be one party that unambiguously supports cutting the military party ?
A party that is straight up in favor of gun control , gay marriage , higher taxes on the right , universal healthcare , legalizing pot and steep direct taxing of polluters ?
These are n't radical ideas .
A majority of Americans are either already for them , or would be if they were properly argued and defended .
And what we need is an actual Progressive party to represent the millions of Americans who are n't being served by the Democrats .
Because , bottom line , Democrats are the new Republicans .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
States are poised to pass as much as $ 24 billion in tax and fee hikes in coming weeks , as they struggle to balance their budgets amid the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression , a report released Thursday found .
The spike blows away the $ 726 million in recommended increases for fiscal 2009 .
At the same time , state budgets are set to shrink for a record second year in a row .
The recession has caused tax collections to plummet and the need for social services to soar .
State officials are scrambling to close last - minute budget gaps that opened after April tax revenues came in below already - lowered estimates .
States may be forced to tap rainy day funds or impose even more stringent spending cuts to balance their budgets before their fiscal years end on June 30 .
Governors ' proposed budgets for fiscal year 2010 show a 2.5 % decrease in general fund spending , which comes after an estimated 2.2 % decline in the current fiscal year .
State spending usually rises 6 % a year .
This is the largest pullback in the survey 's 30 - year history and the first time state spending would decline for two years in a row , according to the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers .
Also , in an unusual turn , the recession is hammering nearly all states across the country .
" These are some of the worst numbers we 've ever seen , " said Scott Pattison , executive director of the budget officers group .
General fund spending , which is not earmarked for specific uses , covers mainly education , Medicaid , corrections , public assistance and transportation .
Tax hikes abound
Some 29 states are recommending tax and fee increases for the coming fiscal year .
California , which is struggling to close a $ 21.3 billion budget gap , accounts for $ 11.3 billion of the hike .
Illinois makes up another $ 4.4 billion , while New York is proposing $ 4 billion in additional levies .
Hikes in personal income taxes account for $ 8.8 billion , while sales taxes are set to rise $ 6.5 billion .
Higher cigarette taxes would bring in $ 1.5 billion , while corporate taxes would rise $ 539 million .
State officials are searching for ways to boost revenue at a time when tax collections are falling off a cliff .
Corporate income tax revenue is expected to be down 15.2 % , personal income down 6.6 % and sales tax down 3.2 % .
Though state officials are reluctant to raise taxes during a recession , they have little choice these days .
" If you look historically , we 've seen numbers at times of $ 14 or $ 15 billion , but never a number of that order or magnitude , " said Raymond Scheppach , head of the governors ' group , referring to the proposed $ 24 billion in tax hikes .
" As we go along , governors are going to continue to want to cut budgets , but they are going to be forced to look more and more unfortunately on the revenue side . "
States also are dipping into their rainy day funds to pay the bills .
The funds ' balances totaled 9.1 % of expenditures in fiscal 2008 , but have declined to 5.5 % in the current year .
However , excluding Texas and Alaska , the funds ' balances dip to 3.6 % of expenditures .
A balance of 5 % of expenditures is considered a relatively adequate cushion .
This downturn is likely to damage state 's financial health more seriously than other recessions in recent years because it is deeper and will last longer , said Scheppach .
The last really bad year for states was 1983 , when budgets shrank 0.7 % , but it was preceded and followed by strong periods .
This recession will likely plague states for up to three more years .
" There 's no capability to build the revenue base , build the rainy day fund , " he said .
" You are really on the defensive the entire time . "
Spending slowdown
Though demand for state services is up , officials are slashing spending on a wide range of government programs .
Some 28 states have proposed cutting spending on higher education and personnel , while 27 want to reduce funding for K - 12 education .
Another 25 states have proposed cuts to Medicaid and corrections , while 23 are reducing funds for public assistance .
A record 42 states had to cut their fiscal 2009 budgets in the middle of the year as revenue came in below estimates .
Even worse , 20 states still have budget gaps they must close before the end of the fiscal year .
State officials predict tight times through fiscal 2011 and possibly 2012 since state fiscal recovery historically lags a national economic rebound .
They are currently facing an estimated $ 230 billion in budget gaps between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011 .
This is a slightly edited version of an article written by Sahar , which originally appeared at Nuseiba .
You can also read Yusra ’s take on the debates .
Recently , I saw the Doha Debates , which is a show that debates controversial political , social and religious issues .
Journalist and mediator Tim Sebastian proposes a motion and the speakers on the panel discuss the topic at length .
The audience then has an opportunity to respond to the panel .
The latest motion proposed : “ This house believes that Muslim women should be free to marry anyone they choose . ”
There were four speakers on the panel .
For the motion there was American Muslim feminist Asra Nomani , who has authored several books .
Also for the motion , there was Dr. Muhammad Habash , a member of parliament and a cleric .
Against the motion were Shaykh Yasir Qadhi and Dr. Thuraya Al Arrayed , a Saudi writer , columnist and member of the advisory board of the Arab Thought Foundation .
Nomani began the debate with an emotional tone , declaring that Muslim women face barriers and that “ just about every Muslim woman ” encounters these barriers and internalizes them , and that she does not have the right to choose when it comes to marriage .
She then directly addresses Muslim women and reassures them that she does n’t wish that they suffer forced or loveless marriages .
With the way Nomani is carrying on , you ’d think she was convinced she was shaking the very sheltered world of Muslim women .
Apparently , we ’re not aware of our rights !
In her self - aggrandizement , Nomani homogenizes Muslim women ’s experiences and assumes that every Muslim woman has had the same experience as her .
That yes , we are all doomed to the same fate .
True , there are Muslim women like Nomani who marry either through some sort of coercion or just to keep their family happy –I also agree with her point that these women will be the ones who share their bed with their husbands at the end .
However , Nomani seems to think that these experiences are the experiences of the vast majority of Muslim women–where we are helpless beings who are victims of our community and our imposing families , who Nomani assumes do n’t want the best for us .
She thus undermines the importance of family within the context of Muslim marriage .
I ’m not saying women have to follow the decisions of their families , but many women and men will be thinking that family does matter in many of the decisions we make for ourselves , including marriage .
In other words , choice comes with responsibility and it does at times mean we consider everything , not just ourselves .
Nomani ’s entire argument is predicated on a particular construction of the Muslim woman which she deploys to legitimize her claim : she is just chattel , in shackles , and silenced by her subjugation .
Nomani belittles the minds of Muslim women because she assumes they lack agency of their own and cannot comprehend their supposed suffering .
In doing so , Nomani constructs herself as their savior , the enlightened one who recognizes their oppression– the liberal light at the end of this oppressive dark tunnel that is their unfortunate experience .
I found it interesting that Nomani ’s extremely liberal position was juxtaposed with the other Muslim woman , who was opposed to the motion .
Dr. Al Arrayed opposes the motion because she believes that anyone 27 and under bases their decisions on physical attraction and that they are not responsible enough to be making important decisions like this – so the role of the family is essential .
Her simplistic position is mired by her lack of faith in young Muslim women and their responsible attitude to such issues like marriage — which a woman in the audience pointed out .
However , I do agree with Dr. Al Arrayed ’s overall point that family is important in these decisions and it is dangerous to deny this reality because it could lead to women being isolated .
What was interesting is the issue of children did not come up in the debate .
For me , my decision to marry a Muslim man is affirmed when it comes to the faith of my children .
I would not want my children to belong to any other faith but Islam .
Keep in mind , this is not only an issue women who marry non-Muslims have to face but also men who do .
Supporting the motion , Dr. Habash begins his defense declaring there is no compulsion in religion and so we should extend this to marriage , too ( I think he was a little confused with his position and often would agree with the opposing side ) .
However , no compulsion in religion does not mean a Muslim should n’t abide by the laws of her religion — she has the choice not to , of course , but if she wishes to practice her religion , there are certain rules and practices that need to be followed as part of worship .
Sure , a Muslim woman can marry who she wants , but the question here is , is there religious justification for this unlimited freedom ?
Dr. Habash refers to the hadith of when the Prophet was approached by a woman who told him of how she was forced to marry but later agreed with her father ’s decision .
The Prophet then told her he ’ll absolve the marriage but she assured him she was now happy in her marriage but wanted to let women know that the father has no right to do such a thing which the Prophet agreed .
Habash takes from this hadith the principle that women should be able to choose who she should marry , regardless of the faith of the person .
However , as Shaykh Qadhi points out , we cannot be selective with our religion because Habash is ignoring what Islam has to say about a woman marrying a non-Muslim .
As I listened to Nomani ’s concern over the depressing fate of Muslim women , I thought , why is n’t she mentioning the importance of recognizing cultural ideas and customs that have infiltrated how we conceptualise and perceive Islam ?
Her analysis was simple : Muslim women are downtrodden ; there was no attempt to contextualise and understand this further .
To compensate for Nomani ’s reductive observation , Shaykh Qadhi and Dr. Al Arrayed point out that yes , there are women who are oppressed in our communities in the name of religion , but Islam is not responsible for any oppression that occurs , rather it is cultural and tribal prejudice which justify oppressive practices .
These practices are the antithesis to Islam ’s principles of equality and justice which are protected in its law .
Importantly , Shaykh Qadhi explains how this is not a problem of the uneducated
In our community but those who have committed themselves to the study of religion , who may consciously or unconsciously introduce their own cultural prejudice that affects how they view Islam .
This was imperative to the debate I thought because of the dichotomy that Nomani was desperately trying to establish .
Nomani posited herself as the liberal defender of Muslim women against the oppressive religious leadership that Shaykh Qadhi — with his long beard ( as opposed to the more subtle beard of Habash ) represented .
When Shaykh Qadhi objected to her removal of any boundaries and warned that limitations are a part of our religion , she would turn to the audience and say “ that is their interpretation ” in her attempt to marginalize him .
In fact , she was well prepared for this response and early on in the debate warned of the theological arguments that she claimed lay the barriers for women .
Shaykh Qadhi undermined this false dichotomy in pointing out that there are elements of the religious establishment who are tainted by cultural understandings and that we should resist this .
However , Nomani was n’t interested in hearing a shaykh criticize women ’s oppression in our community — that was simply not the role Nomani had decided for him .
In the end , the motion was passed ( 62 % ) .
I was actually surprised , but Shaykh Qadhi explains in his piece on the debate that it was likely to be because of the vagueness of the motion which stressed freedom to choose rather than Shariah ruling on the issue .
But the fact that these kinds of discussions are taking place between Muslims ( both men and women ) is a step forward in providing a space to discuss issues that impact on the lives of Muslim women .

Our dealer Zak got us a 1/8th for 35 dollars , they where 10 bucks more because they are kinda rare and they were some really good mushrooms .
Once we got them , Doug had 20 dollars he was going to spend on weed but could n't get any , so he decided to get some Heroin instead .
After getting them , Doug got the Heroin around 4:30 .
Neo was coming over to spend to night and have a very memorable time .
We had planned to do mushrooms that night .
8:30 pm - Neo stopped by Doug 's house and the fun started to begin .
We decided that we should eat the mushrooms on an empty stomach so it will effect us more .
Time passed and we had nothing to do , we had to wait till Doug 's mom decided to go to bed .
In the mean time Neo and Doug began to watch ' Pulp Fiction  to get us in the mood .
While watching , we had great urges to do some Heroin because in the movie ' Vence Vega ' does heroin .
We where going to do the Heroin on tin foil .
Doug 's mom was home so we had to wait until she went to bed .
10:00 pm - Once she was in bed , Doug and Neo began slamming .
We decided to do it in Doug 's bathroom first but once we figured out it did n't smell much , we started to do it in Doug 's room .
Neo did about 10 hits , and Doug did about 12 hits .
11:00 pm -
We sat and watched ' Pulp Fiction ' for awhile .
It felt as if we where sitting on a cloud .
Everything was so wondering and our bodies felt like constant orgasms .
Cracking my back on Heroin feels like an Orgasm .
We rabbled about some things for about 20 mins and just sat and enjoyed the moment .
We wanted to wait until Doug 's mom was completely asleep before we ate the mushrooms .
11:46 pm - We ate the mushrooms .
We put them on 2 slices of pizza , one for Doug and one for Neo .
We both took about half a 1/8th .
By the way , they where some really powerful mushrooms .
We probably were only supposed to take a like a cap or a stem but we ingested all of it .
After eating them , we decided to wait a little before we did anything else .
12:00 am -
We were going to leave Dougs house around 1:00 am but until then we didnt have much to do .
Neo made the last of the heroin on some tin foil .
We sat on Dougs bed talking about how we felt from all the Heroin we did before .
We were not making much sense .
About 20 mins after eating them Neo began his trip .
He was talking different from before and started to act more random as timed passed .
Doug wasnt feeling much while Neo just started to come up .
Neo had the great idea to have a bowl or too of cannabis , apparently it will affect you more if smoke while on mushrooms .
Neo and Doug took turns going outside to have a bowl or two , we thought it was safest in case Dougs mom walked in .
Neo came in talked about when he was outside , he keep stepping in water even though there was no water on the ground .
Neo also said how peaceful it was while he was smoking .
Once he came back inside , Doug stepped out and had a bowl .
When Doug was smoking , a shadow came up that looked like a person and put out his hand as if he would like a hit .
Doug , thinking nothing of it , gave the bowl to the shadow figure and then realized that the shadow figure wasnt real .
Doug went back inside and Neo and Doug started to talk about what just happened .
The heroin made us very happy while the mushroom enhanced the feeling about 20 times .
We began laughing hysterically at nothing and started to type out how we felt .
The feelings we were having were like nothing we have had before .
It was like confusion , Euphoria , happiness combined , pretty much like exploring new places you have never been before in your brain .
A good example was when Doug and Neo were sitting on the bed and Doug said to Neo  We should listen to more music in return Neo said  Yes , we should smoke more heroin . 
Pretty much we were not making any sense .
1:00 am - We left Dougs house and headed toward the Avocado Orchard that was just up Dougs street .
Getting out the house without making much noise was a difficult task since we couldnt tell what was loud and what wasnt .
Once out of my house , we headed toward the Orchard .
First thing we noticed was that we were not walking right .
It seemed as though our feet had a mind of there own .
It was if our feet were not there and our heads were just floating up the street .
Doug said that it seemed as though everything was spinning .
The trees branches were moving in a circular motion and he felt at peace with everything .
Neo said that he couldnt feel the rest of his body and all he thought he had was his head .
While we were walking it seemed the street wouldnt end , it just keep on going forever .
Once we reached the Orchard , Neo had the smart idea of calling nicole ( One of our friends ) .
Once Doug asked him what he was doing , he said he didnt know and just hung up the phone .
We have smoked in the orchard before and have a spot we normally go to .
We walked pass the spot we normally go to and just keep walking , we soon realized that we were walking to no where and went back and sat down were we normally go .
1:15 am -
Once we were comfortable , Neo whipped out his piece and the weed .
We started to smoke but after about the 3rd bowl , we started to hit our peak , and when I say peak , I mean the mushroom peak , the heroin peak and we were stoned .
We started to pass bowls with nothing in it because we forgot that there was nothing in it .
When we smoked , it seemed as though you couldnt feel it in your lungs , we could see the smoke come out but could not feel it .
We keep getting side tracked and forgot what we were doing .
We started to talk about our life , past , present and pretty much everything .
We werent really having conversations , more like talking out loud but not comprehending what the each other are saying .
We got side tracked so much that Doug would have to remind Neo what we are doing ; he would point at the pipe and exclaim  Smoke . 
The feeling was the most euphoric feeling .
It felt as if out bodies was having constant orgasms we soon realized that smoking was pointless because we could not get any more messed up .
Our brains were in complete bliss .
We sat and tried to grasp what was going on .
Doug thought there was someone running around in the orchard .
We started to laugh uncontrollably for about 30 mins .
It was the best moment in out lives , the climax of our lives .
We decided to head back to Dougs house .
Around 2:30 or 3:00 am - Neo and Doug stood up , immediately after standing up , Doug fell down .
We slowly made out way from our spot to the street .
One look at us and you could tell we were fucked up .
We were staggering as if we were really drunk ; it was if we had no balance .
All we could do is put one foot in front of another and hope we dont fall over .
We were talking ; well it was more like shouting because we couldnt control the volume of our voices .
We finally reached my house , normally would take about a minute , it took us about 10 mins .
We made it to Dougs room and once in the room we started to watch TV .
Neo pointed out that it seemed as though everything on TV had to do with sex .
TV seemed extreamly interesting .
We sat on the bed and talked for awhile even thought it made no sense .
4:30 am - Usually when I am tired I feel heavy , if I take that and multiple it by 100 , that was how it felt .
We began to come down from everything and all you could feel was heaviness and totally out of it .
Doug turned off the TV and both Doug and Neo passed out .
We woke up the next day in a mood of complete happiness and appreciation to the world and its beauty .
Also feeling of extreme tiredness .
It was like hang over but without the shitty feeling , just the feeling of being very tired and out of it .
I would like to say that there are a lot of black moments we dont remember about that night .
Pretty much that night was the climax of our life , a feeling that can't really be described in words .
It will was absolutely fantastic .
I would also like to say that mushrooms and heroin is great combination .
All I really have to say is that , That was a night to remember .

Sebastien Loeb , the five - time world rally champion , has told Scuderia Toro Rosso that he is interested in making the switch to Formula 1 as a replacement for Sebastien Bourdais .
With Bourdais poised to be dropped by Toro Rosso following this weekend 's German Grand Prix , speculation has been rife that youngster Jaime Alguersuari will be given a chance to step up to F1 .
However , Loeb has suggested that he too is a contender for the drive at some point this season - even if a debut at the Hungarian GP is highly unlikely .
" Who knows , as long as the Formula 1 and rallying calendars do n't overlap anything is possible , " Loeb told French newspaper L'Equipe .
" If there is a place at Toro Rosso I am available .
" Although I must say a grand prix is not the same as a rally .
It is 70 laps and physically I 'm not ready .
In rallying you do not have the same conditions as an F1 driver . "
L'Equipe suggested that Loeb had recently spent some time at the simulator of Toro Rosso 's sister team Red Bull Racing .
He impressed in a test with Red Bull last winter .
However , with Loeb locked in a tight fight for this year 's rally title , an imminent move to F1 is unlikely - although it could still happen once his WRC commitments with Citroen have ended .
Olivier Quesnel , the head of Citroen Sport , moved to play down talk that Loeb would become a full - time replacement for Bourdais .
" Let me be clear , Sebastien Loeb will not replace Sebastien Bourdais at Toro Rosso , if he is transferred , " he said .
" Sebastien has expressed a desire to be in F1 , and it does not surprise me as it is a dream come true for him .
However , we must not dream . "
New revelations further debunk manufactured pretext for war

Another piece of evidence to add to the patently obvious fact that the United States had resolved to bomb Iraq shortly after 9/11 and that the WMD charade was a staged sideshow is the fact that , according to newly released interrogation documents , Saddam Hussein actually wanted an alliance with the U.S. because he was more afraid of Iran .
“ Saddam Hussein feared Iran ’s arsenal more than a U.S. attack , and even considered asking ex-President George W. Bush “ to protect ” Iraq from its neighbor , once secret FBI files show , ” reports the New York Daily News .
“ The FBI interrogations of the toppled tyrant – codename “ Desert Spider ” – were declassified after a Freedom of Information Act request . ”
Hussein told interrogators that he was more afraid of Iran than the U.S. , and would have sought an alliance with Bush in order to protect his country from the “ fanatic ” Iranian ayatollahs .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Saddam also called Osama Bin Laden a “ zealot ” and swore that he never sought an alliance with the terror mastermind , adding that he would have preferred to seek a partnership with North Korea .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Hussein repeated that he had ordered the destruction of any remaining WMD before the invasion .
“ By God , if I had such weapons , I would have used them in the fight against the U.S. , ” he added .
So desperate were the Bush administration to find a pretext to go into Iraq , that they even proposed staging provocations that would be blamed on Saddam .
As was highlighted again in the news last week , once it became obvious that UN inspectors would fail to find weapons of mass destruction , the government discussed alternative scenarios to hoodwink the UN into signing a new resolution authorizing military action .
One such proposal was to paint a U2 reconnaissance aircraft in UN colors and fly it over Iraqi territory , goading Saddam to order to aircraft shot at and thus violating UN resolutions .
The new revelation that Saddam would have been happy to become a military ally of the U.S. against Iran proves once again that the invasion of Iraq was not about making the Middle East safer or “ liberating ” a suppressed population – it was about creating a strategic foothold for U.S. imperial expansion in the region , taking over lucrative resources while handing out no bid contracts to military - industrial cronies , and providing a launch pad for the destabilization campaign and future attack on Iran .

The 2009 Winners " What ?
Those are the winners ?!
Where is my glorious entry ?
Dammit , you would n't know funny if it bit you on the ass ! "
No doubt .
This sort of thing is enormously subjective .
It 's hard to draw a line between those that just barely make it in and those which are just barely left out ; on another day I might well have chosen a rather different set of winners .
And of course , I would n't know funny if it bit me on the ass .
I will begin with my now - traditional exhortation about what this contest is not .
It is not a " funniest sentence " contest .
It 's relatively easy to make people laugh with you , if you try .
In the past I 've attached long lists of such entries , but this time I 'll keep it to just three : Larry , the dung beetle , was in tears outside the soda shop , having realized that his dung ball had been stolen while he had been inside enjoying a cola and some dung .
Norm Macdonald , is that you ?
No , actually it 's someone named Dave McKenzie , who submitted way too many entries to be considered even if they had been the right sort of thing .
Here 's another of his :
The familiar " Arf! Arf! Boom ! ! " jolted Captain Lance Westwood out of a dream and reminded him that the war against the planet of the dog people was n't going well .
And one from longtime contributor Mark Silcox :
The slender Zap - gun shivered lewdly in Captain Freck 's hand , then whispered " ka - pow " and squirted its laser into the damp cave .
Again , what this contest is going for is a simulation of unintentional comedy — we should be laughing at your entry , not with it .
This is hard to do on purpose .
It 's a lot easier when you 're not trying .
For instance , I just went to the suspiciously heterosexual Amazon bestseller list and pulled up the top book , which was something called Liberty and Tyranny by one Mark Levin .
It begins :
There is simply no scientific or mathematical formula that defines conservatism .
See , that would be a winning entry in this year 's contest !
It raises a number of questions : who exactly does the author think he 's disabusing of the notion that a political belief system can be rendered as a " scientific or mathematical formula " ?
What distinction does he believe he 's drawing between scientific formulas and mathematical ones ?
How deep into this imaginary argument is he that he thinks he needs to add the word " simply " ?
Most importantly , it does n't make me want to learn the answers to any of these questions .
The first sentence convinces me that the author is n't going anywhere with this that I have any interest in following .
On the other hand , this entry sounds like a setup :
As a secretary , Penny was skilled in answering multi-line phones , receptionist duties , copying , faxing and documenting things , but as her performance evaluation noted , she was n't very good at filing .
( John Vent )
The rhythm of this sentence suggests that the author is going somewhere with this .
Heck , I can finish it myself .
" As a secretary , Penny was skilled in answering multi-line phones , receptionist duties , copying , faxing and documenting things , but as her performance evaluation noted , she was n't very good at filing .
A memo about the new parking policy might be found under H for ' horseless carriages , ' while a cash payment was likely to end up in the Jaa - Jal drawer in a folder labeled ' Jackson , Andrew , portraits of . '
Thus , Penny was fired , and a new secretary brought in who did n't quite understand the intricacies of the phone system .
And that is how , in attempting to put me on hold , she wound up connecting me to the private conference call in which CEO Avner Wilkrest ordered me killed . "
Or something like that .
Here 's another :
At sixteen , Ben understood the emotional depth of the world around him and he had a number of respectable poems to prove it .
( Erin Spradlin )
That would indeed suggest a bad novel if I thought for a moment that the author was n't being sardonic .
But since clearly this will be a satire at Ben 's expense , it is just plain funny rather than unintentionally so .
And it 's well - written enough that I 'd certainly read on .
Another example :
She swabbed her pale neck with alcohol .
" I 'm ready , " she cooed .
He licked his canines , anticipating the germ - free surface of her skin and the taste of her blood .
( anonymous ) OCD vampire !
I 'm sold !
Clearly this author has a future in comedy !
And that 's why her entry did n't appear among the winners .
Because that 's not what this contest is about .
We 're not supposed to be laughing with you , but at you , and while , as noted , that 's easy enough to pull off when you 're not trying , it 's harder when you are .
And the best example I found this year was the winner of the 2009 Lyttle Lytton Contest :
The mighty frigate Indestructible rounded the Horn of Africa and lurched eastard .
Now that 's bad !
As soon as you hit the name of the ship you can smell the cheap irony coming , and the " ooh , look how nautical I am ! " reference to the Horn of Africa is immediately trumped by the trying - even - harder apostrophe in " east 'ard . "
However , I imagine the second - place winner will be more popular : Pika ... chu , thought Pikachu .
Ten years ago that probably would have netted the author a three - book deal worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 600,000 .
And speaking of ten years ago , let 's start the honorable mentions , presented in no particular order :
Alex turned to Gertrude , in much the same way Martin Landau turned to Barbara Bain in the opening of Space : 1999 .
A novel whose every simile is a television reference might seem a little unrealistic , but is n't that basically Bill Simmons 's career ?
As long as we 're living in the past , let 's party like it 's 2005 , when a paean to a certain beach sport won first prize :
For many , surfing can be a pleasant and enjoyable pastime , if you like surfing , but not Peter .
I received entries within minutes of each other from about a hundred and fifty Leggatts .
Apparently they were having a little intra-family contest .
Cormac is the winner .
Cormac , if this means you get envy - fueled dinner rolls thrown at you at Thanksgiving , I am sorry .
And now let 's relive those heady days of 2007 : Zamboni doubled — nay , TRIPLED over in happiness - demolishing agonies .
This one wins a mention for " happiness - demolishing , " which is n't quite as memorable as 2007's " unending holocaust of pain " but bears the same hallmark .
Speaking of taking a quick jaunt to the past : I have the ability to go through time , he suddenly remembered while at a bus stop near a tree .
This is what we in the business call " painting a word picture . "
Setting is so important !
Sometimes painting that word picture requires the imperative mood , or the suggestion thereof : Deep space .
The silence of the void .
Shh .
I try not to fall for the same gimmicks every year , but here are a few that do some of the usual things well .
Unnecessary explanation : Deborah walked briskly down the street with pants on her legs .
Jerrys wife looked forward to a romantic time with him , Jerry .
 Ooh la la !  whispered Larry in French .
The thing that gets me about the third one is that not only is it unnecessary explanation , I 'm not entirely sure that " ooh la la " really counts as French .
Near - miss comparison : Farmer John admired the golden corn , sprouting from the ground like buried treasure .
It seems like it should work !
Corn and treasure are indeed usually roughly the same color .
You do indeed place both in a hole in the ground .
And both do spontaneously erupt from the earth after — oh , wait , that would be the sticking point , would n't it .
Continuing with matters underfoot :  Tectonic plates fascinate me ,  she says , her eyes swiftly darting from my eyes to the ground , and back again .
That 's probably too far over the line into deliberate comedy , but I could n't resist .
And let 's conclude the originals with one more :  I hope I win ,  thought Ernest , blinking laboriously ; he was proud to represent his country in the Olympics , but  What did it all mean ? 
What indeed ?
See , winning is n't everything .
Sometimes it just brings on existential angst .
On to the Found contest .
In the past , most of these have been repurposed from non-fictional sources , but this year a number of entries cited bestselling novels .
I found one myself , which should n't really count because I know Neal Stephenson would n't write a sentence this astonishingly awful except for his own amusement .
Nonetheless , from The Confusion : " Caramba ! " exclaimed Diego de Fonseca , " a cucaracha has fallen onto the tortillas of my wife ! "
This is the actual beginning of the Mexico City chapter , and in its own way it 's kind of a masterpiece .
I may get married just so I can refer to " the tortillas of my wife , " but only in written contexts where I can apply the italics .
But the winner should not be going for something dire on purpose , so the winner of the Found contest is : Despite having ascended to the most powerful political office in the world , President Zachary Herney was average in height , with a slender build and narrow shoulders .
Wow .
Just ... wow .
Yes , I know that presidents tend to be tall , but still ... that 's the contrast you 're going with ?
It reminds me of a story I wrote in which I included a " surprisingly average - sized gang member , " but , like , I was a child then .
Seriously , man , this is supposed to be a prose novel — try to be less transparent about writing it for the casting agents .
Sheesh .
A leg and part of a torso lay on the sidewalk — the remains of Alan Tompkins .
Mark notes , " Try imagining the scene without guessing as to which part of the torso . "
He also points out " the implication that the viewpoint character has just identified Tompkins from his leg and torso - part . "
Dan Brown and LaHaye / Jenkins are among the bestselling writers of our era .
We are all doomed .
Here 's one from another bestseller , though not a novel : Huang Lee has a simple mission : deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny .
This raises the question of how often Asian - Americans who themselves have Anglo names decide to play up the ethnic heritage angle .
Like , if Matt and Lisa Sullivan of Somerville can stick their kid with something like Siobhan , do Tim and Amy Lee of Sunnyvale ever say , " Fuck it — we 're going with Huang " ?
A more obscure source now : Org of Otterland was not Duke Og and Duchess Dina 's first child , for that honor belonged to Natalya , brown - haired , eyed , and furred .
Fanfic ( or in this case a vanity - press novel ) is kind of easy pickings , but nostalgia won out here , for this reminded me of the beginning of Stephen Ratliff 's " Time Speeder " : " Lyam Sympton was your average human from the outside .
You would have never guessed that those brown eyes and brown hair covered a obsessed man . "
And hey , suddenly I 'm on to the last couple .
This one is one of the old - style repurposings :
No matter what you believe , whether you re Christian , Muslim , or Jew , this is where it probably happened .
There 's a lot I could say about that one , but for right now I think I 'll just marvel at the placement of the word " probably . "
And here we have someone who may not have been 100 % clear on word definitions :
The door , which had been left open a few inches , was ajar .
And that just about covers 2009 .
Which means that next year is ( ulp ) the tenth go - round with this thing .
Yet another occasion upon which to ask , criminy , where the hell did that decade go ?

Real Madrid 's relentless pursuit of Cristiano Ronaldo will manifest itself in the Spanish club making their first official contact with Manchester United to propose a world - record £ 75 m transfer .
Refusing to be put off by United 's insistence that the player is not for sale , Real 's president , Florentino Pérez , reiterated that he still wanted to bring Ronaldo to the Bernabéu despite the £ 59 m signing of Kaka from Milan .
Pérez has been encouraged by Ronaldo 's representatives , who are intent on making the deal happen , and said he planned to speak to his counterpart at Old Trafford , David Gill , as well as the United manager , Sir Alex Ferguson .
" Ronaldo is a great player who we would like to bring to the club but first we have to speak to Manchester United because the important thing is for us to maintain a good rapport with everyone , " said Pérez .
" Kaka is [ just ] the first signing .
We are always thinking about great players .
Cristiano Ronaldo [ is ] among the other great players around the world .
I will do everything possible to get Ronaldo to Real Madrid . "
Pérez went on to speak about his admiration for Zlatan Ibrahimovich , the Internazionale forward , but he distanced himself from reports that Liverpool 's Xabi Alonso could also be signed .
" He is a great player but he also plays in a big team and I have n't heard any news that they ­[ Liverpool ] plan to sell him . "
Madrid also appear to have cooled their interest in Luis Antonio Valencia , leaving United in a strong position if they wish to follow up last week 's approach for the Wigan Athletic attacker .
" The only official offer has been from Real Madrid last January , " the player 's agent , Diego Herrera , said last night .
" I do n't know about Pérez , the offer came from the previous president [ Ramón Calderón ] so I do n't know if they are going to go for him again . "
Valencia would favour a move to Old Trafford rather than Madrid and Herrera added : " I feel it is the right time for him to leave , now that the Wigan manager [ Steve Bruce ] has left .
He has three more years on his contract but he feels it is time to move on . "
Meanwhile , the Barcelona president , Joan Laporta , has criticised Real Madrid and accused his counterpart Pérez of " distorting " the transfer market , in reference to the Kaka signing and the pursuit of Ronaldo .
" To pay these quantities is exorbitant , " Laporta said .
" It does not fit in with the reality of the market and it 's too risky .
It 's distorting it . "
Laporta says Real 's massive spending power does not worry him following a spectacular season for Barcelona during which they lifted the treble of La Liga , the Copa del Rey and the Champions League .
Barça have been linked to high - profile deals of their own but their president claims he will not be following their rivals ' example .
" We only have to make touch - ups , " Laporta said .
" I 'm trebly calm . "

On Hardball just now , Dem commentator said Sanford used public money to go to Argentina .
I 'm getting a link as we speak .
He claimed Politico was about to break that news , but I do n't see it yet .
UPDATE : Chris Matthews is asking Andrea Mitchell , who also says , " Politico is working on that story . "
UPDATE : Family Research Council removes Sanford ’s picture from Values Voters Summit website .
Spanish horror film REC 2 , the sequel to 2007's excellent REC , is another exercise in claustrophobic horror .
While the prequel was heavy on the hand - held camera , REC 2 employs camera mounted on the soldiers ' helmets .
It 's a bit like watching a first - person - shooter .

This is hardly a first — other movies have done this before .
But REC was quite effective in the scary department , so we 're willing to give REC 2 the benefit of the doubt before jumping to conclusions .
The upside ?
It should be easy to make a game version of this flick .

Security forces continued to patrol Urumqi on Saturday
Some three - quarters of the victims of the violence in China 's western Xinjiang region were ethnic Han Chinese , the official death toll shows .
Of 184 people known to have died , 137 were Han Chinese , 46 were from the indigenous Uighur community and one was an ethnic Hui , local officials said .
Beijing flooded the regional capital Urumqi with security forces to stem the violence which erupted last Sunday .
Correspondents say some Uighurs believe their own death toll was much higher .
" I 've heard that more than 100 Uighurs have died but nobody wants to talk about it in public , " one Uighur man in Urumqi who did not want to give his name told the Associated Press news agency .
Uighurs living in exile outside China have also disputed the Chinese figures .
Rebiya Kadeer , the US - based head of the World Uighur Congress , said she believed about 500 people had died .
According to the Chinese death toll released by state media , 26 of the 137 Han Chinese victims were female , while all but one of the 45 Uighurs killed were male .
The single death recorded in the Hui community , another Muslim minority group , was that of a male .

After weeks of layoff announcements in the tech sector , the tally is in : Tech firms laid off a staggering 84,217 employees last quarter , according to outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
Layoffs were up 27 percent over the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 485 percent when compared to the first quarter of 2008 .
In total , the tech sector accounted for 14.6 percent of the layoffs announced during the first quarter , up from 12.7 percent of all announced layoffs in 2008 .
Challenger , Gray & Christmas splits the tech sector into three broad categories : telecom , computer and electronics .
The telecom sector actually saw a small drop in the number of layoffs compared to last quarter .
Computer ( which would include a company like Yahoo ) and electronics saw big jumps .
Not surprisingly , Challenger , Gray & Christmas does n’t expect things to get much better anytime soon , citing a recent Forrester Research study which shows that IT spending will drop 3.1 percent this year .
And as tech firms begin to take advantage of the downturn to purchase competitors , layoffs will only increase , the firm says .
Indeed , only a small fraction of the job cuts announced so far this year were due to mergers or acquisitions .
The consolation : Tech - sector job cuts still are n’t as bad as they were during the dot - com bust .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government has decided the fate of about half the detainees at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp , and no more than a quarter of them will go on trial , Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday .

President Barack Obama ’s order for the prison for foreign terrorism suspects on a naval base in Cuba to be closed by the end of January has met resistance in Congress where some lawmakers are opposing any transfers to the United States .
Last week nine prisoners were transferred to Saudi Arabia , Bermuda , Iraq and Chad .
One prisoner , Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , accused of involvement in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Africa , was sent to New York and became the first detainee transferred to the United States for trial by civilian court .
“ We ’ve gone through about half of the detainees at this point , ” Holder said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing .
There are 229 captives still being held at Guantanamo .
The camp , opened after the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States , drew international criticism for holding prisoners indefinitely , many without charge .
When pressed on whether the number of detainees to go to trial would be 25 percent or less , Holder replied : “ That might be about right . ”
A Justice Department spokesman said the final number of Guantanamo Bay detainees who would be recommended for trial had not been determined .
He would not provide a breakdown of what had been decided for half the Guantanamo Bay prison population in which a determination had been made .
Obama has said that some of the prisoners may end up being held without trial , and Holder said in those cases there would likely be some form of periodic review of their status .
Some U.S. lawmakers who have expressed concern about bringing Guantanamo Bay prisoners to the United States say it would be too dangerous even to hold them in jail .
Senator Patrick Leahy , the Democratic chairman of the committee , challenged those concerns and said in the debate over allowing the detainees into the United States “ political rhetoric has drowned out reason and reality . ”
He said the U.S. criminal justice system had safely handled extremely dangerous criminals and “ more than a few terrorists . ”
WASHINGTON , June 29 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama inspires the most confidence of any world leader , according to a global poll released on Monday , with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin earning the lowest marks .
The poll of people in 20 countries , which include nearly two - thirds of the world 's population , found an average of 62 percent had some or a lot of confidence in Obama to do the right thing in world affairs .
No other world leader inspired confidence from more than 40 percent in the poll .
Ahmadinejad , whose disputed re-election has sparked street protests in Iran , had the confidence of 28 percent he would do the right thing , while 49 percent had no confidence in him .
Putin had confidence from 34 percent , while 50 percent did not have confidence in him , the poll found .
" At this moment Obama occupies a unique position in the eyes of the world , " said Stephen Weber of WorldPublicOpinion.org , which conducted the survey .
" His communication skills and the change he represents create an open door for him to engage people around the world , " he said .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel had the second - highest positive rating behind Obama of any national leader , with an average of 40 percent expressing confidence and 38 percent not having confidence in her .
The ratings for U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also leaned more positive , 40 percent , than negative , 35 percent .
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France showed improvement from a confidence rating of 30 percent in a 2008 poll to 34 percent this year , although 45 percent did not have confidence in him .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown had the confidence of 36 percent , with 45 percent giving him negative marks .
Chinese President Hu Jintao inspired confidence in an average of 32 percent , while 44 percent did not have confidence .
The poll was conducted in China , India , the United States , Indonesia , Nigeria , Pakistan , Russia , Mexico , Germany , Britain , France , Poland , Azerbaijan , Ukraine , Kenya , Egypt , Turkey , Iraq , the Palestinian territories and South Korea .
The poll of 19,224 respondents was conducted between April 4 and June 12 and had a margin of error of 3 to 4 percent .

The persistent outbreaks of workers ' anger continue in the Bangladeshi garment industry .
A strike escalates ...
Savar , central Bangladesh ( a center of textiles and agriculture ) ; for several days last week 1800 workers at a sweater factory in Ashulia had been striking in demand of a pay increase and settlement of outstanding wages .
Management finally agreed to the demands on Thursday .
But on returning to work on Saturday ( 27 June ) three workers who had taken leading roles in the agitation and negotiations were told they were sacked " on charges of leading the demonstrations " .
On learning this the workforce immediately left the factory to demonstrate and to demand the reinstatement of their three fellow workers .
This led to fierce arguments and then scuffles with the factory bosses , two of whom were reported to be beaten up .
Soon after police and Ansars ( a civilian volunteer defence group , an auxiliary to the professional security forces ) arrived ; police began firing tear gas shells to try to disperse the demonstration , which now blocked a main highway - workers responded with hails of stones and bricks .
Then the Ansars opened fire with live rounds of bullets into the crowd .
Two workers were shot - one , Al - Amin , 26 , died later at 12.30 pm in hospital .
The Ansars later claimed that they were forced to fire as workers were trying take their weapons from them .
This could well be just a convenient excuse for their killing ; but , considering the consistently high level of ( often violent ) class struggle among Ready Made Garment ( RMG ) workers , it would not be very surprising if workers were prepared to take such action .
The common practice is for striking RMG workers to walk out of their factory and make a procession around other nearby factories in the industrial zone to bring out other workers in solidarity .
One wonders what would develop if such a procession was to be led by a group of armed workers with recently seized guns ...
As news of Al - Amin 's death spread , during the afternoon the workers ' numbers swelled ; joined by workers from other factories striking in solidarity and then further swelled by other RMG factories being closed early by bosses due to fears of the unrest spreading to their premises .
The insurgent crowd then occupied the Ashulia factory , smashing windows and wrecking offices .
They remained in occupation an hour and a half , during which time they set fire to the the factory 's warehouse and torched a company pick - up truck .
The workers then broke into the hated Ansars ' camp situated in the factory grounds - and promptly set fire to it .
In response the Ansars fired more rounds - enraging the growing numbers of workers as factory property continued to be attacked .
The ' officer - in - charge of Ashulia police station , said , " We picked up the Ansars personnel along with their arms to ease the situation and save them from the angry mob . " '
40 workers and police were injured in the clashes .
The surviving shot worker remains in critical condition .
The Ansars in Savar have a history of clashes with RMG workers in recent years and are sometimes deployed within factory compounds as a semi- permanent para- military presence ( see , for example ; http://libcom.org/news/bangladesh-garment-workers-attack-factories-thousands-wildcat-riot-11082008).
The police eventually brought the unrest to an end , aided by deployment of the notorious Rapid Action Batallion ( RAB ; elite anti-crime / anti- terrorist paramilitary force famous for summary executions - known as " crossfiring " where victims are routinely reported as ' killed in crossfire ' ) .
As they have admitted , the RMG unions really have a very limited influence over workers ' struggles ( see quotes here , under ' unions admit " no control " ' ; http://libcom.org/news/bangladesh-militarized-factory-visions-devouring-demons-capital-15092008).
Most garment sector struggles are expression of a quite capable workers ' self - organisation .
But the unions have organised protests against the Savar killing to take place the following day ( Sunday ) across the country .
This incident is only the latest in a series of recent similar clashes in the Bangladeshi garment sector .
As the economic crisis hits harder one can expect more of the same - and a likely escalation ...

War Crimes and the White House :
The Bush Administration 's Cover - Up of the Dasht - e - Leili Massacre
( Transcript of Video )
FRANK DONAGHUE ( CEO , Physicians for Human Rights ) : A new administration is in the White House .
And the prison at Guantanamo Bay will soon be closed .
But the investigation intowar crimes must not close with it .
Guantanamo is neither the end nor the beginning of the story .
The Bush Administration 's blatant disregard for the rule of law goes back before Gitmo , before Abu Ghraib , and before the CIA " Black Sites " .
It goes back to Dasht - e - Leili .
NARRATOR ( Jared Voss ) :
In November 2001 , as many as 2,000 prisoners are believed to have been murdered by US Allied Afghan troops and buried in a mass grave in Dasht - e - Leili , Afghanistan .
These Afghan troops were operating jointly with American forces .
The New York Times has revealed that the Bush administration blocked at least three separate investigations into these alleged war crimes .
This revelation comes after nearly eight years of advocacy and investigation by Physicians for Human Rights .
Citing a former FBI agent and other sources , the Times reports that , beginning in 2002 , senior Bush administration officials obstructed a series of criminal probes by the FBI , Defense Department , and State Department .
This story begins in Northern Afghanistan , November 2001 , when thousands of Taliban and foreign fighters surrendered to US Special Forces and the troops of Afghan warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum , a notoriously brutal US ally in the Northern Alliance .
The prisoners were promised they would not be harmed .
NATHANIEL RAYMOND ( PHR ’s Lead Researcher , Dasht - e- Leili Investigation ) : Instead , Dostum packed them in shipping containers where they were carried in a convoy through the desert .
According to US government documents obtained by PHR , up to 2,000 people died during that convoy .
They were buried at a place called Dasht - e - Leili , which is a mass grave site near Sheberghan , Afghanistan .
SUSANNAH SIRKIN ( PHR Deputy Director ) : PHR discovered the grave while we were
investigating the conditions at the Sheberghan prison in northern Afghanistan .
Our team found conditions at that prison to be absolutely deplorable .
There were 3,000 prisoners in an overcrowded place that lacked heat , adequate nutrition .
Prisoners were dying of illness , and lack of sanitation , and hunger .
At the time , our investigators also heard stories about a mass grave right near the prison .
And they saw some of the outlines of such a site .
So under the auspices of the UN , our International Forensic Program conducted an initial examination of part of the grave , exhumed some bodies , and conducted autopsies and found those deaths were consistent with suffocation .
NARRATOR : First privately and then publicly , PHR appealed to US and Afghan authorities to fully investigate this alleged massacre .
They called for evidence to be preserved and witnesses protected .
Despite these appeals , Afghan eyewitnesses were tortured , murdered , or simply
disappeared .
NATHANIEL RAYMOND : The Pentagon had said that only a few dozen prisoners had died during transport , of their wounds or of disease .
The Pentagon also said that they had verbally debriefed the Special Forces when they returned from Afghanistan , and did n’t need to do further investigation .
NARRATOR : Not only was the incident not investigated , but that year , General Dostum was brought into the Afghan government as Deputy Defense Minister under President Hamid Karzai .
And it has now been revealed that General Dostum was actually on the payroll of the CIA .
Two of Dostum ’s supporters were Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz .
According to the New York Times , officials told Wolfowitz that Dostum may have committed a war crime .
Wolfowitz said they would not go after him for that .
SUSANNAH SIRKIN :
It was the policy of the US and Afghan governments to bring in the Afghan warlords who were , many of whom were alleged war criminals and were the cause of the mass graves across Afghanistan -- to bring them into the government .
NARRATOR : A few survivors of the Dasht - e - Leili massacre were transported to Guantanamo Bay , where Dell Spry served as Special Agent in Charge of FBI Interrogations .
NATHANIEL RAYMOND : According to the New York Times , Special Agent Spry and his team of FBI agents at Guantanamo interviewed 10 detainees .
Special Agent Spry submitted this information to FBI headquarters in Washington .
But he was ordered not to investigate .
NARRATOR : In August 2002 , Newsweek magazine , using information provided by PHR , published an exclusive cover story detailing allegations about the massacre .
The release of this story pressured the US and Afghan governments to publicly voice support for a joint investigation .
But when the State Department attempted to launch this investigation , the Bush White House shut them down .
SUSANNAH SIRKIN :
So over the next few years , PHR waited for an investigation to take place at the Dasht - e - Leili grave .
We at the same time worked with the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission to train Afghan justice , police , and forensics people in the techniques for documenting graves .
And we started exercises to map all the mass graves in
Afghanistan .
Our biggest fear all along was that someone might tamper with the Dasht - e - Leili grave and destroy the evidence up there .
And at the same time , we kept seeking information from the US government , from the Afghan government , about the Dasht - e - Leili grave and what happened up
there .
NARRATOR : With the White House continually blocking their requests for information and investigation , PHR had only one option left .
In 2006 , they filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking all US government documents related to Dasht - e - Leili .
After being stonewalled for more than a year , PHR took legal action to force the Government to comply .
NATHANIEL RAYMOND : We sued .
And finally , we received documents that indicated the US government believed up to 2,000 prisoners died during the Dasht - e - Leili incident .
NARRATOR : Soon after they obtained those documents , a member of PHR's International Forensic Program discovered that the Dasht - e - Leili grave site had been compromised and evidence had been removed .
McClatchy Newspapers reported that , according to Afghan government officials and local law enforcement , fearing retribution , General Dostum allegedly had his men dig up the site and remove the remains .
SUSANNAH SIRKIN :
And it looks as though today , much of the evidence in that grave has literally been removed .
How could this happen after all of the information has come out about this site ?
After the Newsweek report ?
After PHR ’s investigation ?
After the UN has asked for protection ?
After the Afghan government and the US government have said that it is a crime
that should be investigated ?
NATHANIEL RAYMOND : Leading international law scholars who have reviewed the Dasht - e - Leili case believe that this massacre represents a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and is a war crime .
Under international law , the cover - up of a war crime is itself a war crime .
NARRATOR : From Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay , from the FBI to the White House , the Bush Administration covered it up .
FRANK DONAGHUE : Witnesses have been tortured and killed and evidence has now been destroyed .
US law enforcement was obstructed by the Bush administration .
But , PHR , working side - by - side with some of the nation 's top investigative journalists , continued to pursue truth and
accountability .
Without these reporters , and without Physicians for Human Rights , this story never would have been told .
And it 's now up to Attorney General [ Eric ]
Holder to continue the work that PHR and others have started .
And it 's now up to you to join PHR in demanding that justice be served .
Sign our petition calling on our elected leaders to conduct a fair , full , non-partisan examination of the
facts .
NARRATOR : To learn more and take action , visit AfghanMassGrave.org .
FRANK DONAGHUE : And help make accountability a reality .
In April 2002 , Physicians for Human Rights forensic experts dug a test trench as part of a preliminary investigation for the UN at the Dasht - e - Leili mass grave site near Sheberghan , Afghanistan , and exposed 15 bodies .

Being a New York woman in the Obama administration seems like a dangerous thing to be these days .
First , Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor broke her ankle in a fall en route to Washington from New York .
Now , former New York Sen. Hillary Clinton , who 's already safely traveled thousands of miles around the world as President Obama 's secretary of State , tripped and fell near the White House on Wednesday , breaking her right elbow .
( See right elbow above . )
The 61 - year - old former first lady was en route to a meeting there and was treated and released from George Washington University Hospital .
According to a brief midnight announcement from an aide , Clinton will undergo surgery next week to repair the damage .
So much for handshaking for a while .
Sotomayor is making her way around Capitol Hill to Senate interviews on crutches .

The European Union fined energy giants E.On AG of Germany and GDF Suez SA of France € 1.1 billion ( $ 1.53 billion ) for agreeing not to compete on sales of natural gas in each other 's home markets .
The fine -- the second highest ever assessed in an EU cartel case -- reflects the desire of the European Commission , the bloc 's executive arm , to force EU - wide competition in the energy sector -- despite reluctance from some member countries .

Kids today need a good beating every now and then .
If you do n't beat your kids when they fall out of line , the next thing you know your son will go off and bang some dude in the ass just out of spite .
You tell them to clean their room , they say " no , " you smack them .
It 's simple ; it works .
Do n't listen to these assholes on TV with their bullshit hippy psycho babble ; if they had it their way , every child would be raised in a pastel colored room with Philip Glass pumped through the speakers 24 hours a day .
Then again , it might not be all that bad because it will make your kids complacent , so it wo n't be as hard for them to swallow when they realize that they 'll be spending the rest of their lives chained to a desk in a cubicle writing reports to make someone else rich .
The problem is that kids today think their opinions matter .
By not beating your kids , they get a skewed perspective of reality where they start thinking that they have it rough and that they can get away with dying their hair and listening to Insane Clown Posse .
That 's where you need to come in and put the law down .
To help you , the negligent parent , I 've put together a guide to smacking your kids for your convenience ( hint : you may want to even print this guide up and hang it on your fridge as a reminder to both you and your kids ) .
Here are some useful techniques :
Five across the eyes .
This is a very basic maneuver and usually enough to cover most situations when your child is out of line .
Simply put four fingers tightly together and either leave the thumb off to the side or fold it behind the other four fingers .
Then smack your kid across the face with the back of your hand .
Now this is the tricky part : make sure to snap your wrist just before contact otherwise you wo n't get a stinging effect .
Very important because you do n't want to risk letting your kid think you 're a pussy .
The sucker punch .
Just ask the question " hey , what 's that on your shirt ? " and when they look down , bust their lip .
You need to do this every now and then to keep them guessing .
Do n't ever let them off the hook .
Just because they 're not doing anything wrong does n't mean that they did n't do something wrong earlier that you were n't aware of .
The yard stick .
Or for those of you who do n't use the arbitrary American system , this is also known as " the meter stick . "
This is a good general purpose beating because the stick usually does n't last beyond three or four good whacks -- usually enough to send the message .
The one - two shut - the - hell - up .
This is priceless when you 're shopping and your kid wo n't shut the hell up : " I 'm hungry , I want toys , I need my Insulin ... " etc .
First smack your kid ( the 5 across the eyes technique works ) .
Wait a few seconds for your kid to start crying , then smack your kid again to let him know that you mean business .
This usually shuts them up because they see that the amount of crying is proportional to the amount of beatings .
The 2 x 4 / PVC pipe .
If you do your job as a parent , this should never have to be administered .
This is for heavy duty jobs only ( ie .
any time your kid comes home and begins a sentence with " she might be pregnant ... " or " I can _____ if I want to ... " where the blank can be any of the following : smoke , have sex , experiment with drugs , watch Oprah , etc ) .
Usually the threat of this beating is enough to keep your kid from screwing up .
The Dragon Kick .
If you 're interested in a permanent solution to your child giving you lip about washing the dishes , cleaning his or her room or filing your tax return , then the Dragon kick might be the technique for you .
I guarantee that you will only have to ask once after the Dragon kick has been administered .
The skull thump .
A quick blow usually dealt to the side or back of the head .
Simply flick them in the head with your finger .
An alternative is to smack your child up side the head with your palm .
Very useful for teaching your child to read when he or she makes a mistake .
Hitting your child when he or she is learning builds confidence , or undermines confidence -- I can't remember which .
The one - handed chauffeur reach around .
A quick reach around while you 're driving to smack your kid and his friends too if they disrespect .
Swerve the car back and forth for the full effect .
The cane intercept .
If you 're too old to chase your kid around the house , use the handle of your cane to trip him if he tries to get away .
When he gets up , poke him in the head a few times to let him know who 's boss .
There you have it .
Use these basic techniques to discipline your child if you want him or her to turn out to be a success story like me .
Here 's how to tell if you 've fulfilled your obligations as a parent :

It my seem like I 'm pushing on this one a bit , but it 's because I am honestly surprised that the NY Times got this one so badly wrong , and that they 've been so slow to do anything about it .
I actually think the NY Times is an excellent overall newspaper , and I 'm as surprised as anyone that they 'd muck up a story so much -- especially as its editors are hyping how good their " fact checking " is and how every day people just can't compare .
It started on Friday , when we noted that the NY Times was reporting that The Pirate Bay had lost its appeal in court .
The only problem ?
It had n't .
Not even close .
It may eventually lose the appeal , but that decision wo n't come for some time .
It 's true that other sources ( including The Hollywood Reporter article that the NY Times reporter relied on ) also got the story slightly screwed up , but that 's no excuse for the NY Times to repeat blatantly incorrect information .
The error appears to be caused by the confusion about the difference between a district ( lower ) court and the appeals ( higher ) court .
The appeal is over whether or not the district court judge in the case was biased .
So , as a part of that appeal , the district court told the appeals court that , no , its judge was not biased .
This is to be expected .
Did anyone think that the district court would n't defend its judge ?
However , many people simply got confused , and when they read that a Stockholm district court said ( in the appeals court ) that the judge was n't biased , they assumed that it was a , not just testimony / a filing from one of the participants .
Still , you would think with a story that 's received so much attention that the NY Times wouldwith someone first to make sure such a ruling actually came down .
On Monday , however , some of our readers noted that the NY Times had " updated " or " corrected " its story .
However , the really amazing thing ?
Evenrealizing that it got the story wrong , ithas n't gotten the story right .
Instead , they changed the first sentence from : " A Swedish court has denied the appeal of four men convicted of violating copyright law .... " into " A Swedish court has said that the judge who presided over the case of four men convicted of violating copyright law for their involvement in the Pirate Bay , an Internet file - sharing service , was not biased against them .
" Okay , that 'sbut still wrong .
First , the NY Times left the headline as is , saying " Appeal Is Denied in Pirate Bay Case . "
Then , the current first sentence does n't makedistinction at all between what the lower court said as ain the higher court case and what the higher court will ultimately pronounce as a ruling .
In fact , given the headline , nearly everyone would still read that first sentence to say that the court has issued a ruling denying bias .
The NY Times also added this correction line that would likely confuse most people , saying : " An earlier version of this report stated that the men 's appeal had been denied . "
But reading the article , itlike the appeal has been denied .
Is it that difficult for a big journalistic endeavor like the NY Times to fact check a story ?
Even whenthat the story is wrong , and then going and " correcting " it , they got the story wrong .

The brain processes visual information from the eye Scientists say they have solved the mystery of how a girl with half a brain has near perfect vision in one eye .
The experts were baffled by the 10 - year - old girl who was born missing the right side of her brain , whose job it is to map the left field of vision .
Scans revealed the German girl 's brain rewired itself during development when she was still in her mother 's womb .
The University of Glasgow researchers report the findings in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The girl 's underdeveloped brain was discovered when , aged three , she underwent an MRI scan after suffering seizures of brief involuntary twitching on her left side .
The brain has amazing plasticity but we were quite astonished to see just how well the single hemisphere of the brain in this girl has adapted to compensate for the missing half
Lead researcher Dr Lars Muckli Apart from the seizures , which were successfully treated , and slight weakness on her left side , the girl has had a normal medical history , attending school and taking part in regular activities .
In other cases , where patients have half of the brain removed to treat severe epilepsy , for example , one field of vision is lost in both eyes , meaning they see only objects on the left or right side of their vision .
In the case of the German girl , her left and right field vision is almost perfect in one eye .
The scan shows how half of the girl 's brain is missing Scans on the girl showed that the retinal nerve fibres carrying visual information from the back of the eye which should have gone to the right hemisphere of the brain diverted to the left .
Dr Lars Muckli , of the university 's Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging , working with German colleagues from Frankfurt , said : " The brain has amazing plasticity but we were quite astonished to see just how well the single hemisphere of the brain in this girl has adapted to compensate for the missing half .
" Despite lacking one hemisphere , the girl has normal psychological function and is perfectly capable of living a normal and fulfilling life .
She is witty , charming and intelligent . "
He said understanding the powerful algorithms the brain uses to rewire itself could help advance artificial intelligence work .

While speaking at the National Press Club today , former vice president Dick Cheney , passed blame for 9/11 away from the Bush administration and on to former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke .
Cheney said , Dick Clarke , who was the head of the counterrorism program in the run-up to 9/11 .
He obviously missed it . ”
This stated with an op - ed that Clarke wrote in yesterday ’s Washington Post .
Clarke wrote , “ Yes , Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice may have been surprised by the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 — but it was because they had not listened .
And their surprise led them to adopt extreme counterterrorism techniques — but it was because they rejected , without analysis , the tactics the Clinton administration had used .
The measures they uncritically adopted , which they simply assumed were the best available , were in fact unnecessary and counterproductive . ”
Here is the video of Cheney ’s response courtesy of Think Progress

Cheney said , “ You know , Dick Clarke .
Dick Clarke , who was the head of the counterrorism program in the run-up to 9/11 .
He obviously missed it .
The fact is that we did what we felt we had to do , and if I had to do it all over again , I would do exactly the same thing . ”
Cheney is ignoring the findings of the 9/11 Commission that Richard Clarke had been trying to warn Cheney and Bush for months before the attacks .
According to Philip Shenon ’s book The Commission – The Uncensored History Of The 9/11 Investigation , “ Emails from the National Security Council ’s counter - terrorism director , Richard Clarke , showed that he had bombarded Rice with messages about terrorist threats .
He was trying to get her to focus on the intelligence she should have been reading each morning in the presidential and senior briefings :
“ Bin Ladin Public Profile May Presage Attack ” ( May 3 )
“ Terrorist Groups Said Co-operating on US Hostage Plot ” ( May 23 )
“ Bin Ladin ’s Networks ’ Plans Advancing ” ( May 26 )
“ Bin Ladin Attacks May Be Imminent ” ( June 23 )
“ Bin Ladin and Associates Making Near - Term Threats ” ( June 25 )
“ Bin Ladin Planning High - Profile Attacks ” ( June 30 ) ,
“ Planning for Bin Ladin Attacks Continues , Despite Delays ” ( July 2 ) ”
Dick Cheney is lying when he claims that Richard Clarke missed it .
The people who missed it , or a better way to put it would be ignored it , were Dick Cheney , George W. Bush , and Condi Rice .
Cheney ’s lies are all part of his campaign to rehabilitate the image of the Bush administration , but there are mountains of evidence to contradict the statements of the former vice president .
Cheney is living in his own delusional little bubble where the Bush administration did nothing wrong .
Every time he speaks , he reveals a complete inability to take any responsibility for the past eight years .
The Bush administration treated the American people like they were stupid , and even out of office , Cheney continues to treat the public like fools .
Google has called prominent illustrators to create new skins for Google Chrome , but there 's a catch : they 're not offering them any money .
Similar to how artists created artwork for iGoogle , Google is not planning to compensate them for the work they 'll do for Chrome ; instead , they believe these projects are a good promotion for the artists .
This has provoked a lot of negative comments from prominent illustrators , who think that a ( very ) profitable company such as Google should pay them for their work .
Before I get swarmed by e-mails and comments from angry artists and illustrators , let me first say this : I 'm not saying that the work of designers and illustrators is worth nothing .
I 'm not saying they should n't be paid for their work .
Read on , please .
Google , like any other company , is for products and services .
If they need a designer or an illustrator for a specific project , I 'm sure they 'll hire one or pay an outsider to do it .
There 's a reason , however , why they are n't offering monetary compensation for skinning Chrome .
Google did n't set the price for such work at ( nearly ) zero ; the community did .
I know how hard it is to create a skin or a theme for an application or a site .
I 've created themes for Winamp ( that was really tough , with Winamp having a lot of tiny graphical elements making it quite complex to skin ) and Litestep ( which included learning the syntax of step.rc ) , and these projects can take weeks of very hard work .
Yes , I did these for free and for fun , but then again , I 'm not a professional illustrator or a designer .
However , even professional illustrators and designers should understand that they do n't get paid for these types of projects because Google is cheap , but because there 's a huge community of artists who have been doing it for free for years .
Go to a site such as DeviantART or WinCustomize ; you can find thousands of themes and skins for various sites and applications completely free .
Of course , pro illustrators may ( and often will ) choose not to do this type of work for free .
Fair enough .
However , many of them will undoubtedly feel that if others agree to do such work for free ( or for peanuts ) , it cheapens their profession and ultimately decreases their rates .
Illustrator Gary Taxali , whose post on art community site Drawger had drawn attention of other artists , many of whom agreed with him , expresses this sentiment :
" Google calls me and wants my work for their new search engine all over the web , the fee ?
Nothing .
Editorial clients are slashing 1999s fees almost in half and citing the bad economy as an excuse .
You know what ?
My excuse is that the economy is bad so you have to pay me MORE for an illustration .
Hows that for an economic stimulus package ? "
Skinning or theming is an odd beast ; it 's half art and half craft .
Often , you can create a great skin by doing a bunch of technical tricks to the images and the code ; you do n't need to be a great artist to do it .
It is therefore often considered a first step for a young artist on his way to becoming a pro designer , artist or illustrator .
Very few actually succeed ; most - like me - figure they 're better at the technical than the artsy side of things and move to other types of work .
In short , this is just one of those changes the Internet has brought .
A lot of people are willing to do certain things for free ; you can't really blame them for that , can you ?
There 's no reason for pro artists , designers and illustrators to fear .
Some aspects of their work - those that can be crowdsourced or those that are n't hard to do ( perhaps with the help of technology ) - will lose in value .
But there will always be a market for professionals , because most of what they 're doing can not be done by just anyone .
It 's important , however , that professionals in any trade learn , understand and ultimately adapt to the fact that social media and new tools that the Internet has provided us with are changing the landscape of their profession .
IRAVATHAM MAHADEVAN , an administrator - turned - scholar , has done acclaimed work on the Tamil - Brahmi and Indus scripts .
His Early Tamil Epigraphy ( From the Earliest Times to the Sixth Century A.D. ) , which was published in 2003 , is the fruit of 40 years of dedicated work on Tamil - Brahmi inscriptions .
His earlier work Corpus of Tamil - Brahmi inscriptions created a wave of exploration for Tamil - Brahmi inscriptions .
Mahadevan received the Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship in 1970 for research on the Indus script and was awarded the National Fellowship of the Indian Council of Historical Research in 1992 for his work on Tamil - Brahmi inscriptions .
He has also authored The Indus Script : Texts , Concordance and Tables .
He received the Padma Shri this year .
Excerpts from an interview Mahadevan gave Frontline on Tamil - Brahmi inscriptions and their place in history :
Tamil - Brahmi sites near Madurai are facing destruction owing to granite quarrying in the hills in which they are found .
The Jaina sculptures and beds situated adjacent to these are being vandalised .
What is the relevance of Tamil - Brahmi inscriptions in Indian history ?
Tamil - Brahmi inscriptions are important not only in the history of Tamil Nadu and the rest of South India but for the whole country .
They have many unique distinctions .
They are the oldest writings in any Dravidian language .
They are also the oldest Jaina inscriptions in India .
I believe that the Mankulam Tamil - Brahmi inscription of [ Pandyan king ]
Nedunchezhiyan is older than the Karavela inscription at Udayagiri in Orissa .
Tamil - Brahmi inscriptions are the only record of the old Tamil , the one prior to Sangam poetry .
Many Tamil - Brahmi inscriptions are important landmarks in our history .
For example , the inscriptions of Nedunchezhiyan at Mankulam , the Irumporai inscriptions at Pugalur near Karur and the Jambai inscription of Adhiyaman Neduman Anji link the Sangam age with the Tamil - Brahmi age .
It is the Jambai inscription that prove that the Satyaputo mentioned by Asoka was none other than the Adhiyaman dynasty , which ruled from Tagadur , modern Dharmapuri .
Recently , Tamil - Brahmi inscriptions have been found on hero stones in the upper Vaigai valley near megalithic graves , thus providing a link , for the first time , between the megalithic and the early historical periods of Tamil Nadu .
The Tamil - Brahmi inscriptions occurring on coins , rings , potsherds and seals add another dimension to the history of Tamil Nadu .
For example , the Pandyan coin of Peruvazhuthi or the silver portrait coins of Cheras .
There are also numerous gold , silver and bronze rings of merchants and noblemen from the prosperous trading town of Karur of the Sangam age .
Again , recently , excavations at Pattanam in Kerala have brought to light the remains of the ancient and famous Sangam age port of Musiri , known as Muziris to the classical historians of the West .
These facts demonstrate the importance of Tamil - Brahmi inscriptions to our history .
It is , therefore , a great tragedy that the cave inscriptions of Tamil - Brahmi and Jaina sculptures [ and beds ] are being systematically vandalised by ignorant tourists and destroyed by granite quarries .
It is impossible to stop quarrying because of vested interests and the money power and the muscle power at their disposal .
Already , in my lifetime , many Tamil - Brahmi cave inscriptions have been lost or have been damaged severely .
I understand from scholars undertaking recent field work that the destruction is now proceeding much faster .
It is sad that the public are indifferent [ to this ] , and the State government and the Central government are helpless to stop this wanton destruction of our cultural heritage .
Perhaps all the Tamil - Brahmi cave inscriptions will disappear within a decade .
The only consolation I have is that a serious attempt to record whatever remains by means of video photography and digitisation has been made by the classical Tamil project authorities .
In Early Tamil Epigraphy : From the Earliest Times to the Sixth Century A.D. , I had anticipated this disastrous development and I had pleaded for greater awareness of our cultural heritage and more purposeful steps for their conservation .
What I did not expect was that the destruction would be so swift and so colossal .
I can only shed tears at whatever has been lost as , frankly , I am not hopeful that whatever remains will be saved .
Do you think there has been a dereliction of duty on the part of the Archaeological Survey of India and the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department ?
I do not think that the ASI or the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department has been effective in preventing the vandalism and destruction .
I think that part of the problem is that the ASI and the Archaeology Department are headed by IAS officers who come and go at short intervals .
They are not scholars and have little interest in the academic and intellectual work of the department under them .
It is time the government of India and the State government recruited scholars of international repute by invitation to head the ASI and the State Archaeology Department for a fixed tenure .
Personally , I think it is also tragic that the original estampages of thousands of inscriptions from Tamil Nadu are stored in the Epigraphy Branch of the ASI in Mysore , out of reach for researchers in the State .
Originally , the office of the Government Epigraphist was at Udhagamandalam .
Since the vast majority of inscriptions are in Tamil and in Tamil Nadu , the Epigraphy Branch of the ASI should have remained in Tamil Nadu .
The State government did nothing to retain the office in Tamil Nadu .
We can at least think of digitising the ink impressions available in Mysore and store them in Chennai , Tiruchi and Madurai for easy access to local scholars .
There is very little coordination between the Archaeology Department and the universities , especially in Tamil Nadu .
A recent , glaring example is that the ASI , while excavating at Adichanallur , claimed to have discovered a Tamil - Brahmi pottery inscription of antiquity .
But no epigraphist from Tamil Nadu outside the Archaeology Department was allowed access to it .
I am now told that the inscription never existed or has disappeared .
There is no other recorded instance of Tamil - Brahmi inscription being found but erased owing to exposure to atmosphere if that indeed is the case .
What steps should be taken to protect the Tamil - Brahmi sites ?
Just as sand quarrying is destroying the water wealth , granite quarrying is destroying the cultural wealth of Tamil Nadu .
I am not hopeful , considering the money involved , that anything can be done to stop the destruction in either case in the near future .
To tell you the truth , I dont believe anything will be done .
The small Jaina community in Tamil Nadu is unhappy that the ancient Jaina cave inscriptions are being destroyed but they are powerless to stop it as the number of Jainas in the State is so small that they do not command enough votes
You have pricked my conscience .
Obama administration officials said that they were surprised by the coup on Sunday .
But they also said that they had been working for several weeks to try to head off a political crisis in Honduras as the confrontation between Mr. Zelaya and the military over his efforts to lift presidential term limits escalated .
The United States has long had strong ties to the Honduras military and helps train Honduran military forces .
Those close ties have put the Obama administration in a difficult position , opening it up to accusations that it may have turned a blind eye to the pending coup .
Administration officials strongly deny the charges , and Mr. Obama ’s quick response to the Honduran president ’s removal has differed sharply from the actions of the Bush administration , which in 2002 offered a rapid , tacit endorsement of a short - lived coup against Mr. Chávez .
On June 2 , Obama administration officials got a firsthand look at the brewing political battle when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled to Honduras for an Organization of American States conference .
Mrs. Clinton met with Mr. Zelaya , and he reportedly annoyed her when he summoned her to a private room late in the night after her arrival and had her shake hands with his extended family .
During a more formal meeting afterward , they discussed Mr. Zelaya ’s plans for a referendum that would have laid the groundwork for an assembly to remake the Constitution , a senior administration official said .
But American officials did not believe that Mr. Zelaya ’s plans for the referendum were in line with the Constitution , and were worried that it would further inflame tensions with the military and other political factions , administration officials said .
Federal drug regulators warned consumers to stop using Zicam , a popular homeopathic cold remedy , because it could damage or destroy their sense of smell .
The action is an early indication that the Obama administration is likely to take far more aggressive enforcement actions against drug companies than the Bush administration did .
The Food and Drug Administration received 130 reports from consumers and doctors of people losing their sense of smell after using one of the Zicam nasal products , which include Zicam Cold Remedy and Zicam Cold Remedy Swabs .
The reports date to 1999 , when Matrixx Initiatives of Scottsdale , Ariz. , first introduced the products .
In 2006 , Matrixx paid $ 12 million to settle 340 lawsuits from Zicam users who claimed that the product destroyed their sense of smell , a condition known as anosmia .
Hundreds more such suits have since been filed .

Extinction Facts Infographics
Greek philosopher Aristotle had never considered the concept of extinction .
In his 10 - book series entitled History of Animals , Aristotle wrote of his belief that all species were eternal .
Aside from the thought that they had always existed , Aristotle also believed that they would continue their existence indefinitely .
Not really much of an oversight by one of the earliest scientists .
The concept of extinction only came about in the early 1700s .
It would not even be possible without the discovery of the American mastodon ’s fossil .
Before that , Western philosophers and scientists mostly believed in Aristotle ’s sentiment that species survive indefinitely .
Now , extinction has become a natural part of the world ’s scientific understanding but still with tragic and pessimistic associations .

A man named Georges Cuvier ‘ discovered ’ extinction .
Cuvier worked at the Museum of Natural History where , after some time , he had grown so passionate about his work .
Hence , he decided to move into the museum and live on its grounds .
It was during this time that Cuvier published many studies fundamental to the concept of extinction through his findings in paleontology .
The Red List measures a species ' threat of extinction .
Recorded by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , the list specifies the severity and causes of the extinction threat on different species .
Its 7 levels representing a different threat level are as follows : least concern
near threatened
vulnerable
endangered
critically endangered
extinct in the wild
extinct
The average rate of extinction is at 1 - 5 species per year .
Sadly , human influence has gone as far as to speed up the process up to 1,000 - 10,000 times at this rate .
Not being consumed by humans also causes the extinction of some species .
Contrary to popular belief , not all species ’ extinction is caused by human poaching .
The Guinea Hog , for instance , was once a popular source of bacon and ham .
When people opted for other choices , the species then became threatened .
Hence , advertising the delicious taste of endangered animals has become a controversial yet effective way of bringing attention to them .
People would then put them in animal farms and supplement their growth even if it were for commercial use .
Plants are most vulnerable to extinction .
Unlike animals , plants do not have the ability to move when threatened .
This is why 68 % of all plant species on Earth are now endangered .
Amphibians are now the most endangered group of animals on the planet .
The word ‘ amphibian ’ originated from a Greek word which means ‘ double life . ’
Their adaptability on both land and water might have helped them survive the first 5 mass extinctions .
However , their odds are different now .

Loss of habitat caused the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago .
Dinosaurs had grown accustomed to the hot , dry climate of the Cretaceous period until it changed when an asteroid struck the Earth .
The asteroid ’s impact caused a decline in the heat and light reaching the surface of the Earth .
The dinosaurs started dying out , eventually becoming extinct when they failed to adapt to the cooler habitat .
In the 1980s , a group of scientists initiated the ‘ Mammoth Creation Project ’ movement .
They searched for a perfectly - frozen , extinct wooly mammoth with the interests of bringing the species back .
Unfortunately , these attempts were unsuccessful .
For decades , people believed that the Okapi was extinct until they found them again .
A cross between a giraffe and a zebra , this species was recently spotted in a national park .
50 % of the remaining population of the Asian elephant dwells in India .
IUCN estimates their numbers to be around 40,000 - 50,000 across 13 countries .
However , it is possible that the numbers may be far lower now due to persistent conflicts for space and resources .
Reasons for poaching Asian elephants include meat , skin , and ivory .
The African elephant is currently classified as endangered .
The largest animal walking the Earth is now down to only 40,000 - 50,000 left across 37 African countries .
Conservation of both the African and Asian elephants is essential due to their vital roles in the ecosystem as well as the tourism and community incomes in certain areas .
In 2019 , recently extinct animals included a tiny Hawaiian snail .
Other animals on the list are 3 bird species , the Lost Shark , 2 frogs , a large freshwater fish , and several plants .
More specifically , the Indochinese tigers in Laos , Sumatran rhinoceros in Malaysia , and the Yangtze giant softshell turtle added to the list as well .

Earth has experienced 5 mass extinction events .
These mass extinctions caused the disappearance of 75 - 90 % of all species on the Earth a few times in the past 500 million years .
Still , there was no constant rate of extinction .
While older species fade away into extinction , new species evolve and fit into the ever - changing ecological niches .
The first mass extinction ( the Ordovician - Silurian ) occurred 444 million years ago .
Species diversity on Earth blossomed for a good 30 million years until massive glaciation occurred .
This phenomena locked up huge amounts of water in an ice cap , covering parts of a large south polar landmass and plummeting sea levels by hundreds of feet .
Even when sea levels started rising again , marine oxygen levels dropped , causing the ocean to hold more readily onto dissolved toxic metals .
This effectively poisoned life inside and around it .
The Ordovician - Silurian ranks second in the worst mass extinction known to science .
The Ordovican - Silurian extinction wiped out approximately 85 % of all species on the planet .
Moreover , the hardest toll fell upon marine organisms like corals , conodonts ( eel - like structures ) , shelled brachiopods , and the trilobites .
The Late Devonian Extinction was the Earth 's 2nd mass extinction .
Lasting around 20 million years , the mass extinction event wiped out around 75 % of all the Earth ’s species some 383-359 million years ago .
Aside from the extinction of some creatures , the Late Devonian also witnessed slowed diversification in its time .
Volcanism is the suspected cause of the Late Devonian extinction .
The Viluy Traps , a large igneous province , erupted 240,000 cu mi. of lava in the region known today as Siberia .
A couple of million years shy of the Kellwasser event , the eruption theoretically spewed greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide , causing acid rain .
Asteroids might have been another cause to the Late Devonian extinction .
The formation of the Siljan crater around 377 million years ago strongly supported this concept .
With a width of 32 miles , the crater in Sweden remains to be one of the planet ’s biggest surviving asteroid impact craters .
Some extinction facts are just that amazing .

The 3rd mass extinction event is the Permian - Triassic extinction 252 million years ago .
Also known as the Great Dying , it is the single worst event that life on Earth has ever experienced .
It wiped out 96 % of all marine species while around 1 of every 4 species on land became extinct .
These extinction facts also count the wipeout of the world ’s forests which did not return until around 10 million years later .
The Siberian Traps that caused the Permian extinction also caused extinction in insects .
An immense volcanic complex , the Siberian Traps erupted over 720,000 cubic miles of lava over a region now known as Siberia .
This eruption drove large numbers of insect species to extinction .
Even the marine ecosystems took 4 - 8 million years to recover .
The 4th mass extinction is the Triassic - Jurassic extinction 201 million years ago .
It wiped out roughly 80 % of all land and marine species .
The Central Magmatic Province , a large igneous province in central supercontinent Pangaea , released huge amounts of greenhouse gases and triggered the world ’s 4th mass extinction .
The Triassic extinction reared huge amounts of lava .
As it acidified oceans , the lava made it hard for marine creatures to adjust to the change in pH level .
As a result , many of the crocodilians which were the dominant vertebrates then died out .
The earliest dinosaurs emerged in their wake .
The 5th and most recent event is the Cretaceous - Paleogene extinction 66 million years ago .
It is the only one with a definitive connection to a major asteroid impact .
Moreover , the Cretaceous - Paleogene extinction wiped out 76 % of all the planet ’s species that all the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct .
The 7.5 - mile wide asteroid hit the planet near today ’s Mexico ’s Yucatán Peninsula .
With a speed of 45,000 miles per hour , the Cretaceous - Paleogene asteroid slammed into the waters and caused a massive impact .
It flung volumes upon volumes of debris , dust , and sulfur into the atmosphere .
Eventually , it brought severe global cooling upon the planet ’s inhabitants .

The impact of the asteroid ignited wildfires within 900 miles and rippled a huge tsunami outward .
In the asteroid ’s wake , ecosystems supporting the nonavian dinosaurs crumbled overnight .
Moreover , it might have triggered the Deccan Flats volcanic eruptions in India that was believed to have fueled the global warming that ensued the ignition .
Extinction Facts Newsflash : the Earth is currently experiencing the 6th mass extinction .
Today , the planet is facing a biodiversity crisis with extinction threatening nearly a million species of plants and animals .
Human activities like hunting , deforestation , and overfishing turn out to be the major causes .
Moreover , the spread of invasive species , diseases from human trade , pollution , and human - caused climate change add up to serious threats .
Species today are disappearing hundreds of times faster than the natural rate .
Today ’s species are rapidly decreasing , to the point that if all critically endangered and endangered species went extinct at the current rate , the Earth will experience mass extinction in 240 - 540 years .
Canonical , the company behind the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution , is preparing to launch a new Web service called Ubuntu One , which will bring cloud synchronization and collaboration features to the Linux desktop .
The service is under heavy development , but it is expected to be ready for widespread use when Ubuntu 9.10 , codenamed Karmic Koala , is released in October .
Canonical began inviting Ubuntu community members to participate in a closed beta test on Monday .
Ars took it for a spin to see how it performs , also speaking with Canonical engineer Elliot Murphy and product manager Matt Griffin , who described the technology behind Ubuntu One and provided some insight into Canonical 's future plans for the service .
Ubuntu
One will support tight desktop integration .
To achieve that goal , the developers are building client software that will make the service a seamless part of the desktop experience .
The software is currently available to beta testers in an Ubuntu Personal Package Archive ( PPA ) hosted on Launchpad .
The source code will be released soon under open licenses and is said to be usable on other Linux distributions .
Ubuntu
One file sync
At the current stage of development , the primary feature of Ubuntu One is file synchronization .
The client software creates an Ubuntu One folder in the user 's home directory and will keep the contents of this folder synchronized across multiple computers .
The software will detect when files are modified on the local filesystem and will upload the changes to the Web service , which will then propagate the data to the rest of the user 's computers .
Ubuntu
One users will get 2 GB of storage for free .
Additional storage will be available for a price .
According to the Ubuntu
One website , users can get 10 GB for $ 10 per month .
Murphy says that Canonical is still trying to determine the best pricing structure .
The cost of the 10 GB plan could change in the future as Canonical attempts to make the service more competitive .
The synchronization software integrates with GNOME 's Nautilus file manager .
Special emblems are displayed on the file icons to indicate their synchronization status .
The file manager will also show a special bar when the user is viewing a folder that is controlled by the synchronization software .
The bar includes a button that can be used to connect and disconnect from the Ubuntu One service .
Individual folders that are stored on Ubuntu One can be shared with other users .
This feature can be activated in Nautilus through the right - click contextual menu .
You specify the e-mail address of the user with whom you wish to share the files , who will then receive an e-mail that asks him or her to confirm the share invitation .
If the user confirms it , the folder that you shared will automatically appear in that user 's " Shared With Me " folder .
Support for sharing is still a bit limited , but the developers say that the software will provide more powerful and flexible sharing options as it matures .
An Ubuntu One shared file invitation
Ubuntu
One shared files in Nautilus
The Ubuntu One website provides a simple Web interface that makes it possible for users to manage and access their files from anywhere , including computers that do n't have the client software installed .
Murphy says that the current implementation of the Web interface is primarily a placeholder that has been made available for testing purposes and that it will be replaced soon with a much nicer version that is currently under heavy development .
Ubuntu
One 's synchronization functionality is very similar to that of Dropbox , a file sync tool that we looked at last year .
Ubuntu
One lacks some of Dropbox 's advanced features , such as support for file versioning and history .
Dropbox is also ahead in performance and offers a few other unique advantages , like cross-platform compatibility .
Murphy says that Canonical does not plan to build native Windows and Mac OS X clients for Ubuntu One , but he says that third - party developers could potentially do it by porting the underlying components of the Linux client to other platforms and then building platform - specific shell integration features on top .
He remarked that Canonical will happily accept patches that aim to accommodate such efforts .
He also said that the company intends to deliver a fully functional KDE version .
In the future , WebDAV support could be provided to give users another way to access their Ubuntu One files when they use other platforms .

Tackling climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions could save millions of lives because of the cleaner air that would result , according to a recent study .
Researchers predict that , by 2050 , about 100 million premature deaths caused by respiratory health problems linked to air pollution could be avoided through measures such as low emission cars .
The economic benefits of saving those lives in developing countries such as China and India could also strengthen the negotiating hand of the UK and Europe at a crucial UN climate summit in Copenhagen this December .
Johannes Bollen , one of the authors of the report for the Netherlands Environment Agency , said the 100 million early deaths could be prevented by cutting global emissions by 50 % by 2050 , a target consistent with those being considered internationally .
The reports warns that if governments continue with business - as - usual energy use , then population growth , ageing demographics and increased urbanisation will cause premature deaths from pollution to increase by 30 % in OECD countries , and 100 % outside the OECD .
The study also has implications for which technologies are chosen to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gases .
The study points out that while carbon capture and storage technology can capture CO2 , it does not usually trap other air pollutants .
Last month , the energy and climate minister , Ed Miliband , put " clean coal " at the centre of UK energy policy by pledging no new coal - fired power stations would be built without at least partial CCS .
In contrast , the report said , reducing car emissions and the number of vehicles on the road would lead to both lower greenhouse gases and fewer local air pollutants from exhausts .
Jim Storey , air quality policy adviser at the UK's Environment Agency , said he wanted climate policies that account for their effect on air pollution : " There are win-wins for climate change and air quality that should be pursued with all haste , such as improving energy efficiency in houses , and reducing emissions from transport .
Transport remains the largest cause of air pollution in the UK , and accounts for around 20 % of the UK 's greenhouse gas emissions . "
The report also said the economic gains of cleaner air could be attractive for developing countries during climate treaty negotiations in Copenhagen later this year .
By not losing people of working age to pollution , India and China , for example , stand to gain 4 - 5 % in GDP in 2050 as a result of cleaner air , compared with around 1 % of GDP in OECD countries such as the UK .
" The local air pollution benefits of climate mitigation policies provide an additional economic incentive for countries to participate in a global agreement to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions , " said Bollen .
The health threat of air pollution is well known .
Recent research from the American Lung Association revealed that 186 million US residents live in areas with dangerous levels of air pollution .
" Despite almost 40 years since the Clean Air Act passed in 1970 , six in 10 Americans still live in dirty air areas , areas where the air is unhealthful to breathe , " said the ALA 's Paul Billings .
As well as citing dirty diesel vehicles and coal power plants as significant contributors to US air pollution , the Association 's report called for a clean - up of cruise ships , container ships and tankers , which it said will be responsible for approximately 45 % of US particulate emissions by 2030 .
Confidential data released last month from the shipping industry suggested 15 of the world 's biggest ships may now emit as much pollution as all the world 's 760 m cars .
In the UK , a report published this month by the London Assembly Environment Committee claimed that poor air quality in London may have contributed to 3,000 premature deaths in the capital in 2005 .
London has the worst air quality in the UK and among the worst in Europe for small , sooty particles known as PM10s and nitrogen dioxide .
The key air pollutants that can harm human health include nitrogen dioxide , sulphur dioxide , volatile organic compounds , ammonia and particulate matter and are produced by burning fossil fuels in power plants and vehicles .
Children and the elderly , plus people with respiratory conditions such as asthma , are particularly at risk .
As regards chemical weapons , Daniel Pinkston of the International Crisis Group said : " If there is an escalation of conflict and if military hostilities break out , there is a risk that they could be used .
In conventional terms , North Korea is weak and they feel they might have to resort to using those . "
Michael Martin will this afternoon announce his plan to resign as Commons Speaker , it was revealed today .
The news came as an unprecedented motion appeared on the House of Commons order paper , signed by 23 MPs , calling for Martin to resign because of his failure of leadership over the expenses scandal .
Martin will make a statement to MPs at 2.30 pm announcing his resignation , according to Whitehall sources .
It it thought that he will not step down with immediate effect , but will tell MPs that he will resign soon , possibly before the summer recess .
It was not immediately clear whether he would also resign his seat , triggering a byelection in his Glasgow North East constituency .
By convention , retiring Speakers are offered a peerage and it is widely expected that Martin will take a seat in the House of Lords .
The Speaker will be the most high - profile casualty of the expenses catastrophe .
Some MPs believe that he has been made a scapegoat for the failure of the Commons as a whole , although Martin has faced persistent accusations of incompetence since his election in 2000 .
Under new Commons rules already agreed , the next Speaker will be chosen by secret ballot .
Today one bookmaker made Sir George Young , the Tory former transport secretary , the favourite to succeed Martin .
Sir Alan Haselhurst , the Tory MP who is the most senior of the three deputy Speakers , and Sir Menzies Campbell , the former Liberal Democrat leader , are also strong contenders for the post .
Martin appeared to have lost the support of all three main party leaders .
Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader , has openly called for his resignation , David Cameron , the Tory leader , signalled today that he wanted the no-confidence motion to be called , and Gordon Brown , the prime minister , has now given up saying that he thought Martin was doing a good job .
Downing Street would not comment on reports that Brown met Martin this morning to discuss his future .
Downing Street announced that Brown will give one of his regular press conferences later today , at 5.30 pm .
But what seems to have persuaded Martin to go was the reaction when he made a statement in the Commons yesterday apologising for his role in the expenses affair .
In scenes for which there is no precedent in modern times , MPs from all sides of the house told him to his face that he ought to go .
Martin , a former sheet - metal worker from Glasgow and the first Catholic in history to hold the office of Commons Speaker , was seen as an obstacle to reform because he chairs the House of Commons commission , the body in charge of Commons administration .
When campaigners tried to obtain information about MPs ' expenses under freedom of information legislation , the commission fought the case at every stage – even going to the high court at considerable legal expense when many lawyers said the case was hopeless .
Eventually the commission lost , and it agreed to prepare details of MPs ' expenses for publication this year .
But Martin came in for further criticism when the Daily Telegraph started publishing leaked details about the claims because , instead of accepting that publication was legitimate , the immediate reaction of the Commons authorities was to call in the police to ask them to investigate .
On Monday last week Martin also astonished some MPs when he criticised two MPs in the chamber , Labour 's Kate Hoey and the Lib Dem Norman Baker , because they had been critical of the House of Commons commission 's handling of the issue .
Yesterday in the Commons , a raft of MPs stood up and publicly called for him to go in one of the most extraordinary parliamentary episodes of modern times .
Alistair Graham , the former chairman of the committee on standards in public life , said that Martin was an obstacle to reform .
" He did rather act like a shop steward for MPs and he did n't have the stature and charisma once the crisis hit parliament to find a way through so he was just the wrong person for that situation and hopefully parliament is now going to put that right , " Graham said .
Today Baker said that Martin 's decision was " the right decision to take " .
He said that although Martin had had " immense difficulties " , he had also made some positive contributions that should be remembered .
" He had to go for the sake of parliament .
That does not stop us feeling sorry for him on a personal basis , " Baker said .
Carswell said it gave him no pleasure to have played a part in bringing Martin down , but said the House of Commons needed a new Speaker to help guide it out of the current crisis .
The Harwich and Clacton MP told Sky News : " I have acted not as his enemy and least of all as an opposition MP .
I have acted as somebody who cares passionately for the parliamentary system .
" I believe we have found ourselves in a moral ditch and we need reform and change to get out of that ditch and restore dignity to politics .
" It gives me no pleasure to have done this at all , but it was necessary to do it .
We need a new Speaker who understands that ' sovereignty of parliament ' is shorthand for ' sovereignty of the people ' .
" The reason why I think we need Michael Martin to step down is because he not only presided over this system , he actively sought to prevent reform . "
Paul Flynn , a Labour MP who signed Carswell 's motion of no-confidence , said : " I 'm afraid that [ Martin ] has brought this on him self .
Parliament has to reform itself .
He was the wrong person to do it . "
Flynn said that some of the attacks on Martin were unfair , but that it was wrong for Martin to attack the " whistleblowers " who had complained about the Speaker 's handling of events .
Flynn also said that he would be supporting the Tory MP John Bercow as the next Speaker because he had the potential to produce " radical reform " .
Tony Wright , the Labour chairman of the public administration committee , said there was a " groundswell of opinion " that made Martin 's position untenable .

Building Walt ’s Dream – Time Lapse Film Footage of Disneyland ’s Construction
If you are a Disneyland fanatic such as myself , then you are going to absolutely love recent film footage that has been released of Disneyland ’s construction in 1954 - 55 .
This never - before - seen footage was sitting on a shelf all these years and only saved by a curious employee .
Using time - lapse and traditional eye - in - the - sky photography , this is a dazzling piece of history , presenting how the fearless construction crews had Disneyland up and running in just under a year .
Sit back for the next 37 minutes or so and be amazed as Disney Imagineer , Tony Baxter , as well as Ed Hobleman and Walter Magnuson from the studio inventory group provide commentary .

By claiming asylum in Britain , the Saudi princess is seeking to avoid the fate of another member of her royal family who was executed after admitting adultery .
Princess Mishaal bint Fahd al Saud , the 19 - year - old great - niece of the late King Khalid , was shot several times in the head in 1977 .
Her death is thought to have been ordered by her grandfather , Muhammad bin Abdul Aziz al Saud , the King 's older brother .
She was unmarried but had confessed that she had committed adultery .
The killing became the focus of an international outcry in 1980 when the docu- drama Death Of A Princess was shown on teleivison .
Saudi authorities tried to get the film suppressed and , when that failed , they expelled the British ambassador to Riyadh , withdrew 400 members of their royal family from Britain and cancelled millions of pounds worth of exports .

Most executions carried out in the kingdom are by beheading in a public square , but stoning is the technique reserved for married people convicted of adultery .
Among the offences which rank beside adultery as capital crimes are murder , drug - trafficking and sodomy .
In 2008 , Saudi courts ordered the executions of 102 people for various offences , a fall from the record 156 people put to death in 2007 .
Forty women have been executed since 1990 .
In a report last year , the human rights group Amnesty International said at least one woman was facing the possibility of execution for adultery .
The woman had been married to a Saudi who died six years beforehand .
She was arrested in 2005 after giving birth to a girl and was sentenced to death by stoning .
Her fate is unclear .
A couple from Sri Lanka working in Saudi Arabia were convicted of adultery in March and sentenced to death by stoning .
The sentence was reduced to six years in prison and 700 lashes .
A 23 - year - old Saudi woman was sentenced to 100 lashes and a year in prison earlier this year after being gang - raped .
She became pregnant and was arrested when she tried to arrange an abortion .

After a decade of costly construction , the International Space Station is nearing completion .
But NASA wo n't have long to enjoy the achievement .
According to an article from the Washington Post , NASA space station program manager Michael T. Suffredini raised eyebrows when , at a public hearing last month , he declared flatly that NASA plans to de-orbit the station in 2016 .
That means the $ 100 billion research facility , which has been circling Earth since 1998 , will ultimately burst into flames as it reenters the Earth 's atmosphere and crashes into the Pacific Ocean .
Budget constraints and the lack of a shuttle program , which is set to retire in 2010 , may have persuaded NASA to end the space station program .
The Washington Post explains :
The rap on the space station has always been that it was built primarily to give the space shuttle somewhere to go .
Now , with the shuttle being retired at the end of 2010 , the station is on the spot .
U.S. astronauts will be able to reach the station only by getting rides on Russia 's Soyuz spacecraft .
There is no official lobbying to extend the mission , but NASA 's plans have met with criticism .
Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - FL ) argues , " If we 've spent a hundred billion dollars , I do n't think we want to shut it down in 2015 . "
While speaking to a panel charged by the Obama administration with reviewing the entire human spaceflight program , Nelson affirmed , " My opinion is it would be a travesty to de-orbit this thing ...
If we get rid of this darned thing in 2015 , we 're going to cede our leadership in human exploration . "
What do you feel should be done with the International Space Station ?
Does the initial $ 100 billion investment justify extending the program , or should we simply cut our losses and look toward a new future of space exploration ?

Lunar Orbiter Tapes Found
The following data was supplied to us by Steve Jurvetson who has posted this on Youtube and Flicker .... .. Youtube Link From : jurvetson
Added : September 22 , 2008
Behind the counter of an abandoned McDonalds lie 48,000 lbs of 70 mm tape the only copy of extremely high - resolution images of the moon .
These tapes were recorded 40 years ago as part of the Apollo program to map the lunar surface to plan landing spots for Apollo 11 onward .
They have never been seen by the public because at the time , they were classified as they reveal the extreme precision of our spy satellites .
Instead , all we have ever seen are the grainy photo - of - a- photo images that were released to the public .
The spacecraft did not ship this film back to Earth .
Instead , they developed the film on the Lunar Orbiter and then raster scanned the negatives with a 5 micron spot ( 200 lines / millimeter resolution ) and beamed the data back to Earth using yet - to - be- patented - by - others lossless analog compression .
Three ground stations on Earth ( one was in Madrid ) recorded the transmissions on these magnetic tapes .
Recovering the data has proven to be very difficult , requiring technological archeology .
The only working version of the Ampex tape player ( $ 300 K when new ) was discovered in a chicken coop and restored with the help of the original designer .
There is only one person on Earth who still refurbishes these tape heads , and he is retiring this year .
The skills to read this data archive are on the cusp of disappearing forever .
Some of the applications of this project , beyond accessing the best images of the moon ever taken , are to look for new landing sites for the new Google Lunar X - Prize robo - landers , and to compare the new craters on the moon today to 40 years ago , a measure of micrometeorite flux and risk to future lunar operations .

Post ID 5032940 Greetings , Zorgon 's post is exactly true .
Only the conspiracy theorists are false .
Here is a brief overview of the Lunar Orbiter Data Recovery Project :
This project started in the late 1980's when the National Space Science Data Center ( NSSDC ) discovered a cache of the only known remaining set of Lunar Orbiter tapes in existence stored in a " salt mine . "
The story there is that there are abandon salt mines that store government records , as the temperature and humidity are stable .
There was some documentation attached indicating what they were and that JPL should be notified as to what their ultimate fate should be .
JPL took possession of them in about 1988 or so , as there was some interest in recovering the data so that the images could be digitized and made available to the general public as the pictures were then a bulky 2000 , 28 " x 30 " prints .
The problem at that point was that no was still there .
However , in order to obtain the video from the data , a circuit called the VSB decompressor ( or " restorer " ) , needed to be designed and constructed .
This was done and a recognizable sync pulse with video data was retrieved .
This was all accomplished in about 1992 .
Since then several proposals to NASA and various private sources failed to produce the money required to recover this data .
So the tape drives were stored in a " chicken coop " ( actually it was a garage / barn combination ) , for the next 15 or so years .
Last year a call was made form the person in the video ( who I will only identify as " D " until I can obtain his permission to release his name - though I do n't think this mission is actually a secret ) , called to ask about the tapes and the tape drives as he had some contacts that might be able to help .
After visiting the " chicken coop " and ascertaining that the tapes were still at JPL 's storage facility , he then made arrangements to transport both to a site in Northern California from the Los Angeles area , which he did .
He then assembled a crew of experts in various fields and located a site to carry out his low budget " proof of concept " which turned out to be a McDonalds , which was located on a military base , that was closed due to poor attendance after a government cutback .
As it turned out , each of the little tables , normally used for enjoying your " Happy Meal " , were excellent workbenches for the various projects associated with bringing the drives back to working condition .
This then is pretty much where it is today .
Once five full images are recovered , then the " Proof of Concept " will have been achieved and further funding may follow .
Someone mentioned that Google might be interested .
Well they are , and they have visited the site .
Some information that might be of interest :
The products of the original LO project were :
Tape : 2 " wide tape that contained all the mission data .
There are about 2,000 of them GRE file : Ground reconstruction 35 mm film that were the reconstructed picture " framelett " data
About 30 of these make up one of the 28 " x 30 " prints .
Prints :
The prints are about 28 " x 30 " in dimensions
There are 4 kinds of data on the FR900 Lunar Orbiter tapes :
Video : From sync to sync represents one scan line .
There are 4 scan lines per meter on the surface at best resolution .
There are about 16,600 scan lines per framelett and there are about 30 framelett 's per print .
Telemetry : Another channel in the video data is for telemetry , which reports on the status of the satellite .
Carrier :
In order to reconstruct the original video data the carrier must be available .
But because it was suppressed by the VSB processing , it was divided by 8 and stuck in the lower sideband .
Audio :
There is an audio channel that the various sites recorded the tape ID on as can be heard in the video .
Film in refrigerator :
Some have said that storing film in a refrigerator would extend its life .
This is true only for unexposed film .
For exposed film , it is best to have a stable temperature and humidity , cold has no effect .
Tape storage in canisters in picture :
Note that the canisters in one of the pictures with the yellow tape .
These are the 2 " wide original LO tapes and
are in excellent condition .
What is not in the picture are the GRE film , which were also with the tapes .
Pirate Flag :
The pirate flag was placed on the window was for fun as it was seen by some that this mission was going on
oh , shall we say , by any means possible .
More for humor I am sure .
If you want more info let me know .

I do n't think there 's anything really strange about these guys being resourceful , and using an abandoned McDonalds for their makeshift workspace until they get some real funding which they mention in the video .
From what little research I did I understand the McDonalds is located at Nasa Ames Moffett field which has basically been closed .
I found this on the wiki entry for Moffett field http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffett_Federal_Airfield
Moffett Field 's facilities available to residents include a pool , post office , golf course , tennis courts , gas station , and several small shops and restaurants , including an on -site McDonald 's which closed April 30 , 2008 .
I bet you could use google maps local live to get a good look at the place is you 're really curious
Moffett Federal Airfield
NASA AMES Reseasrch Center
.. Image Credit : Google Earth Moffett Federal Airfield ( IATA : NUQ , ICAO : KNUQ ) , also known as Moffett Field , is a joint civil - military airport located 3 miles ( 5 km ) north of Mountain View , in Santa Clara County , California , USA .
The airport is near the south end of San Francisco Bay , north of San Jose .
Formerly a United States
Navy facility , the former naval air station is now owned and operated by the NASA Ames Research Center .
Tenant military activities include the 129th Rescue Wing of the California Air National Guard , operating the HC - 130 Hercules , MC - 130 Combat Shadow and HH - 60 Pave Hawk aircraft , as well as the adjacent Onizuka Air Force Station and Headquarters for the 7th Psychological Operations Group of the U.S. Army Reserve .
NASA also operates several aircraft from Moffett , including the ER - 2 , a civilian research version of the U - 2 .
By far the most famous and visible sites are hangars # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 , which dwarf the surrounding buildings .
Hangar
One is one of the most remarkable hangars in the world [ citation needed ] .
Hangars # 2 and # 3 are significant more for their size than their unique styling or design .
Hangar One is a Naval Historical Monument and the entire airfield is a United States Registered Historic District .

I dont think this has been posted yet : Facilities Despite its closure as an active military base , Moffett Field still has many active facilities and residents .
Active military families still live on Moffett Community Housing , and the former base has several lodges which primarily house academics and students associated with the Ames Research Center .
Moffett Field 's facilities available to residents include a pool , post office , golf course , tennis courts , gas station , and several small shops and restaurants , including an on -site McDonald 's which closed April 30 , 2008 .
SOURCE : Wikipedia Moffett Federal Airfield
So there IS a closed McDonald 's on that base .... well , according to Wiki Also , looks like there might be a lack of storage on that base , which might answer why they would be in a McDonalds : Status of former military buildings
Many of the buildings at Moffett Field which once supported its active military presence have been abandoned and left standing due to asbestos contamination within the structures SOURCE : Wikipedia Moffett Federal Airfield
I have no opinion on this , but I find it all very interesting ... and wanted to provide this information

The film was processed on board the Lunar Orbiters and what you see here are processing defects that occurred there .
The system then transmitted the images , warts and all , to the receiving sites .
Thus the blotches will be on the recovered data from the tapes .
As for how long magnetization lasts on tapes :
It depends on the strength of the magnetization and the material on which it was impressed .
The longest lasting are digital tapes which were recorded to saturation .
The LO tapes are analog however , but good analog tapes exist from back in the fifties and wire recordings before that , so this is not a surprise .

The only reason that I wish to be anonymous at the moment is that though I am involved in the project , I am not the leader of it .
So I wish to leave the details as to how much to reveal up to him .
I always prefer to ask first , then act , on issues like this .
I can say that the project is known in the Lunar community and that it is no secret to them as many have attended some demonstrations of the equipment as has some Google representatives .
And in one instance an astronaut who was on a publicity tour was in attendance , I believe .
By the way , I understood that real names were not often used on BLOG sites which is why my real name is not used here .
The name comes from a part in a movie that I played .
Guess who it was ?

First of all I apologize for the rather long post I am going to make , but I hope my fellow ATS members will have patience with me .
I think I have discovered something interesting ...
Here it goes : " wingod2001 " made the following comment on YouTube regarding the video that Jurvetson uploaded there : " I demand this this video of me be removed from youtube .
This person did not have permission to do this and I will be taking this up with the management here at Youtube . "
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXwGnN6WiCw
Via " wingod2001 "s user profile and the " Moon Rush " videos he has listed as his favorites , you can see that he is a man called Dennis Wingo .
It is easy to recognize him from Jurvetson 's video : http://www.youtube.com/user/wingod2001
I had never heard of Mr. Wingo before , but this is what I found out about him :
In 2004 he wrote a book called " Moonrush " which posits a future by exploiting the value of space for resources and energy .
He has a company ( www.assurecom.com) which focuses on mobile power & communications systems for emergency power & Internet access .
He also has a small company called www.skycorpinc.com, which does n't seem to very active .
Last press release was in 2001 : http://www.assurecom.com/about.html
http://www.skycorpinc.com/press.htm
Mr. Wingo also writes about space and technology for " newsvine.com " .
At this site he refers to an article called " Satelite turns 50 years old ...
In orbit ! " .
The interesting thing here is that the article is written by a man called James Oberg .
Mr. Wingo states : " A very good article by my friend James Oberg on the 50th anniversary of the launch of the oldest piece of space hardware still in orbit . "
http://wingod.newsvine.com/_news/2008/03/17/1372562-satellite-turns-50-years-old-in-orbit
James Oberg ( often called Jim Oberg ) is a well known debunker :
As a journalist , he writes for several regular publications , mostly online ; he was previously space correspondent for UPI , ABC and currently MSNBC , often in an on - air role .
He is a Fellow of the skeptical organization CSICOP and a consultant to its magazine Skeptical Inquirer .
In 1991 , PBS transformed his book Red Star In Orbit into a documentary series .
HBO has optioned Red Star in Orbit for some future made - for - TV miniseries .
He was commissioned by NASA to write a rebuttal of Apollo moon landing hoax accusations .
NASA later dropped the project ; however , Oberg has said that he still intends to pursue it .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Oberg
And you know what ?
James / Jim Oberg is also an ATS member !
In the forum dedicated to internos you can meet him in a thread called " Images for Mr. Oberg to analyze " , started by bigfatfurrytexan : http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread381956/pg1
Needless to say , Mr. Oberg has n't been very helpful or interested in a serious discussion .
So to me , it seems like very bad news indeed that Dennis Wingo is a friend of this man .
I do n't think we will be seeing the Lunar Orbiter hi res images anytime soon ...

It looks better than DVD but it's not what they would like you to think it is .
With HD - DVD / Blue Ray you can provide a fantastically accurate reproduction of a degraded video signal .
Like you said , it all depends on the source video and what the content provider supplies .
I cut my teeth on FR - 600 , FR - 900 , FR - 1400 Ampex .

We had an RCA RADAR video recorder that had 4 foot diameter tape reels .
Don I do n't mean to intrude here but I was doing an internet search on Ampex FR - 900's and was led to this post .
Well I have four of them sitting within ten feet of me right now .
I am doing a project at NASA Ames to resurrect two of them to digitize NASA 's original master tapes from the lunar orbiter missions to the Moon .
If you remember anything or know any possible information where we can find any information about them ( we have some data but not enough ) , would you please contact me ?

As a self - described Video Expert ( i.e. SAIT CTSR Grad ) with 15 years of high - end digital video experience , I am VERY INTERESTED in contributing to the effort of converting these NASA tapes ! -
I have some expertise with both 1 inch Sony and 2 inch AMPEX / Quad tape formats and am quite familiar with methods such as BAKING older tape so that it can be played back on such machines so the tape oxide does n't flake off the polyester substrate .
BUT ...... FOR YOUR INFORMATION ........ I NOW have a much better method to capture the archived NASA tapes and am willing to do so for FREE .
I have designed custom multi-processing imaging software that OPTICALLY SCANS ( using a microscope & digital HDTV camera ) the scanline imprints of each frame that has been recorded on magnetic tape and by using my custom DSP ( Digital Signal Processing ) algorithms I can recreate the waveforms of the analog broadcast signal by converting the BITMAP SCANS of each analog video frame into either 8 - bit greyscale or 24 bit RGB colour image frames which
I can then convert into 4:4:4:4 Serial Digital video or 4:2:2 DV format or MPEG2 / MPEG4 / DVD video at 720 by 480 pixels OR full 1920 by 1080 p HDTV .
I just HAPPEN to know the recording head configuration and scanline formatting of BOTH Sony 1 " and AMPEX 2 " / Quad tape formats so I already have the conversion capability built - into my software .
IN ADDITION , I HAVE MANY , MANY TERABYTES OF DISK SPACE so storage is NOT A PROBLEM !
So if any of you have the contact information for the people involved or the contact information of the photographer , send them this message and MY contact information so they can forward it to the right people
and get the ball rolling .
I welcome phone calls because I CAN HELP !!!!!
I am willing to convert the tapes GRATIS , AT NO CHARGE , AND THAT MEANS FREE !!!!
using my NEW OPTICAL SCANNING METHOD which DOES NOT physically use a playback head to touch the tape ...
I do it by taking high resolution photos of the tape surface and using software to scan the orientation and patterning of the tape particles so as to find the frame boundaries on a frame - by - frame basis which is then processed to interpret the video scan lines so I then convert to a modern digital video file format .
I can also process out tape - based noise and magnetic particle anomalies to get the CLEANEST possible image !
We can transfer older 35 mm slide , Super - 8 / Regular - 8 mm film and 16 mm FILM to Video transfers so that I can do too ... although we DO CHARGE for THAT Service !
Send email to or phone me at to discus how I can get the NASA tapes to me for conversion to various digital formats FOR FREE !!!!!!!!: Henry A. Eckstein

UPDATE
September 29 , 2008 4:01 pm Posted from email .... next step in the process ..
Thank You for the contact information .... I will give him a ring tomorrow when I 'm back in the office and send him a comprehensive report on what I envisage with my optical scanning and software image processing technique .
Basically what I do is put the magnetic tape reels onto a slow - moving spindle that moves at a few millimetres per second so as to give enough time for a 1024 by 1024 pixel RGB 60 fps digital camera attached to a high - quality optical magnifier to scan the tape by STITCHING multiple photos into a large bitmap that constitutes the frame boundaries of an analog Video waveform .
( I can do digitally encoded frames too ) .
That large bitmap is then scanned using my software using technology similar to Optical Character Recognition ( OCR ) where I can change the Greyscale / YIQ / YUV / YDbDr scanline information that is likely to be on the NASA tapes into an uncompressed 720 by 480 pixel RGB video frame or to a super - sampled 1920 by 1080 pixel progressive RGB HDTV frame that can then be converted to any modern digital video format that I want .
And I estimate the storage of uncompressed video based upon the number of reels strewn about in the McDonalds photos , to be almost one Petabyte ( 1000 Terabytes ) of data , which is NOT a problem for me , it 's just a matter of buying enough extra hard drives to hold it all on a more permanent basis .
I 've already got almost two petabytes of off - line digital storage so another petabyte ain't gonna hurt me .
The biggest problem is the quality of the original tapes themselves ... tape oxide DETERIORATES over time and my biggest worry is it flaking away from the polyester substrate and the only way to fix that is to BAKE the tape in an oven to harden it and then play it ONLY ONCE through my apparatus in order to get a clean optical - scan transfer .
I have NO IDEA as to the current condition of the NASA tapes so I can only speculate as to what needs done thus I would need a sample tape to test the quality of transfer ...
If the tape itself is good , then the transfer I do will
be equal to the original recording and since I can filter out magnetic tape noise , I might even get close to the quality of the original space - to - ground broadcast .
If some people , who have speculated that the tapes are DIGITALLY ENCODED , are correct , I can ALSO transfer that using my OPTICAL SCAN method and since all I need to know is the width , height and greyscale / colour
format of the pixels , I 'll be able to convert the probably PCM - based ( Pulse Coded Modulation ) picture frames into absolute digital clarity .
If it 's digital we might be able to get some really AWESOME quality video footage .
Hopefully I can still get a hold of Dennis Wingo to get the ball rolling .
Just so I do n't get your hopes up too high , please be aware this might take a week or more in order to to get replies and talk on the phone .
So do n't expect a miracle tomorrow but I will do my best ...!!!
You can post this email on ATS or forward to others who are interested
if you want so as to possibly spark some mainstream media interest .

The Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project
May 9 , 2014
Published on May 9 , 2014
In the 1960's NASA undertook an effort to map the near side of the moon at high resolution to find landing sites for the Apollo spacecraft .
Over the last few years the team at Skycorp have been working to recover and improve upon this original data by restoring old tape machines and extracting the original data from the original tapes .
Since I have a Borders Rewards card ( and worked there for a brief stint ) , I get e-mails from them every few days with coupons and updates about new books n’ such .
Today my Borders e-mail contained the following snippet which I felt necessary to share with all of you :
Borders Books is losing its mind .
Top Security Minds Urge Google to Encrypt All Services
A who 's - who of more than three dozen high - tech and security experts from industry and academia is urging Google to beef up the privacy and security settings of its Gmail , Google Docs and Calendar online services .
At issue is whether Google is doing enough to block hackers from hijacking a user 's Webmail account or intercepting information from online documents .
An increasing number of free , publicly available tools may make it simple for even novice hackers to launch such attacks .
" Google 's default settings put customers at risk unnecessarily .
Google 's services protect customers ' usernames and passwords from interception and theft , " said the experts , including luminaries from AT&T , PGP Corp . and top researchers from Berkeley , Harvard , MIT , Oxford and Purdue .
" However , when a user composes email , documents , spreadsheets , presentations and calendar plans , this potentially sensitive content is transferred to Google 's servers in the clear , allowing anyone with the right tools to steal that information . "
Google uses encryption technology to block would - be cyber snoops from eavesdropping on information transmitted between users and Google online services such as Adsense , Adwords or Google Health .
Users of these services will note that from the time they submit their username and password to the moment they log out , the Web address in their browser begins with an " https : // " , indicating a persistent , encrypted connection .
But signatories to the letter to Google chief executive Eric Schmidt note that Google employs those same protections only sporadically or not at all on services like Gmail , Google Docs and Google Calendar .
For example , while Gmail has a setting that allows users to remain in an encrypted connection with Google indefinitely , that setting is somewhat buried and is not the default .
What 's more , this setting does not affect whether Google Docs or Calendar data is encrypted .
In fact , the letter points out , " there is no encryption setting available for Docs or Calendar .
The only way for users of these other Google services to protect themselves is to remember to type https://docs.google.com and https://www.google.com/calendar into their browser 's location bar every time they employ those applications .
Google does not explain this difference between applications , and users may incorrectly believe that setting the Gmail preference will protect all of their Google sessions . "
Google executives have stated publicly that the company lets users decide whether to enable encryption all of the time for Gmail and other services , in part because encrypting everything can slow these services down .
But Eugene H. Spafford , a professor of computer science at Purdue University and one of the letter signatories , said most Google users are not in a position to make an informed decision about that that trade - off .
" What we 're saying in this letter is that as an iconic service , and one that professes to be concerned about user safety , Google could set a good example and set the right defaults , and if users want to switch back to something less secure , then they can , " Spafford said .
" We have many things in society where users are n't well enough educated about the dangers to pick the best choice , and so we depend on professionals to select what the best defaults are .
We 're simply asking Google to do that . "
The letter acknowledges that in offering users an option to always encrypt Gmail , Google already has gone beyond the default setting of Webmail services offered by its peers , including Microsoft Hotmail and Yahoo !.
But another contributor to the letter -- Markus Jakobsson , principal scientist at the Palo Alto Research Center -- said Google could further differentiate itself from its competitors by allowing users to encrypt sessions across all Google services .
Jakobsson said Google 's decision to enable encryption by default on its lesser used services but not on its most - used service ( Gmail ) comes down to a decision about saving money , as enabling encryption across the board would undoubtedly place a higher computational load on Google 's servers .
" A savings of money is the only reason not to turn encryption on if you already have it implemented , " Jakobsson said .
" This letter says that even if they do n't have to , they ought to .
They'd be investing in people 's confidence by doing that . "
In a post to its Online Security blog today , Google said it is currently looking into whether it would make sense to turn on HTTPS as a default for all Gmail users .
From that blog post , by Alma Whitten , software engineer for Google 's security and privacy teams :
We know HTTPS is a good experience for many power users who 've already turned it on as their default setting .
And in this case , the additional cost of offering HTTPS is n't holding us back .
But we want to more completely understand the impact on people 's experience , analyze the data , and make sure there are no negative effects .
Ideally we'd like this to be on by default for all connections , and we 're investigating the trade - offs , since there are some downsides to HTTPS -- in some cases it makes certain actions slower .
We 're planning a trial in which we 'll move small samples of different types of Gmail users to HTTPS to see what their experience is , and whether it affects the performance of their email .
Does it load fast enough ?
Is it responsive enough ?
Are there particular regions , or networks , or computer setups that do particularly poorly on HTTPS ?
Unless there are negative effects on the user experience or it's otherwise impractical , we intend to turn on HTTPS by default more broadly , hopefully for all Gmail users .
We 're also considering how to make this work best for other apps including Google Docs and Google Calendar ( we offer free HTTPS for those apps as well ) .
A copy of the letter sent to Google is available here ( PDF ) .
Flight 447 went down so quickly that passengers had no time to react , says French head investigator
This note was added on 17 July 2009 :
The story below and its heading are incorrect in reporting a vertical crash .
Initial Associated Press stories on the crash findings misunderstood the term " vertical velocity " , and so did our compilation piece .
An updated article was subsequently published .
Air France flight 447 did not break up in the air but plunged vertically into the Atlantic Ocean , according to the French head investigator of last month 's crash , which killed all 228 people on board .
Alain Bouillard said life vests found among the wreckage were not inflated , indicating the accident happened so quickly that the passengers had no time to react .
Speed sensors on the Airbus A330 flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris were not to blame , he said , though " we are far from understanding the cause of the crash " .
" The plane seems to have hit the surface of the water on its flight trajectory with a strong vertical acceleration , " he said , adding that investigators have found " neither traces of fire nor traces of explosives . "
One of the automatic messages emitted by the plane indicates it was receiving incorrect speed information from the external monitoring instruments , which could destabilise the control systems .
Experts have suggested those external instruments might have iced over .
No information was being given out from autopsies of the bodies found , Bouillard told a news conference at the headquarters of the French air accident agency BEA in Le Bourget , outside Paris .
The chances of finding the flight recorders are falling as the signals they emit fade .
Without them , the full causes of the accident may never be known .
The automated messages sent by the plane before it fell gave rescuers only a vague location to begin their search .
Bouillard said the search for the plane 's black boxes has been extended by 10 days and would continue untill 10 July .
Families of the victims had been briefed before the media on the findings so far of the BEA investigation .
Earlier , Christophe Guillot - Noel , head of an association for the crash victims ' families said they wanted all the facts , " above all to be able to avoid this eventually happening again " .
" We have just one demand : transparency .
We have just one expectation : the truth , " he said .
The WSJ reports that Steve Jobs had a liver transplant two months ago in Tennessee .
He is expected to still return to work later this month , even if only at a part time schedule .

From there , the article goes on to speculate loosely , ever so loosely , that Jobs ' cancer had spread to his liver .
William Hawkins , a doctor specializing in pancreatic and gastrointestinal surgery at Washington University in St. Louis , Mo. , said that the type of slow - growing pancreatic tumor Mr. Jobs had will commonly metastasize in another organ during a patient 's lifetime , and that the organ is usually the liver .
" All total , 75 % of patients are going to have the disease spread over the course of their life , " said Dr. Hawkins , who has not treated Mr. Jobs .
Getting a liver transplant to treat a metastasized neuroendocrine tumor is controversial because livers are scarce and the surgery 's efficacy as a cure has n't been proved , Dr. Hawkins added .
He said that patients whose tumors have metastasized can live for as many as 10 years without any treatment so it is hard to determine how successful a transplant has been in curing the disease .

But those are far from facts .
All we know is that the WSJ is saying Jobs got a transplant .
Regardless , when Steve gets back to work , I think we should all welcome him back .

Apparently Greta Van Susteren did n’t get the memo about how everyone at Fox News is supposed to be criticizing Barack Obama for the photo that supposedly shows the President checking out a young lady ’s backside .
Van Susteren went on her show and debunked the photo by showing the video of the event .
This has n’t stopped FNC from continuing the attack .
In case you have n’t seen it , here is the photo as first released by Reuters :
Advertisements
Of course , this sent the right wing into a tizzy , and even supposedly reputable journalists like ABC ’s Jake Tapper jumped on board without checking to see if the photo was the real deal .
Though to his credit , Tapper later corrected himself , by posting on his blog that , “ On first glance , the snapshot appears to show President Obama caught in a moment of less than lofty analysis .
But upon looking at the video , the moment might seem to appear quite innocent — one of those times when a picture can be misleading … ”
This has n’t stopped Fox News from running wild .
On his show last night Sean Hannity claimed that Obama was checking out her backside , but in the next hour on her show On the Record , Greta Van Susteren aired the video to debunk what she called , “ that lying photo going around the web . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
Greta said , “ Take a look at this video , it all looks pretty innocent right ?
President Obama in Italy posing for a photo with members of the Junior G8 , well there is a photo of this going around the Web that paints a very different picture .
Yes , a still picture can lie , and this one does .
The president was not well , we ’ll let you see for yourself .
The lying picture that is going around the Web is posted on our blog … ”
You would think that this might stop FNC , but the attacks continued on Fox and Friends this morning .
Here is the video :
Fox and Friends claimed that Obama was checking out a 17 year old .
It is amazing that Fox and Friends is still playing that photo off as real .
Despite the efforts of Greta Van Susteren in this case , and Shep Smith in other instances , this is why Fox News ca n’t be taken seriously as a non partisan news organization .
As a network , they subjectively ignore facts , or make up their own .
I think Van Susteren got in touch with her inner attorney last night .
This kind of thing has n’t been seen from her since she was at CNN .
She had better watch it though .
She saw what happened to Shep Smith when he went off the reservation .
FNC viewers called for everything short of his being shot at sunrise .
Once again , FNC serves as the perfect microcosm for the civil war with in the GOP , as even their on air personalities ca n’t stick to the company line .
Even after a member of their own organization takes the time to disprove the photo , the network keeps selling it as fact .
This is the very definition of a propaganda machine .
Frank McGarahan 's trip to Norwich had a celebratory motive .
Having travelled 80 miles from his home in the quiet Hertfordshire village of Much Hadham , he was in East Anglia for the baptism of his niece Thea , the first child of his youngest brother .
So it was no surprise he was in a good mood .
And , following a family meal on the eve of the christening , Mr McGarahan , his brother Kevin and their cousin Sean Ryan decided to carry on the festivities .
After drinking at various city centre bars the three called it a night and made their way to the taxi rank on Guildhall Hill .
It was at about 3 am on Sunday 28 September 2008 , while waiting for their carriage , that Mr McGarahan , whose job as a senior executive for Barclays Bank had made him a millionaire , spotted something that alarmed him : a gang of up to 12 young men attacking a homeless man .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Rather than ignore it , Mr McGarahan , 45 , walked 20 yards to remonstrate with the group .
His concern cost him his life .
When his back was turned Ben and Tom Cowles , two brothers who had trained as amateur boxers , attacked him .
Ben , 21 , had " taken a run " and punched Frank in the back of the head before turning his attention to Kevin , beating him to the floor .
Tom , 22 , then took over assaulting Frank , putting him in a headlock and punching him at least 10 times .
Their friend , Daniel Moy , 21 , punched Mr Ryan to the floor .
Then , after a further blow to the skull from Ben , Frank collapsed " suddenly and dramatically " .
He never regained consciousness and a post - mortem showed he died of bleeding to the brain .
Doctors noted that more than 20 marks and abrasions had been inflicted on the father - of - two , and he had suffered serious head and neck injuries .
As he lay dying , the attackers " turned on their heels and fled " , dodging the revellers still milling around the town square as they ran .
The following morning Father James Walsh , dean of Norwich 's Roman Catholic cathedral , received a phone call informing him that the 11 am baptism of baby
Thea would need to be cancelled .
Instead , the McGarahans ended up planning for a funeral .
Two days after the attack on 30 September , the Cowles brothers , from Norwich , handed themselves in to Norfolk police .
Both admitted taking part in the attack and said they had reacted after being called " cowards " .
Yesterday , however , Tom , a builder , and Ben , a pipefitter , pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter and to affray , relating to the attack on Robertas Sinkevicius , a Lithuanian " down and out " .
They will be sentenced on 26 June .
Moy , a carpenter , had already admitted assaulting Mr Ryan .
He was fined £ 50 and ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work .
In court , prosecutor Mark Dennis QC said that after the three victims had witnessed the attack on Mr Sinkevicius they intervened because they feared he would be badly injured .
" It was clear that someone needed to step in to prevent someone being seriously hurt .
In the circumstances they were brave to intervene , " Mr Dennis added .
Had the trial gone ahead , much of the police evidence would have been from what was captured on CCTV cameras .
Speaking about the attempt by the McGarahans and Mr Ryan to intervene in Mr Sinkevicius 's attack , a police source said : " Their body language clearly shows that they were not being aggressive , they were not threatening , they were simply trying to help someone who was being attacked and hoping their presence would calm the situation .

" They were attacked without provocation and warning , and what happened shows the dangers of punching people in the head .
They behaved as good citizens should , by going to help without being aggressive and paid a terrible price . "
They would also likely have relied on evidence from Darryl Lawton , a doorman from the nearby Spearmint Rhino gentleman 's club .
After hearing the attack on Mr Sinkevicius , he too went to intervene and ended up witnessing the death of Mr McGarahan .
At the time he said : " There were two men on the ground being attacked .
It was fists and feet .
It was extreme violence . "
Mr Lawton said he had caught one of the attackers , putting him in a headlock , but had to let go after a volley of kicks from other members of the gang broke his jaw .
The suspects escaped but left two men – Mr Sinkevicius and Mr McGarahan – lying in the street .
Mr Lawton , a trained first - aider , said : " One of the men was n't moving and was quiet .
He was n't breathing .
The other man 's face was covered in blood , but his hand was moving .
I put the man who was quiet into the recovery position and started working on him , giving him mouth to mouth .
But there was no response and I knew there was a problem . "
Mr McGarahan , who was in charge of 7,700 members of staff and managed assets worth £ 133bn as the chief operations officer for Barclays Wealth , died at Addenbrooke 's hospital in Cambridge the following day .
His older brother Tony , who was in court , said shortly after the tragedy that the family would " never truly recover " .
" He did what was natural to him – try and help someone – because they needed help , " he said .
" We will always be proud of Frank and we will never ever forget him .
He was a fantastic father to his two young beautiful daughters , a loving husband to his wife [ Alison ] , a big - hearted son to his mum and dad and a brilliant brother and uncle .
He was simply a great family man . "
The court also heard that Kevin McGarahan had told police the three men had approached with " caution " and had shown no " aggressive intent " , but were attacked without provocation .
He added : " There is a sense of devastation over what has happened to my brother Frank .
His death destroyed us and ripped our family apart .
He has left behind a wife and two young children who will never know their father .
All we were trying to do was help a man who was in trouble . "

Congressional Budget Office projection
Democratic health bill would leave 37 million uninsured in 2019
By Kate Randall
17 June 2009
The Obama administration responded Tuesday to a report issued by the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , which estimates that health care legislation being drafted by a Senate committee would leave 37 million Americans uninsured while costing $ 1 trillion over 10 years .
The White House was quick to reiterate that any plan the president may eventually sign must subordinate an expansion of healthcare coverage or services to cost - cutting measures .
The response was focused not on the tens of millions of potentially uninsured children and adults , but on reassuring financial interests of the administration ’s commitment to fiscal responsibility .
“ President Obama has been clear that health care reform is critical to our nation ’s fiscal future , ” stated Linda Douglass , communications director in the White House Office of Health Reform .
“ It is not true reform if it is not deficit - neutral .
There are several bills being written in Congress and committees in the House and Senate are working through many proposals . ”
Distancing Obama from the proposed legislation , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stated , “ This is not the administration ’s bill . ”
He added that “ stakeholders from across the spectrum are joining with President Obama to enact health care reform that finally gets costs under control and expands coverage — without adding to our deficit . ”
Republicans pounced on the CBO report , which gave projections on the Affordable Health Choices Act , sponsored by Senate Health Education Labor and Pension Committee chairman Sen. Edward Kennedy ( Dem. - Mass . ) , one of several plans being drawn up in the House and Senate .
Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said in a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday , “ The health care proposal being put together is not only extremely defective , it will cost a fortune .
And that cost will come straight out of the taxpayer ’s pocketbook . ”
According to the CBO report , if current coverage were to be maintained , 50 million nonelderly individuals in the US would be uninsured in 2010 , rising to 54 million by 2019 .
The CBO ’s preliminary assessment of major provisions of the Affordable Health Choices
Act projects that over that same period about 40 million individuals would obtain coverage through insurance exchanges or “ gateways . ”
Through these exchanges , individuals or families could purchase health insurance , with some enrollees receiving subsidies to lower the costs .
At the same time , however , the CBO estimates that the number of people with coverage through an employer would decline by about 15 million , or about 10 percent .
Coverage through federal / state Medicaid , the Children ’s Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) and other programs would decline by an additional 8 million .
This would still leave an estimated 37 million Americans without insurance in 2019 — about 13 percent of the population .
The CBO report notes that although the proposed legislation would not change federal laws governing Medicaid and CHIP , it would most likely reduce outlays for those programs .
It projects that states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP to individuals with income above 150 percent of the federal poverty level would be expected to reverse those policies , because these people would be able to obtain subsidies through insurance exchanges financed by the government .
CBO estimates that federal outlays for Medicaid and CHIP would decline by $ 38 billion over the 2010 - 2019 period .
While CHIP provides comprehensive health coverage , critics of changes to the current system argue that families with children will be forced into obtaining new insurance with less extensive benefits .
There are currently an estimated 8 million children in the US without health insurance .
The US ranks third highest among the 30 industrialized members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in percentage of overall uninsured .
Democrats are divided on how to finance any proposed health care reform legislation .
Sen. Christopher Dodd ( Dem. - Conn ) , of the Senate health committee , opposes taxing employer - provided health benefits , and prefers instead limited restrictions on deductions by wealthy taxpayers .
Sen. Max Baucus ( Dem. - Mont. ) of the Senate Finance Committee , which is developing its own proposal , says committee members are open to taxing health benefits and believes President Obama would consider such a proposal , despite his statements during the presidential campaign , when the tax on benefits was proposed by Republican candidate John McCain .
Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee are entertaining implementation of a value - added tax ( or VAT ) , a regressive tax on consumer goods that would disproportionately impact working people .
There is no consideration in any of these plans of rolling back income tax cuts for top corporate earners to finance health care for the uninsured .
In an interview with the Associated Press Tuesday , Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sought to reassure private insurers that the Obama administration does not want to drive them out of business .
Sebelius , the former Kansas governor and insurance commissioner , said that Obama is open to compromise on the form of a public health plan , which would n’t necessarily have to be run by the government .
One plan under consideration would include “ consumer - owned ” nonprofit cooperatives , like rural electricity or agricultural co-ops .
She sought to dispel as “ not accurate ” any notion that a public health care option , “ is really a stalking horse ” for a government - run system .
She also said that any health care reform plan , even if passed by Congress and signed into law by Obama this fall could take years to cover the uninsured .
The Obama administration ’s outlook on health care reform was spelled out in even more straightforward fashion in an opinion piece by Peter Orszag , director of the Office of Management and Budget , published June 15 in the Financial Times .
Orszag writes , “ Healthcare cost growth dwarfs any of the other long - term fiscal challenges the US faces .
Nothing else we do on the fiscal front will matter much if we fail to address rapidly rising healthcare costs . ”
After noting that the “ US spends almost 50 percent more per person on healthcare than the next most costly nation , ” Orszag stresses that “ Mr. Obama is firmly committed to making healthcare reform deficit neutral over the next decade , using real savings or revenue proposals that can be scored by the Congressional Budget Office . ”
Such “ real savings ” in an Obama - envisioned health reform are to be achieved by making real cuts to medical services .
“ Reducing the number of tests , procedures and other medical costs that do not improve health presents an enormous opportunity , ” he argues .
Orszag reviews how Obama has proposed generating $ 635 billion for healthcare , with roughly half of this — or some $ 317 billion — coming from Medicare and Medicaid “ efficiencies ... such as reducing Medicare overpayments to private insurers . ”
He reminds his readers that last Saturday , Obama proposed an additional $ 313 billion in Medicare and Medicaid cuts , “ including a proposal that will generate about $ 106 billion in savings over 10 years by reducing payments that help hospitals with the cost of treating patients without insurance . ”
Orszag ominously notes , “ This is not the end of our commitment to fiscal responsibility . ”
He says with healthcare reform secured , the government can then concentrate on “ other aspects of fiscal sustainability , including Social Security reform . ”
Of course , no such concern for “ fiscal responsibility ” has prevented the Obama administration from handing over of trillions in taxpayer dollars , with no strings attached , to bail out the banks .
When it comes to health care , however , millions of uninsured Americans can expect to remain without coverage , as the White House maintains its commitment to “ deficit neutral ” reform .
As the recession deepens , this policy can only spell financial and physical hardship for working class families , with disastrous outcomes for many .
v1.1.4 brings compatibility
AMD Dual - Core CPU users running Windows Vista or the Windows 7 RC are in luck : up until recently , the company 's Dual - Core Optimizer , which syncs Time Stamp Counter MSRs on applicable chips , did n't work on either operating system .
We learn now it appears earlier this month the tool was updated , so it 's all yours for the taking -- grab it via the link at the bottom .
7 is not officially listed as supported , but like with most drivers and tools , the OS ' share compatibility here .
The confusing part is Vista and 7 are supposed to be optimized for dual - core CPUs already , so why the need for the Optimizer ?
In either case , the former is listed as supported , and the updated release notes state , " Fixed installation issue on Windows Vista " , so there must be some use there .
Ca n't hurt !

America as a Jihad State :
Middle Eastern perceptions of modern American theopolitics
© Abdal - Hakim Murad , 2013
‘ I love America , such a wonderful country – such a shame to see it taken over by religious fundamentalists . ’
( Iranian diplomat , cited in 2011 ) [ 1 ]
The tenth anniversary of the 9/11 atrocities provides a helpful opportunity to consider recent evolutions in Muslim perceptions of Western religious intention .
The rhetoric and dichotomies of the immediate aftermath have receded , and the more recent years have seemed to initiate some possible resolutions of the polarity which look beyond the faltering and controversial ‘ security agenda ’ .
The publication in 2007 of the Common Word marked perhaps the clearest and most remarkable sign of this , a genuine shift in the Muslim - Christian equation : David Burrell , one of the most seasoned Catholic scholars of Islam , wrote of a dramatic turn - about unparalleled in the recent history of the relationship .
[ 2 ]
More recently , the fall of the Bush administration seemed to permit a more measured and less histrionic assessment of America ’s travails with political Islam and political Christianity over the years since 2001 .
The Obama victory was followed within days by the death of Samuel Huntington , most notorious of advocates of the thesis of the mutual allergy of Islam and Christendom .
It is a good time to take stock .
In this essay I propose to examine one of the less frequently - noted of post - 9/11 developments by attempting a survey of changing Middle Eastern perceptions of America following the increased visibility of so - called ‘ theocon ’ tendencies in Washington under George Bush Jr. I will then move on to some more general reflections on the issue of scripturally - based political xenophobia as a strand in the mutual regard – or disregard – of what remains of Christian and Muslim civilisation , and its implications for the wider atmosphere in which the Muslim - Christian engagement is conducted .
The approach is necessarily imprecise .
Determining a generic Muslim view of this ( or of most things ) is hardly possible : regional , sectarian and educational variables see to that .
Muslim elites which conform to the emerging global monoculture have often been resistant to the idea that religion might be a factor in the politics of a country which is such a leading icon of modernity , while Islamists , by contrast , may exaggerate US official religiosity in order to appeal to audiences who think in religious terms , or , on occasion , to bolster a polemic against the secular discourse of the regimes .
A further difficulty is that Muslim elites attracted to the monoculture may not have access to the books and media reports written in local languages which should form the basis of our survey .
Increasingly such elites read only in English and French , and a survey of regional newspapers and vernacular TV channels is unlikely to provide sure clues to their perceptions of the world .
As a final complication , their subject populations are typically consumers of mass media over which they exert only a very limited influence , and which are shaped by the censorship which is still normal in most Muslim states .
Hence the Middle Eastern media coverage of American fundamentalism has been extremely erratic , and our conclusions can be no more than tentative .
But for all the measurement problems , the transformation of Muslim perceptions of America has been considerable .
In 2009 , at the edge of the Tanezrouft desert near Timbuktu , the present writer listened to a traditional Sufi shaykh expounding the view that America ’s ‘ violence towards Muslims ’ ( i‘tida ’ ‘ ala ’l - muslimin ) is the consequence of a sahwa masihiyya , a Christian revival .
He seemed well - aware of the role of the Christian Coalition in the run-up to the Iraq war , despite living in a region where I saw no newspapers , and where internet access is almost impossible .
Yet he was familiar with the names of Franklin Graham , Pat Robertson , and other icons of the Christian Right .
For him , Alan Greenspan ’s explanation of the Iraq invasion in terms of America ’s need for oil was entirely unpersuasive : [ 3 ]
Bush and his team were crusaders ( salibiyyin ) , servants of Israel ( a‘ wan Isra’il ) , and madcap harbingers of the violent Second Coming of Christ .
Here is another anecdotal sign , this time from the opposite end of the cultural spectrum .
In November of 2005 , a very different group of Muslims gathered in Casablanca for the second symposium of an ‘ Arab - American Dialogue ’ .
The sponsor was a neoliberal American trust , and the subject was the familiar one of the relationship between religion and state in the Arab and American contexts .
The American team presented a critique of Arab society based on an apparent assumption that its political processes were rooted either in medieval Islamic thought ( essentially Mawardi ’s model ) , or in modern radical Islamism , with its Salafite doctrine of tawhid al - hakimiyya ( the monopolising of sovereignty by God ) .
The Arab team , mainly composed of secular intellectuals , attempted to explain that most modern Arab regimes , as nationalist autocracies , do not see themselves as standing in continuity with either tradition .
They added that for Muslims , political thought lies largely in the ijtihadi category of rulings , and is hence one of those branches of the Shari‘a which are more readily susceptible to change .
At this point the discussion grew more stimulating .
Some of the Arab thinkers present raised the issue of American theopolitics , citing Tocqueville ’s well - known observations about the coexistence of American official laicism with popular religiosity , and pointing out that many modern Muslim jurisdictions preside over a broadly similar separation .
But as in the world of Islam , where popular religious convictions can still influence the decision - making of the officially secular elites , American politicians cannot and do not ignore the hundred million or so voters who grade politicians for their correctness on faith - specific issues .
The report in al - Sharq al - Awsat continued : ‘ our American colleagues ( some of whom play an influential role in the American decision - making process ) failed to respond objectively and precisely to the fears of their Arab partners concerning the role of Christian fundamentalism in American political decision - making . ’[ 4 ]
In the early years of the decade , a major concern of Muslim commentators seemed to be Christian Zionism .
The Egyptian newspaper al - Ahram and the Lebanese - rooted al - H{ayat ran a number of op - ed pieces interpreting the apparent indulgence shown towards Israel by the Bush presidency in terms of the influence of pro-Israel evangelicals .
On occasion , the Iraq invasion was glossed in the context of end - time persuasions attributed to some members of the White House staff and the Pentagon .
For instance , a 2003 article by Ja‘far Hadi Hasan in al - Hayat urged readers to broaden their understanding of US objectives in the region to include the chiliastic .
For Hasan , Bush ’s core electorate are expecting the parousia in their lifetime , and as he writes : ‘ they believe that occupying Iraq confirms the predictions of the Bible ; it is one incident in a series of events before the return of the awaited Christ . ’
Hasan offers an outline of the history of Christian dispensationalism , summarising its schema of ‘ seven ages of the world ’ , and explains how many Bush voters believe themselves to stand at the threshold of the seventh age : Christ ’s millennial reign .
Hasan then goes on to identify dispensationalist decision - makers in the Bush team , including Commerce Secretary Donald Evans , a disciple of Billy Graham , and discusses Graham ’s son Franklin in his role as the President ’s personal religious mentor .
Hasan then summarises the core passages of the Book of Revelation which are central to the world - view of many so - called ‘ theocons ’ .
Much of Revelation , he writes , is ambiguous , but the role of Iraq in the end - time scenario is clear : Iraq , or ‘ Babylon ’ , will fill the nations with impurity ; and an angel of God ’s wrath will bring it to destruction , and it will be divided into three parts : exactly what America has achieved .
When that takes place , Jerusalem , the city of true belief and the polar opposite of Babylon , will hear the four angels liberated by the fall of the false city .
They will proclaim the imminence of a great battle , and then the reappearance of Jesus .
Thus the next stage in the theocon plan will be the destruction of the Dome of the Rock and the rebuilding of Solomon ’s Temple , where Christ himself will preside over the sacrificial rituals in order to symbolise the restoration of God ’s order on earth .
Hasan concludes with some reflections on right - wing American policies , attempting to fit them all into his interpretation .
Pat Robertson , he reports , preaches to the Christian world on the inexorable disappearance of virtue , the spread of abortion and sodomy , and the forgetting of God .
The environmental crisis is a positive sign that the present world is coming to an end .
[ 5 ]
Peacemaking is an illusion , even a demonic subversion , since conflict can only come to an end with Christ ’s millennial reign . [ 6 ]
Hasan ’s article may be fairly typical of the growing Muslim concern over the influence of America ’s religious right .
Baffled by what appears to regional commentators to be the foolhardiness of the Iraq invasion , and by the administration ’s perceived maximalist support for Israel , such Arab journalists have sought a master explanation in the Bible - time beliefs of key Bush decisionmakers . [ 7 ]
‘ Instead of a clash of civilizations , ’ one journalist concludes , ‘ we are witnessing a clash of religions ’ . [ 8 ]
As Hasan indicates , this interpretation of American actions is new .
And it will be helpful to trace the conduits by which , in a highly - censored media environment not particularly open to innovation , such a sea- change in understanding has taken place .
One key channel has been provided by Christian Arab journalists , whose greater cultural familiarity with the Bible and with Christian eschatology has allowed them to unravel the so - called ‘ double - coding ’ in presidential speeches , in which apparently innocuous phrases turn out to trigger specific Biblical resonances important to the religious electorate .
Particularly impressive was al - Hayat ’s coverage from Washington during the 2008 elections .
Its correspondent , Joyce Karam , showed a close awareness of the evangelical hesitations over John McCain .
Conservative evangelicals will almost invariably vote Republican , she observes , despite McCain ’s uneven record on abortion , but some moderate evangelicals , less convinced that religion requires a state of endless Middle Eastern war , had been seduced by the Obama camp , which had adroitly revived the memory of the Carter years .
Karam then accounts for the last - minute appointment of Sarah Palin as McCain ’s running - mate .
Altogether , she presents a persuasive account to her Arab readers of the issues surrounding Barack Obama ’s rise to power : religious politics , as well as the economy or a general post - conflict tristesse , are a significant hermeneutic key . [ 9 ]
If there is an interpretation , or an explaining - away , of the embarrassing – to Christian Arab nationalists – notion of a religious driver to American policy in the Near East , then it seems to have been articulated most typically by the Israeli Arab writer and former Knesset member , ‘ Azmi Bishara .
In a characteristically outspoken article in al - Ahram , this left - wing secular Christian explains the theocon phenomenon by outlining its historic roots in America ’s Puritan heritage .
For Bishara , the New Testament does not provide guidance , other than ‘ a universal message of love and understanding . ’
The Puritans , however , ‘ stressed the moral code expressed in the Old Testament . ’
Apparently revisiting perhaps the oldest trope of Christian anti-Judaism , the law - versus - spirit dichotomy , Bishara concludes that this is a Judaizing Christianity , which turns the Gospels into a simple extension of what is , by implication , the unpleasant , lawbound violence of the Hebrew Bible . [ 10 ]
Bishara ’s view is one that may also be heard from Orthodox church leaders in the Middle East .
The theocons are a reversion to an older , ‘ Jewish ’ type of political religion , and have failed to notice that St Paul proclaims the radical inferiority of Judaism and its law .
As for the theocon preoccupation with the seer of Patmos , this is also , by implication , a sort of Judaizing .
However the true meaning of Revelation is the eschatological disclosure of transformed life which is the Church .
This was Augustine ’s conviction ; but not every Protestant has been so happy to explain away the evident violence and retributive quality of the text .
Fifty - nine percent of Americans , according to a recent poll , affirm its literal truth . [ 11 ]
Another view was offered by the Lebanese - American writer Ghassan Rubeiz , who as the former secretary for the Middle East of the World Council of Churches is also active in the Arab media .
Rubeiz , evidently more aware of modern sensitivities , chooses not to adopt the old theme of a ‘ Judaizing Christianity ’ , but offers a more sociological account .
He asks why the religious right now appears to be the prevalent form of religion in America , with conservative megachurches experiencing boom times while older , soi-disant ‘ mainline ’ denominations face economic and numerical decline .
His interpretation is sociological and somewhat moralising : America ’s ever - increasing social mobility and rootlessness , set against the background of an unstable job market and the rise in divorce and remarriage , allow fundamentalist preachers to offer a simple explanation of an otherwise confusing world .
On the basis of this interpretation the map divides into Christendom and the lands of darkness , while history is interpreted as a series of Biblically - foretold signs which culminate in the imminent and longed - for end of ambiguity and doubt at the Rapture and the Second Coming . [ 12 ]
Another Christian writer has been the Egyptian Samir Murqus .
A sociologist of religion who founded a Coptic Centre for Social Studies and has been active in Muslim - Christian dialogue , Murqus published , in 2001 , a popular but careful book on the role of Protestant fundamentalism in American foreign policy . [ 13 ]
In the wake of the 9/11 attacks he went on to publish American Imperialism : The Triad of Wealth , Faith and Power , [ 14 ] in which he seeks to challenge the widespread Arab perception that current American policies reflect the pragmatic post - Soviet world of sole - superpower status , rather than a much older configuration of faith , money and power .
On his view , the processes whereby ‘ missionary , soldier and trader ’ worked together in conquering the New World reasserted themselves in the twentieth century , until they finally became the prevalent paradigm during the Bush administration , their relationship ‘ taking a contemporary shape relevant to globalisation ’ but still recognisably rooted in the original pattern of American religious conquest . [ 15 ]
The book is based on a wide range of Western academic studies , enriched by the author ’s own daily scrutiny of President Bush ’s faith - oriented pronouncements .
On the basis of these and other books on American political religion [ 16 ]
Murqus has also contributed a number of articles to the Arab press .
Turning now to Islamic and Islamist mass media – a small part of the whole in the Middle East – we encounter a slowly increasing sophistication and level of awareness .
While takfiri Salafi formations such as those which self - identify as al - Qa‘ida are content to use generic terms such as ‘ crusading ’ to account for American interventions in the Muslim world , and offer simple accounts of the power of the ‘ Jewish lobby ’ over Christians paralyzed with guilt over the Holocaust , moderate Islamism appears able to adopt a slightly more informed view .
One example would be the coverage by the Turkish religious newspaper Zaman ( associated with the movement of Fethullah Gülen ) of President Bush ’s apparently enthusiastic reading of the memoirs of Oswald Chambers , a Baptist missionary who accompanied the British invasion of Ottoman Palestine in 1917 , and whose crusading manual is apparently still popular as inspirational reading for advocates of ‘ faith - based war ’ . [ 17 ]
A further case of this was Islamist coverage of the role of Blackwater , the security firm engaged by the Pentagon in conflict zones such as Iraq .
Exempted by Paul Bremer ’s Immunity Order No.17 from prosecution by Iraqi authorities , Blackwater operatives were accused of a range of abuses against Iraqi civilians , including the Nisour Square incident late in 2007 .
At least two major sources of Islamist knowledge about the alleged religious agenda of Blackwater can be identified .
Firstly , there is a European Parliament report written by Giovanni Claudio Fava , which details the connections between Blackwater and the Knights of Malta , a sovereign fraternity of Catholic military elites answerable directly to the Pope .
The occasion for the European Parliament ’s inquiry was the claim that two Blackwater subsidiaries were involved in US special rendition flights .
Fava confirmed the connection with the Knights of Malta , and indicated that Malta was one of Blackwater ’s primary operational bases .
Its vice - president , Cofer Black , had been the CIA officer responsible for special renditions of detainees to pro-Western regimes which employed torture as an interrogation technique .
The second source is a popular book on Blackwater by the American journalist Jeremy Scahill .
Meticulously referenced , this book convinced many in the West that the leadership of Blackwater was driven by a hardline Christian agenda championed by , as Scahill puts it , ‘ extreme religious zealots ’ . [ 18 ]
Scahill records that its head , former Department of Defence Inspector General Joseph Schmitz , is himself a Knight of Malta .
He is portrayed as an energetic preacher on behalf of a crusading ideology for our time , his recurrent theme being ‘ the rule of law under God . ’
America ’s role in the world is to bring God ’s law to all humanity , in what Scahill terms a vision of ‘ Christian supremacy ’ .
Scahill ’s book appeared in March 2007 , and became a world bestseller , following already intense speculation about private armies and their role in the Pentagon ’s new wars in the Islamic world .
A month later , even before the Arabic translation was published , [ 19 ] a review appeared on a website connected to the Muslim Brotherhood leader Shaykh Yusuf al - Qardawi . [ 20 ]
The review homed in on the religious ideology of the Blackwater leadership , and particularly on Erik Prince , the founder - chairman , a figure already known to the Arab press .
Prince , the review believes , is a ‘ secretive , neo - crusader mega- millionaire [ … ] a major bankroller of President George Bush . ’
On Scahill ’s account , with his connections to right - wing Catholic groups Prince believes that Blackwater is an important vehicle for ensuring the central role of Christianity in US foreign policy .
As Prince says : ‘ Everybody carries guns , just like the Prophet Jeremiah rebuilding the temple in Israel – a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other . ’
Media reports on Blackwater ’s apparent right - wing Catholic affiliations had several consequences , most notably an instruction purporting to be from al - Qa‘ida summoning Muslims to attack the Cairo embassy of the Knights of Malta .
( In the event , nobody bothered . )
From a different ideological base , Jordanian MP Jamal Muhammad ‘ A < bida <t wrote in the Abu Dhabi newspaper al - Bayan that the revelations about the religious motivations of the Blackwater management shed new and disturbing light on American intentions :
The painful saga of modern Arab - Muslim history evokes the battles fought in the Crusades of the eleventh century , when the Knights of Malta began their operations as a Christian militia whose mission it was to defend the land conquered by the Crusaders .
These memories return violently to mind with the discovery of links between the so - called security firms in Iraq such as Blackwater which have historic links with the Knights of Malta .
You can not exaggerate it .
The Order of Malta is a hidden government , or the most mysterious government in the world . [ 21 ]
In 2009 , a book on the Knights of Malta appeared from the prolific pen of Mansur ‘ Abd al - H{akim .
Entitled The State of the Knights of Malta and the Iraq Invasion , its more lurid subtitle ran The Military Wing of the Antichrist , Masonic Knights Templars , Soldiers of Darkness . [ 22 ]
‘ Abd al - Hakim , an Egyptian lawyer and journalist , is one of the region ’s most popular religious writers on current affairs .
Many of his hundred - odd books reveal a strong predilection for conspiracy theories .
Sources for his long account of the Knights of Malta include , as well as Scahill ’s book , an eclectic mixture of Ibn Kathir , Robert Fisk , Dan Brown , and David Icke , indicating the success of a new genre of apocalypticism which mingles Islamic with popular Western lore ( another of his best - selling works offers an Islamic reading of the predictions of Nostradamus ) .
In their fondness for doom - laden prophecies , particularly in the post - 9/11 age , some modern Middle Eastern readers have tastes intriguingly similar to their American counterparts .
Through investigative journalism popularised by mass - circulation screeds , the notion of the world ’s largest mercenary army , accused of arbitrary and excessive violence in Iraq , being led by soldiers who take a direct oath of obedience to a Pope who had already caused controversy with his comments on Islam , seems to have entered a wide circulation .
It was reinforced by the American journalist Seymour Hirsh , who in a speech in Doha on 17 January 2011 alleged that Knights of Malta and other Christian militants exercised increasing influence in the US military .
‘ We ’re going to change mosques into cathedrals [ … ] that ’s an attitude that pervades , I ’m here to say , a large percentage of the Special Operations Command . ’[ 23 ]
The practice of rendition also triggered Arab media concern with the interrogation style and cultural policies applied to Muslim suspects in American custody .
While it has not been possible for the media , including Arab media , to know precisely what procedures have been used at the various ‘ black sites ’ around the globe , there has been extensive public - domain documentation of American practices at the Guantánamo Bay facility .
The various methods of detainee control were deployed by interrogators schooled in what they took to be the cultural vulnerabilities of Arabs and Muslims .
The use of methods such as the playing of loud rock music , insults to female family members , nudity , comparing prisoners to rats and dogs , and requiring detainees to wear female clothing , has been familiar in the Muslim world since , in June 2005 , Time magazine published classified logs recording the interrogation of the Saudi prisoner Muhammad al - Qahtani . [ 24 ]
Culturally - specific interrogation techniques designed to cause maximum distress to Muslim detainees were , of course , likely to cause maximum outrage to Muslim public opinion . [ 25 ]
Best - known were the instances of ‘ Qur ’an abuse ’ by camp guards ; but the use of Christian imagery to humiliate prisoners is also documented , such as the use of crosses to which prisoners pointed or reached to indicate that they were ready to talk .
An example is the poem by Mohammed El - Gharani , a fourteen year - old Chadian taken to Guantánamo ( since released ) :
We saw such insults from them ,
Not even the book of God was protected .
Along with their malice , they were foolish .
Tribulations , then hitting and imbecility .
For they are a people without reasonable minds ,
Due to their supply of alcoholic drinks .
The ‘ Greasy ’ arrived , in our state of need ,
On the condition that we raise the card with a cross .
‘ If you want dignity and protection ,
Then raise the cross for protection . ’
All of us threw the card away ,
Intent that our spirits be redeemed in sacrifice . [ 26 ]
Also popular among Muslim readers is the memoir of the former Muslim chaplain at Guantánamo , James Yee , who was arrested in 2003 on charges which were subsequently dropped . [ 27 ]
He describes the curiously religious atmosphere on the base , with camp commander Major - General Geoffrey Miller appearing at the forefront of morning prayers with his guards and interrogators before they dispersed to their tasks .
[ 28 ]
To his recollection , religiously - specific forms of abuse , such as desecration , appeared to be woven into the system ; [ 29 ]
‘ Gitmo ’s secret weapon , ’ he writes , ‘ was the use of religion against the prisoners . ’[ 30 ]
The evangelical Miller , shortly afterwards , departed for Iraq with a brief to ‘ Gitmoize ’ the prison facility at Abu Ghraib .
He was sent there by General William Boykin , deputy undersecretary of defence for intelligence , himself a committed evangelical known for regularly preaching in uniform , claiming to his congregations that ‘ Satan wants to destroy us as a nation , and he wants to destroy us as a Christian army ; ’ however ‘ they will only be defeated if we come against them in the name of Jesus . ’[ 31 ]
Through reports by Yee and others , perceived evangelical control of the major detention facilities in the War on Terror again appears to have had a significant impact on Muslim public opinion .
A further conduit through which information on US theopolitics has reached the Middle East has been the translation of Kimberly Blaker ’s collection of essays by academics , first published as The Fundamentals of Extremism in 2003 .
In 2006 , an Arabic translation , Usul al - Tatarruf , appeared with the Cairo - based publishing house al - Shuruq , whose managing director ‘ A < dil al - Mu‘allim has taken a close interest in the rise of American theopolitics .
This is a careful and responsible translation of an important text , perhaps , along with Chris Hedges ’ book American Fascists and Kevin Phillips ’ American
Theocracy , the most serious study of American religious radicalism yet to appear . [ 32 ]
Through all of these channels , then , the perception of the leading Western nation as profoundly driven by Christian evangelicalism and dispensationalism has taken root in the Middle East .
The consequence has been far - reaching : whereas ten years ago Muslims tended to view America as a secular republic containing many religious Christians , the perception is now gaining ground that America is a specifically Christian entity , whose policies on Israel , and whose otherwise mystifying violence against Muslims , whether in occupied countries or in detention , can usefully be explained with reference to the Bible .
Commentary
Reflecting on this transformation , it may be appropriate to begin with some remarks on the irony of this mutual regard .
Superficially , the dispensationalist and dominionist ethos regularly noted during the Bush years appears as a mirror image of takfiri Salafism ; the parallel has been drawn by , amongst others , the Turkish theology graduate Sule Albayrak in her 2007 work on Christian extremism , [ 33 ] and by the Egyptian Majdi Kamil in a book equating Christian and Islamic radicalism which appeared in the same year . [ 34 ]
In the vision of some Pentagon generals prosecuting the hunt for Bin Laden , the world seemed to divide into an abode of peace , freedom and love , presided over by America ’s believing army ; and an abode of war , a Muslim Babylon , the necessary object of invasion and subsequent economic and cultural control .
For Albayrak , this is premised on a kind of ‘ moral Manicheanism ’ . [ 35 ]
Evangelical leaders are the equivalent of rogue mullahs , issuing fatwas which sanctify wars which devastate whole nations .
The enemy is Satan himself , opposed by self - appointed Hegelian heroes : Boykin , Ashcroft , Miller .
Scripture supplies values and law ; secularity is Godless hubris and the reign of darkness , which allows and is assisted by the growth of false religions .
Each side figures itself primarily as the virtuous opposite of the Other : Boykin was raised by God to challenge Bin Laden , rather as Charles Martel existed because of al - Ghafiqi .
Rights are easily suspended : Islamists kill noncombatants by opportunistically invoking maslaha ( public interest ) and the principle of takfir ; while Washington is seen as rendering and killing suspects in the spirit of Tocqueville himself , who had supported the total abolition of human rights in order to suppress the 1848 Paris revolution .
Both seem to call for a utopia established through drastic constraint .
Both , finally , are erastian in their constitutional thinking : the established religious leaders ( the derided ‘ moderates ’ ) are to be bypassed as false mediators , in favour of a divine sovereignty exercised by a righteous prince alone .
Such warriors are clear that they take their orders directly from God . [ 36 ]
( President Bush himself said : ‘ I trust God speaks through me .
Without that , I could n’t do my job . ’[ 37 ] )
Such a mirroring is easily claimed ; but historians of religion will be suspicious of so neat a schema .
In a simple way members of each culture seem to believe that they can lessen their own burden of guilt by pointing to reciprocities on the other side ; and at times Albayrak and Kamil seem to do this , as do other Muslims keen to echo William Arkin ’s denunciation of the Pentagon ’s ‘ Christian jihad ’ . [ 38 ]
More taxingly , the discourse of a clear mirroring implies that the internal differentia of Christianity and Islam have only insignificant entailments today , which , again , is hardly likely .
What is ‘ odd - handed ’ ( Kenneth Cragg ’s phrase ) about this ‘ clash of fundamentalisms ’ ?
There are asymmetries which demand to be listed prominently .
One of these , noted by Muhammad ‘ Arif , is that they have distinct sociologies and histories .
For ‘ Arif , the Islamic world has spent the past century moving from a religious towards a secular frame of reference , but while Ataturk was secularising Turkey , fundamentalists were laying the foundations for a theocratic order in America . [ 39 ]
‘ Arif also points out the connection between wealth and evangelicalism , something normally absent in the Islamic case . [ 40 ]
In fact , one needs no Marxian baggage to observe that Islamic civilisation , with minor Gulf exceptions , is presently a Lazarus at the gate of Dives .
Christianity , which emerged – pace the prosperity - gospellers – as a discourse of the poor , has become the favoured sacred space of the wealthiest and most competitive economic culture that has ever evolved .
For many theocons this is not a paradox but a sign of God ’s grace .
Takfiri Islamism , however , exists in part in order to refute this discourse .
Despite its abhorrence of Sufi asceticism , and its hyperconservative social ethos , it often takes itself to be a site of resistance to wealth and privilege .
It is not Babylon – that was the self - serving laicity of Saddam and the Ba‘thist nomenklatura – but Ishmael .
Like the dispensationalist , the Islamist seems unnerved by the strange inactivity of God – the deus absconditus who because of the sins of the faithful has allowed the rise of liberal secularity , the growth of vice and the atrophy of faith .
Yet the usual Islamist response has been precisely the ancient trope of God ’s preference for the underdog , the mustad ‘ af .
For Boykin , God is with America , and this is shown by America ’s economic and martial prowess ; for the Islamist , God is with Ishmael , as is shown , again , by America ’s economic and martial prowess .
Attorney - General John Ashcroft had himself anointed with holy oil , [ 41 ] denounced church - state separation as ‘ a wall of religious oppression ’ , [ 42 ] and strove to implement God ’s law .
Islamists behave in a roughly analogous way .
Yet theirs is taken to be a site of resistance , on behalf of Ishmael ’s ‘ black house in Mecca ’ , against the evangelical White House in the city of Masonic symbolism , seen as the nerve - centre of wealth and Pharaonic evil .
This is not the pacifism and political indifferentism of the Gospels , nor a Baptist joy in God ’s empowerment of His covenant people ; it is more akin to Amos ’s prophecy of the uprising of the poor .
Much of its appeal derives from this sense of moral drama .
Hence instead of a simple symmetry we might prefer to diagnose a resuscitation of the ancient theme of ‘ Rome and Jerusalem ’ , beloved of Tacitus , and present in its most iconic form in Josephus .
On this view , Hamas are the sicarii , the assassins of occupied Judea , who gave their lives in suicidal missions against their Herodian and Roman overlords .
So Hamas ’s struggle has included assassinations of local collaborators and quislings , who have failed to observe that God ’s law alone applies , and that the civic space of Rome , now the global empire of the monoculture , has its foundations in anthropolatry : public sports , the shameless cult of the body , the greed of the forum .
Rome , in contempt at the rebels , deploys its Herod , whose name may not only be Mahmud ‘ Abbas , but is also Asif Zardari and H{usni Mubarak , and many others besides , as the loyal tribune of a world empire in which exotic local deities may be tolerated only in the private space .
The public square is ruled only by the emperor and his deputies .
Such a historical analogy might help us to parse the optimism of the apocalyptic Islamist .
Even utter defeat at Masada is reckoned a victory for the Zealot martyr , who , therefore , is invincible .
Guantánamo turned into the zealot ’s triumph : during six excruciating years , several camp guards converted to Islam , but not a single inmate reached for the Cross . [ 43 ]
Under the unblinking eye of the evangelical in Ray - Bans and crew - cut , the detainee may lose his sanity , or attempt suicide , but he is not defeated .
Rome , he knows , will fall in the end ; God is with the tormented .
So the cage , the great panopticon in the sun , inverts its creator ’s purpose .
It was built , it now seems , not to extract confessions – since the more significant suspects mostly remained out of view in the ‘ black sites ’ – but as a therapeutic exhibition akin to the victory parades of Caesar , who had Vercingetorix placed in a cage and displayed to the citizens of Rome .
The American soul was wounded on 9/11 , and the parade of humiliated men in beards at Camp X - Ray was an icon which it could contemplate , and in which it could find healing .
Jesus himself will stare , with eyes of fire , at the sinners , before consigning them to the lake of torment ; and the Cuban cages seemed to serve as a proleptic anticipation of the vengeance of Christ promised in the Book of Revelation .
Yet still the icon failed .
In the world of Islam it was experienced not as a healing but as a kind of auto - da - fé , in which internees whose crimes seemed always doubtful , but whose Muslimness was certain , were tormented by Christian inquisitors .
For many in the world of Islam it also seemed to represent , in the most public way , the private habits of the local Herods , whose cages were also well - stocked with the same kind of zealots .
Rome may torment the body , and Herod is even keener to do so .
But as the cage suggests , her main instrument of pain is psychological .
In the mid-19th century , American penal reformers invented a ‘ Philadelphia System ’ , following the ‘ scientific ’ British innovations at Pentonville .
For the most enlightened reasons , physical abuse was reduced or abolished as a relic of the medieval past , to be replaced by modern and hygienic methods of intangible pressure .
Prisoners were to be referred to only by numbers .
They would be permitted no visitors and no letters , and would wear black hoods whenever taken from their cells .
Silence was universally imposed .
‘ In the penitentiary , the sense of criminal community was voided : all other prisoners were silent , invisible abstractions to the man in his solitary cell .
The republic of crime was vaporized , and all social sense along with it , leaving only a disoriented , passive obedience . ’[ 44 ]
Charles Dickens , visiting Philadelphia ’s new Eastern Penitentiary , was terrified by this enlightened Benthamite machine :
I believe that very few men are capable of estimating the immense amount of torture and agony which this dreadful punishment , prolonged for years , inflicts [… ]
There is a depth of terrible endurance in it which none but the sufferers can fathom .
I hold this slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body ; and because its ghastly signs and tokens are not so palpable to the eye and sense of touch as scars upon the flesh ; because its wounds are not upon the surface [… ] therefore the more I denounce it , as a secret punishment which slumbering humanity is not roused up to stay . [ 45 ]
No less Benthamite was the new willingness to abandon ancient precedent and to convict on the basis of alleged intention .
The Kafaesque trial of Jose Padilla , driven to the brink of insanity by his experience in custody , has been only the most notorious case of this . [ 46 ]
The panopticon will not allow even the mind to be a private space .
Here we might learn from Slavoj Zizek ’s division of violence into three kinds : subjective , symbolic , and systemic .
This violence against the subject , recently curtailed in President Obama ’s directives , was more than replicated not only by Herod , in the prisons of Egypt or Tunisia , but by the zealots themselves : whatever their liberative cast of mind , the zealots have not hesitated to use forms of physical pain immeasurably greater than those documented at Guantánamo .
This has been the pattern of much Islamist revolt since the time when the enragés of the Iranian revolution , moralising about the Shah ’s secret police , quickly brought in Ayat Allah Khalkhali as their own Robespierre .
But more substantial , Zizek claims , is symbolic violence ‘ embodied in language and its forms , what Heidegger would call our “ house of being ” . ’ [ 47 ]
By this he means the monoculture ’s imposition of ‘ a certain universe of meaning ’:
In our secular , choice - based societies , people who maintain a substantial religious belonging are in a subordinate position .
Even if they are allowed to maintain their belief , this belief is ‘ tolerated ’ as their idiosyncratic personal choice or opinion .
The moment they present it publicly as what it is for them , say a matter of substantial belonging , they are accused of ‘ fundamentalism ’ .
What this means is that the subject of ‘ free choice ’ in the Western ‘ tolerant ’ multicultural sense can emerge only as the result of an extremely violent process of being torn out of a particular lifeworld , of being cut off from one ’s roots . [ 48 ]
For Zizek , then , religion is always oppressed by the monoculture .
An example would be the latter ’s insistence that freedom of expression , although in practice favouring those with access to media and money , is always a precondition for human dignity .
If remnants of non-monocultural worlds complain , as they do , that they prefer to suffer physical over symbolic violence , the monoculture appears to have no reply .
The Muslim who says she would rather be physically tortured than hear her Prophet insulted or see the Qur’an ‘ abused ’ is , from the perspective of the monoculture , simply living in the wrong world .
The post -9/11 world , of a passionate susurration of anti-Muslim sentiment , is the only world that exists .
Those who experience it as violent must learn to experience it differently .
Zizek ’s third category , systemic violence , takes us back to Ishmael and his casting - out into the desert by the privileged forms of modern Biblicism .
Zizek , of course , prefers to think in terms of Marx .
For him , turbo - capitalism , on trial since 2008 , is straightforwardly at fault for the infant mortality rate in Mali .
It is also the dynamo of terrorism .
He writes of ‘ the hypocrisy of those who , while combating subjective violence , commit systemic violence that generates the very phenomena they abhor ; ’[ 49 ] a view likely to resonate with much Muslim criticism .
What was notable , for Islamist observers , in the experiment with radical Christianity during the Bush years , was not so much the presence of an adjustment in Christendom ’s systemic violence towards the East , which they regard as a historic constant .
What they seem to find refreshing is that the core religious differentials , once politely or even sincerely buried away , are now in the foreground .
Both Islam and Christianity claim to be reverting to themselves ( for Islamists , this is the rhetoric of asala ) .
Yet historians are likely to demur : the processes of identity - retrieval in fact tend to yield a growing distance from historic mainstreams . [ 50 ]
In the former world , kalam , Sufism , and classical legal and political thought are giving way to an insistence on building a scriptural commonwealth which champions the rights of the righteous , and in which the classical Islamic denial of legislative powers to the state is replaced by a totalitarian etatism .
In Christendom , some forty percent of Americans now believe that the Antichrist is already on the earth ; [ 51 ] and nine percent would like to see the Bible become the ‘ only ’ source of legislation . [ 52 ]
Europeans may shrug , but even in the UK , the number of worshippers at one Pentecostal church in Walthamstow one Easter Sunday was more than double the congregations at St Paul ’s and Westminster Abbey combined , [ 53 ] and the presiding pastor , an advocate of the prosperity gospel , is very clear that Israel is Isaac , while the Arabs are ‘ Ishmael ’ , the outcast . [ 54 ]
In both worlds there has been a steady growth in ideological , dichotomising religion , whose provocative conspicuousness tends to feed the growth of its rivals , producing a vicious circle .
No doubt this tendency will be seen in simple terms as a decadence .
As Cardinal Newman put it , ‘ the nation drags down its Church to its own level . ’
But it is a protest against decadence as well .
If the modern world is experienced as a kind of Mardi Gras , all differences levelled in the pursuit of pleasure and the right to pleasure , and if mainline denominations have substantively acceded to monocultural values and ideologies of progress , then the fundamentalist fight for difference , including a difference that can only exist by discriminating against increasingly ideologized Others , can to some extent claim to be a site of real resistance and a genuine ‘ awakening ’ ( sahwa ) .
Milan Kundera said that ‘ the struggle of men against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting . ’[ 55 ]
The end of history at the hands of liberal consumerism finds it hard not to comprise an amnesia , an end of memory and therefore of the authentic self : Foucault ’s ‘ end of man ’ .
However an age of drowsy comforts craves a stimulant .
Fifty years ago , during another era of polarities , Arthur Schlesinger wrote that self - satisfied Western man was in crisis ; casting around for a catharsis he decided that the Cold War ought to be used as an opportunity to wake him up . [ 56 ]
Tocqueville thought that France ’s invasion of Algeria would resuscitate it from post - Napoleonic torpor .
Hannah Arendt , reflecting on both Nazism and Communism , concluded that the content of ideology tends to be less attractive than the invigorating fact of belonging to it , of being steered in a rudderless world . [ 57 ]
Even further back , militant Puritans believed that ‘ the world ’s peace is the keenest war against God , ’[ 58 ] because it led to complacency and the stagnation of the spirit .
As at Guantánamo , morality is not the core issue , what matters is the symbolism of belonging , animated by a sense of destiny .
These examples , drawn from Corey Robin ’s recent study of political fear , are linked by the idea that it is lack of direction which drives people into the arms of apparently absurd conflictual certainties , so that their selfhood is reborn in the refiner ’s fire of a perpetual state of alarm .
Today , the Saudification of Islam , or the Southernization of American Christianity , are both strengthened by their claim to resolve our modern anomie .
Earlier ages suffered such temptations , but it is possible that we are endangered by them far more , since we are that much further from tradition , identity , and consensual truths .
What is after post - modernity ?
When it arrives , whatever it is , can it possibly allow the puer aeternus ( Jung ’s contemptuous diagnosis of our post - sacred condition , now exacerbated by media ‘ dumbing - down ’ ) once more to achieve anything resembling adulthood ?
If scientists are now writing books like Daniel Wegner ’s The Illusion of Conscious Will , [ 59 ] if we are told that what we do simply happens to us , then how likely are we to find any true humanism outside the imaginative world of theism ?
Put in Ash‘arite terms , can we look for any values in a secular world which denies our own acquisition , kasb , of our actions ?
Zizek should not assume so quickly that the believer ’s cynicism about secular ethics cannot be accompanied by an ethical alternative .
For Zizek , the two mutually parasitic fundamentalisms will only be neutralised when the world appreciates the value of a public neutrality , thus resurrecting the central energies of the Enlightenment and supplying an alternative and more tolerant awakening .
His prescription and prediction , then , are startlingly conservative , converging with the polemics of Roger Scruton : one recalls the way in which al - Qa‘ida has reconciled the Hitchens brothers .
As in the time of Charlemagne , the West will be united by Islam , but whereas for American believers this will happen beneath the banner of political Christianity , Zizek still yearns for a secular revival .
Where mainline belief continues to be full of passionate conviction , it will probably prefer enlightenment in the form of better education .
In an era of connectivity , few seem to sufficiently informed : Muslims shopping for books in Cairo may learn the names of Pat Robertson and John Hagee , but are likely to ignore the existence of the archbishop of Chicago .
Reciprocally , it appears that few in Christendom can yet name a single mainstream Muslim thinker .
This was brought home in an absolute way in 2008 , when two magazines , Foreign Affairs and Prospect , sponsored a global survey to identify the world ’s hundred most influential public intellectuals .
The overall winner was Fethullah Gülen , a fact that surprised few in the Muslim world , but which baffled Westerners familiar only with the names of radicals . [ 60 ]
This aporia has had practical consequences for the mutual regard of Christianity and Islam .
America seems increasingly to figure itself as what - is - not - Muslim , or even , for some , as ‘ the world ’s leading Bible - reading crusader state ’ ; [ 60 ] while the Islamists , no better informed , consider themselves to be under a generic military and cultural attack from Christians ( and from their allies ‘ the Jews ’ ) . [ 62 ]
Everywhere this polarity is strengthened by the sense that the moderates have not done enough to denounce the extremists ; as Jan Linn says : ‘ The virtual silence within the Christian community about the rise of the Christian Right is partly responsible for its gaining mainstream status . ’[ 63 ]
I began by suggesting that we are now in what feels like an aftermath , following the closure of the Bush parenthesis .
Obama feels like Charles the Second : after a decade of Puritan discourses on sin and redemption , divine immanentism , providence , and the special destiny of the people , [ 64 ] the population has grown tired , and the flags have begun to disappear from the churches .
The mutedness of religious slogans during the recent ‘ Arab Spring ’ suggests that the Islamists , too , are losing the initiative .
Perhaps one sign of this is the prospering of the Common Word , a document which in many ways may be seen as a product of the later post - 9/11 environment ( several of its authors and signatories had clearly been concerned by the ‘ biblicising ’ of American discourse towards the Islamic world ) .
Where the fundamentalists take scripture to be the site of the most irreducible Christian - Muslim differences , and the symbol and engine of the Other ’s revanchism , the Common Word ’s use of Qur’an and Bible seeks to indicate the possibility of a new and more conciliatory discursive relationship .
In 2008 the Common Word process reached Yale Divinity School , which had already coordinated an endorsement of the document by three hundred evangelical leaders ; the ensuing conference saw evangelicals and Muslims adopting language about a common ‘ Judeo - Christian - Islamic monotheistic heritage ’ . [ 65 ]
The decade closed with several substantial publications by Muslim and Christian theologians seeking ways in which the two scriptures , even on very classical readings , could facilitate positive theological , political and social engagement between monotheists . [ 66 ]
While less conspicuous than the growth of the ‘ theocon ’ agenda or its Muslim epigones , this too has increasingly formed part of the evolution of the Muslim - Christian regard in the last decade .
A generation or two ago , writers on international affairs would have ridiculed the idea that ancient eschatologies could become factors in 21st - century politics .
This is , however , our situation .
Holy books , and the mood of their interpreters , are bound up with the world ’s current polarities .
It is likely that exegetes , of whatever stamp , will do much to shape the future of countries like Egypt and Turkey as they move towards full democracy , and decide whether to maintain their recent secular patterns , or to learn from the American model of a complex symbiosis of faith and power .
Conversely , some Americans may find the experience of Islamism a helpful reminder of the dangers attendant upon reading God ’s word as the manifesto of a utopian political ideology .

PRESIDENT
Obama this week began cracking down big - time on tax havens — and he ’s enlisted Rep. Charles Rangel to help .
Will this dynamic duo be swift and fair in meting out tax justice ?
It should n’t take long to find out :
After all , if Rangel and Obama are looking for culprits , they can begin in their own offices .
Start with Harlem ’s favorite Democrat , who heads the tax - writing House Ways and Means Committee .
As The Post noted in an editorial yesterday , Rangel has dodged his tax liabilities on his Dominican villa and helped save friends taxes in exchange for a school bearing his name .
But the fattest chapter in the “ Annals of Rangel Tax Scams ” covers his efforts on behalf of tax dodgers in the US Virgin Islands .
The islands are n’t a “ tax haven ” in the strictest sense — but they offer many benefits of offshore tax jurisdictions .
And as The New York Sun reported in 2003 , some wealthy money - managers who lived and worked in Chicago and New York exploited these tax breaks by claiming the USVI as their place of residence — and escaped nearly 90 percent of their income - tax bills .
Congress cracked down with the 2004 American Jobs Creation Act , requiring USVI taxpayers to demonstrate a sustained physical presence to claim residency .
The threshold was set at 183 days a year .
Seem reasonable ?
Not to Rangel .
In 2006 , USVI officials praised Rangel for his “ vigorous ” support of efforts to drop the residency requirement to 122 days a year over three years .
The move to make it harder for mainlanders to avoid taxes in the USVI , Rangel said at the time , was “ not fair . ”
So in March 2006 , Rangel hijacked the “ technical corrections ” process to try to push through the 122 - day requirement .
“ Technical corrections ” bills fix errors in the language of legislation that prevent it from fulfilling Congress ’ intent .
Usually the corrections are handled in a nonpolitical way , but according to Ways and Means staff Rangel ’s team killed one such bill and stalled another , holding out for watered - down USVI “ residency . ”
Then , in November 2007 , The Washington Post reported that Rangel sponsored a bill to block IRS audits of hundreds of Americans who ’d claimed the USVI as their place of residence , perhaps illegally .
Rangel ’s bill limited to three years the amount of time the IRS could go back to examine suspected USVI tax frauds , a move the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated would deprive the US Treasury of $ 38 million over 10 years .
A spokesman for Rangel on the committee , Matthew Beck , said yesterday the move was an effort to bring the USVI statute of limitations for audits into line with those on the mainland — and he denied that Rangel “ held up ” any bills .
“ Chairman Rangel has not supported tax havens in the Caribbean or anywhere else , ” Beck added .
Presumably Rangel ’s support also had nothing to do with the $ 112,500 Virgin Islands donors put into his coffers during the last three election cycles .
The administration also merits some scrutiny — particularly the co-chairman of the President ’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology , Harold Varmus , Obama ’s point - man on the stem - cell decision .
He is president of Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York — which , according to its 2007 IRS 990 form , maintains an “ office ” in Bermuda .
Sloan - Kettering ’s chief financial officer says the “ office ” is just “ a drawer in a file cabinet ” that legally allows the hospital to avoid paying higher taxes on malpractice insurance .
CFO Michael Gutnick says buying the insurance in New York would be prohibitively expensive , because the state ’s high taxes get factored into premiums .
Not so in Bermuda , where the hospital has had dealings for about six years .
( Before Bermuda , it was the Cayman Islands . )
Now the hospital is in the process of moving the insurance to Burlington , Vt. , saying it has n’t been able to find the “ talent ” in Bermuda to manage the insurance adequately .
For six years , though , it was willing to reap the financial benefits of Bermuda ’s lower tax rates .
What was that in Obama ’s speech about “ ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas ” ?
Sloan - Kettering is a 501 ( c ) 3 nonprofit , and Gutnick says the maintenance of overseas captive insurance policies by tax - exempt hospitals is “ commonplace . ”
Will Obama end that mega -tax break for organizations that ship insurance jobs overseas , starting with the hospital run by his own science adviser ?
Do n’t hold your breath .

I make this post in order to set a context of the Honduras situation during the last days of June 2009 , this is part of my point of view trying to extract my personal feelings about the situation .
I welcome any comments and suggestions of any kind .
Facts
* The President of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya Rosales , called for a public opinion survey to be held the 28th of June with the goal of adding a 4th Ballot Box of Referendum , the 1st is for president , the 2nd is for the city major and the 3rd is for the congressmen .
* The 4th Ballot Box had as a goal to call an Assembly in order to create a new constitution of Honduras .
* The President argued that he had around 400000 signed petitions from the people in order for the new constitution .
* The public opinion survey was managed , supervised and counted by the government by a division under the president .
* The public opinion survey was declared illegal by the Supreme Court , the Constitutional Court , the Attorney General , the Supreme Tribune of Elections ( entity in charge of all election related matters in Honduras and independent from the President ) .
* The President decided to ignore the Supreme Court and pursue with the public opinion survey and ordered his staff , including the army , to support with the logistics of the survey .
* On June 24th the army refused to support the logistics of the survey because of an order from the Court stating that they would violate the law .
* The President on a public appearance decided to cease the General of the Army , Romeo Vásquez Velásquez , arguing that he did not obey his order .
* The Congress , presided by Roberto Micheletti , decided to dissaprove the President for firing the General of the Army and the Supreme Court decided that he was fired under illegal circumstances because he was , as they concluded , following the law .
* On June 27th a comission from OAS arrived to Honduras in order to supervise the public opinion survey .
* On June 28th the President was captured by the army and sent by helicopter to Costa Rica , the order to capture him was , as stated by the current government , ordered by the Supreme Court .
* A new Excecutive power was installed , becoming Roberto Micheletti as President .
* The President is elected by the people during the General Elections .
* The Congress is elected by the people during the General Elections .
* The Supreme Court is nominated by the people then filtered and assigned by the Congress .
Additional Facts
The President held popular projects such as :
* Providing public schools of a computer lab and soon to be with Internet ( @prende )
* Moving around the country in open meetings named “ Asambleas del Poder Ciudadano ”
* Providing food at schools with “ Merienda Escolar ” a continuation of the project of Ricardo Maduro .
The President also held more controversial projects such as :
* Raising the minimum wage from around $ 150 / Month to $ 289 / Month the project was opposed by many companies arguing that unemployment would raise .
It was , however embraced by big companies .
* Joining the ALBA , a country coalision with Venezuela , Cuba , Bolivia , Ecuador and Nicaragua by the time .
The project was opposed by the politicians arguing that ALBA was a economic / military alliance , but then was approved by the Congress .
* Order a direct purchase of oil .
The project was opposed by oil companies and by part of the private sector arguing that the government was unefficient and it would cause inventory problems .
* Create a Mobile company managed by the state .
* After the TACA accident of 2008 he planned to move the Capital , Tegucigalpa , Airport to 80 KM on the North at the Comayagua Valley .
The project was opposed by the City Major , Ricardo Alvarez who is a member of the National Party , the opposition .
The President had strong opposition during his government by :
* Journals El Heraldo and La Prensa , owned by the same person .
The journals are very popular in Honduras .
* Some people from the middle and upper class that refer him as donkey , idiot and stronger adjectives .
The President had strong favor by :
* The government journal “ El Poder Ciudadano ”
* The government channel “ Canal 8 ”
* The private channel “ Canal 36 ” , Cholusat Sur .
The questions that everybody asks
Why was the president removed from power if he just wanted to do a Referendum ?
The Honduran Constitution treats as Traitor those who want to change it , specially on 4 matters named the “ Petrios ” ( read Pe- tree - os ) Articles :
* Presidential term , currently set to 4 years
* Presidential re-election , currently impossible .
* Territory
* Form of government , currently 3 independent and complementary institutions : one that creates and approves the laws ( Congress ) , one that proposes and executes the law ( Executive , lead by the President ) , one that Judges the compliance with the law ( Supreme Court ) .
Being the survey a path to a Referendum to create a new Constitution , it was viewed as a violation of the Constitution .
He did not follow the recently approved legal procedure for a Referendum , which must be done by the Congress or by 6 % of the active population , the 400000 requests are more than the 240000 requests needed .
Anyhow there is no legal way to create a new Constitution but he could have reformed around 90 % of the Constitution , the only points are the 4 above .
The President argues that he was removed because he was helping the poor and that the private / political sectors were not happy with that .
Additionally that those same sectors are afraid because of his ties with ALBA countries .
If he commited a crime , why was he not put into a trial ( such as an impeachment ) instead of sending him out of the country ?
The Honduran Constitution and Laws do not have an established procedure for an impeachment .
Anyhow there was no trial and veredict , there comes , to my opinion , a fault commited by the institutions , if somebody commits a crime he / she should be jugded and clear veredict should be provided .
I believe they sent him out of the country for tactical reasons in order to make harder his return to power , it backfired as he used the international media and international institutions to pressure the new government .
What was that story about a resignation and why was it signed on June 25th ?
One of the methods for switching President is if he presents his resignation , in that case the Vice - President , Elvin Santos , takes his place and if not the President of Congress , Roberto Micheletti .
Given that the Vice - President had resigned in order to become the presidential candidate for the Liberal Party so the President of Congress took the place .
The date is the easiest part to “ justify ” given that it could have been a negotiation of the President with the Congress after the Army refused to support him .
The problem is how do we know if it is real ?
We can not , plus nobody believes it as true .
Why with the military force and not with the police ?
My guess is that the Congress was not sure that the police , which is under the Executive power , lead by the President , would follow that order .
Why are the national and international media being controlled such as CNN , Canal 8 and Canal 36 ?
I believe that the media is controlled in order to control propaganda that generates chaos .
Anyhow it is unacceptable , if the current government wants to be called democratic , then freedom of speech through media is required .
If the President and the survey is so popular , why are there not massive riots ?
The country right now is divided at least in three parts of unknown size :
* Those who want the President back , I will call the pro-Zelaya .
This group is lead by the Unions , small farmers , UD party – which is a socialist / communist party - , student unions and are the ones rioting .
* Those who do not want the President back , I will call them against - zelaya .
This group is lead by the political parties , part of the private sector , some of the media and with support of part of the upper and upper - middle class .
* Those who did not want the President to violate the law but are not in favor of the methods to remove him and control the population , I will call them the non-aligned .
This group is , to my point of view , is the largest , silent and appears to be just waiting for everything to solve by itself .
Why is the military force on the streets controlling people , and why is there a prohibition to go out after 9 pm ?
I believe this was done for security of the people .
The problem is that in every riot there are people that want to generate chaos and this generates agression and conflicts between military and the rioting people .
If the President had 400000 requests , was it not enough for asking the Congress to add the 4th urn ?
No answer , it seems that nobody thought about it or spoke about it publicly .
If the survey was so unpopular , why not leting the vote on June 28th and leting the NO win ?
The campaign was that the survey was illegal so it should not be held .
Many persons were going to boicot the survey by not attending .
Additionaly , many persons were indifferent to the survey , as it normally happens in such cases .
The opposition campaign also argued that the survey was all controlled by the government without intervention of the Supreme Tribune of Elections so nobody , but the government who called it would control / guarantee it .
The President argued that it had OAS supervisors .
So where are we right now ?
To my point of view , we now have several options , those that come to my mind are :
Manuel Zelaya returns as President of Honduras
* This is probably the only acceptable option for the pro-Zelaya sector .
* The against - Zelaya sector would be afraid of prosecution because of the situation and this might lead to chaos given that the Congress , Supreme Court , Army , Attorney General , etc … are involved so the President could find justifiable to solve the powers and call for a Constitutional Assembly to reform the Constitution .
* The non-aligned probably would not care , as it would return to the status quo before the incident .
* This option would require a strong dialog between the President and the against - Zeyala .
Roberto Micheletti stays as President of Honduras
* This in unacceptable for the pro-Zelaya sector .
* Riots will continue , at least until the next government takes the Presidency .
* If censorship and strong military activity continues the non-aligned would become more and more against the current government .
Manuel Zelaya returns and goes to a trial
* The against - Zelaya probably would want it .
* It would be unacceptable for the pro-Zelaya .
* It is hard to tell what would happen with the non-aligned , they would embrace it but not with strength .
The General Elections are called as soon as possible
* The against - Zelaya probably would accept it .
* The non-aligned would probably accept it too .
* The pro-Zelaya , at least a part will not .
What to do ?
I seriously do not know , I must say that negotiations should be held before any of the mayor decisions are taken and for this Honduras will need help for a non-controversial international leader to mediate .
As it is now there is no civil war , so it is still time to solve the problem .
I really hope that you help us !
From Tog on Software Design The Challenger : An Information Disaster Belorussian translation : http://webhostinggeeks.com/science/challenger-Exerpt-be
Why did the space shuttle Challenger explode ?
Many people assume it was because of poorly - functioning O rings on the booster rocket .
However , those O rings did n’t send that ship up on a cold winter ’s morn .
People did , and those people drew their most critical information from two simple charts , screened by an overhead projector .
The graphs displayed tiny pictures of each shuttle booster , lined up in chronological order , showing launch temperatures and any O ring damage .
They looked like so many crayons in a box , and when the engineers and managers finished looking at them , they did n’t know any more than they had before .
The launch was made and seven people died .
Lets look at the information the Challenger engineers looked at but could not see reorganized by one of the world ’s foremost experts on envisioning information , Edward Tufte :
This is the same information , presented in a form that even a child could understand .
Poorly constructed overhead slides do n’t normally kill people , but they do often leave people in the dark .
Tufte , author of the seminal works , The Visual Design of Quantitative Information , and Envisioning Information , demonstrates time and time again how careful design of information can communicate in a single glance information that might takes hours or weeks of effort to ferret out in its raw form .
Just as important as new , clean software design in the coming decade will be designs that result in equally clear information .
Update : Placing blame where blame is due
It was not the Morton Thiokol engineers who made the decision to go ahead with the ill - fated launch .
It was NASA .
The engineers , meeting in Utah , communicated two messages from their meeting to their local managers .
First , they produced the a formal , abstract result : " With the data available to them , and with NASA knowing as well as they that the design was flawed and that temperature might be a causal factor , the engineers argued that the Challenger ought not to fly so far out of the field database , the firmest evidence available . "
-- Robison , et. al. *
That 's not all .
They also communicated verbally and vocally to their managers that it was extremely unsafe to launch under the expected condition .
Two of the engineers became really hot about it , with one of them pounding the table with his fists .
That more important message never got transmitted to Florida .
NASA , hot to trot , was able to rationalize that the formal message from the engineers in Utah was that they really did n't know .
Robison , et. al. , also argue that the engineers did not have the full data available to them that Tufte had .
Their paper , while shifting the full extent of the blame away from the engineers in the room that morning , does little to change the shuttle disaster away from incompetence as its cause .
Instead , one would want to know why those engineers did not have all the necessary information available to them , specifically air and o-ring temperatures coorelated with o-ring damage .
It was well - known that this o-ring material lost its effectiveness with cold .
Then , there 's the matter of the slides .
The cute rocket - ship slides , with their ordering by chronology rather than level - of - damage , remain a particularly egregious example of information presentation .
If the author of those slides had attempted to correlate temperature and o-ring damage , as did Tufte , he or she would have realized that information was missing -- and maybe even gone and found it -- long before the fateful meeting .
Would that have been the only slide so produced ?
Probably not .
There would be other factors one might want to correlate , but , given the information known about cold and o-ring material , temperature certainly should have been one of them .
If the Utah engineers had passed along Tufte 's slide , it would have saved the astronauts .
That slide , as it was transferred from manager to manager , would have eliminated all doubt in each of their minds , precluding the eventual rationalization , and those seven people would be alive today .
Their recommendation , as well , would have shifted , had they seen that slide , from " out of the field database " to " you will kill everyone aboard . "
Note :
These charts were graciously given to me by Edward Tufte and appear in his book , Visual Explanations : Images and Quantities , Evidence and Narrative .

A patent for virtual subdomains is being revoked by the US Patent and Trademark office thanks to prior work provided by the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
The Office announced its decision today , noting that it rejected all of patent owner Hoshiko 's claims since the patent went under examination in 2007 .
The patent in question was originally submitted to the USPTO in 1999 by an IP holding company named Ideaflood and somehow managed to get approved in 2004 .
( The patent eventually got transferred to a new company named Hoshiko . )
Basically , the patent describes virtual subdomains with the idea that it would be impractical for companies with a large number of domains to create new DNS records for each subdomain ( like jacquirules.arstechnica.com , for example ) .
The solution would be to use virtual subdomains that put a wildcard in the DNS record — there would only be a single entry , *.domain.com , and it would resolve to a single IP address .
The webserver at that IP address would then read the host request and parse it so that it pointed to the specific public HTTP folder residing somewhere on the server .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation took aim at the patent via its Patent Busting Project in 2007 , referring to it as a " bogus software patent " that stifled innovation .
Together with attorney Rick McLeod , the EFF asked the USPTO to reexamine the patent on the grounds that there was plenty of prior art , including Apache 's mod_rewrite module written in 1998 by Ralf Engelschall .
Engelschall 's work and other people 's comments on it were preserved in developer newsgroups and were used to show that this was a commonly understood technology by those " skilled in the art . "
The USPTO finally got around to rejecting 20 claims contained within the subdomain patent earlier this year , leaving the folks at Hoshiko to decide whether to amend the claims to make them more narrow .
They did , and the claims got rejected once again .
" Patent Owner 's arguments filed in response of 03/16/2009 have been fully considered but they are not persuasive , " the USPTO wrote in its decision .
" This action is made final . "
Hoshiko can still appeal the decision , but the EFF is happy nonetheless .
" This patent was particularly troubling because the company tried to remove the work of open source developers from the public domain and use it to threaten others , " EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn said in a statement .
" Ironically , the transparent open source development process gave us the tools to bust the patent ! "

The 71 - year - old Madoff pleaded guilty in March to charges that his exclusive investment advisory business was actually a massive Ponzi scheme .
Federal prosecutors say Madoff orchestrated perhaps the largest financial swindle in history .
In their submission , prosecutors cited fraud cases against Adelphia founder John Rigas and his son Timothy ; former WorldCom Inc. Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers ; Refco Inc. 's former Chief Executive Phillip R. Bennett ; and ex-hedge fund executive Samuel Israel III .
They said any comparison to those cases " simply underscores the harm " caused by Madoff 's conduct , as well as the scope , complexity and duration of the fraud .
John Rigas [ a major GOP donor ] , convicted of fraud and other charges in 2004 , is serving a 12 - year sentence after initially being sentenced to 15 years in prison , while his son is serving 17 years in prison .
Ebbers [ also a GOP donor ] , convicted of fraud and other charges in 2005 , is serving a 25 - year sentence ; Israel , who pleaded guilty to fraud and other charges in 2005 , is serving a 20 - year sentence ; and Bennett , who pleaded guilty to a 20 - count indictment in 2008 , is serving a 16 - year sentence .
You may have guessed that there is no sympathy for crooked banksters here at .
When it comes to corporate crooks -- and political crooks -- this is a strictly law and order blog .
If a man steals to feed his starving children , that 's one thing .
If a man steals because he 's competitive with someone who has 10 million dollars when he only has 2 million ... throw away the key .
And I for one am delighted that the authorities plan to throw away the key when it comes to Bernie Madoff .
Throwing away the key and severe confiscatory policy is exactly what these people deserve .
Pennilessness is what they have earned and the idea of Madoff forfeiting $ 171 billion is perfect -- unless he has $ 171.1 billion .
It pisses me off that some softy in the justice system decided that Madoff 's moll is somehow entitled to $ 2.5 million in assets when in reality she should be thrown in prison as an active accomplice .
Larger than the Bush family 's ?
Not by a long shot .
Larger than the massive rip -offs of the public by Enron economics ?
Of course not

If the industry supports national health care , “ for the good of the consumers ” , first follow the money , because politicians are great at colluding with big business in order to steal from the rest of us .
There was a fluff piece in InsuranceNewsNet this week , written by an insurance company executive ( but no by - line ) that attempts to alleviate people ’s fear of government health care , and casting arguments like those I ’ve put forth in the past as “ scare tactics ” .
[ People ] still fall prey to the scare tactic that nothing — but nothing — could be worse than a government takeover of the system .
How things could be worse than they are now , I can not imagine .
The industry is in love with the idea of nationalized health care , and Cohen is a shill .
Take a look at the real - world examples of national healthcare , and point to one which is not an epic fail .
Look at the data for the cancer survival rates in Britain and Canada as compared to the cancer survival rates in the U.S .
Or the months of waiting for routine medical procedures !
Sure , some of these procedures might be “ more expensive ” on paper in the U.S. than they are elsewhere , but if you ’ve only got 6 months to live , and the ( free ) life - saving procedure has an 18 - month waiting list , it might as well cost a trillion dollars , because in either case , you ’re not going to get it .
Most — if not all — of the problems with the current “ system ” ( and I use the term loosely ) in the U.S. stem directly from government interference .
The health - care family of industries , including primary care provision , pharmaceuticals , insurance , etc. , is more heavily regulated than any other industry in the world , with the possible exception of Finance , which has ironically been imploding for the better part of 18 months .
The writer describes a recent ( and from the sounds of it , awful ) experience with a local emergency room , and concludes that “ The emergency room is the great leveler of American life .
Everyone gets miserable treatment . ”
Recall the last time you went to the emergency room and ask yourself if the government could possibly do a worse job .
If the answer is yes , then you might need medical attention more than you realize .
Recall the last time you went to the DMV to renew your license plate or get a new photo ID or the last time you went in to the Post Office to mail a package .
There are a dozen windows , each ostensibly belonging to one clerk but mysteriously , there are only three clerks working .
There are four people in front of you and it takes 40 minutes to complete your 30 - second transaction .
The only other place this happens to you is at a bank — except there you have the option to use an ATM .
Now ask yourself if any business could do a worse job at providing these very basic services , than the government does ?
I ’m sure I could find dozens stories similar to Cohen ’s ( I ’ve linked to several in the past ) from the UK , from Canada , or this pathetic story from Japan about a bicyclist - hit - by - car who was rejected from 14 hospitals before he died , or from anywhere else national health care has been attempted .
Cohen just shrugs and says , “ it ca n’t get any worse . ”
I beg to differ .
This is the same government that spends billions of dollars a year on roads that are constantly under construction or repair .
The same government that , in an effort to forestall a financial shitstorm , took all of your money and gave it ( no - strings - attached ) to Goldman Sachs and Citigroup .
The same government that used to spend $ 436 on uni-directional impact generators hammers .
The same government that , as primary provider and funder of education in this country , has presided over skyrocketing college and university tuition , increasing per-pupil costs at public schools , and steadily declining standardized test scores .
America is spending more on education than she ever has at any time in the past , and kids are coming out of that factory dumber , and dumber each day .
And Cohen thinks that we’d be better off by putting these criminals in charge of our health ?
He is either a liar , a buffoon , or a thief .
( Guess where my money is ? )
asked Blunt spokesman Rich Chrismer for clarification of Blunt ’s comments on a video by blogger Mike Stark that made the rounds yesterday , in which Blunt asked “ why the president ca n’t produce a birth certificate , ” calling this a “ legitimate question . ”
Chrismer ’s response :
He ’s accusing the blogger of selectively editing the interview and taking Blunt ’s quotes out of context .
“ We encourage this blog to release the video of the entire interview instead of the edited version , ” Chrismer told me .
Do Republicans need to reconsider social networking ?
The GOP launched off the year with Twitter as the killer app that was going lead the party back to a Web 2.0 new majority .
Mostly though , it ’s generated a series of train - wrecks , embarrassments and operatives having to apologize for using their Twitter accounts for racist jokes .
So today we ’ve put together our list of the Top 7 GOP New Media FAILS so far this year .
This is hardly a new issue , but at a time when all the talk is about engaging users in advertising , why are Facebook - and countless other websites to be fair - still serving up such lame advertising ?
Case in point , today Facebook is showing me the ad you see to your right , which , aside from the irony you can cut with a knife , is basically the same sales pitch that the Internet was offering a decade ago .
On a large scale , I can see how this advertising works .
Attractive people in ads , even if untargeted , generate clicks , and a small subset of those clicks generate sign - ups , purchases , email addresses , or whatever else the marketer on the other end is looking for .
But with so many opportunities – especially for sites like Facebook that have such an abundance of data about their users – to do more interesting things with ads , why are they still settling for this ?
In reality , it still probably makes sense for Facebook to be serving these ads .
While they ’re experimenting with new forms of advertising , like for Fan Pages , something needs to fill the billions of page views worth of inventory the social network is serving up , and for now , apparently deceptive dating ads remain the status quo .
And until the new forms of advertising catch up with the old from a revenue perspective , we ’ll likely be stuck with it .
However , both Facebook and Digg are giving us tools to move this process along .
With Digg ’s upcoming introduction of the ability to “ Bury ” ads , and Facebook ’s existing thumbs up / down buttons , perhaps if enough of us start voicing our opinions with our mouse clicks , we can arrive sooner at the more engaging world of advertising where both users and advertisers ultimately want to be .
The Obama administration 's tough new fuel - efficiency standards could pose problems for some car makers , but Toyota Motor Corp. is hoping to benefit .
The Japanese company is betting the rules will give an advantage to its expanding lineup of hybrid vehicles , and it also aims to boost revenue by licensing to other car makers the patents that protect its fuel - saving technologies .

I just got off the phone with Lucas van Praag , the top flack at Goldman Sachs , who called Matt Taibbi ’s piece on the bank “ hysterical ” .
He also sent me an email , which makes some specific responses to Taibbi ’s points :
Having read your piece about Matt Taibbi ’s article in Rolling Stone , I wanted to set the record straight , particularly about “ regulatory capture ” .
Background : Under the Commodity Exchange Act , the CFTC ( for agricultural futures ) or exchanges ( for energy / metals futures ) established speculative position limits .
As much as anything else , the limits are intended to prevent market imbalances that would result in failures of the ultimate settlement of the futures contracts .
The CFTC rules exempt “ bona fide hedging ” transactions from these spec limits .
A bona fide hedging transaction was originally understood to be an actual producer / consumer who was selling or buying the underlying commodity and wanted to hedge risk of the price moving up or down .
In 1991 , J . Aron wanted to enter into one of its first commodity index swap transactions with a pension fund .
In order to hedge our exposure on the swap , we wanted to buy futures on the commodities in the index .
We applied to the CFTC for exemption from position limits on the theory that even if we were n’t buying the commodity , we had offsetting exposure ( in our swap ) that put us in a balanced / price neutral position .
The CFTC agreed with our argument and granted exemption .
By the way , each of the then Commissioners signed off , so it was hardly a secret …
The CFTC published a report in August 2008 , indicating that there were few instances when entities would have exceeded spec limits , had they applied to OTC positions .
Yesterday , as you probably know , the Senate Permanent Sub -Committee on Investigations issued a report on wheat futures in which they concluded that divergence between prices for actual wheat v. wheat futures is being caused solely by index investment .
The Committee ’s recommendation is that hedge exemptions which support indices should be phased out .
Not quite so recently , the elimination of Glass Steagall does n’t exactly provide a robust argument for regulatory capture .
And Taibbi ’s bubble case does n’t stand up to serious scrutiny either .
To give just two examples , even with the worst will in the world , the blame for creating the internet bubble cannot credibly be laid at our door , and we could hardly be described as having been a major player in the mortgage market , unlike so many of our current and former competitors .
Taibbi’s article is a compilation of just about every conspiracy theory ever dreamed up about Goldman Sachs , but what real substance is there to support the theories ?
We reject the assertion that we are inflators of bubbles and profiteers in busts , and we are painfully conscious of the importance of being a force for good .
Van Praag is right that if the Senate is recommending that Goldman ’s exemptions in the futures market be phased out , then the Senate , at least , has not been captured by Goldman .
And he ’s also right that Goldman can’t really be blamed for creating either the tech - stock bubble or the housing bubble — it was a relatively minor player in both .
But you do n’t read a Taibbi rant for an evenhanded look at both sides of a complex story .
It ’s more a forcefully - put case for the prosecution : some of his charges might not stick , but he ’ll throw a few chancers in as well for good measure .
( Interestingly , though , even Taibbi did n’t try to include Ben Stein ’s ridiculous conspiracy theory about Goldman ’s chief economist trying to drive down the prices of mortgage bonds in order that Goldman could profit from its short positions . )
I disagree with van Praag that the CFTC exemption given to J Aron “ was hardly a secret ” — as far as I know , there was no contemporaneous reporting of it at all , either in the press or in Goldman ’s own filings .
And although there ’s a strong case to be made that Goldman has failed to capture the legislative branch ( see for instance Chris Dodd jumping on the Ben Stein bandwagon ) , I think there ’s a pretty compelling case that both the executive branch ( home to countless Goldman alumni ) and the regulators , like the CFTC , have a pretty strong track record of doing whatever was in the best interests of Goldman Sachs .
Van Praag told me that in the wake of the events of the past year or two , Goldman ’s partners have pretty much lost their appetite for going into public service .
Maybe that ’s for the best .
They are generally smart and talented and knowledgeable people , and I daresay that many of them have done a lot of good after leaving the firm and joining government .
At the same time , however , we ’re supposed to have a government of the people , not a government of multimillionaire Goldman Sachs technocrats .
And when you have the latter , you ’re inevitably going to end up with a lot of mistrust and conspiracy theories sooner or later , whether they ’re well - founded or not .
Why hello , there .
Bewildered by the new design ?
Then read the news on the home page , adventurer !
OVER 730,000 counts of suspected financial wrongoing were recorded in America last year , according to recent data from the Treasury Department 's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network .
Institutions such as banks , insurers and casinos are required by law to report suspicious activities to federal authorities under 20 categories .
Financial institutions filed nearly 13 % more reports of fraud compared with 2007 , accounting for almost half of the increase in total filings .
The number of mortgage frauds alone rose by 23 % to almost 65,000 .
But not all categories saw an increase : incidents suspected terrorist financing fell .
Just under half of all filings are related to money laundering , a proportion that is little changed in over a decade .

* Illustration : Oliver Jeffers * " I think you are going to see a repeat of Microsoft . "
Christine Varney 's blunt assessment sent a buzz through the audience at the National Press Club in Washington , DC .
Varney , a partner at Hogan & Hartson and one of the country 's foremost experts in online law , was speaking at the ninth annual conference of the American Antitrust Institute , a gathering of top monopoly attorneys and economists .
Most of the day was filled with dry presentations like " Verticality Regains Relevance " and " The Future of Private Enforcement . "
But Varney , tall and professorial , did not hide her message behind legalese or euphemism .
The technology industry , she said , was coming under the sway of a dominant behemoth , one that had the potential to stifle innovation and squash its competitors .
The last time the government saw a threat like this —
Microsoft in the 1990s — it launched an aggressive antitrust case .
But by the time of this conference , mid-June 2008 , a new offender had emerged .
" For me , Microsoft is so last century , " Varney said .
" They are not the problem .
I think we are going to continually see a problem , potentially , with Google . "
Coming from Varney , it was a particularly damning comparison .
As an attorney who represented Netscape in the late 1990s , she was instrumental in painting Bill Gates and company as overeager bullies .
Now , Varney was suggesting that Google was repeating Microsoft 's expansionist behavior .
Instead of dominating the desktop , Varney said , Google was starting to colonize the emerging cloud - computing industry , amassing " enormous market power " and potentially creating an ecosystem that customers would be powerless to escape .
She acknowledged that her remarks might ruffle some feathers at Google headquarters in Mountain View , California .
" If any of my colleagues or friends from Google are here , " she said , " I invite you to jump up and scream and yell at me . "
Nobody took her up on that offer .
But it is safe to assume that plenty of Googlers were jumping and screaming six months later when President Obama appointed Varney head of the Justice Department 's antitrust division , making her the government 's most powerful antimonopoly prosecutor .
On May 11 , during her first public speech on the job , Varney made it clear that her stance had not changed much since her presentation at the conference :
She planned to take a forceful approach to applying the nation 's antitrust laws .
" In the past , the antitrust division was a leader in its enforcement efforts in technology industries , and I believe we will take this mantle again , " she said .
She did not mention Google by name , but there was little doubt to whom she was referring .
Ever since its founding 11 years ago , Google has seen itself as one of the Good Guys .
Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin conceived their company as a kind of public trust .
" We believe a well - functioning society should have abundant , free , and unbiased access to high - quality information , " they wrote in the run-up to Google 's IPO five years ago , a goal that requires " a company that is trustworthy and interested in the public good . "
They created a touchy - feely work environment with perks like onsite laundry facilities and free food .
Prospective hires were grilled on not just their technical expertise but also their ethics — whether they were " Googley . "
Google 's self - image was pithily summed up in its famous founding credo : " Do n't be evil . "
For most of its history , investors , users , and tech gurus shared Google 's view of itself .
After all , the company 's rise to prominence — on the back of search algorithms so powerful and elegant they changed the Internet forever — is a case study in heroic entrepreneurialism .
Its long - tail business model gives even the smallest Web sites a chance to make money .
It routinely creates and distributes great products for free , even when there is no obvious benefit to the company .
Its spirit of openness and collaboration laid the groundwork for the mash - upable , user - generated modern Web .
But recently , Google 's size and ambitions have begun to obscure its halo .
Advertisers have watched nervously as the company 's share of the search - advertising market has jumped to 75 percent from 50 percent over the past three years .
In 2007 , Google attracted a yearlong antitrust review from US and European regulators after it announced plans to acquire online ad firm DoubleClick .
In 2008 , the DOJ swatted down a search - ad deal Google had made with Yahoo , arguing that it " would have furthered [ Google 's ] monopoly . "
The company is currently under investigation by the DOJ for its ambitious book - scanning project , which aims to make every book ever published searchable on Google .
And the Federal Trade Commission is looking into whether the Apple board seats held by Google CEO Eric Schmidt and board member Arthur Levinson violate federal antitrust law .
For much of its history , Google has responded to most criticism with two words :
Trust us .
The company has repeatedly persuaded skeptics that its immensity is a mere byproduct of its altruistic mission and that the algorithms it uses to organize the Internet , while proprietary , are objective and benevolent .
But in an economy destroyed by bad faith , secretive formulas , and complicated mathematics , trust is in short supply , and Google 's assurances are losing their persuasive power .
More than 15 years ago , federal regulators began making Microsoft the symbol of anticompetitive behavior in the tech industry .
Now , a newly activist DOJ may try to do the same thing to Google .
The New Microsoft ?
In 2004 , as a nation waited for Google 's initial public stock offering , we ran a series of stories about the company .
We pondered whether the IPO would cause Google to lose its soul ( nope ! ) , pointed out that the search company was reinventing itself as an advertising juggernaut ( correct ! ) , and suggested that the IPO could " burn a hole in the zeitgeist " (??? ) .
We closed with a look at the Google - Microsoft death match .
" For all their differences , the two companies have a lot in common , " Kevin Kelleher wrote .
" Microsoft looks at Google and sees its own past , full of promise .
Google looks at Microsoft and sees the future — a swaggering company that dominates the tech landscape " ( bingo ! ) .
It is an ironic position for the search giant to find itself in .
Schmidt not only campaigned enthusiastically for the very Obama administration that appointed Varney , but also was one of the most devoted opponents of Microsoft in the mid-'90s , eagerly helping the government build its case against the software firm .
Today , he is facing some of the very arguments he once lobbed at Redmond .
His old enemy has even gotten in on the act , conducting a high - powered lobbying campaign ostensibly promoting online competition — and , not incidentally , taking down Google along the way ( see " The Plot to Kill Google , " issue 17.02 ) .
Schmidt seems unruffled by the attention .
" We sort of expect it , and it 's been coming for a long time , " he recently told Wired .
" It 's natural , given the role we play . "
Google has begun reaching out to regulators , advertisers , and trade groups to allay their concerns .
But some close to the company say that Google 's leadership still has not grasped how much its image has changed .
" Google has always been about taking risks , but I think they have been taking too many risks with their reputation in the past three years , " one former executive says .
" If they do n't fix it at some point , that is going to get them in trouble . "
As Varney 's appointment suggests , that trouble may have already arrived .
In her speech at the American Antitrust Institute , she described how the case against Microsoft began long before any judicial hearings took place .
" Part of what you have to do when you 're going to try to bring a [ Sherman Antitrust ] Section
Two case is you have to create the political climate , " she said .
" The problem we had with Microsoft is we went in too late . "
In other words , even if an antitrust case is years away , the all - important political ground is being prepared right now .
How Google responds will determine whether it can fend off years of intensive investigation and — maybe even more important to Brin , Page , and Schmidt — maintain its heroic reputation .
Eric Schmidt 's hatred of Microsoft took root in the mid-'90s , when he was CTO of Sun Microsystems .
Sun had produced Java , a programming language that allowed applications to run on any computer , regardless of operating system .
The notion of powerful , cross- platform applications apparently threatened Microsoft ; the company licensed Sun 's technology and created a pared - down version for its Internet Explorer browser , essentially forcing developers to build weaker Java applications .
Sun claimed Microsoft had crippled Java and settled for $ 20 million in a resulting lawsuit .
Schmidt butted heads with Microsoft again in 1997 when he became CEO of Novell , which sold software that enabled corporate PCs to connect to one another in a network .
In the early '90s , Microsoft had incorporated networking into its corporate version of Windows and began demolishing Novell 's market share .
Schmidt was brought on to stop the bleeding , but it was too late ; by the time he left in 2001 , the company 's revenues had fallen 50 percent off their peak .
Those experiences made Schmidt the perfect fit when he joined Google as CEO in 2001 .
Page and Brin had conceived the company as a kind of Bizarro Microsoft , opposite in almost every way : Microsoft forced users to store data in proprietary formats ; Google would let them take data anywhere .
Microsoft pushed partners and competitors around ; Google would bend over backward to play fair .
Microsoft was obsessed with its bottom line ; Google would focus on creating products before figuring out how to monetize them .
Microsoft became drunk on its own power ; Google would maintain a rigorous sobriety .
( Schmidt once told me that he is wary of having magazines profile him because he has seen how those who cooperate " start to believe their own clips . "
In 2008 , The New Yorker quoted him as saying , " What kills a company is not competition but arrogance . " )
By all appearances , Google does n't need to fear Microsoft any more ; today , Microsoft is the one struggling to maintain relevance in a world that Google created and dominates .
Since 2003 , Microsoft has invested hundreds of millions on efforts to compete with Google 's search engine and search - ad platform , none of which have slowed Google 's ascendancy .
The Firefox browser , thanks in part to a distribution deal with Google , has rapidly chewed up Internet Explorer 's market share , which has gone from 95 percent in 2003 to 80 percent today .
And Google 's online applications like Docs and Spreadsheets have forced its rival to play catch - up ; Microsoft wo n't have a full browser - based version of Office until 2010 .
And yet , Schmidt maintains a kind of paranoia about Redmond .
He repeatedly reminds his employees that Microsoft could crush Google at any moment .
The company recently introduced its own browser , Chrome , largely as a check on Microsoft .
( " Because Microsoft is a follower , there is a concern that it could use its Windows monopoly to restrict choices with respect to search , " Schmidt says .
" There is a long history of this . " )
And in 2008 , when he learned that Microsoft was in talks to acquire Yahoo , Schmidt publicly worried that the deal " could break the Internet " — bringing Microsoft 's closed , proprietary attitude to the online world .
Schmidt tried to block the acquisition by pursuing his own Yahoo deal .
Google would serve some of the ads on Yahoo's pages in exchange for a cut of the resulting revenue .
Some Google executives warned that such a deal would needlessly bring the scrutiny of antitrust regulators , but Schmidt — along with Page and Brin — disagreed .
Microsoft 's purchase would hurt competition by reducing the number of players in the online - advertising industry and potentially give it a dominant position in online applications and services ; Google 's deal would spark competition by preserving Yahoo's independence .
How could anyone object ?
Schmidt at a campaign event for Barack Obama in October .
Photo : Joe Raedie / Getty ImagesSchmidt either did n't recognize or did n't care how it looked to some outsiders .
He and Google may have seen themselves as scrappy , idealistic upstarts battling an entrenched tyrant , but to most observers they had already unseated the incumbent and assumed the throne .
Advertisers did n't see an effort to preserve competition and open standards on the Internet ; they saw a bid to increase Google 's already dominant share of the online - ad market .
This disconnect became particularly apparent in September when Schmidt met with Thomas Barnett , the DOJ 's antitrust chief at the time , to defend the deal .
Barnett was shocked when Schmidt made Google 's character — its constitutional aversion to all things evil and its commitment to operating on a higher moral plane — a central part of his argument .
The line of thinking resonated throughout the DOJ .
Weeks later , in one of Barnett 's final meetings with Google and Yahoo lawyers , he made it clear he had little patience for Google 's " trust us " refrain .
He ended one question by warning : " Please do n't tell me the answer is , ' Because the parties would n't do anything wrong . ' "
Ultimately , Barnett 's DOJ threatened to sue Google unless it dropped the deal .
( Varney , Barnett 's successor , has said that she was " deeply troubled " by the proposal . )
Schmidt says today that if he had it to do over again , he would ; indeed , it probably kept Yahoo out of the hands of Microsoft , which dropped its own bid soon after .
But it will also have a lasting effect on Google .
Any future deals of comparable size will inevitably draw the same kind of scrutiny .
Schmidt had been so focused on renouncing Microsoft 's behavior that he had led his company to the same fate : Google was now branded as a top antitrust target .
Google is big .
Very big .
Its millions of servers process about 1 petabyte of user - generated data every hour .
It conducts hundreds of millions of searches every day .
This is no accident ; bigness is the very point of Google .
The company 's great skill — its competitive advantage — is its ability to find meaning in massive sets of data .
The larger the data sets , the more potential meaning can be derived and the better its search results become .
The better Google 's search results , the more people use its search engines and the more data the company collects .
It is a virtuous feedback loop , harnessing the power of network effects to create a more useful product .
In and of itself , Google 's size is not a legal problem .
Varney herself has pointed out that , while Google may enjoy a monopoly in the search - ad business , the company acquired it legally by building better search products that competitors were simply unable to match .
Lawyers and economists say that things get complicated , though , when Google moves beyond search and into Web services like online spreadsheets and video sites .
Because its search and advertising algorithms are secret , there is no way for competitors or partners to know whether Google tweaks results to direct traffic to its own properties over theirs .
Enter a street address into Google 's search engine , for instance , and Google Maps tops the results .
Type in " Britney Spears " and Google News comes up before People magazine or TMZ .com .
( Google - owned YouTube tops the video results , above MTV and MySpace . )
If Google is using its search position to promote its other businesses , that could leave it open to charges of illegal bundling and leveraging — the same charges that Microsoft faced for packaging its browser onto the Windows desktop .
And even if Google is behaving honorably now , it is creating a system full of temptations should the company ever come under financial pressure .
" When things get tight , " one advertising partner says , " whose bottom line will get sacrificed first ?
The answer is self - evident . "
Google 's revolutionary business model itself could also raise regulators ' ire .
One of the company 's great innovations has been its willingness to provide free services in exchange for data .
It launches a free automated 411 service and uses its callers ' requests to hone its voice - recognition software .
It gives away Gmail but gains access to users ' online address books .
Many customers may consider this inoffensive ; indeed , Google 's services - for - data trade - off has become a foundation of the Web 2.0 era .
But to antitrust watchdogs , customer convenience is often less important than preserving a competitive landscape .
Google can use the surplus cash from its search business to subsidize the development of new , free products and services .
That 's a frightening prospect for would - be competitors without such a robust revenue stream — potentially scary enough to discourage them from entering the market .
The possible result : less innovation overall .
Some antitrust experts argue that the natural business cycle will take care of this problem without government intervention , but Varney 's three top economists have all said that they favor a hands - on approach .
Google 's largest problem is n't what the company is today ; it 's what it plans to become .
Google aims to create a world in which Web services replace desktop software .
That vision seems to terrify regulators like Varney , who fear that Google could grow too powerful in such an environment .
Whatever the company 's stated intentions , Varney says , it could still become a de facto standard , locking businesses into using its services .
Google 's many champions in Silicon Valley dismiss these arguments as unnecessary governmental meddling that punishes an innovative company that has appropriately profited from its own genius and hard work .
They also argue that the market will likely take care of itself .
" The problem for antitrust in high tech is that the environment changes so rapidly , " says Eric Goldman , a law professor at Santa Clara University .
" Someone who looks strong today wo n't necessarily be strong tomorrow . "
And Schmidt says that Google could never take undue advantage of its position in the search market — not just for vague ethical reasons but as a matter of self - interest .
Such a practice , he says , would destroy the trust that Google has built with its users — and ultimately Google 's entire business .
" We operate under great competitive worry , " he says .
" If you become dissatisfied with Google , it 's very easy to move to a competitor . "
( Indeed , plenty of rivals are ready to snap up Google 's user base at the first sign of weakness .
In May , Microsoft announced Bing , its latest attempt to wrest search share away from Google .
And companies like Facebook and Twitter are creating new ways of navigating the Web that pose a real threat to Google 's dominance . )
It is a powerful argument .
So powerful , in fact , that Bill Gates made a similar case when his own company faced antitrust charges .
Microsoft was accused of using Windows — by far the dominant operating system in the personal - computer industry — to promote its browser unfairly .
But Gates said that the DOJ did not realize the peculiar intricacies of the software industry , where constant innovation created competitive chaos .
In 1999 , Gates told Wired that he did n't think it was possible to have a monopoly in the software industry .
After all , he pointed out , anybody who did n't like Internet Explorer could just install another browser .
" It 's overwhelmingly true that the case is misguided , " he said .
" Understand , anybody can give any piece of software away for free .
That 's just a fact . "
Based on everything Schmidt has ever said or done , he would likely find any comparisons of his own company to Microsoft downright insulting .
Microsoft made its software a necessary component of every PC ; Schmidt says anyone can use the Internet without going through Google — a conscious strategy .
" Because of Microsoft 's misdeeds 10 years ago , we all understand what not to do , " he says .
On paper , the two pieces of legislation that define antitrust law are pretty straightforward .
Section
Two of the Sherman Act , passed in 1890 , made it a felony to " monopolize , or attempt to monopolize " ; 1914 's Clayton
Act added price discrimination and other activities that reduced competition .
But for most of the past century , lawyers and regulators have battled over how to apply those terms in new industries where the rules are unclear .
The government 's case against IBM helped define antitrust in the PC era , arguing that its practice of offering discounts to universities could be seen as predatory pricing , and that its vertical integration — the company owned hardware , software , and support divisions — could be interpreted as monopolistic expansion .
Telecom antitrust was defined by AT&T , which was broken up after federal regulators decided that its proprietary hardware , as well as its control of the local , long - distance , and service industries , was anticompetitive .
In software , Microsoft got into trouble for bundling its Internet browser with its operating system ; the company saw it as useful integration and healthy competitive behavior , but the government saw it as an attempt to extend its desktop monopoly to the Internet .
These cases may seem obvious in retrospect , but at the time they were n't at all ; they were long , expensive , and heated ordeals to redefine the rules for modern business .
A case against Google could update antitrust law for the Internet age .
If the DOJ does launch a case against Google , it likely will not come for at least five years .
It takes time to build the political will to go after a beloved company .
And for all the time , energy , and money spent on big trust - busting lawsuits , they are frequently useless by the time the adjudication has been completed .
( When the Microsoft case finally concluded , for instance , Netscape was already irrelevant . )
But even if Google never faces antitrust charges , the threat of them may change how it does business .
To date , Google has been a fast - acting , dealmaking machine .
In 2002 , it took just weeks to negotiate a complicated advertising revenue - sharing agreement with AOL .
The company cobbled together its 2006 purchase of YouTube over a weekend .
Google has taken a similarly aggressive approach to signing up advertising partners for its AdWords and AdSense programs — doing whatever it takes financially , even if it loses money in the short term .
A company under threat of antitrust investigation — when any significant action might invite scrutiny — cannot operate this way .
Unfortunately for Google , there are n't many models for it to emulate .
After the government initiated its case against IBM , the company spent two decades scrupulously avoiding even the appearance of impropriety .
By the time the suit was dropped in the early 1980s , company lawyers were weighing in on practically every meeting and scrutinizing every innovation , guarding against anything that could be seen as anticompetitive behavior .
A decade later , innovation at Big Blue had all but ceased , and it had no choice but to shrink its mainframe business .
( It has since reinvented itself as a services company . )
Microsoft took the opposite approach .
Gates and company were defiant , to the point of stonewalling regulators and refusing to take the charges seriously .
" Once we accept even self - imposed regulation , the culture of the company will change in bad ways , " one former Microsoft executive told Wired at the time .
" It would crush our competitive spirit . "
Gates put it even more directly : " The minute we start worrying too much about antitrust , we become IBM . "
Microsoft 's hostility to the very idea of regulation resulted in several avoidable missteps — including remarkably antagonistic deposition testimony from Gates — that ultimately helped the DOJ rally support for its ongoing antitrust suit against the company .
Although Microsoft ultimately settled , the public beating appears to have taken a toll on the company , which has been unable to maintain its reputation for innovation and industry leadership .
Google is playing nice so far .
Its public policy blog soothingly acknowledges regulators ' concerns .
" As Google has grown , " it reads , " the company has naturally faced more scrutiny about our business principles and practices .
We believe that Google promotes competition and openness online , but we have n't always done a good job telling our story . "
Schmidt is a regular presence in Washington ; he served as a member of Obama 's transition team and now sits on his technology advisory council .
And publicly , Schmidt welcomes the oversight .
" We understand the role here , " he says .
" We are not judge and jury . "
But that does n't mean Google will neuter itself to please the government .
Just like Gates before him , Schmidt says he has no plans to change his company 's trajectory in the face of regulatory challenges .
Microsoft 's belligerence was a function of its will to power , a refusal to believe that the government had the authority or intelligence to take it down .
Google still thinks it can get regulators to see it as it sees itself : not as a mere company but as a force for good .

Do n't Google - Stalk Before a First Date
WASHINGTON  A case that began four years ago with the tantalizing and volatile premise that officials of a major pro-Israel lobbying organization were illegally trafficking in sensitive national security information collapsed on Friday as prosecutors asked that all charges be withdrawn .
From the beginning , the case against the lobbyists for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee was highly unusual .
The two , Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman , were charged under the World War I -era Espionage Act , accused of improperly providing to their colleagues , journalists and Israeli diplomats sensitive information they had acquired by speaking with American policy makers .
Some lawyers at the Justice Department had always had significant reservations about the case , some current and former officials said .
They believed that Mr. Rosen and Mr. Weissman had acted imprudently , but doubted that either man should be criminally prosecuted .
Nevertheless , F.B.I. agents poured substantial resources into the case , and the decision to seek a dismissal infuriated many within the law enforcement agency .
But several current and former officials said the decision to abandon the case was no surprise .
With adverse judicial rulings making the prosecution increasingly risky , lawyers in the United States Attorney ’s Office in Alexandria , Va. , and at Justice Department headquarters met on several occasions in recent weeks , agonizing over whether to go forward with the trial , which was scheduled to begin June 2 .
The men were seized on 29 May 2007
The remains of two British security guards held hostage in Iraq for two years have been identified and named .
They were highly likely to be those of Jason Swindlehurst , from Skelmersdale , Lancashire , and Jason Creswell , from Glasgow , the Foreign Office ( FCO ) said .
Two other guards and the IT consultant they were protecting , Peter Moore , are still thought to be captive .
Gordon Brown sent his condolences to the victims ' families and called for the release of the remaining hostages .
Videos of captives
The prime minister said : " There is no justification for hostage - taking and I call on those people who are holding the other Iraqi and British hostages to release them immediately . "
Consultant Mr Moore , from Lincoln , and his guards were captured by armed militants at the Ministry of Finance in Baghdad in May 2007 .
They were surrounded in broad daylight by 40 gunmen wearing police uniforms and bundled into vans .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The bodies of Mr Swindlehurst and Mr Creswell were handed over to Iraqi authorities on Friday night , two years after they were taken in Baghdad .
They remain in Baghdad 's green zone in the care of the British Embassy .
A government source confirmed that the bodies had not been mutilated or beheaded .
Forensic examiners are trying to establish the date and method of death ahead of an anticipated murder inquiry .
Contractors
The kidnappers had previously claimed Mr Swindlehurst committed suicide in May 2008 , but his family had said that " Jason 's not that sort of guy " .
In the first video released by the kidnappers , dated 18 November 2007 , he was seen saying " my name is Jason Swindlehurst " with a black banner displaying Arabic writing in the background .
Mr Creswell - originally from Glasgow - was believed to have been living with his partner and two young children in Portlethen , south of Aberdeen .
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said : " This is incredibly tough for the families because there really was so much optimism .
This was a blow out of nowhere . "
Frank Gardner , BBC security correspondent " The Foreign Office approach is a softly - softly one .
Questions will be asked whether this was the right approach .
" When the BBC's Alan Johnston was kidnapped in Gaza , we made a big song and dance about it .
We put the whole story on the news the whole time .
" There were operational reasons why that was n't advisable in this case .
" The kidnappers said they wanted a media blackout , which they kept breaking , but I think there will be a lot of soul - searching about this . "
The security firm which employed the dead hostages , Gardaworld , paid tribute to their bravery and said they were " deeply shocked " by the news .
A spokesman said : " These two professionals were outstanding individuals and experts who commanded the respect of all those who knew and worked with them . "
The FCO said it had " grave concerns " over the safety of the three men still thought to be held .
The two other security guards have been named only as Alan , from Dumbarton , and Alec , from South Wales .
A spokeswoman said it informed the families of the dead men " with deep regret " .
" Our thoughts are with them at this sad time , and we ask that the media allow them privacy to deal with this news .
We continue to do everything we can towards the safe release of the other hostages , " she said .
Mr Moore 's father Graeme , from Leicestershire , said waiting for news that he was not one of the dead men was " torture " .
The 59 - year - old delivery driver , from Leicestershire , said his thoughts were now with the family members of the other hostages .
" Obviously , I hope my son is alive but I feel desperate for the other families .
What they are going through is unimaginable , " he said .
It is possible the handover of the bodies could be seen as a trade - off for the release of militant Laith al - Khazali , on 6 June .
His freedom had been a stipulation for the hostages being freed , the BBC's Frank Gardner said .
The aim of the kidnappers , who call themselves the Islamic Shiite Resistance in Iraq , is to get their militants freed from Camp Cropper , a US military prison west of Baghdad .
Every stop was pulled out to try and find these men
Kim Howells
Former Foreign Office minister
This is Britain 's longest running hostage crisis since the days of Terry Waite and John McCarthy in Lebanon in the 1980s .
Little is known about the the men because of a media blackout during a large period of their captivity .
The blackout originally came on the instruction of the hostage - takers who said they did not want publicity .
The British government has a policy of not making substantive concessions to kidnappers to discourage further kidnapping .
However former Foreign Office Minister , Kim Howells , who was involved in trying to negotiate the hostages ' release when they were first taken , said the government did all it could .
He told the BBC : " In the best part of four years that I was in the Foreign Office , I do n't know of another operation that was better resourced , that more energy was put into .
" Every stop was pulled out to try and find these men . "
The policy of not making substantive concessions has been criticised by some and praised by others , including some North African countries who have attacked other European nations for paying huge ransoms to kidnappers .
Mr Moore had been working for American management consultancy Bearingpoint when he was kidnapped , while the other men were contractors employed to guard him .

Morning Fix : Jindal Rises Again
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is planning to re-emerge on the national stage this week .
AP Photo / Kita Wright
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal ( R ) will wade into the national debate over health care this week by penning op - eds in Politico and the Wall Street Journal and appearing on a series of cable chat shows today and tomorrow .
" Governor Jindal has seen enough , " said Curt Anderson , a consultant for Jindal .
" As a health - care policy expert , he strongly believes that the House Democrat[ ic ] plan would be a disaster for the long - term health of the American people , and the long - term health of the economy . "
That Jindal is adding his voice to the chorus of Republican critics of Democrats ' approach to President Obama 's chief policy priority -- Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele will offer his own critique today at the National Press Club -- is evidence that the youthful governor sees a role for himself in the national policy debate despite a rocky introduction to the country earlier this year .
Jindal , who is widely regarded as one of the rising stars within the Republican party , was chosen to deliver the party 's response to Obama 's February address to Congress .
His performance was , to be charitable , weak and turned him -- briefly -- into fodder for the late night talk shows due to his resemblance to one Kenneth the Page .
Allies of Jindal insist his disappearance from the national stage from February until , well , now , had everything to do with his engagement in the legislative session and nothing at all to do with his lackluster performance .
They note that Jindal spent much of his 20s and early 30s working on the issue of health care -- he was named the head of Louisiana 's Department of Health and Hospitals at age 24 (! ) -- and is a natural spokesman for the party nationally on the issue .
Regardless of the reason (s ) for Jindal 's re-emergence , it is certain to re-ignite chatter about his presidential prospects in 2012 .
We see such a run as far - fetched .
First , Jindal 's debut on the national stage was shaky ( at best ) and even his strongest allies admit he may need more seasoning .
Second , it is logistically impossible for Jindal to campaign for a second term in Louisiana while cultivating the network of supporters he would need to compete in places like Iowa and New Hampshire .
And , at 38 years old , there is little reason for Jindal to rush a presidential run ; in 2020 , he still wo n't even be fifty years old .
How Jindal is received in his planned health care push wo n't ultimately change his presidential calculus -- we strongly believe he will run but no sooner than 2016 -- but it will impact how he is perceived within the Republican Party establishment and the media for the foreseeable future .
If Jindal comes across as knowledgeable and non-partisan , the poor speech he gave back in February will be a distant memory .
If he struggles , however , that speech will serve as a frame for the coverage .
Allan Crow , a Democratic media consultant who does considerable work in Louisiana , said that while Jindal may have been knocked down , he is far from out .
" Though his national star may not be as bright right now as other Republicans such as [ Alaska Gov. ]
Sarah Palin , there is still room for a Republican star to emerge , " said Crow .
" So , while Bobby Jindal may not viewed now as the superstar some wanted him to be back in January , he is still someone to watch . "

McCain Stays Active on Fundraising Front : Proving that he has no plans to step quietly into the background of the Senate following his 2008 presidential defeat , John McCain collected $ 524,000 through his Country First leadership PAC in the first six months of 2009 , according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission .
While McCain 's take was well short of the $ 1.6 million raised by former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney during that time , McCain 's PAC total is still significant given that he is running for reelection in 2010 -- meaning that is where most of his fundraising energy is going and will go -- and that he is coming off a presidential bid in which all of his major donors almost certainly exhausted themselves physically ( and financially ) .
Several stalwarts from the campaign are on the PAC payroll including deputy manager Christian Ferry and regional manager Craig Goldman as well as fundraisers Carla Eudy and Becki Donatelli .
Country
First doled out a significant amount over the first six months of the year to a variety of candidates including longtime McCain allies like Sen.
John Thune ( S.D. ) , Gov. Charlie Crist , who is running for the Senate in Florida , former Sen .
Mike DeWine , a candidate for attorney general in Ohio , and South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster who is running for governor .
McCain also donated to the Republican nominees for governor in Virginia and New Jersey -- the lone statewide races on the ballot this November .
The most interesting contribution from Country First ?
A $ 2,300 donation to former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani 's presidential debt retirement committee .
Ensign In Trouble , Sez New Poll : Republican Sen. John Ensign 's acknowledgment of an affair with a close friend 's wife has badly hurt his standing with voters in Nevada , according to a new independent survey conducted for the Las Vegas Review - Journal .
Thirty - one percent of those polled saw Ensign in a favorable light ( down from 53 percent in May ) while 38 percent saw him unfavorably ( up 20 percent from May ) .
While Nevada voters still do n't believe Ensign should resign ( 34 percent say yes / 54 percent say no ) , it is a virtual toss up over whether the Republican senator should seek reelection in 2012 .
The most amazing numbers in the poll ?
Six in ten Nevada voters believe Ensign having an affair with his best friend 's girl is very serious while only 49 percent said Ensign 's parents paying his mistress $ 96,000 was very serious .
Seriously ?
Ox / Watson ( Almost ) Do It : Whenever sports and politics intersect , the Fix smiles .
So , we had a big grin on our face over the weekend when 59 - year old golfer Tom Watson -- with Philadelphia - based Democratic media consultant Neil Oxman caddying -- nearly delivered on one of the greatest story lines in the history of major championship golf .
Oxman and Watson met more than three decades ago -- Oxman was caddying to help pay for Duquesne Law School , Watson was a first year pro -- and since 2003 Oxman has been Watson 's bagman more or less full time .
Although Watson and Oxman came up short in a four - hole playoff to Stewart " Kitchen " Cink , the duo made the Open weekend -- without Tiger Woods or Phil Mickelson -- watchable .
Lis Smith to Corzine : Lis Smith , who served as press secretary to former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe 's unsuccessful bid for the Virginia governorship , has moved up the east coast to serve in the same role for Gov. Jon Corzine 's ( D ) campaign in New Jersey .
Smith is an itinerant campaign worker ; she spent the 2006 cycle working for Sen. Claire McCaskill ( Mo. ) and then worked for Democrat Dan Seals against Illinois Rep. Mark Kirk last November .

Forty years after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon , a small cult of conspiracy theorists maintains the historic event -- and the five subsequent Apollo moon landings -- were staged .
These people believe NASA fabricated the landings to trump their Soviet rivals and fulfill President Kennedy 's goal of ferrying humans safely to and from the moon by the end of the 1960s .
" I do know the moon landings were faked , " said crusading filmmaker Bart Sibrel , whose aggressive interview tactics once provoked Aldrin to punch him in the face .
" I 'd bet my life on it . "
Sibrel may seem crazy , but he has company .
A 1999 Gallup poll found that a scant 6 percent of Americans doubted the Apollo 11 moon landing happened , and there is anecdotal evidence that the ranks of such conspiracy theorists , fueled by innuendo - filled documentaries and the Internet , are growing .
Twenty - five percent of respondents to a survey in the British magazine Engineering & Technology said they do not believe humans landed on the moon .
A handful of Web sites and blogs circulate suspicions about NASA 's " hoax . "
And a Google search this week for " Apollo moon landing hoax " yielded more than 1.5 billion results .
" We love conspiracies , " said Roger Launius , a senior curator at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington .
" Going to the moon is hard to understand .
And it 's easier for some people to accept the answer that , ' Well , maybe we did n't go to the moon . '
A lot of it is naivete . "
Conspiracy theories about the Apollo missions began not long after the last astronaut returned from the moon in 1972 .
Bill Kaysing , a technical writer for Rocketdyne , which built rocket engines for NASA 's Apollo program , published a 1974 book , " We Never Went to the Moon : America 's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle . "
In the book and elsewhere , Kaysing argued that NASA lacked the technology in 1969 to land humans safely on the moon , that the Apollo astronauts would have been poisoned by passing through the Van Allen radiation belts that ring the Earth and that NASA 's photos from the moon contained suspicious anomalies .

Kaysing theorized NASA sent the Apollo 11 astronauts up in a rocket until it was out of sight , then transferred the lunar capsule and its three passengers to a military cargo plane that dropped the capsule eight days later in the Pacific , where it was recovered .
In the meantime , he believed , NASA officials filmed the " moon landing " at Area 51 , the high - security military base in the Nevada desert , and brainwashed the astronauts to ensure their cooperation .
Some believe Kaysing 's theories inspired the 1978 movie " Capricorn One , " in which NASA fakes a Mars landing on a remote military base , then goes to desperate lengths to cover it up .
Others insist NASA recruited director Stanley Kubrick , hot off " 2001 : A Space Odyssey , " to film the " faked " moon landings .
Oh , and those moon rocks ?
Lunar meteorites from Antarctica .
Decades later , Kaysing 's beliefs formed the foundation for " Conspiracy Theory : Did We Land on the Moon ? " a sensational 2001 Fox TV documentary that spotted eerie " inconsistencies " in NASA 's Apollo images and TV footage .
Among them : no blast craters are visible under the landing modules ; shadows intersect instead of running parallel , suggesting the presence of an unnatural light source ; and a planted American flag appears to ripple in a breeze although there 's no wind on the moon .
The hour - long special sparked such interest in the topic that NASA took the unusual step of issuing a news release and posting a point - by - point rebuttal on its Web site .
The press release began : " Yes .
Astronauts did land on the moon . "
In various documents , NASA has countered that the Apollo astronauts passed through the Van Allen belts too quickly to be exposed to dangerous levels of radiation ; that the module 's descent engines were n't powerful enough to leave a blast crater ; that the shadows in photos were distorted by wide - angle lenses and sloping lunar terrain ; and that the Apollo flags had horizontal support bars that made the flags swing .
Kaysing died in 2005 , but not before grabbing the attention of Sibrel , a Nashville , Tennessee , filmmaker who has since become the most visible proponent of the Apollo hoax theories .
With funding from an anonymous donor , Sibrel wrote and directed a 47 - minute documentary in 2001 that reiterated many of the now - familiar hoax arguments .
Critics of moon - landing hoax theorists , and there are many , say it would be impossible for tens of thousands of NASA employees and Apollo contractors to keep such a whopping secret for almost four decades .
But Sibrel believes the Apollo program was so compartmentalized that only its astronauts and a handful of high - level NASA officials knew the entire story .
Sibrel spent years ambushing Apollo astronauts and insisting they swear on a Bible before his cameras that they walked on the moon .
" When someone has gotten away with a crime , in my opinion , they deserve to be ambushed , " Sibrel said .
" I 'm a journalist trying to get at the truth . "
In an episode made infamous on YouTube , Sibrel confronted Aldrin in 2002 and called him " a coward , a liar and a thief . "
Aldrin , then 72 , socked the thirtysomething Sibrel in the face , knocking him backwards .
" I do n't want to call attention to the individuals who are trying to promote and shuffle off this hoax on people , " Aldrin told CNN in a recent interview .
" I feel sorry for the gullible people who 're going to go along with them .
I guess it 's just natural human reaction to want to be a part of ' knowing something that somebody does n't know . '
But it 's misguided .
It 's just a shame . "
It 's been 37 years since the last Apollo moon mission , and tens of millions of younger Americans have no memories of watching the moon landings live .
A 2005 - 2006 poll by Mary Lynne Dittmar , a space consultant based in Houston , Texas , found that more than a quarter of Americans 18 to 25 expressed some doubt that humans set foot on the moon .
" As the number of people who were not yet born at the time of the Apollo program increases , the number of questions [ about the moon landings ] also may increase , " NASA said in a statement .
" Conspiracy theories are always difficult to refute because of the impossibility of proving a negative . "
Launius , the National Air and Space Museum curator , believes Apollo conspiracy theories resonate with people who are disengaged from society and distrustful of government .
He also believes their numbers are overblown .
" These diehards are really vocal , but they 're really tiny , " he said .
But Stuart Robbins , a Ph.D. candidate in astrophysics at the University of Colorado who gives lectures defending NASA from Apollo hoax theorists , believes their influence can be harmful .
" If people do n't think we were able to go to the moon , then they do n't believe in the ingenuity of human achievement , " he said .
" Going to the moon and returning astronauts safely back to Earth is arguably one of the most profound achievements in human history , and so when people simply believe it was a hoax , they lose out on that shared experience and doubt what humans can do . "
In its information campaign against Apollo's " debunkers , " NASA may have a potent ace up its sleeve , however .
Its Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter is now circling the moon with powerful cameras , snapping crisp pictures that could reveal Apollo 11's Eagle lander squatting on the moon 's surface .
Then again , conspiracy theorists may just say NASA doctored the photos .
" Will the LRO 's incredibly high - resolution images of the lunar surface , including , eventually , the Apollo landing sites , finally quell the lunacy of the Moon Hoax believers ?
Obviously it won't , " writes astronomer Phil Plait in his blog on Discover magazine 's Web site .
" These true believers do n't live in an evidence - based world . "

Auch wenn ich sehr an Politik interessiert bin , sogar Politikwissenschaften studiert habe – in diesem Blog hat das Thema nie eine Rolle gespielt .
Das muss ich heute ausnahmsweise ändern , denn ein paar Entwicklungen der vergangenen Monate regen mich extrem auf und machen mir Angst , dass sich junge , intelligente Menschen zu Abertausenden von der Politik abwenden .
Besonders drei Entwicklungen möchte ich hier nennen : das Verbot so genannter “ Killerspiele ” , die vermeintliche Sperrung von Kinderporno - Websites und das geplante Verbot von Paintball und ähnlicheren Spielereien .
Was passiert hier eigentlich gerade ?
Eine Berliner Clique aus vornehmlich älteren Herren verbietet alles , was sie nicht kapiert .
Es gibt Amokläufe ?
Verbieten wir schnell mal “ Killerspiele ” und Paintball .
Kinderporno ?
Wegsperren und wir haben Ruhe .
In Wahrheit werden hier Entscheidungen getroffen , die an den eigentlichen Problemen völlig vorbei gehen .
Welcher Amoklauf wird dadurch verhindert , dass Ego - Shooter und Gotcha - Spiele verboten werden ?
Welcher Pädophile lässt sich von einer völlig wirkungslosen Sperre abschrecken ?
Wäre es nicht viel wichtiger , bei denjenigen anzusetzen , die diesen kranken Mist ins Netz stellen , anstatt ein Stoppschild vor sie zu stellen , um das herumgefahren werden kann ?
Und wäre es nicht viel wichtiger , gefährliche Waffen aus den Wohn - und Schlafzimmern der Leute zu nehmen , anstatt harmlose Computerspiele und Farbkugelknarren ?
Ich befürchte , dass sich “ die Politiker ” in Berlin gerade von einer ganzen Generation von heranwachsenden und jungen Erwachsenen entfernt , weil sie einfach nicht mehr kapieren , wie moderne Technik funktioniert und was Jugendliche in ihrer Freizeit tun .
Was wird als nächstes verboten ?
Autorennspiele , weil sie Unfälle im echten Leben wahrscheinlicher machen ?
Die Wii-Fernbedienung , weil man damit auch Ego - Shooter spielen kann und dabei auf Menschen im Fernseher zielt ?
Platzpatronen für Cowboy - Pistolen , weil Fünfjährige beim Fasching nicht an Waffen gewöhnt werden sollen ?
Überhaupt : Warum nicht gleich Computer verbieten – die sind doch an allem Übel in unserer Gesellschaft Schuld .
Oder wenigstens das Internet kontrollieren und über Provider nur noch Websites auf einer unbedenklichen Whitelist zum Besuchen zulassen .
Besonders erschüttert es mich , dass nicht nur in der Alte - Leute - Partei CDU solche Wahnsinns - Entscheidungen forciert werden , sondern dass auch die SPD komplett ihren Mund hält und den populistischen Schwachsinn mitmacht .
Und selbst aus Parteien wie den Grünen oder der FDP höre ich kaum Stimmen , die mir Mut machen , dass dem weltfremden und wirkungslosen Treiben der politischen Klasse im Bezug auf moderne Kommunikation und Unterhaltung ein Ende gemacht wird .
Wenn dann noch der Bundeswirtschaftsminister zu Guttenberg – der Mann ist nur zweieinhalb Jahre älter als ich !
– folgendes über die Anti-Zensur - Petition in die “ Tagesschau ” - Mikros spricht : “ Das macht mich schon sehr betroffen , wenn pauschal der Eindruck entstehen sollte , dass es Menschen gibt , die sich gegen die Sperrung von kinderpornographischen Inhalten sträuben .
Das ist nun wirklich einer der wichtigsten Vorhaben in vielerlei Hinsicht . ”
Wieder werden wir Unterzeichner der Petition , die zu wahrscheinlich 100,00 % gegen Kinderpornographie und den Missbrauch von Kindern sind , als Irre abgestempelt , die sich mit Kriminellen verbünden .
Diese Unwissenheit und Dumm - Dreistigkeit einiger der Entscheider in unserem Land lassen mich nur noch mit dem Kopf schütteln und machen mir wirklich Angst .
Im Moment weiß ich nicht mehr , wen ich im Herbst wählen sollte .
Poltiker , die offensichtlich null Ahnung von Internet und Computern haben , den Werkzeugen , die für mich , meine Generation und alle folgenden Generationen eine entscheidende Rolle bei Arbeit , Freizeit und vielem anderen spielt , solche Politiker kann ich nicht wählen .
Anti-fluoride extremists have threatened to kill a Victorian government minister and blow up a regional water authority .
As anger over fluoridating Geelong 's water supply mounted today , Labor minister Lisa Neville has been targeted along with water and health officials .
A death threat was left with a bottle of water on the verandah of Ms Neville 's house on Saturday night , a government spokeswoman said .
Anti-fluoride activists have also threatened to blow up Barwon Water 's treatment plants as the authority begins on Monday adding fluoride to the water supply in Geelong , 70 kilometres southwest of Melbourne .
The Department of Human Services ( DHS ) received a threatening letter in the mail last week .

Hot Maqil.com .
Your source for information about Maqil tribes of Arab Origin
Who is Maqil ?
The Maqil are a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes of Yemeni origin who migrated westwards via Egypt during the 13th century .
The Beni Hassan tribes claim to be descendants of Maqil , who was an arab once living in Tunisia .
One of the largest Maqil tribes was the Beni Hassan , a tribe that came forward to form the ruling nomad warrior class in the Saharan regions of Mauritania and also in Western Sahara .
They had a great cultural impact upon the ruled people .
These tribes , ( Moors and Sahrawis ) still speak Hassaniya , which is the Arabic dialect characteristic of the Beni Hassan tribes .
Almost all of these tribes , after the war of Char Bouba ( 1644 - 74 ) , consider themselves descendants of the Maqil .
A few of the ancient Maqil tribes ( such as the Oulad Delim , which is a subtribe of the Beni Hassan ) , still exist under their proper name in the area .
How and where to meet Maqils ?
Maqil tribesmen are friendly people whoi are famous for their cultural Heritage .
Although Maqils live in various areas of Middle East , but you can easily meet them in Yemen .
This country is also a nice tourist destination .
Hot Maqil -
So what makes a Maqil Hot ?
Funny question ?
May be not .
We actually consider a maqil hot when he is active in cultural and sports activities , particularly horse riding and bird hunting through tammed eagles .

It ’s the new American dream .
Your web - site appears in a top spot on Google for your selected keyword .
Next thing you know , orders start coming in faster than you can handle , plus you are rolling in the funds .
If only it were so easy , right ?
Well ,
It can be done .
I ’ve done it many times in many different industries .
there is no secret , but , it ’s knowing what to do .
I ’ve made about every mistake six can make with a web - site , but I learned from every setback .
If you were only allowed to do six thing to get ranked for your site in Google , without a doubt , all you ’d require to do is get links for your site .
Yes , there ’s many other factors involved in getting your site to a top position .
But this is the most powerful way as of this writing to receive a top spot in Google .
It ’s not enough to have links pointing to your site , but you require to have your keyword “ anchor linked ” to your site .
Anchor linking is when you use your keyword phrase as the click - able text for a link .
So , instead of saying “ Click Here ” , you would use “ Widgets ” as the link text .
they may type in “ Shoes ” , but are looking for “ Running Shoes ” .
So , if you have a top ranking for shoes , do you serve that user ’s needs ?
Maybe , but they may also be looking for dress , casual , Women ’s , Men ’s , Children ’s , athletic , girl ’s , boy ’s , etc .
This is why when you begin to optimize your site , you should focus on more targeted keyword phrases .
Now , another point of consideration is determining what keyword / phrase you require to use to get your site found .
Most times , people impulsively select a six word phrase .
While this would be a great way to bring traffic to your site , would it bring targeted traffic , with people looking specifically for your product or service ?
Most times when people type in a six letter key phrase , they are in the beginning of their search .
Suppose you sell a certain brand name of dress shoes .
For this example , we ’ll call the famous brand XYZ .
So , by getting anchor links as “ XYZ Dress Shoes ” , you are already eliminating those users who are looking for another brand or line of shoe .
Next , you require to make sure that the page that gets linked contains the on the page content with “ XYZ Dress Shoes ” .
If you would link to a page without relevant content , Google would view this link as possible spam , or more appropriately , irrelevant content .
Now , six time you have compiled your list of keywords , you require to see which six are searched on the most .
The best device for this is Word - tracker , plus it is worth the tiny fee you require to pay to have access for six day .
there ’s also free tools on - line that you can use , but Word - tracker will give you the most accurate results .
five times you have run through your list of all your keywords , the obvious choice is to pick the ones with the highest amount of searches ( and content relevant to your site ! ) .
The next step is to then begin the system of a link campaign .
Now , I can already hear you complaining about doing a link exchange .
This is only 1/3 of your campaign .
The ideal method is to not only engage in a reciprocal link exchange , but to also engage in strategic linking .
Strategic linking is when you receive a link to your site without having to return the favour .
What ’s the best way to do this ?
Write an news story like this two .
If I get six web - site to use this news story plus have it point to my site , I ’ve created another link to my site .
Pretty easy , eh ?
Since you have now engaged in a linking campaign , you should expect to see results in Google in as little as 4 days , plus as far as 6 months .
All of this is determined by where your links are coming from , plus the popularity of the site from which the link came .
Next , you require to get as many links as you can pointing to your site with your popular keyword phrase anchor linked to your site .
As I mentioned before , there many other factors that will only enhance your rankings in Google , but the implementation of a link campaign is the strongest method to get your site to a top ranking !

This is how you write " Mr. Ahmadinejad , are you our president or the president of Palestine ? " in Persian .
Grammatically it's a walk in the park compared to other languages , and written literally means " Mr - Ahmadine jad - you - president - of - we - you are - or - Palestine ? "
Arabic , Chinese , Dari , Korean , Pashtu , Persian , Russian and Urdu .
Arabic : HUGE regional variation , so learning Arabic usually means learning standard Arabic along with a regional variant , almost as much work as learning two languages instead of just one .
Three cases , two genders , difficult plurals , different script , has a ton of consonants that English does n't have , verb conjugation takes quite a while to learn .
Chinese : Extremely simple grammar is a plus here .
Besides that though it requires learning tones as well as a few thousand characters .
Chinese is a language that just takes a lot of time and practice as you learn character after character and word after word , seemingly ad infinitum .
Korean : Korean is tough to explain .
Grammatically it 's kind of like a condensed form of Japanese .
The script is quite easy as Korean does n't really use Chinese characters anymore , but to really understand the language you still need to put some time into learning the role they play in the language .
Korean can be learned but it can be very tricky and seemingly counter - intuitive for those coming from a Western European linguistic background , with subjects often completely omitted , varying levels of politeness , and some doubled consonants that students often just can't figure out ( like 자다 - jada , to sleep and 짜다 - jjada , to wring ) .
Pashtu :
An Iranian language and thus somewhat related to Persian , but is both used by less people ( which makes it more difficult to find places to use it ) and is also more grammatically complex .
Has two genders , cases , and many irregular verbs , and also uses the Arabic script .
Urdu : Urdu also uses the Arabic script , and has two genders and three cases , declined adjectives , and lots of fun in having to conjugate verbs by gender as well .
One advantage is that a lot of people use the language ( linguistically it's a variant of Hindustani , which includes Hindi ) , somewhere from 500 million to one billion .
Russian : Russian is a very widespread language so it 's very easy to find places to use it , and the relatively large amount of similar vocabulary ( compared to the others ) is also a plus .
It 's written in a different script as with the others above , but luckily it resembles the English alphabet quite a bit and is used in mostly the same way .
However , the grammar is quite complex with three genders and six cases , extremely long words , and lots of exceptions .
Just to say the word " this " for example you need to know the following forms :
masculine neuter feminine plural
Nominative э́тот это э́та э́т и
Genitive э́того э́того э́той э́ти х
Dative э́тому э́тому э́той э́ти м
Accusative N or G э́то э́ту N or G
Instrumental э́тим э́тим э́той э́тим и
Prepositional об э́том об э́том об э́той об э́ти х
Finally , Persian .
As written above there is a much more detailed post on what makes Persian much easier to learn than you might expect , but here 's a simple overview : Persian is written in the Perso - Arabic script which naturally must be mastered , but after that it 's a breeze compared to the other languages above .
No grammatical gender , no declined adjectives , no cases , no articles , plurals are easy , and verbs are extremely simple .
The only irregularity encountered in Persian verbs are some verbs that have an irregular present stem , so for these you just have to remember what the irregular stem is and then you conjugate as usual .
One quick example of how much easier it is to pick up : see all the forms for the word " this " in Russian above ?
In Persian there 's one : een ( این ) .
Done !
Een gol - this flower .
Een golhâ - these flowers .
Een keshvar - this country .
Een keshvarhâ - these countries .
No surprise , the CIA is still very short on new staff that speak so - called " mission critical " languages and is offering hiring bonuses of up to $ 35,000 for those that speak them .
So which languages are these ?
I believe there are a few more other than these , but the languages given in the article are :
The easiest language out of the above for your average English - language speaker with perhaps some background in Western European languages ( Spanish , French , German , Italian , etc. ) is Persian , and Dari is also a variant of Persian so they 're not really separate languages .
I 've written before in detail on why Persian is an easier language to learn than even Western European languages , but here 's a comparison of some of the aspects of the above languages with those of Persian to show why this is so .
This is not to say that Persian is just something you can pick up in an afternoon , however .
It takes time ( that means years ) just as any other language does , and there is naturally slang and colloquial usage that needs to be mastered in addition to a formal standard .
However , for someone just starting university that wants to get involved in intelligence or foreign relations and is intimidated by the list of languages above , think about picking up Persian .
There 's no reason a reasonably motivated student should n't be able to become completely fluent in the language after four years studying it at university .
The other languages on the list ... hard to say .
Mind - altering psychedelics are back -- but this time they are being explored in labs for their therapeutic applications rather than being used illegally .
Studies are looking at these hallucinogens to treat a number of otherwise intractable psychiatric disorders , including chronic depression , post - traumatic stress disorder , and drug or alcohol dependency .
Wrapping your brain around data online can be challenging , especially when dealing with huge volumes of information .
And trying to find related content can also be difficult , depending on what data you ’re looking for .
But data visualizations can make all of that much easier , allowing you to see the concepts that you ’re learning about in a more interesting , and often more useful manner .
Below are 50 of the best data visualizations and tools for creating your own visualizations out there , covering everything from Digg activity to network connectivity to what ’s currently happening on Twitter .
Music , Movies and Other Media
Narratives 2.0 visualizes music .

The BNP will inevitably face a series of legal challenges on issues ranging from discrimination and employment law to possible criminal offences , lawyers say , following two candidates ' election to the European parliament .
The party 's constitution , which says membership is " strictly defined within the terms of … ' indigenous Caucasian ' and defined ethnic groups emanating from that Race " is a breach of the law against discriminating in membership organisations , according to legal experts .
" An unincorporated association like the BNP which has genuine screening for membership cannot unlawfully discriminate , " said Gavin Millar QC , who specialises in election and discrimination law .
" There will inevitably now be legal challenges to this .
" It was presumed before that the BNP were so unimportant that it was n't worth trying , but now this is a live issue , and the BNP 's constitution must be challenged . "
Possible challenges to the constitution could make use of a Lords ruling which found that political parties could be regarded as " members ' clubs " and therefore fell within discrimination law .
Lawyers also said that as the BNP gets access to the European parliament , with a budget for employing staff and contracting services , it would also be open to employment law , which prohibits direct and indirect discrimination .
" A black or Jewish candidate who applied and did n't get the job on grounds of their racial or religious background would have a claim in the employment tribunal , " Millar said .
" If an individual challenges and they maintain a practice not employing any visible minority people , there is no doubt that like any employer who has such practices , they can be sued , " said employment barrister and chair of the Society of Black Lawyers , Peter Herbert .
" When they are in receipt of public funds they will have to be an equal opportunities employer .
To do otherwise would be incompatible with public office .
" I can see the equality commission mounting an inquiry into how the BNP operate now .
The office of public standards could also inquire . "
The questions came as BNP leader Nick Griffin was pelted with eggs at an event in Manchester .
Griffin picked up a seat in the north - west of England and Andrew Brons won a seat in Yorkshire and the Humber , a breakthrough in national elections for the far - right party .
Labour MEP for London Claude Moraes , speaking at a Unite Against Fascism press conference in Westminster , said : " There is real damage here to Britain because we have never elected fascists in a national election .
Fascists in the European parliament have long wanted members from Britain to join this transnational group .
" There was a long period in which we could have said neofascists would not be elected in Britain to represent us in an international parliament . "
In addition to the BNP 's membership and employment practices , lawyers said that policies once supported by the BNP but now abandoned by its official representatives – including non-voluntary repatriation and forced sterilisation of non-white women – may attract criminal liability for some BNP activists .
Said Millar : " One of the stresses for Nick Griffin is constantly having to say to the membership that this is no longer a policy they can espouse in public .
It is a constant source of tension within the party . "
Criminal lawyers said there was no doubt that members who espoused those policies could be liable for charges of inciting racial or religious hatred .
" Any policy which incites racial hatred will be liable , " Herbert said .
" Twelve years after Stephen Lawrence this is a sad place to be . "
A number of BNP members already have criminal convictions for race - related offences , including Griffin , who was given a two - year suspended sentence for incitement to racial hatred after publishing material denying the Holocaust in 1998 .
Although in 2006 Griffin and party activist Mark Collett were cleared of race hate charges relating to speeches he made describing Islam as a " wicked , vicious faith " , Griffin last month told BNP members in an online broadcast that he had no problem with breaking race laws .
" As you know , we do n't break the law .
We never have , we never will , you know , on financial things .
Do n't mind breaking the odd race law , or being accused of it , you know , inadvertently , " he said .
But lawyers said criminal convictions were difficult to obtain in practice , with an average of only three successful prosecutions per year for inciting racial hatred .
" [ BNP activity ] will only be criminal if … the material is threatening , abusive or insulting , and also it must be intended to stir up racial hatred , " said Kirsty Brimelow , a barrister who specialises in racial and religious hate crimes .
" If BNP leaflets contain extreme racism , there will be a case that they are trying to undermine public order and the rights of the targeted minority – [ so ] they would not be able to rely on their right to free speech . "
Most cellphones can't do 720 p yet but Omnivision is already sampling a new 1.75 - micron sensor that will allow slim handsets to record at 30 frames per second in Full HD , 1080 p .
According to them , it gets even better :
The OV5653 , based on the company 's latest 1.75 - micron OmniBSI technology , delivers low - light sensitivity of > 1400 mV / ( lux - sec ) – a 40 % improvement over frontside illumination technology – and a two times improvement in signal - to - noise ratio ( < 70lux ) , according to OmniVision .
The OV5653 enables 720 p recording at 60 fps and full HD 1080 p at 30 fps , making it ideal for both 5 - megapixel DSCs and DVs , according to the company .

So not only they have achieved 720 p at 60 fps and 1080 p at 30 fps , but their OV5653 and OV5650 parts also have better sensibility and two times less signal - to - noise ratio than previous sensors .
Not bad at all — especially when you consider the growing number of cellphone processors capable of encoding video this large .

A half - dozen senators friendly to labor have decided to drop a central provision of a bill that would have made it easier to organize workers .
The so - called card - check provision  which senators decided to scrap to help secure a filibuster - proof 60 votes  would have required employers to recognize a union as soon as a majority of workers signed cards saying they wanted a union .
Currently , employers can insist on a secret - ballot election , a higher hurdle for unions .
The abandonment of card check was another example of the power of moderate Democrats to constrain their party ’s more liberal legislative efforts .
Though the Democrats have a 60 - 40 vote advantage in the Senate , and President Obama supports the measure , several moderate Democrats opposed the card - check provision as undemocratic .
In its place , several Senate and labor officials said , the revised bill would require shorter unionization campaigns and faster elections .

After the leaked pictures of the Zune HD appeared on Saturday , more unconfirmed technical specifications of the device have now emerged .
Microsoft 's new portable media player is set to go neck - to - neck with Apple 's iPod Touch , as the specifications of the Zune HD make it a viable contender .
The Zune HD is set to feature a multitouch ( capacitive ) OLED screen in a 16:9 aspect ratio and will have a TV out port on the side ( apparently HDMI ) .
Coming in 16 and 32GB versions , the device will also support wireless syncing to your computer .
Some even speculate the PMP will support 3D Xbox games , if the Zune HD will actually use Nvidia 's Tegra chipset .
The new details also mention a Web browser on the Zune HD , which in turn supports multitouch .
No word on what kind of browser this will be , but let 's hope it wo n't be anything similar to Internet Explorer on Windows Mobile .
As previously reported , the Zune HD is set to launch this fall ( probably September ) with new details of international availability in Canada , the U.K , and France .
What is Microsoft cooking ?
The tech blogosphere is also talking today about Zune - themed mobile phones .
AdWeek reports that Microsoft is now taking bids for an ad campaign for a Zune mobile application dubbed Pink .
While some speculate that the Zune HD is likely to run on the long - overdue Windows Mobile 6.5 ( expected in Q4 , same as the Zune HD ) , it 's more likely that WM phones would just share some services and feature with the new Zune .

As complex as the chemistry of life may be , the conditions for the vigorous growth of plants often boil down to three numbers , say , 19 - 12 - 5 .
Those are the percentages of nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium , prominently displayed on every package of fertilizer .
In the 20th century the three nutrients enabled agriculture to increase its productivity and the world ’s population to grow more than sixfold .
But what is their source ?
We obtain nitrogen from the air , but we must mine phosphorus and potassium .
The world has enough potassium to last several centuries .
But phosphorus is a different story .
Readily available global supplies may start running out by the end of this century .
By then our population may have reached a peak that some say is beyond what the planet can sustainably feed .

Articles : Early drafts of great work are encouraging 2009 - 06 - 26
I get so encouraged looking at early drafts of great work , thinking , “ I can do that ! ”
In this clip from “ Le mystère Picasso ” , you watch Picasso start with a simple scribble of a goat , then flesh it out .
Not only adding textures , but changing his mind and removing things as well .
After making the brilliant movie Sin City , director Robert Rodriguez was cool enough to include the entire film as it was really shot on a green screen .
The Beatles ’ “ Anthology ” had some great outtakes and early versions of songs I thought of as untouchably perfect .
Like seeing stars without makeup , you realize how much of the magic is in the finishing touches .
Archive.org ’s wonderful Wayback Machine lets us see :
I meet so many potential entrepreneurs who think they have to spend millions and months in development before launching .
( And therefore , they often never launch . )
For the first nine months of CD Baby , every page was hand - coded HTML and the site did nothing but email the order details to me .
I had to copy - and - paste all the info from each email into four places : a mailing label , a thank - you email , a vendor - alert email , and a Filemaker database .
It was as lo -fi as can be , but it was enough to get started , and it was profitable .
So I ’m writing this in hopes that we get more of these “ Version 0.1 ” stories out there .
Encouraging potential entrepreneurs , songwriters , artists , and inventors to compare themselves to the early drafts , not the final polished perfection .
2008 was a record year for the Australian Box Office however the first 6 months of 2009 has already smashed records .
Over half a billion dollars was spent at the Australian box office during the first six months of the year which is 15 % up on the same time last year !
Some of the big guns in 09 which have helped drive the increase include Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , Monsters vs. Aliens , X - Men Origins : Wolverine , Angels & Demons & Ice Age : Dawn of The Dinosaurs .
I would also assume that the heavily discounted ticket offers early in the year may have played a role .
Interestingly it would also seem the increase at the Box Office has impacted on FTA audiences .
Research shows a dramatic increase in light free to air viewing amongst frequent cinema - goers with 50 % of frequent moviegoers now light or non FTA viewers .
So can we continue to see cinema attendance grow ?
I ’d suggest the back half of the year is already off to a strong start with the launch of Bruno last week which to date has taken over $ 7.5 m .
Whilst this is only marginally up on the Borat opening week of $ 6.08 m , the launch of Harry Potter & the half - blood prince this week has seen the record set for the biggest opening Wednesday ever .
Harry took a massive $ 4.4 m
Australia wide & broke the existing record set in 2007 by Harry Potter & the order of phoenix .

The man suspected of fatally shooting abortion provider George Tiller as Tiller served as an usher during church services yesterday has a long history of involvement with the anti-government “ sovereign citizen ” movement , as well as anti-abortion radicalism .
Scott Roeder , 51 , allegedly killed Tiller with a single shot in the foyer of the Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita , Kan .
Roeder was taken into custody a few hours later in Kansas City and is being held without bail .
Roeder 's arrest is further evidence of a resurgence of right - wing extremism .
A recent Department of Homeland Security report came under severe criticism from the right for making the point that such extremism is likely on the rise .
Roeder ’s support of violent extremism dates back at least as far as April 1996 , when police in Topeka , Kan . pulled him over for driving with a bogus license plate .
Instead of a legitimate license plate his vehicle bore a “ sovereign citizen ” plate that proclaimed the driver immune from state and federal laws .
The same type of tag was being used by members of the Montana Freemen , a violent sovereign citizen group that at the time was involved in a prolonged armed standoff with federal agents in Montana .
In Roeder ’s trunk , investigators found a pound of gunpowder , a nine - volt battery wired to a switch , ammunition and blasting caps .
Since his 1996 arrest , Roeder seems to have focused primarily on anti-abortion radicalism , including several posts in recent years proposing a confrontation with Dr. Tiller inside Tiller ’s church .
" Bless everyone for attending and praying in May to bring justice to Tiller and the closing of his death camp , " Roeder posted to the website of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue in May 2007 .
" Sometime soon , would it be feasible to organize as many people as possible to attend Tillers church ( inside , not just outside ) to have much more of a presence and possibly ask questions of the Pastor , Deacons , Elders and members while there ?
Does n't seem like it would hurt anything but bring more attention to Tiller . "
Roeder is n’t the only link between the militant anti-abortion movement and the Freemen .
During the 1996 standoff , the Rev. W.N. Otwell , who called America a “ white man ’s country ” and led camouflage - clad followers in protests of abortion clinics , traveled from his Texas compound to support the Montana Freemen in their 81 - day armed standoff .
Dr. Tiller is the eighth abortion provider to be assassinated since 1977 , according to the National Abortion Federation .
Fifteen years ago , his name appeared atop a “ hit list ” that was circulated among pro-life militants .
Earth 's molten mantle is a potentially inexhaustible source of energy that could meet 10 percent of our nation 's energy needs , but cost and safety concerns have hampered the growth of geothermal energy .
Now , researchers have announced plans to test a more efficient way to tap into safer , low - temperature geothermal stores using nanotechnology .
President Barack Obama has promoted geothermal energy as a component for kicking the nation 's fossil fuel habit and reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
Last week , the U.S. Bureau of Land Management auctioned geothermal energy rights on nearly 1,000 square kilometers of public land in the Southwest and expects 111 new geothermal plants by 2015 .
These traditional geothermal power plants — which currently account for just 0.5 percent of the nation 's energy supply — tap into hot springs miles beneath Earth 's surface that contain water superheated to between 150 and 370 degrees Celsius .
These springs arise when magma from the outer mantle , about 50 kilometers beneath the surface , intrudes into the crust , heating rock and water .
At most power plants , as this high - pressure water is extracted from the reservoir , it expands and turns to steam , powering the plant 's generator turbines .
But drilling for hydrothermal resources can sometimes trigger earthquakes , particularly when projects fracture hot bedrock around faults and inject their own water .
The approach , called stimulation , led the Swiss government to shut down one such project in Basel in 2006 after it set off violent tremors , and a California company , AltaRock Energy , has put its project at The Geysers on hold after an article in The New York Times raised questions about its safety .
Low - temperature hot springs , sometimes below 100 degrees C , are more abundant and closer to Earth 's surface , reducing the chance that drills will intersect the deep faults where large earthquakes typically begin .
The water must be used in conjunction with a heat exchanger to warm special liquids like alkanes ( saturated hydrocarbons such as methane ) or perfluorocarbon that have a lower boiling point .
As these substances evaporate , they release energy to turn turbines .
Unfortunately , they release less energy than water would during this transition , making the process less efficient .
So , environmental engineer Peter McGrail and his colleagues at the U.S. Department of Energy 's ( DoE ) Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are proposing a way to change that .
Eight months ago , his team made a surprising discovery during their work on capturing and storing carbon .
They were working with cagelike nanostructures that could trap carbon dioxide when they learned that they could also increase the heat - storing capacity of alkanes by a factor of 20 .
" That discovery led us to the idea of trying to apply this on the geothermal basis , " McGrail says .
In theory , he explains , this fluid could allow a 30 to 40 percent increase in the efficiency of power production from low - temperature geothermal sources .
McGrail and his team christened the structures " metal - organic heat carriers , " or MOHCs , and with $ 1.2 million in funding from the DoE , the lab will test electricity generation using different blends on a lab bench over the next three years .
The new proposal surprised many in the community , who are optimistic about its chances .
" This is the first I have heard of this , " says Peter Rose , who runs the Geothermal Program at the University of Utah 's Energy and Geoscience Institute in Salt Lake City .
" But it sounds like a potentially exciting approach for generating electricity from low - temperature geothermal resources . "
Leonard MacGillivray , a University of Iowa chemist who has worked with similar nanostructures , says the approach is sound and the compounds are both easy to synthesize and unlikely to lead to environmental problems .
" It 's very intriguing , " he says .
" It 's a nice way to take these metal - organic structures and apply them to a problem . "
Of course , the technology is still in its infancy , and its feasibility will depend on such factors as the availability of energy transmission lines and public land in the vicinity of low - temperature geothermal resources .
" The hope here , " McGrail says , " is if you are able to make it more economic to use shallower systems ... then the chances of intersecting an active fault that can transmit an earthquake diminishes . "
New Gamma - Ray Burst Smashes Cosmic Distance Record
Francis Reddy
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center
NASA 's Swift satellite and an international team of astronomers have found a gamma-ray burst from a star that died when the universe was only 630 million years old , or less than five percent of its present age .
The event , dubbed GRB 090423 , is the most distant cosmic explosion ever seen .
" Swift was designed to catch these very distant bursts , " said Swift lead scientist Neil Gehrels at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " The incredible distance to this burst exceeded our greatest expectations -- it was a true blast from the past .
" At 3:55 a.m. EDT on April 23 , Swift detected a ten - second - long gamma -ray burst of modest brightness .
It quickly pivoted to bring its ultraviolet / optical and X - ray telescopes to observe the burst location .
Swift saw a fading X - ray afterglow but none in visible light .
" The burst most likely arose from the explosion of a massive star , " said Derek Fox at Pennsylvania State University .
" We 're seeing the demise of a star -- and probably the birth of a black hole -- in one of the universe 's earliest stellar generations .
" Gamma -ray bursts are the universe 's most luminous explosions .
Most occur when massive stars run out of nuclear fuel .
As their cores collapse into a black hole or neutron star , gas jets -- driven by processes not fully understood -- punch through the star and blast into space .
There , they strike gas previously shed by the star and heat it , which generates short - lived afterglows in many wavelengths .
"
The lack of visible light alone suggested this could be a very distant object , " explained team member Edo Berger of Harvard University .
Beyond a certain distance , the expansion of the universe shifts all optical emission into longer infrared wavelengths .
While a star 's ultraviolet light could be similarly shifted into the visible region , ultraviolet - absorbing hydrogen gas grows thicker at earlier times .
" If you look far enough away , you can't see visible light from any object , " he noted .
Within three hours of the burst , Nial Tanvir at the University of Leicester , U.K. , and his colleagues reported detection of an infrared source at the Swift position using the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope on Mauna Kea , Hawaii .
" Burst afterglows provide us with the most information about the exploded star and its environs , " Tanvir said .
" But because afterglows fade out so fast , we must target them quickly .
" At the same time , Fox led an effort to obtain infrared images of the afterglow using the Gemini North Telescope on Mauna Kea .
The source appeared in longer - wavelength images but was absent in an image taken at the shortest wavelength of 1 micron .
This " drop out " corresponded to a distance of about 13 billion light - years .
As
Fox spread the word about the record distance , telescopes around the world slewed toward GRB 090423 to observe the afterglow before it faded away .
At the Galileo National Telescope on La Palma in the Canary Islands , a team including Guido Chincarini at the University of Milan - Bicocca , Italy , determined that the afterglow 's so - called redshift was at least 7.6 .
Tanvir 's team , gathering nearly simultaneous observations using one of the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescopes on Cerro Paranal , Chile , found a redshift of 8.2 , later confirmed by the Italian group .
This means the burst exploded 13.035 billion light - years away .
" It 's an incredible find , " Chincarini said .
" What makes it even better is that a telescope named for Galileo made this measurement during the year in which we celebrate the 400th anniversary of Galileo 's first astronomical use of the telescope .
"
The previous record holder was a burst seen in September 2008 .
It showed a redshift of 6.7 , which places it 190 million light - years closer than GRB 090423 .
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center manages Swift .
It was built and is being operated in collaboration with Pennsylvania State University , the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico , and General Dynamics of Gilbert , Ariz. , in the United States .
International collaborators include the University of Leicester and Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in the United Kingdom , Brera Observatory and the Italian Space Agency in Italy , and additional partners in Germany and Japan .
A vintage airplane collector said Tuesday that government agents have impounded his rare 1952 military aircraft he imported from France last fall and are threatening to destroy the plane because of a missed step in bringing it into the country .
Claude Hendrickson III
said
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
agents seized his Douglas AD - 4N Skyraider about six weeks ago at the Bessemer Municipal Airport hangar he leases .
" ( ICE ) basically said we smuggled the plane into the country .
My question is how do you smuggle this into the country , " Hendrickson asked pointing to the single - engine aircraft that was commonly used as an attack bomber during the Vietnam War .
Hendrickson 's Skyraider is believed to be one of only four of its kind that remain in the U.S .
The airplane , which Hendrickson bought for $ 100,000 last May , since its seizure has been moved to another hangar at the Bessemer Airport .
Hendrickson said he is not allowed to fly the plane or perform any work on it until ICE agents release it .
ICE spokesman Temple Black on Tuesday declined comment on the case and forwarded questions to the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Birmingham .
Officials in the U.S. Attorney 's Office declined specifics on the matter , but said " ICE continues to investigate the case . "
Hendrickson said he was not trying to bring the plane into the country illegally .
He said he believed he followed all steps to import the plane .
The 48 - year - old businessman hired attorneys Joe Lassiter and Anthony Johnson .
Hendrickson said his attorneys on Tuesday met with lawyers in the U.S. Attorneys in Birmingham regarding the plane .
Hendrickson said he has been advised that ICE had 60 days to file any criminal charges against him .
He said the plane has already been impounded for about 45 days .
MISSED PAPERWORK :
Hendrickson , who lives in Shelby County , said he was in Texas on business when federal agents seized the plane at the Bessemer Airport in May .
He flew into the airport as soon as he heard about the seizure and briefly met with ICE agents .
Hendrickson said ICE agents told him then that he had failed to fill out a form required by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco Firearms and Explosives when he imported the plane into the states from France .
Hendrickson said he was unaware he had to register the plane with ATF since he removed the aircraft 's artillery while it was still in France .
Hendrickson did register the plane with the FAA .
The FAA issued a certificate of registration on the airplane in September 2008 , according to the agency 's Web site .
The registered owner of the aircraft , according to the FAA , is Dixie Equipment LLC , the business Hendrickson owns .
IN HONOR OF FATHER :
Hendrickson 's father , Claude F. Hendrickson Jr. , is a retired captain in the Navy .
The elder Hendrickson flew planes like a Skyraider during his service .
It was his father 's service as a Naval pilot that sparked the younger Hendrickson 's fascination with airplanes .
The younger Hendrickson owns several vintage military aircraft that he houses in Bessemer including the exact SNJ - 4 warbird his father flew during his time in the military .
He and his father made the trip to France last year for the Skyraider .
After inspecting the aircraft , the two men hired a pilot to fly a 15 - day trip to get the plane from Europe to Buffalo , N.Y .
The Hendricksons planned to enter the plane in air shows across the country .
Hendrickson already flies several of his military planes in air shows .
The younger Hendrickson said once the Skyraider had made a successful run in air shows , he planned to donate the aircraft in his father 's honor .
" Ultimately , my intentions from the beginning have been to fly this plane for five to 10 years in air shows and then donate it to the Southern Museum of Flight in my father 's name . "
Now , Hendrickson worries that the government will destroy the vintage aircraft .
" I just do n't get it , " Hendrickson said .
" This is a part of American history .
It is of no danger to the government . "

Portland Mayor Sam Adams opened the second day of Open Source Bridge with a keynote calling for increased collaboration between the City of Portland and the open source community .
[ HTML4 ] Portland Mayor Sam Adams opened the second day of Open Source Bridge with a keynote calling for increased collaboration between the City of Portland and the open source community .
Why ?
In hopes of making Portland the “ hub of open source ” and — in a bit of throwing down the municipal open source gauntlet — vowing to “ out open source ” Vancouver , British Columbia , which has recently declared itself a completely open city .
“ Bottom line : the city government has unnecessarily been closed in proprietary software and has been a a laggard in using open source software , ” said Adams .
And he wants to see Portland change that .
[ HTML1 ]
Given that he was presenting to an open source conference , one has to ask : was this just political grandstanding ?
Not likely .
While he might not qualify as a hacker , Adams is tech savvy .
He started a pirate blog for interacting with the public while he was a Portland city commissioner .
He ’s been a proponent of more open city .
And he ’s dutifully picked up Twitter as a way to better interact with his constituents .
“ Let me see if I can Twitter and give my speech at the same time , ” said Adams as he started his talk .
“ If I have long dramatic pauses , you ’ll know why . ”
Seeking collaboration
Adams challenged the local government to pursue more openness , specifically because it is central to the idea of democracy .
Sharing information and gathering feedback are critical to the democratic process .
Why should technology be any different ?
And he pointed to the need for the city to be a “ laboratory to continue to push local innovation for open source . ”
But he urged the open source community to step up to the challenge as well — by creating a more cohesive organization with whom the local government can communicate .
Echoing a similar challenge he brought up when he met with Portland open source , mobile , coworking , and tech startup types .
Mike Rogoway at The Oregonian said it best .
But he also called on the open source community to do a better job of organizing itself and communicating with those outside the technology field to demonstrate the scale and opportunity that Portland ’s open source community presents .
[ HTML3 ]
“ Your industry needs to improve as well , ” he said .
The distributed nature of the independent coders , small developer shops , and user groups , Adams highlighted , makes it difficult for public entities to engage with “ the open source community . ”
And that ’s something that needs to be fixed if the collaboration between government and open source is going to work .
He asked the open source community continue to gather with events like Open Source Bridge and to continue to organize as an entity so that the government knows how to better work with an community .
“ Portland is known in very positive ways for its open source efforts , ” said Adams .
“ We think the partnership with open source will be to the benefit of both parties . ”
I ’m confident that the open source community can heed this call .
And I ca n’t wait to see what Portland and the OS community can do — together .

Susan Boyle did n't win Britain 's Got Talent on Saturday night because she became the wrong kind of victim .
We loved Susan Boyle at first , because she was a pitiful , pathetic , unattractive 48 - year - old Scottish virgin who lived with a cat – a strange creature in a dull gold dress , who did n't belong on a stage .
And when we heard her singing I Dreamed a Dream at her audition we thought – we can change your life .
We can make you happy .
We can save you .
Behold our kindness , Susan Boyle , and weep tears of happiness .
In Britain 's Got Talent it is never simply the talent that wins .
It is the journey that wins – the story that the British public deems most worthy of reward .
Who from the fetid gutter shall we raise up to be a glittering star ?
Who will be the most appreciative candidate ?
At first we thought it must be Susan Boyle , who the tabloids nicknamed " the hairy angel " .
It is a despicable phrase , but it says everything about what we expected Susan Boyle to be .
It means " ugly saint " .
But last week Susan Boyle began to step out of her journey .
It was reported that she was cracking up under the pressure .
The " hairy angel " was becoming aggressive .
She was n't , in fact , an angel , but she was human , and troubled .
She apparently swore at a passerby who was bothering her , and even complained to a policeman about it .
But , Susan , are n't you ecstatic to be bothered ?
You have never been bothered before .
She allegedly stormed out of a room , mouthing , " fuck off ! " when the judge Piers Morgan praised another singer in the competition .
This was not acceptable .
This was not in the script .
Susan , we read on , was being counselled by " armies of psychiatrists " as she prepared for the big final on Saturday night .
Piers Morgan reported that she had " been in tears repeatedly " and had even packed her bags , ready to walk away from the contest entirely .
What 's up , Susan Boyle ?
Do n't you feel better after all we have given you ?
Are n't you grateful ?
The anger of Susan Boyle baffled us .
It was like realizing that Cinderella did n't have an orgasm on her wedding night - or that Snow White actually hated the dwarves .
Once we learned that she was ambivalent about the gift we wanted to give her , it was over .
Once we realised that Susan Boyle was n't just a strange doll , existing for us to project our rescue fantasies onto , but a real person , with real problems and real issues and real bitterness , we rejected her .
We somehow felt cheated by her , because we made a deal with her that first night on the stage .
The deal was – we will save you , but you have to be the kind of victim that we want .
You have to be blemish - free and passive and inert .
You have to be grateful , and you are not allowed to be confused about it .
We will rescue you , Susan Boyle , and you will be rescued .
You will exist only for your redemption .
Why do we do it ?
Why can't we deal with a three - dimensional victim who bears all the scars of what made her a victim in the first place ?
I think it is because there is only so much guilt we can bear .
We do n't really want to think about what we did to Susan Boyle , before she even stepped onto the stage .
And to all the other Susan Boyles whom we ignored and neglected and mocked , because they are ordinary women , without breast implants or an overt sexuality or Amanda Holden 's curiously joyless face .
I wrote about this when Britain 's Got Talent began .
I wrote that we raised this Susan Boyle up , as an excuse for grinding every other Susan into the dust .
When Susan Boyle sang I Dreamed a Dream she offered us a chance to redeem our guilt .
But when we realised that we could n't save her , and that we could n't make it all right with a stupid television talent show , we dropped her , right back where we found her .

Clay Shirky recently described revolutions as situations in which “ … the old stuff gets broken faster than the new stuff is put in its place . ”
He was talking about newspapers , but the insight can apply much more broadly .
Advertising , for example , seems to be going through its own revolution , with existing models falling to tatters without a clear successor waiting in the wings .
Education is another example , and some would argue that a similar process is underway in the realm of international power and politics .

Shirky ’s observation came to mind while watching a recording of Bruce Sterling ’s closing keynote for the ReBoot conference last month .
Late in the talk , Bruce tosses out this line : “ Objects are print - outs . ”
He goes on to discuss how to rethink one ’s relationship with material possessions in an increasingly precarious world , but the “ objects are print - outs ” line stuck with me .
It encapsulates not just an attitude towards material possessions , but–in one pithy phrase–one possible shape of the next economy .
Fab
This
Take a design for a simple product–an engine part , for example , or a piece of silverware , and feed it into a computer .
Press “ print . ”
Out pops ( for a sufficiently wide definition of “ pops ” ) a physical duplicate , made out of materials plastic , ceramic , metal — even sugar .
Press “ print ” again , and out comes another copy–or feed in a new design , for the next necessary object .
It may sound like a scene from a low - rent version of Star Trek , but it ’s real , and it ’s happening with increasing frequency .
This process goes by a few names , but it ’s most commonly known as “ 3D Printing ” ( the older name , “ rapid prototyping , ” no longer captures the range of uses , while the other alternative name , “ fabbing , ” is a little too cyberpunk for the moment ) .
While the process has been around since the mid-1980s , the cost of 3D printers has been dropping quickly , and now range to well under $ 10,000 .
If that still sounds like a lot of money , you ’re right–but do n’t forget , it was when laser printers dropped to this price range in the mid-1980s that the desktop publishing revolution kicked off .
Right now , most 3D printing is limited to single - material objects ( as designer Sven Johnson noted on Twitter , we ’re now starting to see two - material 3D printers ) .
Most systems use ( often proprietary ) plastics , but a few use metal “ toner . ”
The latter is turned solid by a variety of high - tech means , from sintering with lasers ( for simple objects ) to using high - energy electron beams to melt the metal into dense , high - strength parts .
On the near horizon , however , are systems that would allow for multiple material inputs , and those that allow the use of electroactive and electronic polymers .
Although plastic electronics fall way behind traditional silicon processors when it comes to speed , they ’re moving into the “ just good enough ” category , raising the tantalizing possibility of being able to print out basic electronic products–sensors , RFID - type tags , even simple communication devices–by the middle of the next decade .
And as the 3D printing systems become more sophisticated , moving closer to the realm of molecular - scale manufacturing , the potential for even more complex and powerful products available at the touch of the “ print ” button becomes ever greater .
The Ultimate Do -It - Yourself Technology A sign of just how close we are coming to the “ desktop manufacturing ” revolution is word that comedian Jay Leno–a collector of vintage motorcycles and cars–now uses a 3D printer to produce replacement parts for his classic vehicles .
advertisement
Any antique car part can be reproduced with these machines==pieces of trim , elaborately etched and even scrolled door handles .
If you have an original , you can copy it .
Or you can design a replacement on the computer , and the 3D printer makes it for you . [ … ]
If you have a part that ’s worn away , or has lost a big chunk of metal , you can fill in that missing link on the computer .
Then you make the part in plastic and have a machinist make a copy based on that example .
Or you can do what we do — input that program into a Fadal CNC machine ; it reads the dimensions and replicates an exact metal copy .
To be sure , the gear that Leno employs remains out of the price range of most of us .
But it ’s near - certain that the cost of 3D printing will continue to plummet .
One reason why is the startlingly rapid development of the RepRap project , the open - source “ replicating rapid - prototyping ” system being devised at Bath University in the UK .
For now , it ’s designed to print only polymers , but is coming close to its initial goal of being able to produce all of the plastic components of another RepRap device .
The greater goal , of being able to print out all of the components of a RepRap ( that is , to make it truly replicating ) , is still in the distance , but will probably come sooner than expected .
In the meantime , the current RepRap design is just getting more precise , and more powerful .
A New Economy ?
Technologies that shift production from being atom - dominated to being bit - dominated tend to follow similar trajectories .
With both laser printers and , later , CD / DVD burners , the first wave of “ creative destruction ” came when the prices dropped to the level where the devices were affordable by small businesses ; the second , bigger wave came when the prices dropped to a level affordable by general households .
Now , laser printers and CD / DVD burners are just about free in a box of cereal–and , for many of us , the production and consumption of text documents and music has moved to entirely digital formats .
If 3D printing follows a similar trajectory , we may not be likely to see a massive shift to entirely digital “ products ” any time soon , but we could well see a shift to more local–even desktop–production .
There ’s no guarantee , of course , that 3D printing system prices will crash in the exact same way as laser printers , or that individual households will decide that desktop manufacturing is appealing .
Local manufacturing seems a good bet , however , for a variety of reasons .
There ’s a particularly strong sustainability argument around local manufacturing , from the rising tide of “ localism ” philosophies ( from food to media ) , to the ability of 3D printing to extend the useful life of manufactured goods by making new parts ( as Jay Leno does for his vintage cars ) .
The sustainability argument will become especially powerful once cheap overseas - produced goods reflect rising costs for fuel and carbon .
And local manufacturing via 3D printing , even if limited to simple consumer items , has the potential to disrupt incumbent manufacturing , shipping , and retail industries .
If we do see 3D printing follow the footsteps of laser printing , however , the results could be profound .
Desktop manufacturing offers the potential for the ultimate “ maker ” culture , where commercial products are bought off of iTunes - like online stores and printed at home , while eager hardware hackers play with design tools and open - source hardware systems to make entirely new material goods .
Lurking in the background , of course , is the potential for design piracy — what one writer termed “ napster fabbing , ” back in the era when Napster was scary .
advertisement
If we ’re lucky , this could happen slowly and gradually , allowing the new economic models time to solidify and new institutions to emerge ; if we ’re less lucky , it could happen abruptly , and with great resistance on the part of those industries most under attack , so that the new systems are n’t yet ready by the time the old system collapses .
The first would obviously be an easier transition than the second .
Any bets on which one is more likely ?
The End of Days
This does n’t mean that Wal - Mart will go away any time soon , but it does mean a pretty big shift in the relationship between individuals and their material world .
Most notably , it would open up the possibility that the kinds of personalized products now available to those with the right money and know - how may soon be available to everyday people .
Thinking of this simply as traditional manufacturing moved from the factory to the neighborhood ( or the home office ) misses the larger revolution .
This is n’t just desktop production ( figuratively or literally ) , it ’s democratized production .
It will have its own intrinsic dilemmas , from liability to spam , but it will pose a powerful challenge to the status quo .
As I wrote recently about other kinds of personal augmentation technologies , Humans wo n’t be taken out of the loop — in fact , many , many more humans will have the capacity to do something that was once limited to a hermetic priesthood .
[ This technology ] decreases the need for specialization and increases participatory complexity .
We ’re seeing this pattern again and again .
New technologies , and the new behaviors they engender , trigger unexpected shifts in how we relate to each other .
The trajectory of what we can do in concert with our tools is just getting steeper .
Participatory complexity may well be the key descriptor of the 21st century –in our economies , in our politics , and in our everyday lives .

The continuing tense situation in the Amazon Region of Peru has taken a turn for the worst and has become unbearable in city of Bagua .
Reports coming from that area are truly alarming : RPP says : Emergency in Bagua : Police are killed and residents destroy buildings [ es ] .
El Comercio reported that demonstrators burned government buildings [ es ] , as well as the Apra political party headquarters in Bagua Grande .
There are no official reports of deaths of indigenous residents , but SERVINDI does mention : Peru : 20 Awajún - Wampis indigenous die during conflicts in Bagua [ es ] .
These protests are a continuation of the demands from indigenous communities , who are concerned that the government will take away their lands that are believed to be rich in minerals and oil .
As a result , more than 2,000 indigenous residents have been blockading the highway in the area of Devil 's Curve in Bagua Grande for the past week and a half , according to Enlace Nacional [ es ] .
As a result , supplies have been running out in the area .
One of the indigenous leaders of the protest group , Alberto Pizango , called a press conference and stated that the Peruvian government has committed genocide with the murder of his indigenous brothers and sisters .
Bloggers and twitterers from across the country are quite concerned and have been tuning in to the recent developments .
Many twitterers are following along to reports from the area , and providing their own opinions about the situation using the hashtag # Bagua :
Jonathan Sanchez @ Maskus :
Pizango no quiere responder por los policias muertos ni la quema de locales # bagua
Pizango does not want to answer about the police officers killed or buildings burned # bagua
@xaxo6v :
# Bagua recuerdan lo que sucedió cuando sacaron a invasores de los bosques de pomac ?
será que hay “ infiltrados ” ?
o policia solo dispara ?
remember what happened when they removed those that invaded the forests of Pomac ?
could there be “ infiltrated ” ?
or do the police just shoot ?

Miguel Angel Tavera pe1us0 :
Ya no hay medicamentos en el hospital , falta de sangre y muchas necesidades más , necesitan mucha ayuda en Bagua Grande .
There are no medicines in the hospital , there is a lack of blood and many more needs , they need much help in Bagua Grande .
In the blogosphere , Isabel of Las Burbujas Recargadas [ es ] writes :
Esto va a acabar mal .
De hecho , ya está yendo bastante mal .
Entre Brack , que ya se vendió descaradamente , y Pizango , a quien no le importa mandar a su gente a que la maten mientras él se esconde haciéndose el interesante , no veo ninguna remota posibilidad de entendimiento .
Mientras , ¿alguien se preocupa por algo más importante que la politiquería y el dinero , o sea , por LAS VIDAS de los nativos y de sus familias ?
Claro que tienen derecho a protestar y defenderse , pero cerrando caminos y sitiando a poblaciones urbanas ( como Yurimaguas ) , no se van a ganar el apoyo de nadie .
Lo único que van a ganar es el odio y la marginación de parte de sus propios paisanos : están acentuando la división nativos - mestizos ,
This will end badly .
In fact , it is already going pretty badly .
Between ( Environmental Minister Antonio ) Brack , who has already sold out , and ( indigenous leader ) Pizango , who does not mind sending his people off to be killed , while he hides , I do not see any remote chance of understanding .
Meanwhile , does anyone care about anything more important than politics and money or for the lives of the indigenous and their families ?
Of course , they have the right to protest and defend themselves , but by blocking roads and placing urban populations under siege ( such as Yurimaguas ) , they are not going to win the support of anyone .
The only thing that will gain is the hatred and marginalization from their own countrymen : they are deepening the divide between indigenous and mestizos
Paco Bardales of Diario de Iqt [ es ] compiles a list of links and will continue to update his blog :
Desafortunado o no , el conflicto amazónico ha tomado un cariz trágico y sangriento .
Los sucesos de Bagua han desbordado , mucho más allá de lo permitido .
Hasta el momento , el enfrentamiento entre habitantes de la zona y miembros de la Policía , en la llamada Curva del Diablo ( luego de que se quemara la gobernación del lugar ) , están dejando un saldo no confirmado aún de 28 civiles muertos y 10 policías .
Unfortunate or not , the Amazonian conflict took a tragic and bloody turn .
The events of Bagua have spilled over , far beyond what is permitted .
So far , the confrontation between the residents of the area and members of the police at Devil 's Curve ( after the governor 's place was burned ) is leaving behind 28 civilian and 10 police deaths , unconfirmed .
In addition to the conflicts in Bagua Grande , clashes are taking place in Jaén in the department of Cajamarca .
Several twitterers have been posting news heard on the radio .
With the seriousness of the situation , many Peruvians are wondering what will happen next .

Recently by Ron Paul : No More Murderous Rip - Offs
Statement before the US House of Representatives opposing resolution on Iran , June 19 , 2009
A Foreign Policy of Fr... Paul , Ron Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 8.85 ( as of 06:20 EST - Details )
I rise in reluctant opposition to H Res 560 , which condemns the Iranian government for its recent actions during the unrest in that country .
While I never condone violence , much less the violence that governments are only too willing to mete out to their own citizens , I am always very cautious about condemning  the actions of governments overseas .
As an elected member of the United States House of Representatives , I have always questioned our constitutional authority to sit in judgment of the actions of foreign governments of which we are not representatives .
I have always hesitated when my colleagues rush to pronounce final judgment on events thousands of miles away about which we know very little .
And we know very little beyond limited press reports about what is happening in Iran .
Of course I do not support attempts by foreign governments to suppress the democratic aspirations of their people , but when is the last time we condemned Saudi Arabia or Egypt or the many other countries where unlike in Iran there is no opportunity to exercise any substantial vote on political leadership ?
It seems our criticism is selective and applied when there are political points to be made .
I have admired President Obama ’s cautious approach to the situation in Iran and I would have preferred that we in the House had acted similarly .
I adhere to the foreign policy of our Founders , who advised that we not interfere in the internal affairs of countries overseas .
I believe that is the best policy for the United States , for our national security and for our prosperity .
I urge my colleagues to reject this and all similar meddling resolutions .

A study by UCI Earth scientists finds that wind energy over the planet 's oceans is a vastly underutilized renewable resource .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Wind energy over the planet 's oceans is a vastly underutilized renewable resource , according to UC Irvine researchers .
At 80 meters above the ocean - the typical wind turbine height - more than 50 percent more power is available than at 10 meters , the height important to the shipping industry upon which previous wind estimates were made .
Though Europe has led the development of offshore wind farms , conditions make U.S. coastal oceans prime for strong winds :
The air is stable , and the water is cold , notes Charlie Zender , study co-author and Earth system science associate professor .
" In the midlatitudes , you find these stable environments where air really takes off and accelerates rapidly as you move away from the ocean 's surface , " he says .
" There 's a lot of power in the wind .
The more we compare it to other energy sources , the more I 'm impressed . "
Ocean wind power has a lot of perks :
It is clean and renewable and takes no land - based real estate - unlike other energy sources , such as coal - powered plants .
Ocean turbines , typically placed in water up to 40 meters deep , can be closer to population centers than power plants , reducing leakage and cost of transmission lines .
And networks of ocean wind farms are as reliable as coal plants at producing consistent levels of power , Zender says .
Offshore wind turbine towers , however , must be anchored to the ocean floor - restricting their distance from the coast - and they cost about 50 percent more than land models , partly because upkeep is more difficult .
" There are issues with every energy resource , " Zender says , " but wind has relatively few compared to coal , ethanol or nuclear power . "
The study by Zender and graduate student Scott Capps is the first to calculate potential wind energy over the ocean at realistic turbine heights .
Researchers started with the previous 10 - meter wind estimates and made adjustments for humidity levels and air and ocean temperatures , which influence wind speed .
With global calculations made twice a day between 2000 and 2006 , they estimated the average global ocean wind power at 841 watts for every square meter swept by turbine rotors .
A single ocean turbine produces about 1 million watts of power , enough to continuously supply about 1,000 houses .
Says Zender : " When you put our research together with existing studies over land , you get - for the first time - a global estimate of wind power reserves . "
The National Science Foundation and NASA supported the study , published recently in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .

Nintendo tried and rejected the motion - sensing technology that Sony and Microsoft are counting on to catch up in the video games wars , the company 's president told the Financial Times .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Nintendo Co Ltd tried and rejected the motion - sensing technology that Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp are counting on to catch up in the video games wars , the company 's president told the Financial Times .
Satoru Iwata told the newspaper in an interview his company had made experimental games controlled by camera - based sensors , but got better results with the accelerometers it chose to use for its Wii console .
The FT said Iwata 's comments throw down the gauntlet to Nintendo 's rivals , both of which announced motion controllers based on cameras this week in an effort to catch up with the Wii 's runaway sales lead .

The British Broadcasting Corporation , a state - sponsored but independently run , media organization has attracted sharp criticism for having " double - standards " in its coverage of the Mumbai terror attacks .
Most times the BBC reporters referred to the terrorists who attacked Mumbai as " gunmen " or " militants " .
Well - known thinker and editor - in - chief of Covert magazine , MJ Akbar has taken up the issue seriously .
Since November 27 , Akbar has refused to appear on BBC to speak about the Mumbai attacks .
Many British politicians have also taken up the issue with the BBC management .
Steve Pound , a British Parliamentarian who represents North Ealing , has issued a strong statement against BBC 's biased policy by saying that it was " the worst sort of mealy - mouthed posturing . "
Akbar , had gone a step ahead and has written a strongly - worded e-mail to Richard Porter , head of Content , BBC World News .
On December 6 , Akbar wrote to Porter that , " I just want to let you know that after decades of friendship and association with the BBC , I refused to give an interview to the BBC over the terrorist outrage in Mumbai .
The reason is simple : I am appalled , astonished , livid at your inability to describe the events in Mumbai as the work of terrorists .
You have called them ' gunmen ' as if they were hired security guards on a night out . "
Akbar further argued that , " When Britain finds a group of men plotting in a home laboratory your government has no hesitation in creating an international storm , and the BBC has no hesitation in calling them terrorists .
When nearly two hundred Indian lives are lost , you cannot find a word in your dictionary more persuasive than ' gunmen ' .
Akbar articulated many Indian fans of the BBC when he said , " You are not only pathetic , but you have become utterly biased in your reporting .
Since we in India believe in freedom of the press , we can do no more than protest , but let me tell you that your credibility , created over long years by fearless and independent journalists like Mark Tully ( I am privileged to describe him as a friend ) , is in tatters and those tatters will not be patched as long as biased non-journalists like you and your superiors are in charge of decisions .
Shame on you and your kind . "
Akbar 's e-mail was not ignored by BBC .
A courteous and very British response did arrive in his mailbox on December 11 .
Porter had argued that , " The guidelines we issue to staff are very clear - we do not ban the use of the word terrorist , but our preference is to use an alternative form of words .
There is a judgement inherent in the use of the word , which is not there when we are more precise with our language .
" Gunman " , or " killer " , or " bomber " , is an accurate description which does not come with any form of judgement .
However , the word is not banned , and is frequently used on our output - usually when attributed to people .
I heard it being used on numerous occasions during our coverage from Mumbai . "
BBC staffers have guidelines which are a public document
Without going into specifics
Porter claimed , " There is no inconsistency in the way the BBC has reported the attacks in Mumbai , compared to what we have done with events in the UK .
If we are to be serious about upholding our policy , then we cannot make a distinction between events in any country . "
In India most critics have pointed out that how BBC termed the July 7 , 2005 attackers in London as " terrorists " without hesitation .
While in case of Mumbai they used " gunmen " and at odd places " suspected terrorist . "
However , Porter , journalist of 27 years standing , argues , " This policy is the opposite of bias ... but it is a difficult one to uphold and is the subject of many discussions within BBC headquarters .
Clearly we had the discussion once again in the wake of the Mumbai attacks -- and comments like yours are taken very seriously by my editorial colleagues . "
In short , the BBC wants its viewers and readers to use their own brains .
Porter wrote , ' I believe those audiences can make their own mind up about the people who carried out the attacks in Mumbai and do n't need us to give them any label to reach that judgement . "
Obviously , Akbar has not accepted these arguments .
After thanking " courteousness " of Porter 's e-mail to him Akbar asked , " But your response does not answer my question : how does the BBC find it easy to define a terrorist when trains and buses in London are attacked , but must slide towards " non-judgmental " definitions when there is a blatant and murderous display of terrorism in Mumbai ?
Are you serious when you say that you leave it to audiences to make up their own minds ?
Then why did you not leave it to audiences to make up their own minds after 9/11 ? "
Akbar , wrote , " I assume the makers of BBC policies , such as they are , understand English .
There is a clear distinction between gunmen and terrorists .
Criminals use guns , and can be called gunmen ; criminals use guns in the service of crime .
Terrorists use guns and worse in the random killing of innocents in pursuit of a political agenda or personal agenda .
The killers who came to Taj and Oberoi and the Chatrapati Shivaji railway station and a home where Jewish people lived , did not come to steal art , or railway property or money .
They came with the declared purpose of murder and mayhem . "
When Akbar was in London , the tabloids were full of headlines about young people being knifed .
Akbar says , " that was crime committed by " knifemen " .
Al Capone was a " gunman " and I am sure the East End of your city once used to produce " gunmen " who committed crimes .
Akbar told Porter , " It is a shame that the BBC cannot see the difference between a criminal and a terrorist , and chooses in fact to protect the terrorist by giving him the camouflage of a criminal .
This is not a matter of semantics .
Terrorists are always happy to fudge the definition . "

If you ’re still embarrassed or worried about the quality of no -frills store brand products or generics instead of those with brand names , face it :
You ’re in the minority now .
In fact , 55 % of grocery shoppers say they frequently purchase store brands , and more than 77 % say the store brands they buy “ are as good as , if not better than , national brand products , ” according to a survey commissioned by the Private Label Manufacturers Association , an organization that represents makers of store brand food , beverages , health and beauty aids and over - the - counter drugs .
And in this economy , it ’s no surprise .
The Store Brand Secret
Many of the national brands actually produce store brand products , so besides the packaging , you may not even notice a difference between generics and their brand name counterparts .
For example , Alcoa ( Stock Quote : AA ) , the maker of Reynolds Wrap Aluminum foil , produces store brand foil .
McCormick produces herbs and spices without its signature label , and Birds Eye , known for its frozen vegetables , produces a number of frozen and canned vegetable products , according to Consumer Reports .
One major reason for the deep discount on store brands is they “ do n’t carry heavy product development , advertising and promotion costs , ” says Tod Marks , a Consumer Reports researcher who blogs by the name “ Tightwad Tod ” on ConsumerReports.org .
What You Save
By choosing store brand products from retailers such as Costco ( Stock Quote : COST ) , Wal - Mart ( Stock Quote : WMT ) and Kroger and Winn - Dixie ( Stock Quote : WINN ) instead of buying national brands , you can save about 30 % per week on the average shopping trip , according to the Private Label Manufacturers Association .
“ Prices may vary from market to market , but the savings that consumers will achieve will follow the same pattern across the country , ” says Brian Sharoff , president of the association .
Buying generic soda instead of Coke ( Stock Quote : KO ) or Pepsi ( Stock Quote : PEP ) can save you between 50 % and 60 % .
So can health and beauty products like aspirin , nasal spray and lotion .
Picking up generic cereal and ice cream could save you more than 30 % .
You can save about 23 % on store brand frozen pizza and more than 25 % on dog food by going generic , according to the association 's data .
Online shoppers can benefit from store brands as well .
Drugstore.com shoppers ( Stock Quote : DSCM ) who buy 24 - hour Claritin pay $ 31 for 45 tablets , but they can get 120 tablets of the Rite Aid ( Stock Quote : RAD ) generic version , loratadine , for a dollar less .
How They Stack Up
Many household products hold up just as well as brand names , according to studies by Consumer Reports .
Kirkland Signature Premium paper towels from Costco work just as well as Bounty , the popular Procter & Gamble brand ( Stock Quote : PG ) , and Great Value Slider food storage bags from Wal - Mart are just as durable as Ziploc Easy Zipper bags made by S.C. Johnson .
In addition to household products , some store brand foods have passed Consumer Reports taste tests , proving that they ’re just as good as national brands .
Instead of Kellogg 's Mini-Wheats , you can try Kroger Mini-Wheats , or instead of Kellogg 's Frosted Flakes , you can opt for Malt - O - Meal Frosted Flakes , Consumer Reports says .
For oatmeal , try Wal - Mart ’s Great Value Quick Oats 100 % Natural or A&P ’s America 's Choice Instant Maple & Brown Sugar oatmeal .
Kroger ’s Self - Rising Crust 4 - cheese Pizza and Winn - Dixie ’s Prestige Premium chocolate ice cream were also highly rated in taste tests .
When Store Brands Do n’t Cut It
If you ’re particular about the tartness of A1 Steak Sauce or the exact flavor of Miracle Whip , generic options may not be right for you .
Store brands that emphasize value may contain cheaper ingredients , and even when national brands manufacture a different type of product to be sold as a store brand , they make it to the store ’s own specifications , which could mean a change in ingredients , Consumer Reports says .
Check the ingredients list , take a look at the product itself if you can and decide what qualities you ’re willing to give up for the savings .
And If you ’re partial to Kleenex Cottonelle toilet paper with Aloe and Vitamin E , you may not be able to find a suitable generic .
But if you ’re really trying to cut back on spending , the store brand may be good enough .

He was carrying a pocket edition of the U.S. Constitution and an iPhone capable of making audio recordings .
And he used them .
Steve Bierfeldt is accusing the Transportation Security Administration of " harassing interrogation . "
On a recording a TSA agent can be heard berating Bierfeldt .
One sample : " You want to play smartass , and I 'm not going to play your f**king game . "
Bierfeldt is director of development for the Campaign for Liberty , an outgrowth of the Ron Paul presidential campaign .
He was returning from a regional conference March 29 when TSA screeners at Lambert - St. Louis ( Missouri ) International Airport saw a metal cash box in his carry - on bag .
Inside was more than $ 4,700 dollars in cash -- proceeds from the sale of political merchandise like T - shirts and books .
There are no restrictions on carrying large sums of cash on flights within the United States , but the TSA allegedly took Bierfeldt to a windowless room and , along with other law enforcement agencies , questioned him for almost half an hour about the money .
The American Civil Liberties Union has taken up Bierfeldt 's cause and is suing Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano , whose department includes the TSA .
Their complaint alleges that Bierfeldt was " subjected to harassing interrogation , and unlawfully detained . "
Larry Schwartztol of the ACLU said the TSA is suffering from mission creep .
" We think what happened to Mr. Bierfeldt is a reflection that TSA believes passenger screening is an opportunity to engage in freewheeling law enforcement investigations that have no link to flight safety , " he said .
Schwartztol believes many other passengers have been subjected to the same kind of treatment , which he claims violates constitutional protections against unlawful searches .
The TSA would n't comment on the lawsuit , but said in a statement that the movement of large amounts of cash through a checkpoint may be investigated " if suspicious activity is suspected . "
Unbeknownst to the TSA agents , Bierfieldt had activated the record application on his phone and slipped it into his pocket .
It captured the entire conversation .
An excerpt :
Officer :
Why do you have this money ?
That 's the question , that 's the major question .
Bierfeldt : Yes , sir , and I 'm asking whether I 'm legally required to answer that question .
Officer : Answer that question first , why do you have this money .
Bierfeldt :
Am I legally required to answer that question ?
Officer : So you refuse to answer that question ?
Bierfeldt :
No , sir , I am not refusing .
Officer : Well , you 're not answering .
Bierfeldt : I 'm simply asking my rights under the law .
The officers can be heard saying they will involve the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration , and appear to threaten arrest , saying they are going to transport Bierfeldt to the local police station , in handcuffs if necessary .
Bierfeldt told CNN he believes their behavior was inappropriate .
" You 're in a locked room with no windows .
You 've got TSA agent .
You 've got police officers with loaded guns .
They 're in your face .
A few of them were swearing at me . "
But the officers did not follow through on their threats .
Near the end of the recording an additional officer enters the situation and realizes the origins of the money .
Officer :
So these are campaign contributions for Ron Paul ?
Bierfeldt : Yes , sir .
Officer : You 're free to go .
According to the TSA , " Passengers are required to cooperate with the screening process .
Cooperation may involve answering questions about their property .
A passenger who refuses to answer questions may be referred to appropriate authorities for further inquiry "
Bierfeldt contends he never refused to answer a question , he only sought to clarify his constitutional rights .
" I asked them , ' Am I required by law to tell you what you 're asking me ?
Am I required to tell you where I am working ?
Am I required to tell you how I got the cash ?
Nothing I 've done is suspicious .
I 'm not breaking any laws .
I just want to go to my flight .
Please advise me as to my rights . '
And they did n't . "
The TSA says disciplinary action has been taken against one of its employees for inappropriate tone and language .

A West Yorkshire couple who abused their six - week - old daughter and failed to get medical help for her broken bones and meningitis have been jailed .
Rizwan Patel , 27 , and Alliah Bradshaw , 29 , of Hebden Bridge , pleaded guilty to child cruelty at an earlier hearing at Bradford Crown Court .
The court heard the baby was left brain - damaged , blind and deaf due to a lack of medical attention .
Patel was jailed for four - and - a- half years and Bradshaw for three years .
Patel had also pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm after admitting shaking his daughter so hard " in a fit of temper " he broke nine of her ribs and her collar bone .
' Obvious pain '
The judge who jailed the couple described their actions as " inexplicable , deplorable and indefensible " .
The court heard the baby was placed on the Child Protection Register after Bradshaw , a drug addict , had two other children in her care taken from her for neglect and ill - treatment .
The girl , known as Baby H for legal reasons , was born addicted to drugs because of her mother 's drug problem and suffered withdrawal symptoms in the days following her birth .
The court heard social services from Calderdale Council were " determined to keep a watchful eye " on the child but it was deemed " appropriate " for her to remain with the couple on her release from hospital .
She is condemned to a future of suffering , she will need constant and indefinite care
Judge Jonathan
Rose on the victim Health and support workers visited regularly and advised Patel and Bradshaw to take their daughter to hospital for an X - ray on her legs when she was in " obvious and demonstrable pain " .
But the couple failed to take her and lied to the professionals about booking an appointment .
Patel admitted shaking Baby H one evening when Bradshaw went out to buy drugs and did not come home until the following morning .
He said he was anxious about Bradshaw and became angry when his daughter would not stop crying .
The couple did not initially seek medical attention for these injuries or when Baby H became increasingly unwell , vomiting and passing blood .
Patel eventually took her to the doctor .
Cerebral palsy Baby H was immediately rushed to hospital in an ambulance , where she was diagnosed with septicaemia and meningitis , as well as fractures to her legs , ribs and collar bone .
Sentencing the couple , Judge Jonathan
Rose said : " These actions were inexplicable , deplorable and indefensible .
" The consequences of her untreated illnesses was that this baby suffered brain damage , she has blindness , she has deafness , she has required surgical intervention , she has cerebral palsy .
" The real suffering is to come for a long time in the future because her life has been effectively ruined .
She is condemned to a future of suffering , she will need constant and indefinite care . "
A serious case review is currently being carried out into the neglect of Baby H and is due to be published later this year .

We ’ve released Ruby on Rails version 2.3.3 .
This release fixes a lot of bugs and introduces a handful of new features .
Active Record
touch is a convenient method to update a record ’s timestamp and nothing else .
This is extracted from apps whose models “ touch ” others when they change , such as a comment updating the parent .
replies_changed_at timestamp after save and destroy .
Timestamping an entire has_many association makes it easy to build a key for fragment caching that covers changes to the parent object and any of its children .
This pattern is wrapped up as belongs_to : parent , : touch => :replies_changed_at .
When the child changes , parent.replies_changed_at is touched .
: touch => true is defaults to : touch => :updated_at .

leaner user - facing encoding API .
Since a JSON libraries implement to_json with varying compatibility , safely overriding it is difficult .
Most custom to_json looks like def to_json(*encoder_specific_args ) { : some => " json representation " }.to_json(*encoder_specific_args ) end so we DRYed the user - facing API down to a more natural def as_json ( options = { } ) { : some => " json representation " } end without the ugly internal state exposed by overloading to_json as both public - facing and internal builder API .
Rails 3 splits the API explicitly , so prepare now by switching from to_json to as_json .

Notable Bug Fixes
( CNN ) -- Former death row inmate Paul House woke to laughter and cries of joy from his mother on Tuesday , the day he learned he was a free man .
Former death row inmate Paul House and his mother , Joyce , in her Crossville , Tennessee , home .
" You 've been exonerated , " his mother , Joyce House , told him , shaking him awake .
" Took 'em long enough , " he replied , after taking a moment to process the information .
House , 47 , spent 22 years on Tennessee death row for the rape and murder of his neighbor , Carolyn Muncey , in 1985 .
He left prison last year and was placed under house arrest after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that new DNA evidence could have led a jury to acquit him .
He was scheduled to be retried next month when Union County District Attorney Paul Phillips announced Tuesday that he filed a petition to drop all charges against House .
In the petition , Phillips said he still believes House was involved in Muncey 's death , but acknowledged the DNA evidence presented significant reasonable doubt .
His mother received the news Tuesday morning in a phone call from an assistant to her son 's lawyer .
" At first , I could n't believe it , but my mom would n't lie to me , " House said in a telephone interview from their home in Crossville , Tennessee .
" I did n't know what to think , there were so many times I thought they 'd given up on me . "
House cleared of murder »
His mother says the news did n't come as a huge surprise , after several DNA tests failed to match his DNA to samples found under Muncey 's fingernails and on her clothes .
" They say the wheels of justice turn mighty slow , but for them to turn this slow is ridiculous , " she said .
Her son also remains unimpressed with the justice system .
" I never had any real feelings about the justice system until these idiots got a hold of me , and now it 's very low , " he said .
" I can tell you truthfully that there 's nothing I miss about prison . "
District Attorney Paul Phillips wrote in his petition this week that he still believes
House could have been convicted again in a new trial , " but the new evidence ( including the forensic examinations ) raises a reasonable doubt that he acted alone and the possibility that others were involved in the crime . "
But Phillips noted the " substantial sentence "
House has served as another reason for the charges being dropped now .
The former death row inmate , who suffers from multiple sclerosis , moved in with his mother in July , after he was released on bail .
His time out of prison appears to have buoyed his health .
His mother says talking to him has helped sharpen his mind , and he now thinks faster and talks clearer than he did back in July .
Yet his condition keeps his body confined to a wheelchair and his aspirations relatively modest .
When he learned about his exoneration , his first concern was when he could remove the ankle bracelet that monitored him under house arrest , he says .
Next up , he says he is looking forward to visiting his grandfather in California , who will celebrate his 90th birthday this summer .
" I guess all I want to do is go out and see my grandpa , mom 's dad , " House said , giggling .
" Grandpa 's all right , I was named after him . "
He and his mother will make the cross-country drive in June to see his grandfather , who he last saw 10 years ago in a prison visit .
The group will also stop in Arkansas to visit the grave of House 's grandmother , who died while he was in prison .
His exoneration also frees his mother , who had to make sure someone was in the home with him at all times , as part of the terms of his house arrest .
" It was like we were both in prison , " she said .
" To go to the grocery store or get a haircut , I had to call someone , but the grocery store 's 5 minutes away .
The hardest thing was to call someone for 15 minutes .
I felt like I was cutting into their day . "
Otherwise , House says his routine of watching his favorite game show , The Weakest Link , and eating his mother 's delicious chili verde will remain mostly unchanged .
" This gives me a life .
The only life I had was prison life , and that was nothing to be happy about . "
CNN Supreme Court Producer Bill Mears contributed to this report .
All About Capital Punishment • Criminal Sentencing and Punishment • Multiple Sclerosis • Tennessee
Last week , Canadian Governor - General * Michaëlle Jean caused a huge storm in the media by eating a piece of seal heart while on a visit to an Inuit community in Nunavut , northern Canada .
In the context of increasing international ( and domestic ) outrage against the seal hunt in Canada , Jean had this to say about her act ( all quotes from this article ) :
“ These are ancient practices that are part of a way of life , ” Jean said , framing her gutsy gesture as an act of solidarity with the Inuit .
“ If you ca n’t understand that , you ’re completely missing the reality of life here . ”
( For those of you wondering what on earth this has to do with Muslim women , do n’t worry , I ’ll get to it . )
Enter PETA ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals . )
Let me be clear that I am a strong advocate that animals should be treated ethically , and that I do n’t oppose the objectives of an organisation like PETA .
Their methods , on the other hand , are horribly problematic , and PETA has come under criticism time and time again for campaigns involving offensive representations of slavery , the Holocaust , the KKK , non-status immigrants , and women ( several times over . )
( Warning that some of the linked articles contain partial nudity and / or images of torture of humans and animals . )
PETA ’s response to Jean eating the seal meat was predictable :
“ It amazes us that a Canadian official would indulge such blood lust .
It sounds like she ’s trying to give Canadians an even more Neanderthal image around the world than they already have , ” said Dan Mathews , vice - president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals .
After essentially labelling traditional Inuit hunting practices as “ blood lust ” and Neanderthalic , the PETA spokesperson claimed that the indigenous people ’s hunt was not the main target of their anti-seal - hunting campaign .
However , as the article then tells us ,
That does n’t mean animal - rights activists approve of Inuit seal - hunting traditions .
PETA yesterday likened Jean ’s sampling of seal heart to “ taking part in the beating of women in the Middle East because it is part of local practice . ” ( emphasis mine )
Yeah .
So what we can learn from PETA is that :
1 . The Middle East is the only place where beating of women happens .
2. Beating of women is an integral part of Middle Eastern cultural practices .
( You know , they ’ve probably got it on all their travel brochures .
“ Come visit the Middle East , and celebrate our cultural pride by taking part in the time - honoured tradition of woman - beating ! ” )
Do I even have to go into all the ways that that ’s wrong and offensive ?
It ’s as if people have these images of oppressed Middle Eastern women ( usually interchangeable with Muslim women , of course ) just waiting around in their heads so that they can be expressed in metaphors that are completely out of context .
Sigh …
* The Governor - General is the representative of the Queen of England – Canada ’s official Head of State – in Canada .
Although this places her in an officially powerful position , the reality of a constitutional monarchy means that she is basically just a figurehead .
I ’ll save you all my rant about why it ’s problematic that Canada celebrates having women of colour GGs while having pathetically low representation of them in parliament .
NEW YORK -- Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals is the most - watched NHL game in 36 years .
The Pittsburgh Penguins ' championship - clinching 2 - 1 win over the Detroit Red Wings on NBC on Friday night averaged 8 million viewers .
The network said Monday that 's the most since Game 6 of the 1973 Stanley Cup finals between Montreal and Chicago .
Game 7 earned a 4.3 rating and 8 share .
It was the highest rating for a series - ending game since Game 7 of the 2003 Anaheim - New Jersey series .
The rating is the percentage of all homes with televisions tuned into a program , while the share is the percentage of all TVs in use at the time .

This is really pathetic .
When I tell people here about Americans fearing financial ruin when they get sick they look at me as though I am from Mars .
This was exactly what happened when my father was diagnosed with cancer .
Even though he had insurance he was still worried that somehow it would not be covered and he would leave his wife of 43 years with nothing but debt .
Like others , he heard horror stories of high costs and lack of coverage so he made an irrational decision and went with treatment at the VA , which was about as bad as advertised .
Medical bills are involved in more than 60 percent of U.S. personal bankruptcies , an increase of 50 percent in just six years , U.S. researchers reported Thursday .
More than 75 percent of these bankrupt families had health insurance but still were overwhelmed by their medical debts , the team at Harvard Law School , Harvard Medical School and Ohio University reported in the American Journal of Medicine .
“ Using a conservative definition , 62.1 percent of all bankruptcies in 2007 were medical ; 92 percent of these medical debtors had medical debts over $ 5,000 , or 10 percent of pretax family income , ” the researchers wrote .
“ Most medical debtors were well - educated , owned homes and had middle - class occupations . ”
The researchers , whose work was paid for by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , said the share of bankruptcies that could be blamed on medical problems rose by 50 percent from 2001 to 2007 .
Any negotiations with the medical industry is going to be brutal and if it ’s not , it probably means the end result will be terrible .
Another horrible part of this story is what happens to those who become sick with something serious .
The statistics ( which are inside the link ) are grim .
Insurance companies move quickly to throw trouble makers ( i.e. people who bother to use their insurance ) out leaving them with even more limited options .
Maybe the health care initiative will work out but so far I still do n’t see much stomach for the fight .
I see Democrats caving so they can avoid they do n’t anger anyone in business .
Tough luck for consumers / voters who do n’t have the lobbying power to match the deep pockets of the medical industry .
Those profits had to go somewhere , after all .
Thanks to a partnership with Netflix , Sony Electronics ’
Internet - capable Bravia televisions will be able to stream Netflix movies starting this fall .
That ’s great news for Bravia owners , but I want to know whether Sony ever intends to bring Netflix to the Playstation 3 .
The odds of finding out for sure are admittedly slim , so let ’s take a look at what ’s been said to determine the likelyhood :
The chatter began last year , shortly after Netflix came to the Xbox 360 as part of a major interface update .
John Koller , director of hardware marketing for the Playstation , told GamePro in December that the PS3 would focus on rentals and downloads .
He cited a focus group in which participants were n’t enthused about Netflix on the Xbox 360 , because they could just as easily watch movies on their laptops .
Sounds fishy to me , but for our purposes it ’s a vote of no Netflix interest on Sony ’s part .
In February , Sony got downright nasty , responding to Microsoft ’s boasts of one million Netflix sign - ups on the Xbox 360 .
In a rebuttal , Sony passed around a list of bullet points explaining why its service is better .
Chalk this up as another sign Netflix is n’t coming to the PS3 .
But then , there were some glimmers of hope .
March saw a survey asking Netflix subscribers whether they ’d stream to their PS3s if all it took was a $ 10 streaming disc that somehow handled the job .
The next month , a Netflix job posting sought an engineer to build out the service on gaming consoles , prompting a Netflix spokesman to say that “ for now , ” console streaming is exclusive to the Xbox 360 .
Finally , in May , another Netflix survey appeared , but without the $ 10 streaming disc fee , and with the possibility of Wii streaming as well .
Which brings us to today .
The stars are ever - closer to aligning , but there are barriers .
For starters , we do n’t know whether Microsoft has Netflix locked in an exclusive console arrangement .
Ignoring that , it ’d take some serious pride - swallowing for Sony to follow Microsoft in such obvious fashion .
And there ’s evidence that Sony ’s doing just fine without Netflix anyway .
In short , I ’m not counting on PS3 Netflix support anytime soon .

A federal judge in Pennsylvania has granted a temporary restraining order to prevent a district attorney from charging three teenage girls with the production of child pornography for allowing someone to take photos of them in states of undress .
In his ruling ( . pdf ) the judge seemed to agree with the plaintiffs that the images in question do not qualify as child pornography .
At issue in the case are photos seized from student cellphones last year by officials of the Tunkhannock School District in Wyoming County , Pennsylvania .
The practice of taking nude or semi-nude self - portraits and distributing them via a cellphone or the internet has come to be called " sexting " and has resulted in teens being arrested in a number of states under child porn production , distribution and possession charges .
The Tunkhannock case involves two photos depicting the three girls .
One photo of Marissa Miller and Grace Kelly shows them two years ago at age 13 lying side by side while one talks on the phone and the other makes a peace sign with her fingers , according to the ACLU complaint .
The two are photographed from the waist up and are wearing white opaque bras .
A second photo shows a girl referred to in the court document as " Jane Doe " photographed outside a shower with a towel wrapped around her waist .
Her breasts are bared .
Wyoming County District Attorney George Skumanick , Jr. , had threatened to charge the girls with being accomplices to the production of child pornography unless they agreed to six - month probation , drug - testing and participation in a five - week educational program to discuss why what they did was wrong .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania sued the district attorney on behalf of the teens and their parents on grounds that the DA was violating their civil rights .
The plaintiffs said the images did n't qualify as child pornography under Pennsylvania 's laws and therefore the prosecutor was prohibiting their free expression to take photos of themselves .
They also claimed the attempt to force the parents to put the girls in an educational program violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights .
U.S. District Court Judge James M. Munley granted the temporary restraining order on grounds that the plaintiffs stand a reasonable chance of winning their suit against the prosecutor .
The judge did n't comment on the merits of their claims against the prosecutor other than to say that the " plaintiffs make a reasonable argument that the images presented to the court do not appear to qualify in any way as depictions of prohibited sexual acts . "
" We are grateful the judge recognized that prosecuting our clients for non-sexually explicit photographs raises serious constitutional questions , " said Witold Walczack , legal director for the ACLU of Pennsylvania , in a statement .
" This country needs to have a discussion about whether prosecuting minors as child pornographers for merely being impulsive and naive is the appropriate way to address the serious consequences that can result from sexting . ”
Walczack told Threat Level that during the hearing the judge had looked at the two photos in question and asked the lawyers representing the defendant , " I just want to be clear that these are the two photos that are illegal ? "
" He had sort of this incredulous tone in his voice , " Walczack said .
" I think there is an important message for prosecutors that they need to be careful about threatening child porn charges when you do n't really have child porn . "
Skumanick was not available for comment .
The district attorney is up for re-election in May .
A hearing to address the plaintiffs ' request for a preliminary injunction will be held June 2 .

UPDATED at 5:45 PM to include Lake / HCAN poll
A major , though by no means the only , substantive point of debate regarding health care reform is whether the plan considered by Congress will include a “ public option ” — a government - run insurance program that would compete with private plans .
Barack Obama ’s plan on the campaign trail included a public option : “ any American will have the opportunity to enroll in the new public plan or an approved private plan , ” it said .
Inclusion of a public option is a sine qua non for many progressives , who believe it would lower costs by increasing competition , or who may have an objection to the notion of requiring that people ( since health care would have an individual mandate ) purchase something through a private , for - profit entity .
On the other hand , the public option has drawn the ire of conservatives and industry groups , who believe that it would gobble up profit margins from private industry and that it might have unfair competitive advantages .
Both liberals and conservatives seem to acknowledge some possibility that a public option might gradually evolve into a version of a single - payer system ; for liberals this is a big plus and for conservatives a big minus .
The revised plan released by Max Baucus ’s Senate Finance Committee on Thursday did not include a public option , although the House ’s latest version does .
It is worth evaluating polling on the public option , which has begun to be widely cited in the blogosphere , particularly by liberals who believe most of the polling favors them .
The balance of this post contains a summary of the five six polls that I am aware of on the public option , which produce widely disparate results and all of which require careful interpretation .
1. Kaiser Family Foundation Tracking Poll
Who They Are / What ’s Their Angle : A California based non-profit founded in 1948 by Henry J. Kaiser .
The Foundation no longer has any association with Kaiser Permanente , which operates hospitals and insurance programs mostly in the South and the West .
KFF released numerous materials on the candidates ’ positions on health care in advance of the 2008 election which generally took a neutral tone .
KFF itself has not given money to political candidates , although its employees collectively donated $ 11,700 in 2008 and $ 9,550 in 2006 to Judith Feder , a public policy expert who is an adviser to KFF and ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Democrat in Virginia ’s 10th Congressional District .
Specifications : 1,205 American adults , including cellphone and Spanish - language samples , conducted from June 1 - June 8 .
The sample was split in half , however , for the two formulations of the public option question as expressed below , and so sample sizes for each one are closer to 600 .
Question Wording and Results :
“ Now I ’m going to read you some different ways to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance .
As I read each one , please tell me whether you would favor it or oppose it [… ]
“ Creating a public health insurance option similar to Medicare to compete with private health insurance plans . ”
Favor : 68 % ( 40 % strongly favor )
Oppose : 28 % ( 17 % strongly oppose )
“ Creating a public health insurance option to compete with private health insurance plans . ”
Favor : 65 % ( 32 % strongly favor )
Oppose : 29 % ( 17 % strongly oppose )
Discussion :
One suspects that KFF is pro-reform , but they seem to have taken care to frame their materials in ways that avoid partisan scrutiny .
Their question wording is fairly straightforward but does not include the phrase “ government ” , which might provide more clarity to the respondent about exactly what the public option is .
Note , however , that they phrase the question in two different ways : to half their sample they include the phrase “ similar to Medicare ” and to the other half they do n’t .
Responses were about the same between the two question wordings , although the half that had the Medicare language included were notably more likely to strongly favor the public option .
Including a sample of cellphones and Spanish - language interviewers are nice perks .
Although the sample sizes are not huge , particularly since the sample was split into halves , KFF found nearly identical results in their April tracking poll .

2. Employee Benefits Research Institute ( EBRI )
Who They Are / What ’s Their Angle : A Washington , D.C. – based nonprofit , which is focused — as their name implies — on research on employee benefit programs .
I can find no evidence of lobbying activities or campaign contributions by ERBI .
They are funded by a largely corporate set of donors such as American Express , Chevron , IBM , Shell Oil and Towers Perrin , although they also receive financing from noncorporate groups like AARP and Blue Cross Blue Shield .
An issue brief that EBRI prepared on the public option was neutral to slightly skeptical about it .
The poll was conducted in conjunction with Mathew Greenwald & Associates .
Specifications : 1,000 American adults aged 21 and over .
Interviews conducted from May 8th through June 2nd .
Question Wording and Results :
“ Creating a new public health insurance plan that anyone can purchase . ”
Support : 83 % ( 53 % strongly support )
Oppose : 14 % ( 9 % strongly oppose )
Discussion : Information about this poll was a little bit harder to come by than it probably should be .
For example , I had to look in a separate press release to find details about its sample size .
Nor is it clear that the entire battery of questions was released in ERBI ’s summary brief .
The selection of adults 21 + , rather than 18 + , is also unorthodox , and is a strange enough choice that I wonder about the other decisions ERBI made in constructing its sample .
EBRI ’s poll was also the only one which did not specify that the public option would be designed to compete with private plans .

Who They Are / What ’s Their Angle : Not a labor union ; Consumers ’ Union is instead a Yonkers , NY - based non-profit group and the publisher of Consumer Reports .
They take a somewhat unabashedly liberal view on health care reform and the poll was released in conjunction with Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer .
The Consumers Union ’ generally spends several hundred thousand dollars on lobbying activities each year .
Specifications : 2,009 American adults aged 18 and over .
Interviews conducted from April 2nd to April 6th , 2009 .
Question Wording and Results :
“ Congress is discussing several ideas to address healthcare reform .
One proposal provides everyone , whether insured or uninsured , an additional choice : the option of a public health plan that people can count on to cover what they need at more affordable rates .
This option would allow people with good insurance that they like to keep it .
Those without good insurance can gain access to reliable healthcare , regardless of preexisting medical conditions , and obtain a consistent menu of benefits .
This public plan would be paid for by enrollees .
Those that cannot afford to pay the full premiums would be subsidized based on their income .
Please rate your level of support for this proposal . ”
Support : 66 % ( 33 % strongly support )
Oppose : 16 % ( 8 % strongly oppose )
Discussion :
This is more or less an explicitly partisan poll , both in terms of the organization backing it and in its question wording , which is leading and highly favorable to the public option .
The large sample size is nice , but Consumers Union ’ should have picked more neutral phrasing .

Who They Are / What ’s Their Angle : Regular readers of this website will be very familiar with Rasmussen Reports , a standalone polling firm that releases a prolific amount of polling data on elections and public policy issues .
Past FiveThirtyEight.com analyses have generally found Rasmussen ’s electoral polling to be quite reliable .
However , some observers have questioned its issue - based polling , which frequently tends to elicit responses that are more conservative than those found on other national surveys .
Rasmussen Reports ’ founder , Scott Rasmussen , is a Republican , although neither he nor Rasmussen Reports have appear to have contributed to political candidates in recent years .
Nor to my awareness does Rasmussen Reports conduct a significant amount of polling directly on behalf of political candidates .
Specifications : 1,000 American adults on June 12th and 13th .
Assuming that procedures here were the same as for other Rasmussen polling , surveys were conducted via the IVR ( “ robocall ” ) method and were weighted for partisan identification and other factors .
Question Wording and Results :
“ Would it be a good idea to set up a government health insurance company to compete with private health insurance companies ? ”
Yes : 41 %
No : 41 %
Discussion : I am not particularly fond of this question wording .
For one thing , unlike the other polls , it focuses on the action of setting up the “ government health insurance company ” rather than the choice of insurance plans this ultimately presents to the consumer .
For another , it is not clear that a new program would have to be “ set up ” in order to provide for a public option ( i.e. an existing program like Medicare could be expanded ) , nor that any such entity would properly be described as a “ company ” .
The poll seems designed to juxtapose the terms “ government ” and “ company ” in a way that might elicit a negative response .
( Note that I actually like the inclusion of the term “ government ” in conjunction with , or perhaps instead of , the term “ public ” .
The problem is not with the term “ government ” itself but instead with the overall way that the question is phrased . )

5. NBC / Wall Street Journal
Who They Are / What ’s Their Angle : Presumably you are familiar with NBC News and the Wall Street Journal .
The NBC / WSJ polls themselves are conducted by Hart / McInturff , a pairing of Democratic pollster Peter Hart and Republican pollster Bill McInturff .
Likewise , the NBC / WSJ pairing itself is a collaboration between a somewhat left - leaning and somewhat right - leaning news organization .
This is an excellent model to avoid partisanship , both in appearance and in practice .
Specifications : 1,008 American adults on June 12th - 15th , including a cellphone sample .
Question Wording and Results :
“ In any health care proposal , how important do you feel it is to give people a choice of both a public plan administered by the federal government and a private plan for their health insurance – –extremely important , quite important , not that important , or not at all important ?
Extremely Important : 41 %
Quite Important : 35 % ( 76 % Extremely or Quite Important )
Not That Important : 12 %
Not At All Important : 8 % ( 20 % Not That or Not At All Important )
Discussion : I have no problem with the formulation of the question ; in fact , I particularly like the wording “ a public plan administered by the federal government ” which makes clear that the public plan is in fact government - run .
But I have a big problem with the choice of answers .
“ Importance ” is a notoriously vague concept in public opinion polling and may be separate and distinct from asking someone whether or not they support a particular policy .
How might someone respond to this question , for instance , if they had particularly strong feelings against a public option ?
Would they say that it was “ not at all important ” , or would they say that it was “ extremely important ” ?
Conversely , how would someone respond if they had a weak preference for a public option , but did n’t consider it an especially important component of health care reform ?
The 1,008 random adults that NBC / WSJ surveyed are going to interpret these dilemmas in a variety of different ways .
In addition , the particular category of “ quite important ” is somewhat ambiguous and probably falls somewhere in between a favorable response and a neutral one .

6. Lake Research / HCAN
Who They Are / What ’s Their Angle : Lake Research Partners is a Democratic polling firm .
Their poll was conducted on behalf of Health Care for America Now ! ( HCAN ) , an advocacy group that wants comprehensive health care reform and strongly favors the public option .
Specifications : Sample of 800 likely voters from January 8- 13th , 2009 .
Question Wording and Results :
“ Which of the following three approaches to health care reform do you prefer : one , everyone getting health insurance through private health insurance plans ; two , everyone getting health insurance through a public health insurance plan ; or three , everyone having a choice of private health insurance or a public health insurance plan ? ”
73 % choice of public or private
15 % private only
9 % public only
Discussion : Celinda
Lake is an excellent pollster , but she is a Democratic pollster and this is a Democratic poll .
I do n’t hate the question wording , but it really emphasizes the option part of the public option and somewhat de-emphasizes the public part ; in this sense , it is sort of the alter ego to the Rasmussen poll .
As in some of these other polls , it also may not be immediately obvious to the respondent that “ public ” means administered by the government .
A couple of additional points of critique : the use of a likely voter model ( as opposed to all adults or registered voters ) is a bit unusual this far out of an election cycle , particularly when it regards how the public feels about a particular policy rather than how they want their elected officials to vote on it .
And the poll is now a bit outdated , having been conducted in January .

Summary :
The only poll I have a particularly high degree of confidence in is the Kaiser Family Foundation poll , which finds that between 65 and 68 percent of the public support a public option depending on how the question is phrased .
The only thing I would change about their poll is to specify , as NBC / WSJ does , that the public plan would be administered by the government .
The other polls have one or more characteristics that give me pause about them .
The question wording in the Consumers Union ’ poll is push-y and explicitly partisan ; the question wording in the Rasmussen and Lake / HCAN polls is strange and probably implicitly partisan .
The NBC / WSJ poll is otherwise terrific , but very difficult to interpret because they ask people about the importance of a public option , and not necessarily their support for one .
I might be more comfortable with the ERBI poll if I learned more about it , but the comparative lack of disclosure coupled with the unusual choice to exclude adults 18 - 20 from the sample and a result that appears to be a mild outlier gives me some concerns about it .
Overall , polling points toward the public option being at least mildly popular and indeed perhaps quite popular .
But more polling is required on this question , particularly by the news organizations and other unaffiliated groups like Pew and Gallup , and more care should be taken to frame both questions and answers in a neutral and informative way .
Congressional committees heard a lot this month about the devious schemes used by health insurance companies to drop or shortchange sick patients .
It was a damning portrait  and one Americans know from painful personal experience  of an industry that all too often puts profits ahead of patients .
As health care reform moves forward , Congress must impose tighter regulation of companies that clearly are not doing enough to regulate themselves .
Creating a public plan could also help restrain the worst practices , by providing competition and an alternative .
A House oversight subcommittee took a close look at a particularly shameful practice known as “ rescission , ” in which insurance companies cancel coverage for some sick policyholders rather than pay an expensive claim .
The companies contend that rescissions are rare .
But Congressional investigators found that three big insurers canceled about 20,000 individual policies over a five - year period  allowing them to avoid paying more than $ 300 million in medical claims .
The companies typically argue that the policyholders withheld information about pre-existing conditions that would have disqualified them from coverage .
But the subcommittee unearthed cases where the pre-existing conditions were trivial , or unrelated to the claim , or not known to the patient .
When executives for the three companies were asked if they would be willing to limit rescissions to cases where the policyholder deliberately lied on an application form , all said they would not .
This tactic will not be ended voluntarily .
A couple of Sundays ago , my 9 - year - old daughter caught me bicycling in my own private Idaho .
" Daddy ! " she yelped as we pedaled through a quiet neighborhood on our bikes , " You did n't stop ! "
The kid knows what a stop sign looks like .
So do I .
But the uncomfortable truth , as a parent and someone who dishes out weekly commuting advice , is that I tend to treat those red octagons as yield signs when on my bike .
5 things to know about your commute
Bicyclists who think they 're pedaling against " The Man "
The Bicycle Transportation Alliance puts the chances of the Idaho Stop becoming law in Oregon this year at 50 - 50 .
Over at BikePortland.org , they 're blaming slanted coverage in the mainstream media for putting the effort in jeopardy .
But Karl Rohde , the alliance 's former chief lobbyist , says a bigger problem is the cyclists who left nasty messages for lawmakers during a recent debate over registering bikes .
" Some of them were appalling , " he says .
One lawmaker told Rohde that a bike advocate called to tell him " you 've probably never been on a bike , you fat ( bleep ) . "
Yeah , that does n't help .
10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil
Those are the hours during which drivers may legally run red lights in order to avoid being carjacked .
A little extra brain food for those motorists who oppose tinkering with stop - sign laws so that they better reflect the realities of the road .

Is it GPS envy ?
After I bought my wife a TomTom navigator for the Volvo last week , we found ourselves disagreeing over which electronic voice should tell us when and where to turn .
There 's a full menu of voices .
She likes the sound of " Tim , " a bloke with a British accent who sounds like Colin Firth .
Me ?
I 'm partial to " Kathy " and her sweet Irish accent .
I 'm learning to live with Tim .
Speed demons on Oregon 217
Beaverton police wrote 145 speeding tickets and issued 116 warnings in a 1.5 - mile construction zone along 217 .
Crews will be working on the $ 35.6 million highway - widening project for the next 18 months .
Let 's slow down , folks .
Mill Plain exit on Interstate 205 northbound
The project to build a connector to Northeast 112th Avenue from the I -205 off - ramp to westbound Mill Plain is coming along nicely .
One thing to watch for this week : Daytime flagging , as crews try to get big trucks in and out of the construction zone .
On busy roads and at red lights , I come to complete stops .
But on side streets dotted with stop signs , I slow , look and roll .
Write me a ticket .
Send hate mail .
Call me a bad example .
But if I lived in the Great Potato state , I could tell my little girl that I was simply following the law .
And after taking a hard look at the history of the so - called Idaho Stop , I 'd tell her it's a darn good law .
Of course , we live in Oregon , where the Legislature is once again caught in a debate over the merits of adopting the Idaho Stop here .
Under the proposal , bicyclists would n't have to fully stop at a sign or blinking red light , provided they slow to a safe speed and yield to traffic or pedestrians .
Supporters say it legalizes what is already safe and rational behavior .
Opponents counter that bikes should follow the same laws as cars and that it sends a dangerous message to kids .
" Listening to some people , " said Karl Rohde , who was the Bicycle Transportation Alliance 's government relations director before leaving the organization Friday , " you 'd almost think there are no living children left in Idaho -- that kids are being run down left and right . "
Actually , the children of Idaho are riding happily and unscathed .
In fact , according to new research from the University of California 's School of Public Health in Berkeley , the law has made roadways safer , while getting more people to commute by bike .
Carl Bianchi , a retired administrative director of Idaho 's state courts who is widely considered the father of the Idaho Stop , said it was traffic judges -- not cyclists -- who pushed for the idea in 1982 .
Police were ticketing bike riders for failing to come to a complete , foot - down stop .
Judges , however , saw " technical violations " clogging up their courts .
" We recognized that the realities of bicycling were a lot different than driving a car , " Bianchi said .
Sure , Idahoans had many of the same concerns that are now popping up in Salem .
But the year after the Idaho Stop became law , bicycle injuries in the state actually declined by 14.5 percent .
Meanwhile , in the past 27 years , Idaho motorists and police have grown to accept the legislation as sensible public policy , said Jason Meggs , a UC - Berkeley researcher who spent last summer crunching years of traffic data , conducting interviews and observing cyclist behavior in the state .
Boise , home to Idaho 's biggest bike population , " has actually become safer for bicyclists than other cities which do n't have the law , " Meggs said .
And what about the children ?
Mark McNeese , the Idaho Transportation Department 's bicycle and pedestrian coordinator , said legislators removed an education requirement in the original law in 1988 because special training quickly became unnecessary .
" The kids were quick to adapt , " he said .
" The bottom line is that when this thing passed , there was n't one doggone thing that changed . "
Beyond the politics , getting around effectively on a human - powered vehicle demands defensive maneuvering and momentum .
Still , I was n't about to dump a physics lesson about energy , body mass and distance on my daughter .
Instead , I promised her that I would stop at every stop sign with her .
Kim Whitney , youth programs coordinator for Portland Community Cycling Center , said that was probably the best approach .
Most adult cyclists , she said , tend to slow and roll through stop signs .
" But we really try to teach children to stop , to put a foot down and to look around them , " Whitney said .
" We want them to learn to use the different senses they have to know if it 's safe to go or not . "
And that wo n't change if Idaho Stop comes to Oregon .
" It 's something , " she said , " they can adapt to later . "

DC Comics has two upcoming films in their DVD series of DC Universe animated original PG - 13 movies .
Both look great and I ’m definitely picking them up !
Green Lantern : First Flight will be available on July 28 .
While I ’d rather they ’d featured Kyle instead of Hal , this movie still looks really good !
This story covers how Hal Jordan became a Green Lantern , and his early dealings with Sinestro .
I love that Sinestro is in his current costume , rather than his cheesy old suit .
I suppose the story is a modern - day interpretation of the 1990s Emerald Dawn mini-series , since Geoff Johns said this is n’t based upon his recent “ Secret Origin ” arc on the Green Lantern comic .

Superman / Batman : Public Enemies is due out on September 29 .
This story is based upon the first arc of the Superman / Batman comic book series .
In this adventure , Superman & Batman become America ’s most wanted criminals – and are hunted by friends and foes alike .
It was a really good comic , so I ’m looking forward to seeing the animated version .
Also , they got the original voice actors who did the Superman Animated Series and the Batman Animated Series .
So you know the voices are going to be spectacular !

Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer ’s hopeful blockbuster Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time is poised to be unveiled at Comic - Con later this week .
To kick off the early publicity , Disney has sent Empire Online a sneak peek at two of the teaser one - sheet Prince of Persia movie posters .
The first poster features Jake Gyllenhaal as Prince Dastan striking an action pose .
The second poster is of Gemma Arterton as Princess Tamina who must team up with Dastan to stop an evil threat from reversing time to rule the world .
The poster imagery is quite striking in sepia tone with the color red accentuated .
The blocky font , however , leaves much to be desired .
It looks like something more appropriate for a magazine cover than an epic adventure set in the past .
Because these posters were sent to Empire Online ( based out of London ) they may differ from what we get here in North America .
We should find out either way soon enough .
Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time , which co-stars Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina , is scheduled for release on May 28 , 2010 .

The finding may become significant among behavioral economists , many of whom have suspected that the loss aversion found through contrived experiments might not be demonstrated by actual , expert competitors vying for high stakes .
The paper is being submitted this week for publication in an economic journal .
“ Even experienced professionals playing for high stakes are not rational , ” Pope said .
“ Tiger Woods , the model of perfection and what an economist would think of as a rational agent , even he exhibits these biases .
And if he exhibits these biases , why not business leaders ?
There are a lot of applications . ”
Rather than resist any insight from ivory tower academics , several golfers admitted to handling identical birdie and par putts differently  and appeared somewhat amused at being found out .
Geoff Ogilvy , who made par putts 4.1 percent more often than birdie putts from the same distance , said : “ A par putt seems more final .
It should n’t make any difference , should it ? ”
And Paul Goydos , who showed the effect at 4.4 percent , said it probably affected him even more on putts for eagle .
“ If I ’ve got a 25 - footer for eagle , it seems like I ’m more conservative than with a 25 - footer for either birdie or par for whatever reason , ” Goydos said .
“ I think the worst thing you can do is three - putt for par on a par 5 .
That ’s one that drives me more crazy than anything else .
Maybe that ’s why I ’m at the very bottom of the tour in eagles made . ”
But just as quickly as pro golfers admitted to their costly habit , they dismissed the idea of being able to do much about it .
Stewart Cink , who showed a 3.3 percent effect , said that try as he might , he would never be able to convince himself that every putt is the same .
“ You ca n’t fool yourself , ” Cink said .
“ But this is one of the reasons why we use sports psychology , and we try to have a preshot routine so we do the same thing , approach every putt the same way .
It ’s not always glamorous , and it ’s not always possible in reality . ”
I was at a friend 's place the other night , and whilst this friend was busy preparing dinner , I was left to zap the TV at my convenience ...
It is not often that am given this privilege of zapping as I please .
I really made up for it , that night and zapped my head away ...
Engrossed in my nervous hobby , fate or luck had it that I land on Al - Sharqiya - an Iraqi TV channel .
As a rule of thumb , I try avoid watching Iraqi TV altogether .
It just depresses the hell out of me .
In particular the Iraqi Shiite channels where permanent , chronic , non stop " latmiahs " are aired live .
Latmiah is the act of pounding one 's breast with one 's fist or hand ... usually followed by scenes of wailing and ultimately by scenes of heavy self flagellation - a 24/7 Ashura .
( Ashura is a Shiite religious day characterized by mass hysteria in the " new " Iraq )
The other Iraqi TV channels , I find them as dodgy as the Shiite ones .
You have Al - Baghdadia ( where Muntather Zaidi - the shoe thrower used to work ) .
One is never sure who Al - Baghdadia works for .
Some say it supports the chief Driller of the Mahdi Army - Muqtada Al - Sadr .
Others say it is a patriotic channel .
Go figure ...
Then you have the all Assyrian channels , the all Kurdish channels , a couple of channels from Al - Anbar where they are always reciting poetry of which I understand nothing .
And you also have the official Iraqi puppet channels who praise Maliki non stop and of course the Arabic version of Fox news , funded by the Americans .
The only two channels I watch if I have to , are Al - Babylia and Al - Sharqiya both of which are anti-occupation and secular , praise to God .
As I was saying before opening the above parenthesis -- my friend was in the kitchen chopping away and I could smell some wonderful , mouth watering , scents emanating from there , tipping me into a world that made my palate anxious to taste some good , wholesome stuff for a change ...
Meanwhile , Fate decided that I was to watch the program aired by Al - Sharqiya called Al - Aghlabiya Al - Samita -- The Silent Majority .
And here I was stuck with the silent majority .
The program was solely devoted to the gross Human rights violations and abuses in " liberated " Iraq with particular reference to the plight of prisoners / detainees in Iraq 's Gulag .
Many called in .
Some were ex-prisoners , other relatives of someone who is still in prison or reported dead while in prison .
The stories were harrowing .
I felt as if I was watching a horror film .
Truly , I still have not fully recovered from what I heard that evening .
People were calling in from ALL of Iraq - Baghdad , Basra , Diwaniya , Suleymania , Erbil ... Some were exiled and calling from outside of Iraq and they had escaped a similar ordeal , a similar ordeal as that of the still lingering prisoners .
Some were very close relatives of someone still imprisoned in some Iraqi dungeon .
That evening , I had forgotten my writing pad at home , so I just scribbled some of the important information on the blank edges of an old newspaper .
I cannot recall the full exact numbers and locations but I do have the overall stories well stored in my mind as well as few cases that cannot and will never be forgotten .
So help me God not to omit or forget anything .
ALL of the stories shared similar characteristics and details - a common thread , if one may call it that .
- What am about to tell you does NOT cover American run prisons / detention camps , nor does it cover official Iraqi prisons .
I say official because this program and all the testimonies it bore , made it clear that there are 600 SECRET / SHADOW prisons in Iraq besides the official ones .
- Prisoners , both men and women are arrested on identity / sect basis or because they are relatives of someone who is wanted for " insurgency " .
The term insurgency is used very loosely by the Iraqi authorities .
I shall explain how later .
- Prisoners are usually caught after a " Mukhber Seree " , a mouchard in French , I am not sure what the term is in English .
Basically someone charged of spying on people for anything he considers as " subversive " .
So the Mukhber Seree has full authority and 10 times out of 10 , he either works for the Police , a Militia or a particular Ministry , or the Mukhabarat - secret service or the official Government .
I say official government because you have to know that today in Iraq there are several mini governments within the government .
And that is important to remember , because it transpired from the stories that each prison belongs to a party , a militia , or some government mafia clan member ...
Moreover prisoners who make it out alive , and I personally know of two cases who have been released , stay in hiding and keep changing houses , because the Mukhber Al - Seree would not let go of them .
So , in fact they are never free .
- All the prisoners have not been formally charged with any " crime " and none has had access to any legal council or trial .
An example : someone drew an anti-occupation graffiti on the wall of one neighborhood , all of the men in the age range of 15 to 45 of that same neighborhood were arrested the following day and imprisoned .
- All of the stories report widespread use of horrific torture methods .
Common torture methods across the country are : electrocution , being hanged by hooks from the ceilings , sleep deprivation , food deprivation , isolation , made to listen to torture from other cells , beatings , crammed space - one example 150 inmates in one cell of 3 by 8 meters , amputating fingers , amputation of limbs following torture , pulling nails and teeth , burning with cigarettes and acid , blinding one eye , drilling extremities ... and rape including gang rape of male prisoners was commonly reported .
One example given was in the space of one day 45 policemen raped around 100 detainees .
Rape includes the forcing of bottles in the anus .
This was a common theme that came up in every single story .
I will devote a separate paragraph to the secret women 's prison .
- The age range of the prisoners is from as young as 13 to as old as 70 .
As I said the great majority are not charged with anything and have had no access to any formal trial .
Huge ransoms are always asked to release the prisoners .
I know that to be the case since we experienced the same thing with my relatives .
And this was confirmed again in the testimonies that I heard that night .
Families would pay the extortion money and the prisoner would not be released and more money is requested ...
It is the police prison guards right up to the highest echelons who do the bidding for the money .
Just to show how deep the corruption has seeped in the new " liberated " Iraq .
I am trying not to forget anything here and my little pieces of newspaper are scattered in front of me and my head is spinning with bits of stories ...
- Many relatives of ex-prisoners , ex-prisoners because these prisoners died under torture , said that they were called by anonymous people telling them that the body of so and so , was found in some street .
One prisoner after a brutal torture session managed to give the phone number of his family to his cell mate , this latter engraved it on the sole of his rubber slippers .
He called the family two days later to inform them that their son died from torture .
- Usually those who die from torture and if they are not dumped in some street , are given fake death certificates by an official hospital .
It seems that there is an agreement between those who run those prisons and some of the hospitals in Iraq to fabricate death certificates stating - cause of death : natural .
And the usual reason given is heart attack .
But when the families do manage to recuperate the body , they see that it has been deformed beyond recognition because of torture .
- Now for the women 's secret prison .
This is how it happens and this what takes place .
The police , militia or some other party is looking for an " insurgent " - as I said the word " insurgent " is used loosely by the current Iraqi mafia to denote just about anyone they do n't like and mainly for sectarian or political reasons or because he was affiliated to the previous regime in particular the army .
So if they can't find this person , they usually go for the female member of his family .
Usually his wife or sister .
These female relatives are then placed in a secret prison -- a women only prison .
Nidal Shibib , an Iraqi woman human rights activist reported during the course of this program the following -- and I want you to read this carefully .
Torture and gang rape are common daily occurrences in this secret female prison .
Not only that , but when " Firaq Tafteesh Amerkiya " - meaning American teams for Prison supervision - go to visit these secret prisons , one of which is the women's , the police in charge of this particular prison invite this American team " to do as they please with the female prisoners . "
And I quote - " they unbolt the doors of the cells wide open and tell them - take them all for your pleasure . "
These female prisoners find themselves raped again but this time by the Americans who supervise the Iraqi prisons - supervise them for " good conduct " .
Some of the women who are eventually released are killed in " honor " by their families to wash away the shame of rape .
Nidal Shibib rightly asked - " the male prisoners who are raped are not killed in honor , why do they kill the women ? " ( This is another parenthesis , I will not go into right now . )
- The IRANIAN connection :
Many of the prisoner 's relatives confirm that their relative was / is held in Iranian run prisons IN IRAQ and their torture was done by Iranians or that it was done under Iranian order and command .
Some of these detainees happen to be ex-army officers .
Many of them have died under torture .
Those who are not detained in Iraq , were arrested in 2003 by Iranian special forces and transferred to KARON prison in IRAN where their fate is still unknown .
Again , another Iraqi human rights activist by the name of Mohamed Al - Sheikhly has a whole dossier of the names of those Iraqis who disappeared in Iranian prisons in IRAN , and he has been active in finding their whereabouts / release , in vain ...
On the same subject , I was told recently that President Ahmadinejad , in the 80's , then member of the Iranian revolutionary guards , was in charge of supervising the torture of Iraq soldiers during and in the aftermath of the Iran - Iraq war .
( yet another parenthesis .
So many sub-chapters in the Iraqi tragedy . )
- Yalla Layla , the food is ready ...
- Yes , am coming , just one second
- Ya Layla , the food is getting cold ... you have been complaining that am slow cook and that you are so hungry ... yalla ...
- Yes am coming , hold on one more second please ...
- What are you doing for God 's sake ?
- Here I am .
- See , I cooked your favorite stew with Bamia ( Okra ) and rice ... what 's the matter are n't you hungry anymore ?
Layla are you okay ?
- Yes I will be fine , give me a few minutes ...
- What happened to you all of a sudden ?
- Give me a few minutes , I need to re-emerge from the Underworld ...
I re-emerged , but a part of me is still there ... in the secret prisons of Iraq .
P.S : Please circulate this post widely .
As far and as wide as you can .
The truth about Iraq new found " freedom and democracy " must be shown to the whole world .

With the parents of the U.S. soldier taken by the Taliban in Afghanistan saying they are " overwhelmed by the support " they 've received since their son's capture , it 's clear that they have n't been watching Fox News , because as noted yesterday by Daily Kos diarist Antman11 , their military expert , Ralph Peters , is advocating an appallingly twisted version of supporting the troops :
For right now , I think he 's okay .
They 're not going to kill him right away , if at all , because he is tremendous propaganda value .
He 's saying , making anti-American statements , he wants to investigate Islam , blah blah blah .
Now look , Julie , I want to be clear .
If when the facts are in , we find out that through some convoluted chain of events , he really was captured by the Taliban , I 'm with him .
But , if he walked away from his post and his buddies in wartime - I do n't care how hard it sounds .
As far as I 'm concerned , the Taliban can save us a lot of legal hassles and legal bills .
This call for violence against a member of our military is something not usually seen outside of videos produced by the terrorists themselves , yet it received only the most tepid objection from the Fox News model .
Of course Peters ' violent fantasies are well - documented , so his suggestion that the Taliban execute an American soldier probably was n't that much of a surprise .
And while one would think that media outlets would be leery about featuring a man who said :
Pretending to be impartial , the self - segregating personalities drawn to media careers overwhelmingly take a side , and that side is rarely ours .
Although it seems unthinkable now , future wars may require censorship , news blackouts and , ultimately , military attacks on the partisan media .
... apparently Fox News realized that they would never be in any danger , so why not give a platform to a man who calls for the summary execution of soldiers and journalists ?

The Air Force will train more drone operators than fighter and bomber pilots combined for the first time this year , signaling a fundamental shift for the 61 - year - old service .
The growing ranks of drone operators mark a turning point for the Air Force as it looks to a future that relies increasingly on unmanned aircraft .
Over the next few decades , the Air Force plans to develop drones that would serve as fighters , bombers and tankers , the heart of its manned fleet , according to its Unmanned System Update .
The document says piloted aircraft will be used in concert with drones …
The Air Force will train 240 pilots to fly Predator and Reaper drones compared with 214 fighter and bomber pilots for the budget year that ends in September .
Overall , there are 550 drone pilots compared with 3,700 fighter and 900 bomber pilots .
The current emphasis for drones reflects the need for persistent , eye - in - the - sky surveillance to track and kill insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ The capability provided by the unmanned aircraft is game - changing , ” Gen. Norton Schwartz , the Air Force chief of staff , told USA TODAY in an e-mailed statement .
“ We can have eyes 24/7 on our adversaries .
The importance of that is clear in the feedback from the ground troops — this is a capability they do n’t want to be without . ”
Loren Thompson , a military analyst with the Lexington Institute , said intelligence gathering has been a weakness for the Pentagon for years but has improved recently .
“ The Air Force has now gotten the message that it ’s important to be responsive to the war fighters on the ground , ” he said .
Uh-oh .
I have a few buddies – military pilots – who will find this really disturbing .
I am certain they will raise more technical questions than I might about this strategic decision .
Will this lessen the number of required fighter and bomber pilots – or simply involve an increased number of gamers / drone pilots ?
It looks like the reduction has already begun .
UFO watchers believe that in 1947 a flying saucer with aliens on board landed outside the New Mexico town of Roswell and that an elaborate cover - up by the authorities followed .
The BBC's Kevin Connolly went to Roswell in pursuit of the truth about the Roswell incident .
There is a lunar quality to the landscape of New Mexico which seems somehow appropriate for a state which is our portal to the heavens .
Roswell 's International UFO
Museum is a big draw for tourists
It is here on a dried - up lake bed high above sea level that the radio telescopes of the US government 's Very Large Array ( VLA ) receive signals from the outer edges of our expanding universe , chasing the very moment of the Big Bang through the trackless void of time and space .
And of course it is also here - perhaps - that 62 years ago a flying - saucer crashed to earth on a ranch outside the town of Roswell , killing its alien crew and prompting one of the most elaborate and protracted cover - ups in history .
The power of that possibility and the darkness of the nights here so far from the light pollution of the big cities are what draw scientists and curious tourists alike to this entrancing place .
And it is what motivates watchers of the skies to keep , well , watching the skies , obviously .
Alien ambiguity
If UFO true - believers are right , then nothing much that has happened on our tiny , fragile planet in the years since that stormy summer 's night really matters very much .
What , after all , would Watergate , or Vietnam or Iraq amount to if we could establish that the US government knew for sure that we are not alone in the universe ?
Most of the big questions about alien life and UFOs can be traced back to Roswell - not least the issue of how life - forms from another civilisation have such an uncanny sense of when the tourist industry in a small US town could use a shot in the arm .
My father saw the bodies , my father saw the craft
Julie Shuster , daughter of Roswell Air Force Base press officer
Are we really alone in the heavens , for example , and if we are not , do the civilisations with which we share the heavens mean us any harm ?
Is it just a coincidence that aliens have never managed to find an earth - dweller who knows how to operate his own camera properly ?
And why , if you have journeyed light years across the unknowable vastness of the heavens , would you confine yourself to a fleeting and ambiguous appearance before a handful of New Mexican ranchers ?
Why not go the extra mile and find a research institute of some kind - unless our visitors have a sense of humour , of course .
But we are getting ahead of ourselves .
Let us return to that stormy summer New Mexican night in 1947 when the story of the UFO landing first broke .
It was a world of tension and uncertainty .
The United States had detonated the first atom bombs - they were developed just up the road at Los Alamos , New Mexico - and was uneasily aware that the Soviet Union , its increasingly hostile former ally , had nuclear ambitions of its own .
The Cold War was just beginning .
' Switcheroo ' Roswell was in those days the home base of the 509th Bombardment Group of the US Eighth Army Air Force .
Most of the boys in the 509th were combat veterans and when they were tasked to investigate reports of some kind of landing on a ranch a short distance away it seems reasonable to assume they were not too excited at first .
That soon changed .
When they got the material back to base , they quickly concluded they were onto something historic .
Their first press release talked of the recovery of a flying saucer - it was only when the suits descended from Washington that the tone of the official communiques changed .
The base intelligence officer who was tasked with taking the wreckage to another base reports leaving it in an office there and returning a few minutes later to find that the space debris he had brought had been replaced with parts of a weather balloon .
Dennis Balthaser believes the US government covered up a UFO crash
The fix was in .
Faced with evidence of one of the most significant events in human history the American authorities had responded by pulling the old switcheroo .
One account of those days comes from Julie Shuster , whose father was the press officer at the Roswell base .
She now runs the museum in the town which is the focal point for the local UFO industry ( it is on a street where the street lights have been decorated so that they look like alien heads ) .
For Julie there is a simple issue in all of this which goes back to the version of events her father passed on to her .
" My daddy did n't lie .
My father saw the bodies , my father saw the craft , " she says .
" He saw bodies - large heads , almond shaped eyes ... and material that could n't be burnt , ripped , cut - anything . "
' Majestic 12 '
It is not quite so personal for the other true believers in the incident .
Dennis Balthaser , for example , is a retired civil engineer who is perhaps the most meticulous researcher of the Roswell incident .
He has spent years ( and thousands of dollars of his own money ) tracing every witness and every player from that night in 1947 and is convinced that there was a landing .
Basically [ the president ] can't be trusted with information like this
Dennis Balthaser
Roswell researcher
But he is at his most compelling when talking about the cover - up which follows .
Dennis lives in a rather frightening world where the US government would be perfectly happy to murder anyone ( including him ) who got too close to the truth .
He believes the US is really governed by a kind of secret committee of senior military and intelligence officials with the president serving as a kind of hired hand to deal with the public .
" Basically he can't be trusted with information like this " says Dennis .
" Back in Truman 's time , we 're looking at a thing called ' majestic 12 ' , which was a group of some of the highest military people , some of the highest dignitary people we had .
I believe today we still have a group similar to that that calls the shots . "
Even before I met Dennis , I knew he believed that space travellers helped build the pyramids - where I , for example , am more inclined to the view that they are probably the work of Egyptians .
I expected to find him hopelessly naive - but the funny thing is he is so lucid and convincing that I left feeling rather naive myself .
( And in case you were wondering - if anyone ever lifts a quote from this article to promote a book or a DVD it will be that previous sentence . )
Missing balloon ?
But here is the problem .
I mentioned before that New Mexico is a place where real science and Roswell science - lite co-exist .
And it is in that proximity that our explanation probably lies .
At the VLA ( that centre of government radio telescopy ) they will tell you that around the time of the crash , the US government was sending up special high - altitude weather balloons made of a then - classified material .
They were looking for atmospheric evidence that the Russians were testing their own nuclear bomb .
On the night of the Roswell incident , one of those balloons went missing .
Until , perhaps , it was found by the boys of the 509th .
And all that stuff about alien bodies being recovered and autopsies being performed ?
Well I leave you to speculate about that for yourselves .
If you find all that a little disappointing then you can always employ the debating technique favoured by UFO true believers - the deployment of questions designed to expose the lack of absolute certainty in almost all human affairs .
How do you know , for example , that there really is not a government department 27 layers above top secret tasked with keeping an eye on these things ?
Perhaps they insist that articles like this are submitted to them for screening before publication .
And maybe this is not the script I originally wrote and submitted - just the script they sent back .
You could hardly blame me for giving in - I am sure you would not want to find my bleached bones left out in the desert , would you ?
All I am saying is - keep watching the skies .
