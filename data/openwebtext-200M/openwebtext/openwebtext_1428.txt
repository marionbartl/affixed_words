​ Daniel Sosa went to Crescent City , California last Friday to pick up four pounds of marijuana .
He had a 2 p.m. appointment to pick up the stuff — at the Del Norte County Sheriff ’s Office .
“ It seemed weird , ” Sosa said .
“ I was worried they were going to arrest me again . ”
If the pot looked familiar to Sosa , it was because it was the same weed that had been confiscated from him a year ago , during a routine traffic stop , reports Kurt Madar of The Daily Triplicate
Sosa , who operates two medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles , said it took a call from his lawyer to the Sheriff ’s Office before the medicine was finally released .
“ My lawyer said that I had a 2 p.m. appointment ; it only took an extra 15 minutes or so before the evidence officer came out , ” Sosa said .
The evidence officer , Deputy John Olson , directed Sosa to wait in his car down the block from the Sheriff ’s Office .
As Sosa waited across the street , Deputy Olson wheeled out a shopping cart with a cardboard box containing the four pounds of pot .
“ It was surreal , ” Sosa said .
“ There we are on the street , and we are going over an evidence sheet and pulling out bags of medicine .
I mean , we were just on the street . ”
“ This is the first time we ’ve released that quantity of marijuana , ” said Sheriff ’s Commander Tim Athey .
“ It ’s not something we like to do . ”
Sosa was arrested in February 2009 after being pulled over for a broken headlight .
Officers smelled marijuana when they approached his car , and a subsequent search produced about $ 7,000 in cash in $ 100 bills , and 4.5 pounds of marijuana in the trunk .
After the original bust last year , Sgt. Steve Morris erroneously claimed that Sosa ’s medical marijuana card “ was not valid in Del Norte County , only in the Los Angeles area . ”
Nice try , Sergeant .
Last time I checked , Del Norte County is still part of California .
“ This has been dragging on for a long time , ” Sosa said .
“ The DA kept trying to make a deal , but I refused anything that did n’t include a dismissal and getting the medicine returned . ”
Sosa said the District Attorney ’s office offered to plead the case down to a misdemeanor , then to a civil infraction , before it was finally settled in a plea bargain where Sosa forfeited $ 4,500 of the $ 7,000 he was carrying , but got all his marijuana back .
Hmm … $ 4,500 for four pounds would be a hell of a deal … if the pot were n’t already yours to begin with .
“ I believe this upholds the credibility of cannabis dispensing collectives in Del Norte County , ” Sosa said .
“ It ’s a great example of California law being upheld like it should . ”
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke referred to mortgage - finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a “ platypus , ” saying they were “ neither fish nor fowl . ”
He suggested strongly that the companies should be privatized during his appearance before the Senate Banking Committee .
Mr. Bernanke did n’t specifically direct Congress to privatize the government - sponsored firms , but did go as far as saying it was an “ interesting direction to go , ” which in Fedspeak often means something .
" When you pay for proprietary software , what do you get ?
Let 's look at the world 's largest software company , Oracle - the cost of their software licences is astronomical and well out of the range of most small businesses . "
But , on the plus side , " bundled with those licences is a whole lot of service , set - up , configuration , customisation and specialised consulting and training " .
With free software , you get none of that , she says .
Typically , people download it , install it and see if it works .
People can choose to buy those additional services if they need them .
Organisations such as Red Hat and Canonical , as well as many open - source consultants , are selling services and support around open - source software .
" It 's a new way of doing things , " says a former systems architect , Paul Galland , who started up online music storage business Save My Musik recently , using the open - source database from Sun , MySQL .
Mining the talent in the " legions " of community development groups was how Galland found people to help him evaluate , maintain and support his open - source products .
Open source is a boon for small businesses , he says .
" There would not be as many start - ups without open - source .
I paid for high - end hardware and removed some costs with Sun 's open - source software with half the money I thought I 'd need .
" We sell a service ; it has to be good quality .
We have put effort into the best architecture and safety and security of data .
The database is the most critical [ aspect ] .
" I do n't do anything leading - edge .
The technology I use is conservative and proven .
But if you are using an open - source product where the community developer base is small , then you could be caught out .
The wider use of the technology , the safer you are . "
According to an Australian government document discussing the risks of open - source software , the first question to ask is whether the software has an established track record .
" If the software has been available for a reasonable time and there appears to be a longstanding community of users , this may support claims that the software performs as advertised , " it says .
Another issue facing open - source products is the perceived lack of research and development .
If the software is free or almost free , there is no money to put back into research and development to keep the product up to date , which is traditionally how it 's done .
Benjamin says open - source software is more a project than a product .
" Everyone with an interest works together to protect , preserve and improve the eco-system that produces it , " she says .
" Let 's look at Linux [ a free operating system ] .
Linux is one of the most successful open - source projects in existence .
Some of the world 's top vendors are working together by employing developers to work on the Linux kernel [ the software that runs the operating system ] .
IBM , HP , Novell , Red Hat , Canonical , Oracle and now even Microsoft make contributions to the Linux kernel that supports their own products . "
The research and development also takes place in community organised events , Benjamin says .
" They 're like the secret R&D lab brought out into the open marketplace .
Developers mingle and socialise , all the while sharing their experiences , explaining their challenges and working together to find solutions to common problems .
" This is where the seeds are sown for new features , where problems are solved and the technology is improved .
It 's the technologists that drive these events , not the marketing department .
There is no marketing department . "
The United States , which has less than 5 percent of the world ’s population , has about one - quarter of its prisoners .
But the relentless rise in the nation ’s prison population has suddenly slowed as many states discover that it is simply too expensive to overincarcerate .
Between 1987 and 2007 the prison population nearly tripled , from 585,000 to almost 1.6 million .
Much of that increase occurred in states  many with falling crime rates  that had adopted overly harsh punishment policies , such as the “ three strikes and you ’re out ” rule and drug laws requiring that nonviolent drug offenders be locked away .
These policies have been hugely costly .
According to the Pew Center on the States , state spending from general funds on corrections increased from $ 10.6 billion in 1987 to more than $ 44 billion in 2007 , a 127 percent increase in inflation - adjusted dollars .
In the same period , adjusted spending on higher education increased only 21 percent .
In 2008 , the explosion of the prison population ground to a near halt , according to data released last month by the Bureau of Justice Statistics .
About 739,000 inmates were admitted to federal and state facilities , only about 3,500 more than were released .
The Bloom Box — an as yet unbuilt in - home " power plant " designed to be about the size of a mini- fridge — could provide cheap , environmentally friendly electricity to U.S. households within ten years , according to Bloom Energy .
Or not .
After days of speculation and hype , the fuel cell company unveiled their plans for Bloom Box mass production — but no prototype — at a press conference today with California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former U.S. secretary of state and Bloom Energy board member Colin Powell , among others .
But fuel cell experts say that , based on the information the company made public today , the Bloom Box technology is not revolutionary , nor is it the cheapest or most efficient fuel cell system available .
" It 's a big hype .
I 'm actually pretty pissed off about it , to be quite honest , " said Nigel Sammes , a ceramic engineer and fuel cell expert at the Colorado School of Mines .
" It really is nothing new .
Go to any [ solid oxide fuel cell ]
Web site and you 'll see the same stuff . "
Mike Brown , a vice president at fuel cell maker UTC Power — a competitor to Bloom Energy — also was n't surprised .
" I think we had anticipated just about everything that 's on their Web site , " Brown said .
" But it 's nice to at least finally see something " after ten years , which is about how long the Bloom Box has been in development .
In an interview with CBS TV's 60 Minutes Sunday night — which did much to fuel anticipation for today 's announcement — K.R. Sridhar , CEO of Bloom Energy , said that , for one thing , the Bloom Box fuel cell system is a much better , or at least more reliable , alternative to solar power as a green energy source .
Video : Bloom Box Segment From 60 Minutes
" The sun does n't shine on your rooftop 24 hours a day , " Sridhar said .
" Our box produces electricity continually and reliably . "
Fuel cells are devices that combine a fuel , such as natural gas , and an oxidant , such as oxygen , and turn their chemical energy directly into electrical energy .
Big Bloom Box Already in Use
For months now , Bloom Energy has been testing refrigerator - size Bloom Boxes at campuses of major corporations — including Google , FedEx , Wal - Mart , and eBay .
One of these jumbo Bloom Boxes , called Bloom Box Servers , could power a hundred homes , and four of them could power a 35,000 - square - foot ( 3,250 - square - meter ) office building , Sridhar said on CBS .
Sridhar , a former NASA engineer , said he hopes to begin selling the mini- fridge - size Bloom Boxes within five to ten years .
Each of the small Bloom Boxes should be able to power a household , he said .
How Bloom Box Should Work , Basically
At the heart of the Bloom Box will be solid oxide fuel cells — in this case , flat , coaster - size ceramic plates with a secret coating — widely considered by experts to be one of the most efficient types of fuel cells .
Bloom Box plates — already in use in the industrial models — can each power one light bulb , but a stack of 64 of the cells could be " big enough to power a Starbucks , " Sridhar said .
Oxygen and natural gas would be fed into the Bloom Box and undergo a high - temperature chemical reaction in the fuel cells to produce electricity , heat , carbon dioxide , and water .
The fuel could be piped in from municipal natural gas systems — much as it is for gas stoves and ovens — or created from biogas or , as in the case of eBay , harvested from natural gas - rich landfills .
No Reason to Doubt Bloom Box Tech ?
Friedrich " Fritz " Prinz , a fuel cell expert at Stanford University , said there 's no reason to doubt that the Bloom Box works as Bloom Energy 's Sridhar claims .
" The solid oxide fuel cell technology they 're pursuing is one of the most attractive fuel cell technologies there is , " said Prinz , who was not involved in the Bloom Box 's development .
Based on the 60 Minutes segment , Prinz said , the design of the Bloom Box appears to be fairly standard and that there was nothing obviously revolutionary about it .
" They did n't reveal any new physics or any new principles , but I do n't think they need to do that , " Prinz added .
" They just need to take understood and recognized principles in material science and thermodynamics and implement them , and it looks like they 've done that successfully .
" Whether they 've done it economically , I do n't know . "
Bloom Box for the Budget Conscious ?
The industrial - strength Bloom Boxes now in use cost eBay and other companies between U.S. $ 700,000 and $ 800,000 .
At eBay , Bloom Energy is maintaining the machines under a ten - year maintenance contract .
e Bay CEO John Donahoe told 60 Minutes that the five Bloom Boxes installed seven months ago at the company 's campus in San Jose , California , now provide almost 15 percent of eBay 's electricity needs .
Estimated energy savings for the seven months : $ 100,000 .
At that rate , the Bloom Boxes should pay for themselves within three years , Donahoe told the business - news site Fast Company .
A residential Bloom Box should cost around U.S. $ 3,000 , Bloom Energy 's Sridhar said — much cheaper than most currently available consumer fuel cell systems .
" Manufacturing these things cheaply is not easy , " said Michael Kanellos , editor - in - chief of Greentech Media , a business - news site specializing in green technology coverage and analysis .
" ClearEdge initially sold theirs for $ 50,000 , and they had to raise it to $ 56,000 . "
Those high prices are due in part to the fact that home fuel cell systems have been built by hand and because low demand has n't allowed manufacturers to achieve economies of scale — for example to negotiate cheaper prices for raw materials in the way that large production runs allow — said Brown of UTC Power .
Previous systems have also used the precious metal platinum , though Bloom Energy says they 've found a way around this — though the details are under wraps — according to Prinz , of Stanford University .
Bloom Box Safe and Solid ?
It 's also unclear how safe and durable the Bloom Box will be , said UTC Power 's Brown .
Solid oxide fuel cells must operate at extremely high temperatures , and as a result , they often crack or leak .
For the Bloom Box to become widely adopted by homeowners — who would presumably be nervous about replacing old reliable technology with a new , relatively untested one — the system will need an operational lifetime of about 85,000 hours , or about ten years , Brown said .
There are commercial fuel cells , such as ones made by UTC Power , that can operate continuously for that long , Brown said .
Bloom Energy has not disclosed the operational lifetime of its Bloom Box .
It 's also unclear as of yet how energy efficient the Bloom Boxes are , Brown said .
Fuel cell systems in which both the generated electricity and heat are used can be 90 percent or more energy efficient .
Bloom Energy has not released specific details about the Bloom Box 's energy efficiency or specified whether the heat produced by its units can be utilized .
" We did n't see any evidence of thermal recovery , so we assume it's an electricity - only device , " Brown said .
" If that 's the case , it is somewhere between 45 and 55 percent electrically efficient . "
That would make the Bloom Box only about 5 to 10 percent more efficient than conventional combined cycle gas turbine ( CCGT ) power plants , Brown said .
Such plants create electricity in two phases : first via gas turbines , then via steam turbines , which take advantage of excess heat generated in the first phase .
Whitney Colella , a fuel cell researcher at Sandia National Laboratories , said the Bloom Box appears to be very similar to fuel cell systems developed by United Technologies Corp. ( of which UTC Power is a unit ) and FuelCell Energy , Colella said .
" All of them can run on natural gas , and all of them can run on biogas , " she said .
" The main difference is that the electrical efficiency [ of the Bloom Box ] is slightly higher " than the other two , at least according to figures posted online by Bloom Energy today .
Bloom Energy 's Killer App ?
While most experts seem to agree that the current Bloom Box appears to be a fairly standard solid oxide fuel cell system , Bloom Energy has filed patents in recent years that hint at a possible killer feature that could set its future devices apart from the competition , Greentech Media 's Kanellos said .
The patents describe a process for taking the runoff of the main electricity generation — carbon dioxide and water — and using it to produce oxygen and a " methane - like fuel , " he said .
This would essentially reverse the chemical reaction in the Bloom Box — a possibility Sridhar hinted at on 60 Minutes .
That new fuel and oxidant could be automatically run through the Bloom Box to generate even more electricity — and less waste .
The big Bloom Energy Servers already in use do n't currently do this , but if such a reverse - reaction is possible — and it's not clear that it is — then " it would be huge , " Kanellos said .

One - terabyte ( TB ) solid state drives ( SSDs ) are expected to be released in a couple of years , and they will be about the size of the average postage stamp .
A team of Japanese researchers from Toshiba and the Keio University in Tokyo , led by Professor Tadahiro Kuroda , claims to have developed a technique that will reduce the size of SSDs by around 90 per cent .
Not only that , but the technology also increases their energy efficiency by 70 per cent and makes them cheaper to manufacture .
A prototype of the new SSD consists of one controller chip and 128 NAND flash memory chips .
The data transfer speed is said to be 2 GB per second , and Nikkei said that since the system is based on radio communication its production costs are lower .
All this could help SSDs become the standard system for data storage in the future .
The SSDs are expected to be available commercially in 2012 , and by then their specifications may have improved even further .
Their expected retail price is unknown at this stage .

Google has been awarded a patent that describes a software method for selectively restricting the availability of content on the basis of access privileges and geographical location .
On the surface , it may look like this patent covers techniques for censoring politically sensitive content in specific countries — a practice that Google has recently spoken out against in its ongoing feud with China .
A closer look at the patent 's claims , however , shows that it has little to do with censorship and may actually relate to the company 's controversial book scanning initiative .
Patent # 7,664,751 , " Variable user interface based on document access privileges , " submitted to the patent office in September , 2004 and was awarded to Google on Tuesday .
Like most patents , it is written to be very broad , but it identifies some specific use cases .
The major case it covers is a system where the availability of scanned documents , such as books and magazines , is constrained to selected portions or restricted entirely based on access privileges that are derived from copyright law and other related factors .
In cases where access is limited or restricted , the patent explains that the software could supply the user with links to buy the full document .
How copyright law necessitates location - based filtering
Most countries are party to the Berne Convention , an international treaty that set the groundwork for modern copyright law .
It 's important to understand , however , that the Berne Convention and subsequent agreements of a similar nature merely define a set of minimum standards .
Individual countries can establish longer copyright terms or enforce additional restrictions .
Many countries , including the United States , allow copyright to last longer than the minimum that is mandated by international treaties .
A book that is considered part of the public domain in one country may still be covered under copyright law in another country .
The lack of consistency in copyright law between nations has raised some really peculiar issues for content distributors .
For example , Project Gutenberg Australia freely offers the full text of books by Charles Williams ( my favorite author ) even though the same text can't be published on the main Project Gutenberg website .
Different countries also have completely different ways of defining and protecting Fair Use rights .
It may be entirely permissible to publish properly attributed excerpts of considerable length in some countries while others would view the same behavior as highly damaging and criminal .
These issue can arguably be attributed to the general brittleness of modern copyright law and the trend towards blatantly unreasonable copyright extension , but that 's not something that can be fixed overnight on a global scale .
Attempts at international harmonization of copyright seem to tilt towards the Machiavellian end of the spectrum , making it worse for everybody instead of better .
For now , companies like Google that want to publish content and make it available to an international audience on the Internet have no choice but to play by the rules that have been established by individual governments .
We 've already seen some major friction between Google and various publishing companies in countries where the laws are somewhat different .
Google is working on negotiating a settlement with authors in the United States to legitimize its book scanning effort , but it lost a lawsuit in France where a court declared that the program is categorically a violation of the country 's copyright law .
Similarly , a Belgian court banned Google from indexing news that is published by 20 companies in the country .
The specific technology described in Google 's patent enables the search giant to deal with the inconsistencies in regional copyright law by programmatically managing access control in a manner that is more conducive to compliance with its legal obligations as a content distributor .
Patent questions
The validity of Google 's patent and the possibility of prior art is a matter that is open to debate .
The question of whether patents on software are valid could soon be addressed by the Supreme Court , which is evaluating a lower court decision that partially shot down the legal basis on which business method patents are rationalized .
The fact that Google was awarded the patent likely means that Project Gutenberg and other content distributors who face the same kind of copyright dilemmas as Google may not be able to implement similar systems without licensing the patent .
It 's unclear , however , if Google would even consider enforcing the patent in the event that it is infringed .
The company has stated in the past that its patent portfolio is for defensive purposes , a position that is supported so far by its actions .
Regardless of the patent 's validity or substance , the underlying problem that the described technology can solve is a very real issue for Google and a number of other companies that are struggling to contend with copyright chaos .
With the millions of poker hands are played every day online , it ’s actually a pretty amazing feat that there ’s as few problems as there are .
Until a mistake like what happened recently at Cake Poker occurs .
In what has to be a worrying case for Cake Poker , the wrong player was awarded a pot Wednesday at a $ 0.02 / $ 0.04 no-limit hold ’em table .
All the money got in preflop , and here ’s how the hand went down , according to a post at 2+2 .
Player 1 was dealt Ah Qs
Player 2 was dealt Kd Kh
The flop looked good for the pair of Kings , with the board showing 4c 4h 8h .
Things got a little dicier on the turn , a 6h , giving player 1 four cards to the nut flush .
The 9h came on the river , and the pot should have been shipping to the AQ hand , which had rivered a flush .
Instead , the pot of $ 5.36 went to the player holding KK , who had the second - nut flush .
The wrongly awarded pot was dismissed as a doctored hand history , until Lee Jones , card room manager at Cake Poker , quickly posted this in a thread at 2+2 on the subject of the hand :
Hi folks –
Unfortunately , at the moment , this appears to be real .
What ’s bizarre is how it happened this one time out of the tens of millions of hands we ’ve dealt .
Needless to say , our software people have dropped everything else to track this down .
I ’ll update you as soon as we understand what happened .
Best regards ,
Lee Jones Cake Poker Cardroom Manager
That was yesterday .
Just a few minutes ago , Jones posted again , and provided the reason for the wrongly awared pot , which is pretty complicated .
Instead of trying to explain it ourselves , we ’ll give you the answer straight from Jones :
During the hand in question , there was a player who had missed the blinds and been asked to post a dead blind in the cutoff .
He did n’t , but somehow there was a perfectly timed lag between the client and the server that caused him to have a “ Fold ” button presented ( though he may or may not have seen it ) .
Probably unknowingly , he clicked a non-existent “ Fold ” button , which went through to the server .
The server has code built in to protect it from extraneous messages such as this ( including malicious intent from hacked clients ) .
But it turned out that it did n’t have that protection from a dead blind - posting player if the message was something that should n’t have been coming in anyway ( e.g. a “ Fold ” from somebody who should n’t be allowed to fold in the first place ) .
The result of all this was for the system to believe that it had a side - pot between the sitting - out player and the small blind ( the guy with the kings ) .
It evaluated that pot , awarded that pot to the small blind , and then had no more pots to award , so it ended the hand .
Jones said the code that caused the problem has been fixed and is being tested even as we speak .
So , Cake Poker hopes this is the final word on this fairly frightening scenario for online poker players .
Jones also said that $ 500 was sent to the player who should have won the hand but did n’t , $ 250 to the poster at 2+2 who brought the problem to light , and $ 250 to the other players dealt into the hand .
Cake Poker would probably be out a lot more money if this happened at a higher - limit table .
We ’ll keep an eye on the situation .
For now , however , it looks like it ’s safe to play on Cake Poker .
I received a great question from a reader on the subject of atheists in business and the prejudice they often face .
I used to discuss issues related to atheism in the workplace quite often , but it occurs to me that it has been awhile since I posted on this important subject .
I also imagine that this is something many of you have had more experience with and might like to chime in too .
I 'd like to approach this subject from two directions , different but equally interesting .
First , there is the scenario where we have a small atheist - owned business and must contend with the owner potentially losing customers when his or her atheism becomes known .
And second , there is the case of an atheist being employed in a company where most of the prejudice encountered would be expected to come from co-workers and bosses .
I 've had more experience with the second situation , so I 'll start there .
I 'll speculate that most atheists employed in the U.S. either have faced some sort of prejudice in their place of employment or remain closeted at work in order to avoid this outcome .
I 've encountered prejudice of all kinds at the state university where I am employed ( e.g. , race , age , sexual orientation , gender , and atheism ) .
What stands out to me is that most people seem to know that it is inappropriate and try to conceal it , except when it comes to atheists .
In fact , I 've heard more than my share of anti-atheist bigotry right out in the open ( e.g. , atheists are immoral , ca n't be trusted , evil people , etc. ) .
People do not seem to put anti-atheist bigotry in the same category as the other forms , and many are not reluctant about expressing it openly I have also heard from friends and family of far more serious examples of prejudice and discrimination against atheists in the workplace .
These include repeated , unwanted invitations to attend church with the boss , mandatory attendance at sectarian prayer meetings during work , open hostility from co-workers including threats of hell , and even termination .
Particularly here in the South , being an open atheist can be an excruciatingly difficult experience in many places of employment .
At the same time , being an openly evangelical fundamentalist Christian is often encouraged , sometimes explicitly so .
This section is much more speculative since I have n't had much direct experience with atheist - owned businesses .
Based on what I know of atheist professionals ( i.e. , accountants , attorneys , psychologists , etc. ) , I 'd guess that it would be virtually impossible to run a small business in a small and rabidly Christian community as an open atheist .
I 've heard many stories of professionals in such settings losing clients after answering questions honestly about their views on religion .
I would expect the experience of atheist business owners to be highly variable by region .
In a large city located in a more educated part of the country , I suspect one could do okay even while being reasonably open about one 's atheism .
Customer word - of - mouth and the involvement of churches might be less important in such settings .
If you 've had direct experience with atheism in the workplace or running a small business as an atheist , we 'd love to hear from you .
What are your biggest challenges in such a setting , and how have you navigated the potential minefield of prejudice ?
Nearly 25 % of all mortgages are underwater
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
More bad news on the housing bust front : Nearly 25 % of all mortgage borrowers were underwater , meaning they owe more on their loans than their homes are worth .
First American CoreLogic , the research firm that monitors housing equity , reported Tuesday that 11.3 million homeowners -- or 24 % of all homes with mortgages -- were underwater as of the end of 2009 .
That 's up from 23 % and 10.7 million borrowers three month earlier .
Nevada was the state with the worst record at 70 % of all mortgaged properties underwater .
That was followed by Arizona ( 51 % ) , Florida ( 48 % ) , Michigan ( 39 % ) and California ( 35 % ) .
For many homeowners , being underwater , also know as negative equity , has few consequences .
If they 're not planning to sell and can afford their monthly bills , they can wait out the downturn .
For others , however , plunging underwater can spell disaster .
If they become unemployed or have a financial emergency , they have no equity to tap .
Or , if they need to downsize or sell their home to relocate for a job , they can't .
" Negative equity is a significant drag on both the housing market and on economic growth , " said Mark Fleming , chief economist with First American CoreLogic .
" It is driving foreclosures and decreasing mobility for millions of homeowners . "
Traditionally , being underwater was one of two main factors in determining a borrower 's likelihood of foreclosure .
The other is having sufficient income to pay bills .
But , there 's an increasingly important exception : strategic default .
As equity gets more and more negative , some homeowners are choosing to quit paying and give the keys to the bank .
As long as negative equity remains a big problem , it will be difficult to stem the tide of foreclosures that continue to plague many local real estate markets around the nation .
" Since we expect home prices to slightly increase during 2010 , negative equity will remain the dominant issue in the housing and mortgage markets for some time to come , " said Fleming .

Melting away with the snow ?
The wolverine , a predator renowned for its strength and tenacious character , may be slowly melting away along with the snowpack upon which it lives .
Research shows wolverine numbers are falling across North America .
Their decline has been linked to less snow settling as a result of climate change .
The study is the first to show a decline in the abundance of any land species due to vanishing snowpack .
Details of the wolverine 's decline are published in Population Ecology .
The wolverine lives in boreal forest across Scandinavia , northern Russia , northern China , Mongolia and North America , where it ranges mostly across six provinces or territories of western Canada .
We do n't have to just sit back and watch climate change drive animals extinct
Dr Jedediah Brodie
University of Montana
This largest member of the weasel family eats carrion and food it hunts itself , including hares , marmots , smaller rodents and young or weakened ungulates .
It has evolved for life on the snowpack , having thick fur and outsized feet that help it move across and hunt on snow .
Striking trend Wildlife biologist Dr Jedediah Brodie of the University of Montana , in Missoula , US , wondered how climate change might be having an impact on snowpack levels , and on the animals that depend on it .
He had previously researched how declining levels of snow in the US Yellowstone National Park , caused by climate change , was changing the abundance of aspen trees and how elk feed on them .
Dr Brodie and his colleague , Professor Eric Post of Pennsylvania State University , at University Park , US , gathered data on snowpack levels across six provinces or territories of Canada : Alberta , British Columbia , Manitoba , the Northwest Territories , Saskatchewan and the Yukon Territory .
In all bar the Yukon , he found that snowpack depth declined significantly between 1968 and 2004 .
Other studies have shown corresponding rising temperatures and declining precipitation across much of the western US .
LIFE IN THE SNOW : FIND OUT MORE
Wolverines are the largest terrestrial members of the weasel family , weighing about 10 - 25 kg
As adaptations to living on snow , they have short legs , outsized feet , stocky bodies and thick , extremely warm fur Reindeer herds around the world are also in decline as a result of industrial development and climate change , but as yet , these declines have not specifically been linked to declines in snow cover " It occurred to me that a good first place to look for ecological impacts of that snowpack decline would be with a snow - adapted species like the wolverine , " Dr Brodie told the BBC .
" Fortuitously , Canada has good records of both snowpack trends over time as well as trends in the harvest of all sorts of fur - bearing animals . "
So Dr Brodie and Professor Post examined the records of wolverine numbers caught by fur trappers over the same period .
They found a striking correlation between declining snowpack and falling numbers of the predator .
" In provinces where winter snowpack levels are declining fastest , wolverine populations tend to be declining most rapidly , " the researchers wrote in the journal article .
" Spring snowpack also appears to influence wolverine population dynamics . "
The researchers found only one territory , the Northwest Territories , where wolverine numbers are increasing .
There , snowpack levels are declining but they remain much higher and less variable than in most other provinces .
Food scarcity
Dr Brodie cannot be sure why wolverine numbers are falling , but he has his suspicions .
" Recent work shows that wolverines appear to use areas with deep snowpack for dispersal .
So reduced snowpack could make dispersal more difficult or dangerous , potentially reducing the success rate with which individuals can establish new home ranges , " he says .
" Reduced snowpack may also make it harder for wolverines to get food , for several reasons .
" First , harsh winters and deep snow are major causes of mortality for ungulates like elk , moose , deer and caribou .
" If milder winters mean that fewer of these animals die over the course of the winter , then there will be fewer carcasses for wolverines to feed on , " he explains .
As climate change worsens , we should reduce trapping and disturbance to boreal forest
Dr Jedediah Brodie
University of Montana " Wolverines also hunt rodents , and this food source may be important for wolverine reproductive success in some areas .
" But shallower snowpack is bad for a lot of rodents because it provides less insulation from the cold .
" So if declining snowpack reduces rodent abundance , that could be bad for wolverines . "
Dr Brodie believes that his is the first study to show a decline in species abundance due to a reducing snowpack - for any land animal , not just those in North America .
But he says there are interesting parallels in marine systems .
" For example , sea ice is critical for polar bear foraging . "
Polar bear body condition , reproductive rates , and survival have declined significantly in Hudson Bay as sea ice breaks up earlier in the spring , he says .
" At the other end of the globe , Antarctic sea ice has increased over recent decades .
" This may have negative impacts on adelie penguin populations that depend on ice - free areas for breeding and foraging .
" But we do n't have to just sit back and watch climate change drive animals extinct , " he says .
" As climate change worsens , we should reduce trapping levels and also disturbance to boreal forest habitats .
" Reducing the impact of these anthropogenic stressors could help ' offset ' the impacts of climate change on wolverines . "

Is the euro on the road to perdition ?
The eurozone stands at a critical juncture and could be very different after the Greek economic crisis is over .
“ Ford to City : drop dead ” was how , in October 1975 , the New York Daily News summed up then US president Gerald Ford ’s threat to block a $ 1 billion bail - out package for a near - bankrupt New York City .
A month later , New York ’s political leaders returned to Washington , DC to get the loans they needed – but only after submitting a credible plan to control the city ’s budget .
No European politician is going to send the feckless Greeks quite so blunt a public message as Ford did to the Big Apple .
But the Eurogroup – the finance ministers of the eurozone – on Monday night ( 15 February ) correctly delivered to the Greek government a message that if financial support is needed , the terms will be humiliating and punitive .
George Papandreou , Greece ’s prime minister , has been told that the eurozone is not going to be held to ransom by a country that accounts for a mere 3 % of its gross domestic product .
Some ( already weakened ) eurozone banks are holding more IOUs from Athens than is good for them , and there is indeed a risk of contagion to other frail eurozone debtor nations .
But , as Papandreou is being reminded , by far the biggest losers from a Greek default will be Greeks .
It is not the case , as Papandreou maintained last week , that Greece has become “ a laboratory animal in the battle between Europe and the markets ” .
Instead , what he is experiencing is further proof , if more were needed , of Margaret Thatcher ’s famous adage that “ you ca n’t buck the market ” , at least not for decades on end .
For a generation – this is far from the first time that Greece has flirted with financial disaster – its politicians ( including Papandreou ’s father ) and its central bankers have thumbed their noses at both the markets and EU officials .
They have ignored calls to collect taxes from the rich , to reduce the size of a bloated civil service , and to stop subsiding fuel and encouraging corruption .
And they have ignored calls to reform a political system that encourages the middle - classes to rip off the state and lets bureaucrats and many middle - class peoplebelieve they have a right to retire before the age of 50 .
For a generation , Greece ’s politicians and its central bankers have thumbed their noses at both the markets and EU officials
Vulnerable borrowers
Greece is a test case .
Unless it is handled wisely , speculators will see a bail - out of Athens as an invitation to move on to Portugal , Spain or ( and those wallowing in schadenfreude in London should take note ) the vulnerable borrowers ensconced in 10 and 11 Downing Street , London .
So the EU , not just the eurozone , has an interest in forcing Greece to put together a credible package to control its finances and to send a message to speculators ( and to the other EU capitals ) that a politically inspired fudge is not an option .
The Greek government needs plenty of heavily conditioned financial support to help it push through vital reforms .
Without such finance , reform will fail .
The alternative scenario is that people will take to the streets and block change , as overhasty efforts to slash decades of excess hit an already weakening economy , triggering a vicious circle of declining growth and burgeoning debt .
International investors , seeing such threats take shape , would refuse to roll over the state ’s already crippling debts , provoking a true liquidity crisis and , ultimately , default .
Indeed , it is hard to imagine the Greek government ( or any other ) credibly committing itself to the tough actions that are needed without an assurance that , if it does fulfil its side of the bargain , it will have reliable access to official funds to hold the markets at bay should economic conditions deteriorate further .
Swallowing hard , eurozone leaders will have to involve the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in the provision of such support .
However , the precise scope of the IMF ’s oversight will have to be worked out ( for example , who decides what to do and when if the Greek government fails to live up to its commitments ? ) .
The eurozone is at a fork in the road .
The issue is not whether the current crisis will quickly lead to the break - up of the eurozone .
It is what sort of eurozone will be left when this crisis is over .
Will it continue to be the hard currency , stability - focused , low - inflation area its founding fathers imagined ?
Or will it have set off on the road to perdition , a soft currency , distrusted by investors and citizens alike , a plaything for speculators around the world ?
Otmar Issing , the former chief economist of the European Central Bank who devised its monetary policy strategy and who remains a guardian of the single currency flame , warned on Tuesday ( 16 February ) that “ this is a decisive moment for economic and monetary union .... a bail - out [ of Greece ] that broke the rules would make it impossible to deny aid to others ” .
This “ last chance ” for Greece , he said , also represents a “ final test ” for economic and monetary union .
Culture clash
Greece , too , is at a fork in the road .
If reform is to happen , even with official financial support , it will require the Greek people to provide a positive answer to an existential question .
The eurozone is a currency region built on the political culture of the German people – northern Europeans brought up to pay their taxes and believe that there is something called ‘ society ’ , which is state - sponsored , which needs to be fostered and with which they have a mutually beneficial relationship .
The Greeks are not the same .
Perhaps deep down they do not want to be part of the eurozone , even of the Union .
Perhaps they really are incapable of making the deep cultural ( and political ) changes needed to maintain their membership .
If that is so they should be helped to leave , but they should not be permitted to lay waste to a project that is vital to Europe ’s global role .
You reported on the 1968 interview with John Lennon that I published in the New Statesman , which revolved around Lennon 's " furious " response to a letter attacking him and his song Revolution for being " unfavourably compared to the BBC radio drama Mrs Dale 's Diary " ( Day in the life : Lennon 's six - hour interview with student revealed , 17 December ) .
The article says Lennon was " enraged " by the letter , in " Tariq Ali's radical journal " Black Dwarf .
As you say , " The Beatles might have changed their image , but had lost none of their fire , [ Lennon ] insisted . "
And in ­January 1969 , in his own letter to the magazine , Lennon expressed irritation at being " ticked off " by " brothers in endless fucking prose " .
But in the actual conversation – triggered when I showed him the letter , which was so patronising I knew it was bound to get him going – Lennon 's response was initially dismissive , unsurprising given that this was the first time he 'd seen it .
He was not a regular reader of Ali 's ultra - left paper : in fact the open letter to him had appeared a month before the interview .
But the idea that by the time John Lennon was shot dead in 1980 he " had long since made his peace with Tariq Ali , and regained his radical laurels " , is wrong .
It is true that Lennon flirted with the left in the early 70s , mainly in New York , employing his song - writing and rhetorical talents in the cause of justice and the promotion of peace .
It is therefore perhaps apt that you quote from the interview Lennon did with Ali and Robin Blackburn for Red Mole in 1971 , to the effect that " Lennon agreed with Ali that he was becoming ' increasingly radical and political ' " .
But that was 1971 .
Lennon 's political radicalism was in fact a relatively short - lived affair , as readers of his collection of ( mostly ) late 1970s writings , Skywriting by Word of Mouth , will know .
Lennon much regretted his earlier association with the radical left , as the contents of the chapter entitled " We 'd all love to see the plan " ( quoting from the song Revolution ) make clear .
Writing in 1978 , he stated : " The biggest mistake Yoko and I made in that period was allowing ourselves to become influenced by the male - macho ' serious revolutionaries ' , and their insane ideas about killing people to save them from capitalism and / or ­communism ( depending on your point of view ) .
We should have stuck to our own way of working for peace : bed-ins , billboards , etc . "
Lennon 's primary gift was for writing and recording songs that communicate with millions in ways that no ideologically driven political creed – whether of the left or right – ever could .
In the book I am writing about the relationship between Lennon 's songs and his life , I explore the communicating power of his music .
The book also draws on my recollections of the 75 % of the Lennon interview that has yet to be revealed – your reporter could not know that what appeared in the New Statesman is far from being " the full version " .
A new study by the Economic Policy Institute takes on the idea that immigration is causing a drop in wages of U.S. - born workers .
Rather , it suggests that immigration actually increases the wages of U.S. - born workers overall , but may lower those of immigrant workers already here .
The study is entitled “ Immigration and Wages : Methodological Advancements Confirm Modest Gains for Native Workers , ” and is authored by Heidi Shierholz .
The study is a bit on the technical side , but worth a read anyway for anybody who is confronted by friends , relatives or coworkers who are convinced that immigration creates competition for a limited number of jobs , and therefore must act to bring wages down .
The idea that the sheer number of workers in the country at a given time determines what wages they can attain is an old one , but it is fallacious .
It has frequently been brought into the debate on immigration , but also pops up elsewhere , as a red herring to distract workers ’ attention from the real reasons for low wages such as weak labor laws and unfettered corporate power .
Since the January 12 earthquake in Haiti , for example , numerous commentators attribute Haiti ’s pre-earthquake poverty to overpopulation .
This allows them to ignore the role played by imperialism and inequitable trade relationships in blocking poor countries from advancing economically .
In the case of immigrants coming to the United States , Shierholz puts it succinctly : “ Although immigrant workers add to the labor supply , they also consume goods and services , creating more jobs .
In other words , as the labor force expands ( as it is always doing , due to both native population growth and immigration ) the economy adjusts and expands with it , and average wages are not hurt . ”
Otherwise , she further points out , each child who graduated from school and entered the labor force could be accused of bringing down the wages of existing workers .
Schierholz might also have mentioned that most immigrant workers pay into Social Security and Medicare , as well as paying federal and state income taxes .
All pay local property taxes ( many through their rent ) and sales taxes , things which also create public sector jobs .
There are exceptions , for example when employers deliberately play off immigrant and native - born workers against each other .
But the point is that overall , immigration per se does not automatically bring down wages , any more than natural population growth does .
Shierholz ’s study uses the “ national ” approach , a methodology which in the past has led to claims , by George Borjas and others , that immigration brings down wages .
But Shierholz adds the concept of “ substitutability ” ( or elasticity of substitution ) among sectors of the working population .
This means the degree to which one worker , or set of workers , could be substituted for another in a given category of jobs .
So for example when more people get advanced degrees in nuclear physics , it does not bring down the wages of taxi drivers , because people who have the set of skills needed for driving taxis do not have the skills needed to be nuclear physicists ( and vice versa ) .
No increase in the number of people with taxi licenses will lower wages of the physicists , and no increase in the number of physicists will affect the earnings of the taxi drivers .
Further , Shierholz groups workers differently , regarding those who have no high school diploma and those who have a high school diploma but nothing more as basically the same in terms of substitutability within the present and recent labor market .
She then analyzes immigration and wage date for the years 1994 through 2007 , breaking the data down by immigrant and native born , male and female , race , and educational level .
She pays special attention to comparing the states which experienced most immigration in that period ( California , Texas , Florida and New York ) with the rest of the country .
Her overall conclusion is that new immigration actually increased wages for U.S. - born workers , but reduced wages for immigrant workers already in the country .
The results were not even across the board , but on the average , U.S. - born workers saw an increase of wages due to immigration from 1994 to 2007 of $ 3.68 a week .
This works out to $ 2.78 for women and $ 4.32 for men .
This was even greater in states with many immigrants than the national average .
The higher the educational level , the more the increase for women .
But for native - born men , there was a slight dip for those with no high school or only high school .
For immigrants however , there was a drop in weekly earnings of $ 33.11 overall : $ 28.59 for women and $ 46.92 for men .
This was worse at the higher educational levels .
There was state - to - state variation .
So new immigrants are in a sense “ competing ” with immigrants already here , not just by existing but by reason of the high level of substitutability of their skill sets .
But native - born American workers are either benefited or only slightly harmed .
Shierholz recognizes a major problem , namely the near impossibility of sorting out , from the available national statistics , undocumented immigrants from other immigrants , as well as categories like guest workers .
This is important because within a given category of “ substitutable ” workers , those that can be forced to work longer hours for less pay are more likely to have a negative impact on wages of the rest .
Clearly , undocumented workers and guest workers are used by employers to control wages .
This is not due their mere existence or to any “ cultural characteristics ” of those workers , but to their powerlessness .
Though many show that they are eager to join unions and fight for higher wages ( which would benefit all workers , especially in their “ substitutable ” categories ) , they are stopped from doing so by the conditions they have to put up with both on the job and in the community .
This is another good reason for a comprehensive immigration reform that embraces legalization of immigrants already here and a change in visa policies so that people do not have to come illegally or as easily exploited “ guest workers . ”
Words like mother and love often appear on lists of beautiful English words .
But so do defenestration and lollygag .
Obviously , they are not all chosen for the same reason .
Some words tug at the heart , some pique the mind and others are simply euphonious .
Perhaps the strangest member of the last category , the purely harmonious , is the otherwise ordinary phrase cellar door .
The claim that cellar door is beautiful to the ear — in opposition to its prosaic meaning — has been made by and attributed to a wide variety of writers over the years .
“ Poetry , in fact , is two quite distinct things , ” H. L. Mencken wrote in a 1920 magazine column .
“ It may be either or both .
One is a series of words that are intrinsically musical , in clang - tint and rhythm , as the single word cellar - door is musical .
The other is a series of ideas , false in themselves , that offer a means of emotional and imaginative escape from the harsh realities of everyday . ”
More recently , the superior sound of cellar door was mentioned in the 2001 movie “ Donnie Darko , ” in which a cellar serves as a time - twisting portal .
In one scene , the main character , Donnie , sees the phrase on a schoolroom chalkboard .
He asks his teacher why it ’s on the board , and she explains that the words are thought to be especially lovely , vaguely attributing the idea to a “ famous linguist . ”
The fantasy writer J. R. R. Tolkien , who was also a philologist , might well be the linguist she had in mind .
He mentioned the idea of cellar door ’s special beauty in a speech in 1955 and is often given credit for it .
Other supposed authors abound ; the story is tangled .
But Tolkien , at least , can be ruled out as the originator .
He was , after all , just 11 years old in 1903 when a curious novel called “ Gee- Boy ” — which also alludes to the aesthetic properties of cellar door — was published by the Shakespeare scholar Cyrus Lauron Hooper .
Hooper ’s narrator writes of the title character : “ He even grew to like sounds unassociated with their meaning , and once made a list of the words he loved most , as doubloon , squadron , thatch , fanfare ( he never did know the meaning of this one ) , Sphinx , pimpernel , Caliban , Setebos , Carib , susurro , torquet , Jungfrau .
He was laughed at by a friend , but logic was his as well as sentiment ; an Italian savant maintained that the most beautiful combination of English sounds was cellar - door ; no association of ideas here to help out !
sensuous impression merely !
the cellar - door is purely American . ”
Shark attacks :
On the increase ?
By BBC News Online 's Kate McGeown
In the last few days , three people have been attacked by sharks off America 's east coast , two of them fatally .
On Monday , a Russian man was killed and his wife critically injured as they walked through shallow water off a beach in North Carolina .
Just two days before , 10 - year - old David Peltier was killed further up the coast , in Virginia .
These recent incidents will further exacerbate concerns among the US public that shark attacks are increasing .
Earlier this summer , a series of high - profile cases led to renewed interest in the issue .
It 's a media frenzy not a feeding frenzy
George Burgess , University of Florida
The media has lost no time in speculating on the reasons behind the behaviour of the ocean 's most feared predators .
A recent US edition of Time magazine even devoted its front page to the " Summer of the Shark " .
But George Burgess , director of the International Shark Attack Files at the University of Florida , said the number of attacks this year was actually nothing unusual - if anything , the overall annual figure is likely to be lower than last year .
Instead , he said that a couple of highly publicised cases earlier this year had fuelled interest in shark attacks , and since then almost every incident , however minor , had been reported .
On 6 July , eight - year - old Jessie Arbogast had his arm bitten off by a bull shark in knee - deep water in the Gulf of Mexico .
He remains in a coma .
And earlier this month , two New York bankers were attacked in the Bahamas , with one , Krishna Thompson , losing his leg .
But the other recent incidents have been fairly minor , and while Mr Burgess was quick to extend his sympathy to the victims , he said that according to the statistics , this year was nothing special .
" It 's a media frenzy not a feeding frenzy , " he said .
On the increase While 2001 may not break any records , in the long term there is no doubt that the number of shark - related incidents is on the increase .
The ISAF listed 79 confirmed cases in 2000 , compared to 58 in 1999 and only 37 a decade ago in 1990 .
A number of theories have been given to explain the increase - ranging from environmental factors such as global warming to the increased popularity of aquatic sports .
These factors vary from region to region , and also on the species of shark .
But the most controversial theory is that sharks are being lured into shallow water by specific feeding events set up for tourists .
The annual risk of death from lightning is 30 times greater than that from a shark attack
George Burgess Mr Burgess admitted that this may be an issue in some areas of the world .
In the Bahamas , for example , there are several organisations which give food to sharks to lure them into sight for tourists .
There are also a couple of small - scale operations in Florida , although recent proposals may lead to them being banned .
But the most obvious reason for the increased attacks , according to Mr Burgess , is the gain in visitors to the beaches of America 's east coast , drawn by the popular sports of diving and surfing .
Last year , a record 90 million people flocked to the Florida 's resorts .
" There is no doubt that being attacked by a shark is an odds game , " said Mr Burgess .
" When there are more people , there are more attacks . "
Surfers targeted Surfers are particularly at risk - all six victims over the weekend were surfers , and Mr Burgess said that surfing is a " provocative activity " to sharks .
In part , this is because surfers spend most of their time in the " splash zone " , which is also the area where sharks congregate to look for prey .
Surfers also create splash themselves , further exacerbating the problem .
When there is a lot of white water and splash , visibility is reduced , and many sharks mistake surfers for prey .
There is also speculation that sharks occasionally mistake divers in wetsuits for seals or sealions , and in some areas of the world , such as Australia or Hawaii , people paddling on their surfboards may be confused for turtles .
Whether this is actually the case or not , the clear indication is that a shark attack of this sort is a case of mistaken identity rather than a deliberate attempt to harm humans .
In almost all attacks , the shark quickly realises its mistake and releases its grip , Mr Burgess said , allowing the victim to get away .
Cases when a shark specifically targets a human are very rare , and only happen about once a year .
Unfair press
Mr Burgess said there is a big misconception about shark attacks .
Reducing the risk Always stay in groups
Do not wander too far from the shore
Do not wear shiny jewellery
Do not enter the water if bleeding Avoid waters where there are signs of bait fishing Refrain from excess splashing Signs of porpoises do not indicate an absence of sharks
Use extra caution when waters are murky Evacuate the water if sharks are there Source : ISAF
The vast majority are not life - threatening , with only an average of eight deaths a year worldwide .
" That is very low compared to the hundreds of millions of person hours in the sea , " he said .
Sharks often get bad press .
They can't be as easily controlled by man as land - based animals such as large cats and bear .
Shoot a land - based predator and the danger goes away , but disposing of your would - be enemy is not so easy in the sea .
Mr Burgess put the actual danger in perspective .
" Bees , wasps and snakes are responsible for far more fatalities a year , " he said .
" And the annual risk of death from lightning is 30 times greater than that from a shark attack . "
Add to that the millions of sharks that are killed every year for their fins , meat and skin - so much so that some species are now close to extinction - and sharks do not seem quite the villains that some would make them out to be .

Farmers ' fields are a bigger source of water contamination in China than factory effluent , the Chinese government revealed today in its first census on pollution .
Senior officials said the disclosure , after a two - year study involving 570,000 people , would require a partial realignment of environmental policy from smoke stacks to chicken coops , cow sheds and fruit orchards .
Despite the sharp upward revision of figures on rural contamination , the government suggested the country 's pollution problem may be close to - or even past - a peak .
That claim is likely to prompt scepticism among environmental groups .
The release of the groundbreaking report was reportedly delayed by resistance from the agriculture ministry , which had previously insisted that farms contributed only a tiny fraction of pollution in China .
The census disproves these claims completely .
According to the study , agriculture is responsible for 43.7 % of the nation 's chemical oxygen demand ( the main measure of organic compounds in water ) , 67 % of phosphorus and 57 % of nitrogen discharges .
At the launch of the paper , Wang Yangliang of the ministry of agriculture recognised the fall - out from intensive farming methods .
" Fertilisers and pesticides have played an important role in enhancing productivity but in certain areas improper use has had a grave impact on the environment , " he said .
" The fast development of livestock breeding and aquaculture has produced a lot of food but they are also major sources of pollution in our lives . "
He said the ministry would introduce measures to improve the efficiency of pesticide and fertiliser use , to expand biogas generation from animal waste , and to change agricultural lifestyles to protect the environment .
While the high figure for rural pollution is partly explained by the immense size of China 's agricultural sector , it also reflects the country 's massive dependency on artificial farm inputs such as fertilisers .
The government says this is necessary because China uses only 7 % of the world 's land to feed 22 % of the global population .
An industrial lobby is pushing for even greater use of chemicals .
It includes the huge power company CNOOC , which runs the country 's largest nitrogen fertiliser factory in Hainan 's Dongfang City .
But the returns on this chemical investment are poor .
According to a recent Greenpeace report , the country consumes 35 % of the world 's nitrogen fertiliser , which wastes energy and other resources , while adding to water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions .
" Agricultural pollution has become one of China 's gravest environmental crises , " said Greenpeace campaign director Sze Pangcheung .
" China needs to step up the fight against the overuse of fertilisers and pesticides and promote ecological agriculture which has obvious advantages for human heath , the environment , and sustainable development of agriculture . "
Wen Tiejun , dean of the school of agriculture and rural development at Renmin university , said the survey should be used as a turning point .
His research suggested that Chinese farmers used almost twice as much fertiliser as they needed .
" For almost all of China 's 5,000 - year history , agriculture had given our country a carbon - absorbing economy but in the past 40 years , agriculture has become one of the top pollution sources , " he said .
" Experience shows that we do n't have to rely on chemical farming to resolve the food security issue .
The government needs to foster low - pollution agriculture . "
But in what appears to be a statistical sleight of hand , the government said the new agricultural data and other figures from the census would not be used to evaluate the success of its five - year plan to reduce pollution by 10 % .
Zhang Lijun , the environmental protection vice - minister , claimed China was cleaning up its pollution problem far faster than other countries during their dirty stage of development .
" Because China follows a different pattern of development , it is very likely that pollution will peak when per capita income reaches US $ 3,000 , " he said , comparing this with the $ 8,000 he said was the norm in other nations .
If true , it would suggest the worst of China 's pollution problems may already be over .
According to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund , per capita incomes in China have already passed this point .
If exchange rates and a low cost of living are factored in , Chinese incomes may be equivalent to more than $ 6,000 .
But Zhang 's claim is contestable .
As countless pollution scandals have revealed , many industries and local governments routinely under - report emissions and waste .
Many harmful or controversial forms of pollution are either not measured - as is the case for carbon dioxide and small particle emissions - or the data is not made public , as is the case for ozone .
Zheng said the government would expand its monitoring system in the next five - year plan .
Extracts from China 's first pollution report ( for 2007 ) :
• Sulphur dioxide emissions 23.2 million tonnes ( 91.3 % from industry )
• Nitrogen oxide emissions : 18 million tonnes ( 30 % from vehicles )
• Chemical oxygen demand discharges : 30.3 billion tonnes ( 44 % from agriculture )
• Soot : 11.7 million tonnes .
• Solid waste : 3.8 billion tonnes ( of which 45.7 m tonnes is hazardous )
• Heavy metal discharges : 900 tonnes
• Livestock faeces : 243 million tonnes .
• Livestock urine : 163 million tonnes
• Plastic film on cropfields : 121,000 tonnes ( 80.3 % recycled )

In " The Quest for Innocence and the Loss of Reality in Political Journalism on PressThink , Jay Rosen puts his finger on a major failing in American political journalism .
Namely , that in the name of objectivity , political reporters shun evaluation of the objective truth of political claims .
Rosen takes a recent and very good NYT story on the Tea Party movement , in which the reporter , David Barstow , describes the Tea Party movement as being built around a " narrative of impending tyranny . "
But , Rosen notes , Barstow shies away from writing about whether there is an actual danger of impending tyranny — whether it 's likely that guns will be seized , concentration camps established , and so on .
This despite the fact that these events — if real — would be major stories in their own right , but comments on their truthfulness are off - limits because political reporting must be " objective " and evaluating the truthfulness of these statements would be tantamount to taking sides .
In a word , the Times editors and Barstow know this narrative is nuts , but something stops them from saying so– despite the fact that they must have spent over $ 100,000 on this one story .
And whatever that thing is , it 's not the reluctance to voice an opinion in the news columns , but a reluctance to report a fact in the news columns , the fact that the " narrative of impending tyranny " is ungrounded in any observable reality , even though the sense of grievance within the Tea Party movement is truly felt and politically consequential …
The quest for innocence in political journalism means the desire to be manifestly agenda- less and thus " prove " in the way you describe things that journalism is not an ideological trade .
But this can get in the way of describing things !
As it did in Barstow 's account .
Now let 's speed up the picture and imagine how this interference in truth - telling happens routinely , many times a day over years and years of reporting on politics .
What 's lost is that sense of reality Isaiah Berlin talked about .
In its place is savviness , the dialect of insiders trying to persuade us that they know how things really work .
Nothing is more characteristic of the savvy style than statements like " perception is often reality in politics . "
Master ’s Degree in Islamic Texts
Zaytuna ’s master of arts degree in Islamic texts is intended to provide students with higher - level access to the Islamic tradition through a guided course of study in Islam ’s primary sources .
Women are more drawn to true crime books than are men , according to research in the inaugural issue of Social Psychological and Personality Science ( published by SAGE ) .
The true crime genre of nonfiction books is based on gruesome topics such as rape and murder .
Many people might assume that men , being the more aggressive sex , would be most likely to find such gory topics interesting .
The researchers found that what makes these books appealing to women are relevant in terms of preventing or surviving a crime .
For example , by understanding why an individual decides to kill , a woman can learn the warning signs to watch for in a jealous lover or stranger .
By learning escape tips women learn survival strategies they can use if actually kidnapped or held captive .
It is possible that reading these books may actually increase the very fear that drives women toward them in the first place .
In other words , a vicious cycle may be occurring : A woman fears becoming the victim of a crime so she turns to true crime books in a possible effort to learn strategies and techniques to prevent becoming murdered .
However , with each true crime book she reads , this woman learns about another murderer and his victims , thereby increasing her awareness and fear of crime .
" It is not possible to state with certainty from these studies whether or not this vicious cycle occurs , " write authors Amanda M. Vicary and R. Chris Fraley .
" But we do know that women , compared to men , have a heightened fear of crime despite the fact that they are less likely to become a victim . "
In the middle of December , an article was published by a senior News Corp executive in Australia that claimed among other things that those standing against censorship in Australia were “ communists ” who had no real understanding of history .
We ’re not linking to an organization that purposely defames those who disagree with it , but the article claimed that there was no parallels between what is happening in Australia , and what has previously occurred in places like Nazi Germany , Iran or China .
“ … the arguments being mounted against his plan – and specifically against him [ Conroy ] , as for some unfathomable reason this has become a bitchy personal campaign – fall into three woeful categories .
The historically inaccurate , the deliberately incorrect , and the morally ambivalent ….. casually compare the conduct of the Rudd Government to the dictatorships in China , Iran , Burma , the former Soviet Bloc . ”
I have to LOL at being called a Communist as it ’s the first time I ’ve been labeled anywhere moderately to the left of the center , but I digress because nothing speaks louder than facts to combat those who are so pathetic as to call those who disagree with them “ communists . ”
Wo n’t someone think of the children ?
Censorship is always justified for a reason , usually on the grounds of protecting society from the content being censored .
Children are usually somewhere near the top of the list .
Stephen Conroy
“ It is important that all Australians , particularly young children , are protected from this material … .
The Government believes that parents want assistance to reduce the risk of children being exposed to such material . ” ( ref )
“ Online safety is critical for children to enjoy positive internet experiences , and to protect themselves from danger . ” ( ref )
Adolf Hitler
“ The state must declare the child to be the most precious treasure of the people .
As long as government is perceived as working for the benefit of children , the people happily will endure almost any curtailment of liberty . ” ( ref )
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
“ Teachers and professors , you must be alert to watch your own colleagues to see if some of them are trying to teach deviating thoughts during their lessons to the children of our Islamic nation so that they can be stopped ” ( ref )
Lenin
Destroy the family , you destroy the country … .
Give me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted …. ideological talk and phrase mongering about political liberties should be disposed with ; all that is just mere chatter and phrase mongering .
We should get away from those phrases . ” ( various…ref )
Qin Gang , a Foreign Ministry spokesman for China on censorship
“ If you have children or are expecting a child , you could understand the concerns of parents over unhealthy online content . ” ( ref )
When it starts
The broader history of censorship is full of examples where censorship is first introduced on a smaller scale , usually justified in protecting people , then over time becomes something far more sinister .
China quote
“ Professor Jonathan Zittrain , of Harvard ’s Berkman Center said : “ Once you ’ve got government - mandated software installed on each machine , the software has the keys to the kingdom …
While the justification may be pitched as protecting children and mostly concerning pornography , once the architecture is set up it can be used for broader purposes , such as the filtering of political ideas . ” ( ref )
Once you have censorship , Government ’s find extra uses , no matter what they say to begin with .
Joseph Goebbels : “ It is the absolute right of the State to supervise the formation of public opinion ”
Nazi Germany
Of note to historians of Nazi Germany is the gradual increase in censorship from the beginnings of the Third Reich to its end .
On the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda : “ The Ministry grew steadily .
It began in 1933 with five departments and 350 employees .
By 1939 , there were 2000 employees in 17 departments .
Between 1933 and 1941 , the Ministry ’s budget grew from 14 million to 187 million Reichsmarks . ” ( ref . )
Conroy is boosting numbers in “ cyber safety ” including the hiring of an additional 91 police officers and an expansion of ACMA programs .
China
Of note in China is that formal censorship is more of a late bloomer in the country , with all press owned by the State in China until well into the 80s and 90s ( hence it was controlled by political means . )
Foreign works were censored during the cultural revolution , however a broad basis under law came later .
Of direct parallel ( and mentioned above ) is China ’s more recent crackdown on pornography in an effort to “ save the children . ”
Iran
Censorship in Iran has expanded in the past year following the student uprising in 2009 .
Where as Iran had a fairly liberal censorship regime ( for that part of the world )
Iran now monitors and blocks large chunks of the internet and other forms of communication ( no reference needed , check Google or Wikipedia for the latest . )
The censorship infrastructure in place , it was simply a matter of expanding its reach .
Australia
The risk in Australia is presented by the misplaced popularism of the Government , specifically in its false belief that the policy is wanted .
All it takes is some targeted lobbying from groups who will deliver votes to the ALP , and Conroy decides to extend the filter .
Minister Conroy has waffled about what would and would n’t be included since coming to power , along with a double back - flip on the filter being compulsory or not ; remember it was Labor ’s policy at the last election that the filter would be optional NOT compulsory .
That Conroy now states that the filter will never be extended is impossible to believe given that he has already clearly changed what he has said previously .
Conclusion
Given a full day or five this post could be far more extensive in its examples of how Australia ’s draconian internet censorship policy has rich historical precedents in other countries .
However the examples prove to a point that the rhetoric and current direction of the Australian Government on censorship does have parallels with totalitarian regimes past and present .
You might be able to argue the degree of similarities , but remember that when Conroy says that someone should think of the children , he follows in the footsteps of Hitler , Lenin and many other dictators over the years .
When he says that censorship is protecting us from bad stuff , he follows in the footsteps of Iran and China who both use the same arguments when defending their censorship laws .
The internet censorship proposal from the Australian Government must be stopped ; even if we concede that the chances of Australia turning into the next Iran are slim , that there is a chance now the door is open is a chance never worth taking .
Free speech is far too important to risk on a throw of a dice , or as the case may be the words of a Minister who is proven to be a man who ca n’t keep his word .
US Claims Right To Assassinate Americans Overseas
U.S. Says It Has Right To Kill American Terror Suspects Abroad Without A Trial By Sherwood Ross
Aping the assassination tactics of Josef Stalin , the U.S. has created an illegal “ hit list ” of Americans abroad marked for murder .
Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told a House Intelligence Committee hearing February 3rd the U.S. may , with executive approval , target and kill American terrorist suspects , Inter Press News Service of Rome reported .
” We take direct action against terrorists in the intelligence community , ” he said .
Blair ’s statement recalls the policies of Soviet Russia ’s secret police , who often murdered those who fled Stalin ’s tyranny .
Red Army founder Leon Trotsky , for example , was tracked to Mexico by a Soviet agent who killed him with an ice pick .
Ben Wizner , staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project , said , ” It is alarming to hear that the Obama administration is asserting that the president can authorize the assassination of Americans abroad , even if they are far from any battlefield and may have never taken up arms against the U.S. , but have only been deemed to constitute an unspecified ' threat ' ”
Blair 's remarks followed a Washington Post article reporting President Barack Obama had embraced President George W. Bush ’s policy of authorizing the killing of U.S. citizens involved in terrorist activities overseas .
The Post reported : “ After the Sep. 11 , 2001 , attacks , Bush gave the CIA , and later the military , authority to kill U.S. citizens abroad if strong evidence existed that an American was involved in organizing or carrying out terrorist actions against the United States or U.S. interests , military and intelligence officials said .
The evidence has to meet a certain , defined threshold .
The person , for example , has to pose ' a continuing and imminent threat ' to U.S. persons and interests . ”
Attorney George Brent Mickum , an American lawyer who has defended a number of Guantanamo Bay detainees , told Inter Press , ” I guess my sense is that it 's just more fear mongering .
They kill somebody and do n't need to offer any justification . ”
” We have killed thousands of innocent civilians while attempting to target alleged operatives , ” Mickum said .
“ And let us not forget how frequently our intelligence has been wrong about alleged operatives , ” he added .
“ My clients Bisher al Rawi , Jamil el - Banna , Martin Mubanga , abu Zubaydah , and Shaker Aamer all are alleged to have been operatives based on intel .
In every case that intel was incorrect , ” Mickum told Inter Press .
“ I do n't have any expectation that our intel with respect to alleged American operatives is likely to be any better . ”
“ This extrajudicial execution of human beings constitutes a grave violation of international human rights law and , under certain circumstances , can also constitute a war crime under the Four Geneva Conventions of 1949 , ” said Francis Boyle , University of Illinois professor of international law at Champaign .
“ In addition , the extrajudicial execution of U.S. citizens by the United States government also violates the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution mandating that no person " be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . "
Boyle said , “ The U.S. Government has now established a ‘ death list ’ for U.S. citizens abroad akin to those established by Latin American dictatorships during their so - called ‘ dirty wars . ’ ”
He claimed President Bush “ reduced the United States of America to a Banana Republic waging a ‘ dirty war ’ around the world in gross violation of international law , human rights law , and the laws of war .
It is only a matter of time before the United States government will establish a similar ‘ death list ’ targeting U.S. citizens living here at home . ”
He added that , “ As someone who used to teach Constitutional law , President Obama knows better . ”
Boyle , a leading U.S. authority in international law , drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 for the U.S.
He is the author of a number of books in his field , including “ Destroying World Order ” ( Clarity ) .
Daphne Eviatar , an attorney with Human Rights First , told Inter Press , ” The short answer is that combatants can be targeted and civilians cannot under international law .
Their citizenship is n't relevant .
But just being a ' suspected terrorist ' does n't necessarily mean they 're a combatant . ”
She added , ” The key question , and where there may be serious disagreement , is whether the person targeted is ' directly participating in hostilities ' .
If not , and they 're targeted , it 's a war crime . ”
Chip Pitts , president of the Bill of Rights Defence Committee , told Inter Press , ” As with its embrace of the [ George W. ]
Bush approach to indefinite detention , the Obama administration 's even greater reliance on targeted extra-judicial killing - including of U.S. citizens - is a tragic legal , moral , and practical mistake . ”
” Even for those who accept the legitimacy of the death penalty , ” Pitts continued , “ this further undermines the rule of law that is our best weapon in the fight against true terrorists , while completely subverting due process and constitutional rights of U.S. citizens . ”
In his testimony before the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee , Blair said , ” We take direct action against terrorists in the intelligence community , ” Inter Press reported .
He said U.S. counterterrorism officials may try to kill U.S. citizens involved in extremist groups overseas with ” specific permission ” from higher up .
In response to questions from the panel 's top Republican , Rep. Pete Hoekstra of Michigan , Blair said , if ” we think that direct action will involve killing an American , we get specific permission to do that . ”

Fire Departments Charge for Service , Asking Accident Victims to Pay Up
A growing number of towns are imposing fire service fees to close budget gaps .
Feb. 4 , 2010  --
It came in the mail less than a month after Darline Fairchild watched her family 's home go up in flames -- a bill for the nearly $ 28,000 it cost the fire department to extinguish the blaze .
" I felt my body turn cold and I just broke out into a sweat , " Fairchild told ABCNews.com .
" It was awful .
I said , ' It 's got to be a mistake . ' "
But it was n't a mistake .
The Fairchilds , of New Castle , Ind. , were just one of a growing number of fire and accident victims across the country who are being billed for fire department services once funded solely through taxpayer money .
Already banned in several states , the practice of charging to respond to house fires and car accidents -- dubbed a " crash tax " or an " accident tax " -- has horrified victims and earned the ire of insurance lobbyists who say their member companies are being targeted to make up for budget shortfalls .
" Part of the sales tactic when municipalities consider this is , ' Hey , do n't worry , it 's going to go to insurance , ' " Jon Zarich , director of government affairs for the Insurance Institute of Indiana , told ABCNews.com .
" But it 's the homeowner that 's responsible once coverage runs out . "
The Fairchilds ' bill for $ 27,989.12 was itemized with hourly rates for the use of fire trucks , hoses and the firefighters ' time , even a case of drinking water for firefighters who got thirsty .
The total for five hours of fire personnel on the scene totaled more than $ 8,500 .
The use of the fire trucks cost more than $ 12,300 .
Fairchild , who was shuttling her family between hotels when the bill arrived , said she immeidately contacted her insurance company , which was similarly shocked .
" She said , ' That 's what taxes are for , ' " Fairchild quoted the flabbergasted insurance employe as saying .
The insurance company has since taken over the bill and the Fairchilds do not know if it was ever resolved .
" I do n't know what 's going to happen , " she said .
" I 'm not paying it , I know that . "
Insurance Companies Fight Back Against Third - Party Vendors
Zarich said his organization is familiar with the billing company that sent out the Fairchilds ' bill .
Most municipalities and fire districts across the country that have turned to these types of service charges contract with billing companies who then take a cut of the collections .
But Emergency Services Billing Corporation , Zarich charged , has been grossly inflating charges on behalf of their clients .
In the last 18 months , the institute 's member companies have reporting seeing their average fire service charges go from $ 300 to $ 400 to between $ 2,000 and $ 5,000 , Zarich said .
Indiana 's state fire marshal lists appropriate service charges as up to $ 250 for a vehicle response and up to $ 150 for each hour of assistance , but Zarich said ESBC 's estimates are almost always higher .
ESBC's
Web site does n't list specific rates , but advertises it 's own rate policy based on charges for every 15 minutes a fire department 's equipment and personnel are on scene , with the fees taking an emergency responder 's rank into consideration .
ESBC spokesman Rob Blackford confirmed to ABCNews.com that his company ignores the state recommendation , saying the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation , and Liability Act , or CERCLA , allows fire departments to charge what they see fit in exchange for mitigating the environmental impact of an accident or fire .
" I do n't care what the fire marshal says at all , " Blackford said .
" The insurance companies owe this . "
He confirmed that the Fairchilds ' insurance company was refusing to pay the $ 28,000 bill and that ESBC would be pursuing the charges in court .
" Every time you have one of these fires , it 's an environmental disaster , " Blackford said .
" Should we make the person who is responsible for the problem pay or should we raise your taxes and my taxes ? "
He , instead , blamed insurance companies that collect premiums from their customers , then refuse to pay when called upon .
" I think that 's criminal .
It 's embezzlement , " Blackford said .
" They 're taking the premiums and not paying the claims . "
Blackford said his company would never go after homeowners if their insurance company refused to pay , but Zarich said they 've heard an increasing number of horror stories about accident and fire victims being harrassed for payment .
Zarich said the Insurance Institution of Indiana would like to see the government crack down on ESBC , but has also been lobbying for an eradication of this practice in general .
" You do n't want to be thinking can you afford it when your house is on fire , " he said .
Florida became the most recent state last year to ban such fees for emergency services .
Seven other states , including Arkansas , Oklahoma and Tennessee , have some sort of law banning accident fees .
Indiana banned police response fees in 2008 , but the law did not include provisions for fire departments .
Angela and Ralph Piper certainly were n't expecting a bill when their 2 - and - a - half - year - old dream house in Bryan , Texas , burst into flames over the summer after being hit by lightning .
The couple was able to grab their photo albums and rush out of the house with their three sons , but firefighters could do nothing to save the home , which Angela Piper said burned for more than seven hours .
Their house a total loss , the family had moved into an apartment at a nearby Christian boys ' ranch when they got the bill two weeks ago for $ 14,650 .
Fire , Accident Victims in Shock After Hefty Bills Arrive
" We were so shocked to get the bill , " Piper said .
They immediately called the fire chief to make sure it was real and found out that they had indeed been charged per truck , per minute .
" One truck , it was there 461 minutes and that charge was $ 3,841 , " Piper said .
" We do n't have any way to know if the charge was low or high or accurate . "
The fire chief , Piper said , was understanding and eventually had their bill dismissed .
But the Pipers said they want people to know that these types of charges are being levied and most people do n't know about it .
Fire department service charges , she said , will now be built into their insurance policy .
" We would have found the money , " she said .
" It was never as much about the money , but that we had received a bill for something we did n't know we could get billed for . "
John Villeneuve was n't as understanding when he got slapped with a $ 395 bill for a small brush fire outside his home , caused by neighborhood kids setting off Fourth of July fireworks .
A neighbor called 911 as he doused the flames with a garden hose .
Even though the neighbor told the dispatcher the fire was out , a fireman in his personal vehicle stopped by to make sure , and Villenueve was billed three weeks later for the cost of the 13 volunteer firefighters that responded to the station and one fire truck , even though they never went to his house .
Villeneuve said he fought the bill with the township of Bellevue and the fire board .
He was able to get the charge for the fire truck taken off , but was stuck with the remaining $ 195 tab and was threatened with collections when he refused to pay .
He gave in , saying , " $ 195 is n't much to fight for .
Not even to get to a lawyer for .
They called me disgruntled and everything . "
So a few days before Christmas , Villeneuve paid his bill in person -- in pennies , all 117 pounds of them .
He wondered why departments that operate on a volunteer basis are allowed to charge at all .
" A volunteer is a volunteer .
That kind of makes me scratch my head a little bit on that , " he said .
Fire Department Chief : ' We Are Trying to Do the Right Thing '
While many of the departments that have hired billling companies to collect on their newly imposed fees are volunteer , it 's a measure many professional departments are turning to as well and not just for house fires .
Sam Sorich , president of the Association of California Insurance Companies , said most of the new service charges he 's seeing in his state are for car accident fees .
" We 've seen quite a bit of activity in California , " he said , estimating up to 60 municipalities and fire districts in the state now bill for services once deemed to be free .
Most have programs that charge drivers if they are insured , assuming their policies will cover it , and waive the fee if the drivers are uninsured , which infuriates the insurance companies .
" It seems very unfair , " Sorich said .
" First of all , we think the whole process is unfair , but this is particularly unfair . "
The Association of California Insurance Companies -- which runs the opposition Web site CalCrashTax.com -- lobbied for a bill to ban fire service charges last year , but the bill fell apart before it went to a vote .
" We believe these services should be paid by taxes , " he said .
" This is government service . "
Dale Henson , chief of the Decatur Township Fire Department in Indiana , said taxes just are n't enough anymore to provide the services people expect .
Last year , his department decided to start charging $ 750 for extrications after car accidents .
The department also had to borrow money to cover it 's $ 1.3 million budget shortfall .
" Is it right or wrong ?
I do n't see a problem with it , " Henson said .
" They 're putting caps on taxes and all that , but yet we still have budget we 've got to meet . "
For Henson , the extra fees are not pouring in .
Despite being dispatched for 41 extrications , his department collected just $ 1,100 in service charges for car accidents and house fires .
The department hired a billing company , but Henson admitted he had n't followed up to see why more money was n't coming in .
" People want the same service , but we 're not getting the same revenue , " he said .
" So we 've got to get creative .
" I feel we are trying to do the right thing , " Henson said .
" We are not trying to just take more money from taxpayers . "
( CNN ) -- U.S. Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , a stalwart foe of government spending , won a blowout victory Saturday in the annual Conservative Political Action Conference presidential straw poll .
With participants naming " reducing the size of federal government " as their top issue , the 74 - year old libertarian hero captured 31 percent of the 2,400 votes cast in the annual contest , usually seen as a barometer of how the GOP 's conservative wing regards their potential presidential candidates .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney finished second with 22 percent of the vote , ending a three - year winning streak at CPAC .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin finished third with 7 percent of the vote , followed by Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty at 6 percent and Indiana Rep. Mike Pence at 5 percent .
They were followed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who tied at 4 percent .
Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels , former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum , South Dakota Sen. John Thune and Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour rounded out the results .
Five percent of participants voted for " Other " and 6 percent was undecided .
The announcement of Paul 's win , a surprise victory unlikely to have a major impact on the 2012 presidential contest , drew a volley of loud boos from the CPAC audience .
That discontent could be seen in the poll results :
A majority of participants said they wished the Republican Party had a better field of candidates to choose from .
But Paul 's victory might be seen , in part , as a result of his support among anti-establishment Tea Party activists -- who turned out in force at this year 's conference and expressed some frustration with the Republican Party .
Reflecting the college atmosphere of the annual event , young people dominated the voting : 54 percent of participants were between the ages of 18 and 25 .
The poll also contained a bit of bad news for Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele , who made an under - the - radar appearance at CPAC late Friday .
Follow on Twitter : http://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/cpac
Participants were asked to rate their opinions of several top political figures , including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader John Boehner , both of whom received a majority favorable rating .
But Steele was the only Republican to garner an upside - down rating , with 44 percent giving him an unfavorable rating and 42 percent rating him favorably .
The three - day meeting Saturday that has featured speeches by Republican leaders , training sessions for local political activists and a renewed purpose to stand firm behind their principles heading into the midterm elections .
Granted this is only US figures given that it is based on stats collected by compete.com but damn who would have thought eh .

It ’s too easy for members of Israel ’s government to call for peace talks to resume .
From one side of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu ’s mouth , he says he wants peace .
From the other , he says he wo n’t freeze settlements .
They are not compatible statements , but Netanyahu knows that each message has adifferent intended audience .
Not freezing settlements is intended to provoke Palestinians into their typical rejectionism .
The Palestinians have a button that Israelis can easily push to get the reaction they want , the same reaction every time .
Netanyahu also knows that constantly calling for peace is exactly what American leaders want to hear , easing the pressure off President Barack Obama .
The US , which has a multibillion - dollar annual investment in Israel and politicians who pander to pro-Israel votes during biannual elections , does n’t really care about the problems of the Middle East conflict , so freezing or not freezing settlements is a non-issue to most Americans .
Do Netanyahu and most Israelis want peace ?
The only way to find out is to push them into a corner from which they ca n’t escape .
But you ca n’t do that when you are in your own corner , drawing lines around yourself and babbling meaningless rhetoric as the world continues to collapse around you .
Instead of issuing unenforceable preconditions on Israel , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas should go to the peace table and play the cards he has .
Talk .
But this time , do what his predecessor the late president Yasser Arafat failed to do .
Partner peace talks with public relations .
When they collapse , as they might , make sure you get your story out first before Israel , not three years later as Arafat did in futility during the siege of the Mukata and the confrontation years with Netanyahu ’s party predecessor Ariel Sharon .
WHAT ’S THE worst that can happen ?
Peace talks collapse and the region nose - dives into militant - driven violence , terrorism and excessive , heavy - handed military responses from the IDF .
Or , just maybe , peace talks progress and Netanyahu , given something to take back to Israel ’s increasingly intransigent population , shows them peace might work and restoring hope .
Peace is the only answer that can move Israelis and Palestinians away from the precipice where they have debka ’d during the past 62 years .
Not only are Israelis and Palestinians bad dancers , they are terrible at reading road maps .
But only Israel has the clout .
Israelis will not willingly budge from their rejection of compromise with the Palestinians .
It ’s been too easy for them over the years .
The Palestinians demand “ all or nothing ” and constantly end up with nothing , while the Israelis take whatever they can get .
A peace agreement is the only way to freeze Israel ’s settlement expansions around Jerusalem .
The Israeli settlements did n’t just appear because some ingenuous Israeli developed a bullet - proof strategy to build them , but because Palestinians always said “ no , ” demanding everything and always ending up with nothing .
Israel had carte blanche to take what it wanted .
And it did .
Who would n’t ?
IN RETURNING to the peace table despite Israel ’s hard - line stance , Abbas can also give some strength back to the weakened President Obama , whose powerful shouts of peace sound more like distant whispers these days .
If Obama can show some progress in the Middle East , he just might be able to leverage that to pressure Israel ’s government to do more , which it should , and add tenor to his declarations .
But with Abbas saying “ no , ” and with Netanyahu ’s clever double - talk to preserve his right - wing coalition , Obama ca n’t do much except tell Americans he will focus his attention elsewhere .
The Palestinians will never have a stronger American ally than Obama .
Every other Democratic alternative , including Hillary Clinton , would move the table back into Israel ’s corner .
Politically , there is no advantage to confronting Israel in the United States .
Every Republican challenger , like Mike Huckabee , will be fawning all over Israel during repeated visits , telling the Israelis everything they want to hear , from bashing the Goldstone Report as the bible of anti-Semitism to promising that America will always stand by Israel ’s side – well , as long as there are Jews in America who can vote .
There is neither virginity in American politics nor innocence .
My guess is Abbas will make the wrong choice , again , and waste his time trying to smooth things over with the uncompromising Hamas , presumably to strengthen his own weak government .
Only Hamas can play the game of double - talk better than Netanyahu .
And there is nothing anyone could do to change Hamas , which is uncompromising by faith .
The only Palestinian leader giving Abbas good advice is his prime minister , Salam Fayyad .
But Fayyad ’s role has been relegated to that of an entertainer as he travels the country and the world telling audiences what they need to hear while failing with his own people .
The truth is Israel holds all the cards .
If Israel wanted to end the conflict it could .
But with Israelis becoming increasingly satisfied with the status quo – controlling everything with only “ minor ” losses of life – there is little incentive to push them to do the right thing .
If Abbas could stop being predictable and surprise Israelis and theUS , maybe he could regain the momentum and reignite a peace processthat Israel cannot reject .
What do Abbas and the Palestinians have left to lose that they have n’t already lost ?
Israeli settlers organization announced , Monday , a plan by the Israeli controlled Jerusalem Municipality to construct 550 new settlers homes in Jerusalem ’s east city .
According to Ahmed Lebn , a researcher specializing in settlement activities , the homes will be constructed near Beit Safafa , a Palestinian neighborhood in Jerusalem City .
The researcher announced that this new plan comes after a number of plans issued last year to construct 2,327 settlement homes in the city .
Since Israel occupied the East side of the city of Jerusalem in 1967 , it continued to construct Israeli settlements in and around the city ; an act that is illegal under international law .
WITH ANOTHER LAUNCH of the Nvidia GT300 Fermi GF100 GTX480 upon us , it is time for an update on the status of that wayward part .
Production parts have been coming back from TSMC for several weeks now , and the outlook for them is grim .
We first got word that production A3 GF100s were back in Santa Clara near the end of January .
When enough of them rolled off the line to characterize the silicon , we hear there were no parties in Santa Clara .
For those not interested in the ‘ why ’ side of things , the short answer is that the top bin as it stands now is about 600MHz for the half hot clock , and 1200MHz for the hot clock , and the initial top part will have 448 shaders .
On top of that , the fab wafer yields are still in single digit percentages .
That said , the situation is far more nuanced than those three numbers suggest , and the atrocious yields are even after the chip has been downclocked and defective units fused off .
To make matters even worse , the problems that caused these low yields are likely unfixable without a complete re-layout .
Lets look at these problems one at a time .
Number one on Nvidia ’s hit list is yields .
If you recall , we said that the yield on the first hot lot of Fermis that came back from TSMC was 7 good chips out of a total of 416 candidates , or a yield of less than 2 percent .
The problem that Nvidia faces can be traced to what it is doing to fix the issues they face .
The three steppings of GF100 are all what are known as metal layer spins , something that is cheaper and faster than a full base layer respin , taking about two months to see results .
A full base layer respin takes well over a quarter , likely more than six months to accomplish , and costs more than $ 1 million just for the masks .
Metal layer spins are denoted by upping the number , A1 to A2 for example , while base layer respins up the letter , A3 to B1 .
Nvidia counts first silicon from A1 , so the current A3 is the third metal spin .
Metal layer spins tend to solve logic problem like 1 + 1 = 3 , not power or yield issues .
Most yield problems are related to the process that the chips are made on , and modified by factors like how fast you try to run the transistors , how much you bend the design rules , and other related issues .
While this is a very simplified version , metal layer spins do n’t tend to do much for power consumption or yield problems .
When Nvidia got its first Fermi GF100 silicon back in early September , and you can read about the dates and steppings on the chips in this story , clock speeds were hovering around 500MHz and yields were in single digit percentages .
These numbers were shockingly low , but on the first batch of silicon , rushed through the fab hence the name hot lot , problems are quite common .
The second spin , A2 , did up the clock speeds a bit , but yields remained stubbornly low .
It was a month or so overdue , so you can be pretty sure the problems that were being worked on were fairly difficult .
This is not a process that you tolerate any unnecessary delays on .
SemiAccurate has heard that the A3 silicon hot lots that came back just before Christmas did n’t improve clock speeds at all , or not enough to be considered a fix .
That is n’t a surprise because Nvidia was using the wrong tool , metal layer changes , to fix a clock speed and power problem .
Yields on A3 hot lots also were in the toilet .
As we have been saying since we first heard about the design last March , it is unmanufacturable , and the changes that might possibly fix things will take a full re-layout .
Why are things this bad ?
The simple answer is that Nvidia did n’t do its homework .
Just like the failures that lead to the bad bumps , Nvidia simply did n’t do test , instead it tried to brute force things that require nuance and methodical forethought .
ATI did test .
ATI put out a full production run of HD4770 ( RV740 silicon ) GPUs and used that as a test of TSMC ’s 40 nm process .
TSMC looks to have failed , badly , but crucially , ATI learned why and how the parts failed to yield .
That learning was fed back in to the Evergreen 5000 series GPUs , and those come off the line at perfectly acceptable yield rates now .
Nvidia in the meantime had four 40nm GPUs in the pipeline for Q1 of 2009 , the G212 , G214 , G216 and G218 , shrinks and updates of the 55nm G200b , G92b , G94 and G96 respectively .
G212 was so bad that it was knifed before it ever saw silicon , and the second largest one , the G214 had to go on a massive diet , dropping from 128 shaders to 96 .
This was renamed G215 , and finally came out in November 2009 .
It is sold as the GT240 , G216 is sold as the GT220 , and the G218 is on the market as the G210 .
All have had innumerable renamings and are currently being parlayed as 300 - series chips for no apparent reason .
The problem here is that the chips are approximately 139 mm ^2 , 100 mm ^ 2 and 57 mm ^ 2 for the G215 , G216 and G218 respectively .
ATI ’s RV740 is 137 mm ^ 2 .
These are all very small , while the higher end 55nm G200b was over 480 mm ^2 , and the earlier 65 nm G200 was over 575 mm ^2 .
ATI was making salable quantities of a 137 mm ^ 2 chip in April 2009 .
Nvidia had severe problems with the 40nm process and only got the G216 and G218 out in August 2009 as OEM - only GPUs .
It took months for the yield to reach a point where Nvidia could release retail cards , and the G215 lagged the first two by several months .
A really rough measure of yield is that for similar products , the yield goes down by the square of the die size .
A 200 mm ^2 chip can be expected to have 1 / 4 the yield of a similar 100 mm ^ 2 chip , and a 50 mm ^ 2 chip will have about 4 times the yield of the 100 mm ^ 2 part .
Chip makers put lots of redundant structures into every design in order to repair some kinds of fabrication errors , but there are limits .
Each redundancy adds to the area of the design , so the base cost for the chip is higher .
Semiconductor manufacturing is a series of complex tradeoffs , and the cost for redundant area versus yield is one of the simpler ones .
If you plan right , you can make very high yielding chips with only a little extra die area .
If things go well , the cost of the redundant area is less than you would lose by not having it there at all .
If things go badly , you get large chips that you ca n’t make at anything close to a viable cost .
The AMD K6 - III CPU was rumored to be an example of this kind of failure .
Last spring and summer , ATI was not shy about telling people that the lessons learned from the RV740 were fed back into the Evergreen 5000 series chips , and it was a very productive learning experience .
One of the deep , dark secrets was that there were via ( interconnects between the metal layers on the chip ) problems .
The other was that the TSMC 40nm transistors were quite variable in transistor construction , specifically in the channel length .
Since Anand talked about both problems in his excellent Evergreen history article , any promises to keep this secret are now a moot point .
What ATI did with Evergreen was to put two vias in instead of one .
It also changed transistor designs and layout to mitigate the variances .
Both of these cost a lot of area , and likely burn a more than negligible amount of energy , but they are necessary .
Nvidia on the other hand did not do their homework at all .
In its usual ‘ bull in a china shop ’ way , SemiAccurate was told several times that the officially blessed Nvidia solution to the problem was engineering by screaming at people .
Needless to say , while cathartic , it does not change chip design or the laws of physics .
It does n’t make you friends either .
By the time Nvidia found out about the problems , it was far too late to implement them in Fermi GF100 .
Unless TSMC pulled off a miracle , the design was basically doomed .
Why ?
GF100 is about 550 mm ^ 2 in size , slightly larger than we reported after tapeout .
Nvidia ran into severe yield problems with a 100 mm ^ 2 chip , a 3 month delay with a 139 mm ^ 2 chip , and had to scrap any larger designs due to a complete inability to manufacture them .
Without doing the homework ATI did , it is now trying to make a 550 mm ^ 2 part .
Basic math says that the GF100 is a hair under 4 times as large as the G215 , and they are somewhat similar chips , so you can expect GF100 yields to be around 1/16th that of the smaller part .
G215 is not yielding well , but even if it was at a 99 percent yield , you could expect Fermi GF100 to have single digit percentage yields .
Last time we heard hard numbers , the G215 was not yielding that high .
Fixing these problems requires Nvidia to do what ATI did for Evergreen , that is , double up on the vias and also change the circuits in a non-trivial way .
This process requires a lot of engineering time , a base layer respin , and probably at least one metal spin on top of that .
If everything goes perfectly , it will still be more than six months before it can bring a fix to market .
While this is bad for Nvidia , and likely terminal for Fermi GF100 as an economically viable chip , it does actually get worse .
The chip is big and hot .
Insiders have told SemiAccurate that the chips shown at CES consumed 280W .
Nvidia knew that the GPU would consume a lot of power long before the chip ever taped out , but it probably thought it would be around the 225W mark claimed for the compute boards .
To combat this , Nvidia engineers tell SemiAccurate that the decision was made to run the chip at a very low voltage , 1.05 V versus 1.15 V for ATI ’s Cypress .
Since ATI draws less power for Cypress , 188W TDP vs 225W TDP for the Fermi GF100 , every time Nvidia needs to tweak the voltage of its card , that results in roughly 50 percent more amperage used for every .01 V the core is raised by .
While this is oversimplification , the take - home message is that Nvidia made choices that result in more power added than ATI if the voltages need to be upped .
Remember the part about TSMC having variable transistors ?
This means some are ‘ leaky ’ , meaning they consume more power than their less leaky brethren , and others run slower .
The traditional fix for the slow transistors is to up the voltage , and that often works to make a ‘ weak ’ transistor perform correctly .
It also makes leaky transistors leak more , and the more they leak , the hotter they get .
Hotter transistors also leak more than cooler ones , so you get into a cycle where leakage leads to higher temperatures , which make things leak more , and so on .
One way to combat this is to put a much more aggressive heatsink and fan on the card , but that costs a lot of money , and tends to make a lot of noise .
If you are having a flashback to the Nvidia NV30 GeForce 5800 ‘ dustbuster ’ , that is exactly it .
TSMC ’s variability means that there are lots of weak transistors scattered throughout the die , and lots of leaky transistors .
If Nvidia ups the voltage , they start sucking up power at a huge rate .
If it does n’t , the weak transistors basically do not work , and are effectively ‘ broken ’ or ‘ defective ’ .
The two goals are mutually antagonistic , and the low voltage , high amperage choices made by Nvidia only multiply the problems .
If that was n’t bad enough , sources tell SemiAccurate that the TSMC 40nm process is very heat sensitive .
Leakage goes way up with heat , much more so than with previous processes .
If you go past a certain critical temperature , leakage goes up shockingly fast .
The jail that Fermi GF100 is in now has three sides closing in on the chip .
The alternative is to fuse off shaders with too many ‘ weak ’ transistors , and leave the voltage alone .
Unfortunately , another bad architectural choice makes this very unpalatable .
Fermi GF100 is arranged into 16 clusters of 32 shaders for a total of 512 shaders on the chip .
By all accounts , if you are going to fuse off one , you are forced to fuse off a full set of 32 .
Since the weak transistors are scattered evenly throughout the GPU , fusing off two would mean that you lose not two but 64 shaders .
This level of granularity is bad , and you have to question why that choice was made in light of the known huge die size .
On the current A3 silicon , sources tell us that Nvidia is having to use both ‘ fixes ’ , fusing off at least two clusters and upping the voltage .
This results in a GPU that consumes more power while having at least 12.5 percent less performance than intended .
If you were going to use one in your PC , this may be manageable , but hundreds or thousands of them in a big supercomputer is a non-starter .
For reasons tied to the power consumption and weak transistors , Fermi GF100 simply will not run at high clocks .
Last March , sources told SemiAccurate that the intended clock frequencies were 750MHz for the ‘ low ’ clock and 1500MHz for the high clock .
Since you can only pull off so many miracles with a voltage bump , we hear the A3 production silicon has a top bin of 600 / 1200MHz , and that is after an average of two shader clusters are turned off .
Nvidia was claiming 60 percent more performance than Cypress last fall .
That quickly dropped to 40 percent better , and at CES , Nvidia could only show very select snippets of games and benchmarks that were picked to show off its architectural strengths .
Those maxed out at about 60 percent better than Cypress , so consider them a best case .
If that 60 percent was from a fully working 512 shader , 750/ 1500 MHz Fermi GF100 , likely the case at 280W power draw , than a 448 shader 600/ 1200 MHz GPU would have 87.5 percent of the shaders and 80 percent of the clock .
160 * 0.875 * 0.8 = 112 percent of the performance of ATI ’s Cypress .
This is well within range of a mildly updated and refreshed Cypress chip .
Do n’t forget that ATI has a dual Cypress board on the market , something that Fermi GF100 ca n’t hope to touch for performance .
Fermi GF100 is about 60 percent larger than Cypress , meaning at a minimum that it costs Nvidia at least 60 percent more to make , realistically closer to three times .
Nvidia needs to have a commanding performance lead over ATI in order to set prices at the point where it can make money on the chip even if yields are not taken into account .
ATI has set the upper pricing bound with its dual Cypress board called Hemlock HD5970 .
Rumors abound that Nvidia will only have 5,000 to 8,000 Fermi GF100s , branded GTX480 in the first run of cards .
The number SemiAccurate has heard directly is a less specific ‘ under 10,000 ’ .
There will have been about two months of production by the time those launch in late March , and Nvidia bought 9,000 risk wafers late last year .
Presumably those will be used for the first run .
With 104 die candidates per wafer , 9,000 wafers means 936 K chips .
Even if Nvidia beats the initial production targets by ten times , its yields are still in the single digit range .
At $ 5,000 per wafer , 10 good dies per wafer , with good being a very relative term , that puts cost at around $ 500 per chip , over ten times ATI ’s cost .
The BoM cost for a GTX480 is more than the retail price of an ATI HD5970 , a card that will slap it silly in the benchmarks .
At these prices , even the workstation and compute cards start to have their margins squeezed .
The two real fixes , doubling the vias and redesigned circuits to minimize the impact of transistor variances both require a full re-layout .
Both also cost time and die area .
The time is at least six months from tapeout , if you recall .
Fermi taped out in late July and was only slated for small numbers at retail in late November , a very unrealistic goal .
A B1 spin of the chip would be at least Q3 of 2010 if it tapes out today , and it wo n’t have a useful life before it is supplanted by the next generation of 28nm chips .
Should Nvidia make the necessary changes , that brings up two more problems .
Nvidia is at two limits of chip engineering , a die size wall and a power wall .
The power wall is simple , a PCIe card has a hard limit of 300W , anything more and you will not get PCIe certified .
No certification means legal liability problems , and OEMs wo n’t put it in their PCs .
This is death for any mass market card .
The power can only be turned up so far , and at 280W , Nvidia already has the dial on 9.5 .
The die size wall is similar , you can only fit a mask of a certain size in the TSMC tools .
The G200 pushed that limit , and the changes to Fermi / GF100 would likely push the chip to a size that would simply not fit in the tools needed to make it .
At that point , you have to look at removing units , a task which adds even more time to the stepping .
The only way to make it work is a shrink to 28nm , but the first 28nm process that is suitable is not going to have wafers running until the last few days of 2010 , best case .
Fermi GF100 is six months late and slipping , ca n’t be made profitably if it can be made at all , and initial production is going to be limited to essentially a PR stunt .
Every card made will be sold at a huge loss , meaning that there will probably not be any more wafers run after the initial 9,000 risk wafers are used up .
Those were paid for in advance , so there is little harm to finishing them for a stopgap PR stunt .
The chip is unworkable , unmanufacturable , and unfixable .
If Nvidia management has any semblance of engineering sense , it will declare its usual victory with Fermi and focus resources on Fermi II , something it is still promising for 2010 .
The changes needed to fix the first Fermi are basically not doable until the chip is shrunk to 28nm , the size is just too big .
This puts any hope for Nvidia out until 2011 for anything but PR stunts .
The derivative parts for Fermi exist only on paper , they have n’t taped out yet .
If Nvidia does tape them out , they will have the same size , yield and power problems as Fermi GF100 .
ATI will price them into the red , so there is no way Nvidia can make money on the derivatives , and there is no way it can fix the problems in time to matter either .
Nvidia will not have any economically viable DX11 parts until the last days of 2010 if everything goes well from here .
As we have been saying since last May , Fermi GF100 is the wrong chip , made the wrong way , for the wrong reasons .
Dear Leader has opened the proverbial can of Whoop - Ass on the competition , and on top of that criticized Intel ’s Larrabee for everything that ended up sinking Fermi GF100 .
Intel had the common sense to refocus Larrabee and take a PR hit rather than pouring tens of millions more dollars down the drain for no good reason .
It does n’t look like Nvidia has the management skills to make that call .
The company not only designed a ‘ Laughabee ’ , it went against all sense and built that too .

There was a typo 5980 is in fact 5970 .
WASHINGTON  President Obama , speaking to an enthusiastic audience of union officials in Lanham , Md. , on Tuesday , underscored his embrace of nuclear power as a clean energy source , announcing that the Energy Department had approved financial help for the construction of two nuclear reactors in Georgia .
If the project goes forward , the reactors would be the first begun in the United States since the 1970s .
The announcement of the loan guarantee  $ 8.3 billion to help the Southern Company and two partners build twin reactors in Burke County  comes as the administration is courting Republican support for its climate and energy policies .
With climate legislation stalled in the Senate and its prospects for success dim , Democrats are seeking new incentives to spur clean energy development and create jobs .
At the same time , the president ’s embrace of nuclear energy has drawn the ire of environmental groups that have long opposed any return to a reliance on nuclear power .
A committee of the European parliament will consider evidence that more than 15 countries in the European Union are exporting torture equipment .
Amnesty International says regulations introduced four years ago to outlaw the trade are failing .
The devices named by Amnesty include thumb screws , electric stun belts and body hangers , which it says can be used in conjunction with what are known as foot heaters .
Amnesty says the companies that make the equipment are often the same companies that make regular police equipment , like handcuffs and batons .
These sidelines , according to Amnesty , are produced by companies in Germany , Spain , Italy and the Czech Republic and sold to regimes around the world with little respect for human rights .

NASA administrators and international scientists are arriving in Alice Springs to help launch balloons the size of football fields into the stratosphere .
The giant plastic balloons , which can float at altitudes of up to 40 kilometres , hold germanium detectors , rare telescopes that collect data on x-rays and gamma rays .
The telescopes weigh two to three tonnes and cost between $ 5 million and $ 10 million .
Over the next week , specialist staff and instruments will travel to Alice Springs to begin preparation for the launches , which will happen next month from Runway 17 at the Alice Springs Airport .
The director of the Alice Springs Balloon Launching Centre , Ravi Sood , says the telescopes have to be stored in liquid nitrogen at minus 196 degrees Celsius .
He says the instruments are being transported by air to Sydney and then in a special vehicle to Alice Springs .
" These are actually state - of - the - art , extremely sensitive instruments and you would not find anything like that in Australia or in most other countries , " he said .
" Launching is a hairy process with such large balloons ; they 're made of very flimsy material , you 're talking about material that 's the thickness of glad wrap . "
Dr Sood says central Australia has excellent conditions for the experiments .
" Alice Springs is a good place to do that in because here we can look at the centre of our galaxy directly overhead , whereas you can't see the centre of our galaxy from the Northern Hemisphere , " he said .
" That 's one reason for coming to Alice Springs . "
When all the data is collected , the telescopes will be detached from the balloons and parachuted down to land .

Air passengers who refuse a full body scan to be barred from their flights
Air passengers who refuse to submit to controversial full body scans will be barred from boarding their flights .
The technology - which has been strongly condemned by civil liberties campaigners - began operating at Heathrow and Manchester airports yesterday .
Birmingham will follow suit later this month before the anti-terror devices are rolled out nationally .
Strict :
Air passengers who refuse to submit to the advanced imaging technology scans at airports will be barred from boarding their flights
The move - strongly criticised by civil liberties campaigners who say the scanners are an invasion of privacy - follows the attempted Detroit bomb attack on Christmas Day .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is accused of trying to detonate a bomb on a flight as it was about to land in the U.S. city .
Transport Secretary Lord Adonis said : ' In the immediate future , only a small proportion of airline passengers will be selected for scanning .
' If a passenger is selected for scanning and declines , they will not be permitted to fly . '
He said a code of conduct would govern how images were used and which passengers were checked .
Campaigners say the scanners , which act like a mini radar device ' seeing ' beneath ordinary clothing , are an invasion of privacy .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission has warned that the scanners breach privacy rules under the Human Rights
Act for their naked images .
The exemption of under 18s from being scanned , which was in place during the trial of the machines in Manchester , has also been removed .
The Department for Transport has published an interim code of practice for the scanners .
The officer operating the machine never sees the image , and the employee viewing the scan must be in another room .
The scan cannot be saved , printed or transmitted .
Passengers can also demand that only officers of their sex see their image .
BAA , which runs Heathrow , refused to comment on how many scanners are in place and in which terminals they will be used , although it is believed they will be in Terminal 4 .
While only a small minority of travellers are expected to be asked to undergo the scans , those who decline will not be allowed to board their flight .
Baring all : A Manchester airport employee demonstrates how the scanners work
Body scanners at Manchester airport will be confined initially to terminal 2 , where they have been trialled since late last year .
Additional scanners are planned for terminals 1 and 3 by the end of the month .
The airport said that its previous exemption for children had been overturned by the Government .
Head of customer experience Sarah Barrett said passengers had ' privacy concerns ' , but stressed that the airport had put in ' strict procedures ' .
' It will enhance security for everyone , which can only be a good thing , without compromising people 's privacy , ' she said .
' The image generated by the body scanner cannot be stored or captured , nor can security officers viewing the images recognise people .
' Contrary to reports , the equipment does not allow security staff to see passengers naked . '
But Alex Deane , a barrister and director of campaign group Big Brother Watch , said such measures meant ' the terrorists have won ' .
' People are understandably afraid of terrorism , ' he said .
' But we did n't allow the IRA to impede our freedoms or change our way of life , and we should n't change now either .
' Those upset by the prospect of undergoing these scans should n't be forced to choose between their dignity and their flight .
' What kind of a free society does the Government think it is " protecting " , when it invades our privacy like this ?
' When we are forced to expose ourselves at the airport in order to go on holiday , the terrorists have won . '
Buried in an interview with Warner Brothers President Jeff Robinov are two very exciting movie announcements : the next Dark Knight is a go , and a Wonder Woman movie might be in the works .

Yesterday rumors were circulating that the third Nolan Batman film was in the works with brother Jonah and David Goyer on board to cowrite the script .
And now the New York Times has confirmed the Batman film , and a possible Wonder Woman movie .

While interviewing director Nolan about working with Robinov they confirmed the next Batman picture and later let it slide that Wonder Woman might be one of the next DC characters they focus their lenses on .
" He is trying not to cling to the things that have worked in the past , " said Christopher Nolan , who directed " The Dark Knight " and is working on another Batman sequel ....
The Walt Disney Company 's $ 4 billion purchase of Marvel Entertainment just over a month ago has increased the pressure on Warner to succeed this time .
Warner is expected to announce a DC slate in the coming months populated by characters like the Flash and Wonder Woman .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
This is probably as close as we 're going to get besides an official press release from the studio .
But we 're just happy Nolan is no longer merely brainstroming ideas about the next Batman picture , and actually putting pen to paper .
The article also gives a sense that Robinov is still committed to doing ambitious , creator - driven projects , even in spite of the failure of Speed Racer and the relative failure of Watchmen , and this may play into the studio's plans for its DC Comics properties .

Mechanical fireflies could help create a new kind of 3 - D display , say researchers at MIT .
Standing in for the bioluminescent beetles will be LED - fitted , remotely controlled micro-helicopters that can be choreographed electronically to display shapes and images as they hover in midair .
The project , called Flyfire , would use RC helicopters similar to the toys sold at the mall today .
" Each of the helicopters then acts as what we call a smart pixel , " E Roon Kang , the MIT research fellow who is leading the project , told Wired.com .
" By controlling their movement , we can have the pixels flying through the air . "
The idea is almost all theoretical now since it is in its very early stages , says Kang .
Researchers at MIT 's SENSEable City Lab and Aerospace Robotics and Embedded Systems ( ARES ) Lab are jointly developing the idea .
In traditional displays , pixels are static and arranged on a flat surface .
Finding a way to make truly three - dimensional displays has been a frequent subject of research , but few practical solutions have emerged despite decades of effort .
The MIT researchers are betting that if each pixel can be made to hover in space and can be controlled reliably , they can create a giant 3 - D display .
Ultimately the project would be a step in the direction of " smart dust " – the idea that computing devices will be extremely small , somewhat self - contained , and pervasive , says MIT .
The canvas made by little lighted helicopters can show either a two - dimensional image or a 3 - D shape .
Currently researchers are trying to design these little helicopters that will serve as the smart pixels .
Kang says the team is looking at microcopters with four rotors as a possible vehicle .
Simple as the idea may seem , creating an army of microcopters poses some significant technical challenges .
For instance , each of these little devices will have be self - stabilizing .
That means as they hover , they will have to maintain their co-ordinates with extreme accuracy for at least a few minutes .
Another problem lies in being able to reliably control thousands of these microcopters .
" Today we are able to simultaneously control a handful of micro-helicopters but with Flyfire , we are aiming to scale up and reach very large numbers , " says Emilio Frazzoli , head of the ARES Lab in a statement .
Flyfire is being conceived as a installation in a large public place , where the pixels can recharge every few minutes and then perform in space .
So far , the team has performed simulations to show the idea at work and hopes to start designing the actual devices soon .
Check out MIT 's video explaining how the Flyfire idea will work .

GOING TO THE ROOTS OF THE PROBLEM
PART 1 of 4
By Dr. Edwin Vieira , Jr. , Ph.D. , J.D .
February 21 , 2010
NewsWithViews.com
[ The following is an expanded version of an address I was asked to present recently .
The subject is “ radical ” , in the sense that it digs down to the roots of the problem .
But for that very reason it needs airing .
Therefore , I put it out here for general consumption , and perhaps consternation .
Please add it to the “ I told you so ” folder in your “ favorites ” list . ]
Once upon a time , not so very long ago , a certain nation was
one of the richest countries in the world .
[ World War II ] had left it a creditor nation ; it was owed * * * billion [s of ] dollars by Britain alone .
The derelict state of the European economies gave [ this country ] an assured market for its exports , while making it difficult to import much from Europe , thus enabling th[is ] country to protect its own * * * industries .
After the neglect of the thirties there was money for public spending and the country was * * * absorbing a flow of immigrants * * * [ who ] were not illiterate and unskilled , but scientists , skilled workers , intellectuals .
What country was this ?
The United States ?
No — Argentina . [ 1 ]
The whole world knows what has happened in Argentina since then , and is still happening there .
Informed individuals also know why : because Argentina ’s dysfunctional leadership classes adopted faulty economic and political principles .
Moreover , Americans can expect much the same thing to happen here , if the same conditions precedent are fulfilled .
For although History may never repeat itself exactly , bad principles will bring about similar perverse consequences whenever and wherever they are put into operation .
And America ’s equally dysfunctional leadership classes have adopted the most dangerous of those principles .
So , absent a radical correction in this country ’s present course , the Argentina- ization of the United States is very likely to take place .
As in Argentina , America ’s present economic and political systems are controlled by arrogant men and women steeped in avarice and ambition , and driven by their appetites for abusive power .
The lyric by Enrique Santos Discepolo , master composer of the tango , sums up the situation here just as it did in postwar Buenos Aires :
Do n’t you see , you poor fool ,
That whoever ’s got the most dough is right ?
That honor ’s sold for cash , and morals for pennies ?
That no truth can withstand two bucks ? [ 2 ]
Simply put : Greed , accompanied by every manner of chicanery , both economically in the marketplace and politically in public office , has become this country ’s one and only “ hard currency ” .
Nowhere does this appear more starkly than in the political arena .
Contemporary politicians recognize no limits to their raw power .
Observe that I do not say their “ authority ” — because to the extent that they act outside of the Constitution , they have no legal authority whatsoever ( and , in the strictest sense , no power , either ) .
Yet most of them do imagine themselves entirely outside of the Constitution — at least in terms of the constraints it imposes on them when they act under color of law in the guise of “ government ” .
Indeed , they openly express their disdain for the Constitution .
For instance , recently , Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi was asked at a press conference where in the Constitution Congress finds authorization to enact national health - care legislation .
Her response was , “ Are you serious ?
Are you serious ? ”
No one asked whether she was serious — because , of course , everyone knew that she was .
That Representative Pelosi was quite serious is as disturbing as it is revealing .
For the Constitution explicitly commands that public officials “ shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation , to support this Constitution ” . [ 3 ]
So , every time that officials treat constitutional limitations on their prerogatives as some kind of contemptible joke , they are in effect committing perjury .
Yet America is saddled with governments , at every level , comprised largely of individuals for whom the willingness to commit serial perjury in furtherance of their own selfish interests appears to be a condition of obtaining and operating within public office .
Inasmuch as “ Oath[s ] or Affirmation [s ] , to support th[e ] Constitution ” are ultimately made to the American people as a whole , these rogue public officials plainly feel no sense of legal or moral obligation to the people .
Doubtlessly they are strengthened in this malign conviction by their belief that the electoral system is so tightly controlled by the two major political parties and their clients and partisans in special - interest groups and the big media that the people can do nothing to change the situation in any event .
In this belief , however , they are woefully mistaken .
Political loyalties move on a two - way street .
Masses of economically deprived , socially dislocated , and politically disenfranchised , disgruntled , and disgusted people — who have next to nothing left and therefore almost nothing more to lose — are unlikely to entertain any obligation to the political system under which they happen to live , or to the political parties , politicians , and special - interest groups that run that system for their own parochial benefit .
When America ’s economy slips into the free - fall of hyperinflation or depression , impoverished people will rebel .
First , against ever - worsening conditions , by demanding that public officials correct the situation .
Then , when their protests accomplish little or nothing , they will rebel against incumbent officials at the next election .
Finally , when they discover that the two major political parties are really one party with an empty cranium and a pair of duplicitous faces , and that changing the political personalities in office does not ameliorate the conditions that arise out of the government ’s hare - brained economic policies , they will rebel against this country ’s governmental institutions as a whole .

A general disdain for legality will become the order of the day .
After all , if public officials refuse to obey the Constitution , which is the sole source of their authority , what obligation has anyone else to obey any law that those officials enact or attempt to enforce ?
Now , as many as 200,000,000 to 300,000,000 firearms and an immense store of ammunition are estimated to be held in private hands throughout this country .
Can anyone believe that , in the midst of what promises to become the most severe economic crisis of modern times , perhaps of all time , this profusion of armaments — in the hands of people who have been rudely stripped of their financial security , disabused of their political illusions , and driven to the edge of desperation by homelessness , hunger , and loss of hope — will not come into play in the most direct manner possible ?
Can anyone believe that these people ’s natural and justified antagonisms against public officials , politicians , and special - interest groups will not turn to rancor — rancor to hatred — hatred to an urge for revenge — and an urge for revenge into actual violent retaliation in more than a few isolated instances and in only a short period of time ?
Of course , no sensible person wants this to happen .
But no sensible person can deny that it could , and very likely would , happen under the posited circumstances .
One can only speculate as to how widespread and intense such violent reactions could become in the course of a catastrophic economic collapse throughout the United States .
The circumstances that provoked previous episodes of mass violence in America , however , pale in comparison to what should be expected from hyperinflation or depression today .
For instance :
During the six days of the so - called “ Watts Riots ” of 1965 in Los Angeles , California , over 30,000 adults took to the streets as rioters , 34 people were killed , 1,100 were injured , and upwards of $ 100 million worth of property , including some 1,000 buildings , was destroyed , looted , vandalized , or otherwise damaged .
The riots were triggered by an altercation incident to a simple arrest for alleged drunk driving — but their suppression required more National Guardsmen and police than the total of American Armed Forces personnel whom President Lyndon Johnson deployed to take over the entire Dominican Republic in that same year .
And suppression of the rioters did not address , let alone alleviate , the riots ’ underlying causes , which were chronic in the community — including such socio-economic problems as high unemployment , substandard living conditions , and a lack of adequate public education , together with political grievances linked to institutionalized racial discrimination in the city .
In the Los Angeles riots of 1992 , again the triggering event was relatively trivial — the questionable acquittal of three local police officers on charges of using excessive force to make an arrest . [ 4 ]
Within hours of the “ not guilty ” verdicts , rioting broke out and then continued for three days , with live television coverage of arson , assaults , looting , and vandalism by rioters , and suppression of the disturbances by National Guardsmen and police , being broadcast nationwide .
Overall , 50 people were killed ; more than 4,000 were injured ; and some $ 1 billion worth of property was destroyed or damaged .
These events teach certain lessons that Americans would be imprudent to imagine do not apply to themselves today :
First , each of the riots in Los Angeles erupted over a relatively minor event — but one which people on the spot linked to long - standing , widespread , and serious animosities derived from social , economic , and political grievances that public officials had failed , neglected , or refused to address .
In the course of a major nationwide economic collapse , such events — and many much more serious — will be quotidian and legion .
Second , the Los Angeles rioters obviously believed that mass violence could and should be employed as a justifiable form of political activism , when nothing else worked .
In this , one might note , they were in rough agreement with the men who wrote the Declaration of Independence .
And the timeless wisdom of the Declaration — that “ mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed ” , but that “ when a long train of abuses and usurpations * * * evinces a design to reduce the [ People ] under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government ” — will surely gain many more adherents as insufferable economic catastrophe , caused by the nincompoops in the General Government , sweeps across America .
Third , probably very few of the participants ( other than perhaps adventitious semi- professional looters ) expected to gain anything in terms of significant personal profit or meaningful social betterment as a consequence of the upheavals in Los Angeles .
Most of the rioters could never have expected the riots to bring about any specific political reforms , but instead engaged in them simply as a staging of anguished , despairing , and defiant political street - theater , the value of which inhered in the unmitigated violence through which the dialogue was communicated to a national audience .
People who find themselves in dire economic straits throughout America tomorrow may also be expected to turn to the red- curtained drama of mass violence in order to “ send a message ” across the footlights .
This message , however , will not be sent from a very small part of the country to the rest of it , but from the entire country to the very small part that constitutes the failed economic and political leadership classes .
So the level of violence will be far greater , and its focus far narrower and much sharper .
Fourth , although the territory in which they broke out was limited in extent , the riots in Los Angeles were so severe that they could not be put down with only the local police forces available , but instead required deployment of the regular Armed Forces ( in the form of the National Guard ) .
Major civil disturbances throughout the entire length and breadth of the United States will render this country ungovernable in short order , even if the entire National Guard were mobilized and none of it defected to the popular side .
Fifth , although those in positions of political power eventually suppressed the Los Angeles rioters with armed force , the cost was exceedingly high in relation to what might have been the bill for nonviolently correcting the worst of the underlying conditions that had spawned the people ’s grievances before those grievances finally took shape in destructive rebellion .
Today , even worse shortsightedness is evident .
For nothing is being done by the political and economic leadership classes to lift the crushing burden of debt — much of it unconstitutionally incurred in the first place — from the American people ’s shoulders .
Instead , more and more debt is being shoveled into the national account — eventually to be billed to common people through taxation and inflation — precisely in order to “ bail out ” the very institutions and individuals responsible for the present financial mess .
Sixth , the rioters in 1965 and 1992 were neither organized nor disciplined ; and although some were armed , no concerted and systematic use of arms throughout the disaffected communities occurred .
Neither did the rioters attempt to extend their violence into other areas , so as to attack the people they considered their oppressors in those people ’s own neighborhoods .
Under similar circumstances in the near future , this almost certainly will not be the case .
And ,
Seventh , in general , the more extensive the underlying socio-economic dislocations , and the more callous the disregard for these problems exhibited by the political apparatus , the more likely the eruption of mass violence that the perpetrators will rationalize as their only effective means to protest , broadcast , and redress their grievances with petitions written in the harsh language of destruction .
Which augurs ill for the present time , inasmuch as no one can believe that the socio-economic problems that underlay the riots in 1965 and 1992 in Los Angeles alone were anything but minor in comparison to the dislocations that full - blown hyperinflation or depression — or even the run-ups to those conditions — will bring about in contemporary society throughout America .
Now , if Americans are to deal intelligently with this situation , they must understand the reasons for it .
Basically , the reasons relevant here are that one vitally important constitutional principle has been flouted since 1913 and that another such principle is now being systematically disregarded .
The central economic problem plaguing this country since 1913 has been the presence of the Federal Reserve System .
Without the Federal Reserve System ’s debt - currency scheme having effectively supplanted the constitutional monetary system based upon silver and gold , it would have been impossible — not simply improbable , or difficult , but impossible — for politicians in the public sector and speculators in the private sector to have amassed the staggering level of unpayable , unconstitutional , and unconscionable debt that now bears down upon this country .
The critical political problem now emerging is the absence of a proper “ homeland - security ” structure based on “ the Militia of the several States ” , which the Constitution itself declares to be “ necessary to the security of a free State ” .
Instead of thoroughly organizing and preparing the American people at the State and Local levels to deal with economic and social crises by themselves and with their own resources , public officials are setting up a centralized para - military police - state apparatus , which in a major nationwide crisis will impose upon this country the very worst kind of “ homeland insecurity ” in the style of the East - European communist “ people ’s republics ” of the 1950s .
These two problems are inextricably interlinked .
The people in political and economic control in Washington , D.C. , and New York City may be knaves ; but they are not all fools .
They know that the Federal Reserve System — indeed , any central - banking scheme that circulates instruments of debt as “ currency ” — is inherently unstable , and will eventually self - destruct .
And they realize that , here in the United States , “ eventually ” is no longer far off .
Either they do not want to replace the Federal Reserve System , or they do not know how to replace it ( at least in time ) .
In any event , they have decided to attempt to “ manage ” its ever - more - destructive effects and thereby somehow “ muddle through ” with their power , wealth , and social positions intact — and the staggering costs of saving themselves to be imposed on hapless common Americans .

A major breakdown of the monetary and banking systems will , to some degree or other , negatively impact upon every economic transaction and relationship everywhere throughout the United States .
So the crisis will inevitably and inexorably entail social unrest on an immense scale .
Even if most State and Local police forces are marginally adequate to deal with the unrest that arises within their own jurisdictions , they will need to be coordinated in conformity with some overall national plan , so that an unified national effort can be made to stem the crisis .
This will require a central apparatus of command and control .
All the more so if State and Local police prove inadequate to the task .
For which reason , more than any other , the Department of Homeland Security was originally created .

Summary :
This article is presented in reverse order , newest on top , oldest on the bottom .
I ’ve briefly summarized the goal and procedure , but you can read from the bottom up to get the background .
Briefly , the goal of the exercise was to compare the quality of Ogg Theora with H.264 using two test files — one SD , the other HD – that I ’ve used over the years to compare codecs .
I encoded to my standard parameters , which are :
SD – 640×480@29.97 fps@ 500 kbps , 468 kbps video / 32 kbps audio , maximum quality parameters .
For H.264 , this meant High Profile , CABAC enabled , B - frame interval 3 , all quality options enabled .
HD – 1280×720@29.97 fps@ 928 kbps , 800 kbps video / 128 kbps audio , again maximum quality .
The lowest data rate that I could achieve for Ogg was 928 kbps for video , so I used that file .
I used Sorenson Squeeze to produce the H.264 files .
I used Xiph QuickTime Components to produce the first set of Ogg Files , presented on the bottom of this page .
Then , after learning that there was an update to the codec , I used ffmpeg2theora on the Mac to reproduce the results .
Specifically , I used verson 0.26 , dated 2/5/2010 , downloaded from here .
My command string for the SD file was ( ffmpeg2theora SD.mov –videobitrate 500 –optimize –keyint 300 –audiobitrate 32 – channels 1 ) , for the HD file it was ( ffmpeg2theora HD.mov –videobitrate 900 –optimize – keyint 300 –audiobitrate 128 –channels 2 ) .
For a general overview of how I encoded with Squeeze , check out this tutorial here .
I called this article Round 1 because I knew from the start that it would involve multiple tries to get things right .
I appreciate all the feedback that I got during this process and enjoyed the dialog .
Here ’s where we are .
I ’ve created a comparison file using the 1.1 Thusnelda release and using the command line argument supplied by Gregory Maxwell .
ffmpeg2theora -V 500 -k 300 -d 99999 ( the only additions provided to the commandline above is - d 99999 to remove the buffering constraint ) .
I encoded the file and then compared it to a file that Greg had encoded using the encoded H.264 file as the starting point .
When I noticed that his quality was better than mine , I loaded both files into MediaInfo and found that he was using a later code version .
This also was clear when I read KeyJ ’s review and the associated comments .
So , rather than test beta code ad infinitum , I decided to stop here .
I ’ve pulled some images from the three files ; here ’s the display order in each image .
The Ogg file I created is always on the left , the H.264 file in the middle , the file Greg created from the H.264 file on the right .
You ’ll see that the upcoming release has lots of promise and I look forward to seeing it .
The images are in PNG format ( as suggested ) and you can see them at 100 % by clicking them .
Some other notes :
You can draw your own conclusions regarding quality .
Clearly , Thusnelda 1.1 retains less quality than H.264 , but the new version shows lots of promise , even encoding from H.264 source .
I ’m aware that the audio on the test files is sub-standard .
I am drawing no conclusions about audio quality , but it ’s necessary to ensure that sound synch is maintained through to the end .
I ’m aware that there are other techniques for producing the Ogg file .
Greg is highly respected and works for Xiph , so I decided to go with his recommendation .
I did n’t include the HD file because of time constraints .
I know it ’s unfair to compare a file encoded from H.264 encoded video to a file encoded from the original source .
I ’m sure I could have gotten the code base that Greg used , and encoded using the original source file , but I wanted to wait until Ptalarbvorm is released .
I included Greg ’s file only because it showed improvement over the Thusnelda 1.1 file encoded from the original source material .
You can also play the files themself via the links below .

For a general overview of how I encoded with Squeeze , check out this tutorial here .
I know that mpeg2theora comes with multiple post processing filters that I did n’t try because that can turn hours of testing into weeks .
If anyone has any good input on which switches produce the best results I ’ll be glad to give them a try .
Just let me know in the comments below .
Here are the files as they sit on my server to verify the file sizes and bitrates .
I try to get the file sizes within about 5 - 10 % .
The files are n’t protected in any way , so after viewing them , you should be able to save them to your own systems .

I ’ll let the videos and still images speak for themselves .
Note that I did use two different encoding tools , the Xiph QuickTime encoder for the encodes below , and ffmpeg2theora for the most recent encodes .
As before , click each image to view it in full screen .
Still Image Comparisons
Original Ogg Comparisons
These comparisons used the pre-Thusnelda 1.1 codec are are superceded by the findings above .
SD – H.264
SD – Ogg
SD – Ogg 1mbps
HD – H.264
HD – Ogg
I understand that there ’s code that would play the videos in more browsers ( and fall back to Flash for the H.264 files ) .
I ’ll do better next time .
Still Image Samples
Here are some sample images grabbed from the clips , beginning with SD comparisons .
I ’ll start with a low motion scene , then move to higher motion .
In all instances , click the photo to view the original in a separate window .
In the SD comparisons , I created three files , two at 468 kbps as described above , the other OGG file at 1 mbps , more than double the data rate of the H.264 file .
In the first low motion sequence , all the images look pretty good , and Ogg is competitive even at 468 kbps .
In the second clip , there ’s a lot more motion , but the background has little detail .
We see that Ogg suffers at the comparable data rate , but that the 1 mbps clip is about the same in quality as the H.264 clip .
The H.264 clip has much better color fidelity and clarity , but that could probably be corrected by boosting contrast and saturation before encoding to Ogg format .
The third clip contains both high motion and high detail , a skateboarder coming to rest after a great run , framed against a chain link fence .
Here we see that the H.264 clip retains superior detail to even the 1 mbps Ogg clip .
Let ’s move to the HD samples .
Starting with a low motion sample , you can see that the difference between the two technologies is very minor .
Here ’s a higher motion clip , a closeup of a very talented piano player .
Fast moving fingers , a noticeable difference in quality .
Here ’s a higher motion clip .
In this clip , the ballerina ( Coppelia , actually ) is walking across the stage , so the image pan is pretty significant .
Lots of motion , some detail , very noticable difference in quality .
Here ’s
Beth the ballerina , coming down from a jump .
High motion , neither clip looks particularly great , but H.264 is clearly superior .
That ’s it for the samples , see the next page for some closing thoughts and considerations .
In the first federal appeals court opinion dealing with “ sexting ” — the transmission of sexually explicit photographs by cellphone — a three - judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled Wednesday that parents could block the prosecution of their children on child pornography charges for appearing in photographs found on some classmates ’ cellphones .
“ It does not resolve all of the constitutional issues implicated in sexting prosecutions , but it ’s a terrific start for civil liberties , ” said Witold Walczak , legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania , who represented the parents .
The case , Miller v. Mitchell , began in 2008 when school officials in Tunkhannock , Pa. , discovered seminude and nude photographs of some female students — some as young as 12 or 13 when the photographs were taken — on other students ’ cellphones .
The officials confiscated the phones and turned them over to the Wyoming County District Attorney ’s Office .
The district attorney at the time , George Skumanick Jr. , said that students possessing “ inappropriate images of minors ” could be prosecuted for possession or distribution of child pornography , and sent letters to the parents of the students with the phones — and the parents of students who appeared in the photographs — threatening to prosecute any student who did not participate in an after - school “ education program . ”
Open Ports on Windows XP
Inside your computer
I wage a constant battle to know everything that is going on in my computer .
Much of this stems from the constant barage of security holes that Microsoft calls " features " that are enabled by default in Windows XP .
Yes , I 'm paranoid . :-)
This page aims to be a quick - and - easy reference for what ports are open on a reasonably standard installation of Windows XP , and what they are used for .
Open ports
To see a list of open ports on Windows XP you can install one of many firewall applications , or you can go to a command prompt and enter :
netstat - ano
To find the program that is using the port , look at the PID number , then use the task manager to match the PID with a running process .
To get a more detailed list that includes the EXE file and DLL file names ( this takes a bit longer ) try this :
netstat - anobv
Port Description 123 Network Time Protocol used by the Windows Time Service
In theory , this synchronizes with various time servers on the internet .
In my experience , it always synchronizes with time.windows.com no matter how I set it .
I would not have noticed if I were n't running Kerio Firewall .
A bit suspicious , eh? 135 RPC ( Remote Procedure Call ) and DCOM ( Distributed Component Object Model ) .
RPC and DCOM allow a remote computer to send commands to another computer .
This is used by a variety of Windows - specific services .
( See the entry " Anything > 1023 " below . )
The RPC service is not stoppable ( see the section on unstoppable services . )
137,138,139
File and printer sharing and network name resolution using NetBIOS over TCP .
Windows 2000 and XP use 445 for the file and printer sharing portion , but is not accessible to Windows NT / '9 x systems .
445 File and Printer sharing for Windows 2000 and above .
( SMB over TCP ) 500 This is IKE ( Internet Key Exchange ) which is part of the IPsec protocol .
This is handled by LSASS .
EXE : Local Security Authority Service .
LSASS is also used for user login authentication , so disabling IPSec closes port 500 , but leaves LSASS running .
Anything > 1023 Ports above 1023 are available to applications in general .
Any service that uses RPC will be given a port above 1023 .
The port number can vary based on what services are available and what order they start in .
Examples include : Terminal services and Fast user switching
Task Scheduler
Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator ( MSDTC )
Domain Name System ( DNS ) 3372 Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator ( MSDTC ) .
This also uses another variable port above 1023 .
1900 Universal Plug and Plug ( UPnP ) 5000 Simple Service Discovery Protocol ( SSDP ) .
The companion to UPnP .
3389 The Remote Desktop service that allows you to control your PC remotely .
What is SVCHOST ?
You will notice that most ports are held by one of the many instances of svchost .exe .
Most Windows services are not full executables , merely DLLs .
These DLLs must be loaded by a host executable like SVCHOST .
This saves system resources at the expense of security .
To determine which services are running under a specific instance of SVCHOST , open a command prompt and enter :
tasklist /svc
Svchost usually runs as one of three special users : SYSTEM , LOCAL SERVICE , or NETWORK SERVICE .
Unfortunately , even the system administrator does not have sufficient rights to kill SVCHOST when it runs as one of these three users .
Unstoppable services
Some services such as RPC are unstoppable .
They ignore the stop command , and the service control manager will refuse to even let you try .
Some of these services cannot even be disabled .
I cannot imagine why any service should get such priveledges .
For example , why is the Audio Server unstoppable ?
Oh no !
No audio !

Jean -Baptiste Marchand wrote a very detailed article titled Minimization of network services on Windows systems which describes many of these ports in great detail .

Some may debate that architecture by itself is art , well , one thing is sure , when visual artists set their mind to illustrate something architectural , there ’s no doubt that ’s going to result in something incredible .
3D graphics opened a whole new way to architectural visualization , because it ’s very intuitive .
Thanks to the tools of modern 3D software , one can quickly and easily create architectural models in a virtual space , and just as easily make modifications , experiment with shape , structure , camera and lightning settings .
Although this medium works great not just for mere artistic pleasure but even for professional use in architecture , this collection focuses mostly on the former , bringing you some of the most inspiring 3D exterior rendering artworks .

Your foot strikes the ground about 1,500 times when running a mile .
It strikes the ground about 39,300 times when running 26.2 of them .
That ’s called a marathon , for which you need both training and a routine .
For 10 years , Michael Ward had a routine : Up at 4 a.m. , breakfast , catch the bus to work as an editor at an aviation newsletter , then leave at 6 p.m. and back to his one - bedroom , one - bathroom Santa Monica apartment .
FOR THE RECORD :
Jobless marathoners :
An article in Thursday ’s Section A about unemployed workers who use distance running as a way to manage stress said one such runner , Michael Ward , had lost his job April 31 .
The correct date was April 30 . —
But on May 1 , 2009 , when it was time to get up , Ward , 39 , did n’t .
He had been laid off the day before .
He lay in bed for hours , angry , scared .
His head told him he needed to be somewhere , that there was work to do .
Then it hit him : “ There ’s nothing there . ”
He had to get out of the house .
So he grabbed a pair of old sneakers and went to Clover Park near Santa Monica Municipal Airport .
He took a step .
Then he took about 3,000 more , running two miles , using a trash can as a lap marker .
He ran on adrenaline and the anger of being let go .
He used long strides as he had when he was a sprinter at Servite High School in Anaheim .
When he finished , he was n’t tired , just hungry .
He had skipped breakfast that morning .
He came home and went through job ads .
He wondered what to do .
On Sunday , Ward will be among 25,000 runners in the L.A. Marathon , many of them participating in their first marathon , just as he will be .
But his story is not unfamiliar .
He is part of a new group of marathoners : those who are unemployed and do distance running as a way to manage stress .
There are no direct statistics linking the two , but as job losses have reached historic highs , so too has marathon participation .
Running experts have found that during this recession , the number of new runners has surged , largely because it ’s cheaper than a gym membership .
It costs only a pair of shoes and time .
“ It ’s a terrific sport for this economy , ” said Gary Smith , a marathon coach from Long Beach .
About 25 new marathons were founded in 2009 , putting the total at more than 470 in the U.S.
In 1999 , there were about 320 .
This last year a record 465,000 people finished a marathon in the U.S. , up about 10 % from 2008 .
It was the biggest increase in more than 25 years .
The growth in marathon participation is not solely linked to the recession .
There is the advancement of social networking , which makes it easier for people to train together and for race organizers to target specific groups .
But running coaches say during this recession , the unemployed have turned to marathons because they need a challenging goal that requires structure and offers control .
“ That ’s a huge part , ” said Tom Holland , an exercise physiologist based in Connecticut whose specialty is training people for marathons .
“ Especially in this time when so much is out of your control , you put on your shoes and you can go out when so much else in your life is crazy around you . ”
Ward trains with a group , as many do .
Because of its nature , that method can be considered group therapy for the unemployed .
“ There ’s the all - in - this - together attitude , ” said Dr. Adam Naylor , a sport psychology coach and director of the Boston University Athletic Enhancement Center .
“ And what ’s a job ?
It ’s people working toward a common goal . ”
Ward had that until he was told his last day would be April 31 .
A week after returning from England , where he buried his uncle , who died of cancer , Ward was on the line with a department boss from the company ’s regional office in Maryland .
“ As you know , the company is struggling right now , and we have to make cuts . ”
Ward sighed .
Two years ago , when the economy started tanking , he started saving what he could because he thought this call might come .
“ We ’re here to help you . ”
He laughed .
A month before the call , he was asked to fill out a chart of his daily responsibilities and list who was most capable to be his backup .
He knew then he would n’t last much longer .
“ We value you as an employee . ”
The call ended shortly after that .
The 10 - person staff was cut to four , and he was asked to train his replacement .
Running became his routine after that , but he was n’t built for distance .
The most he had ever run was 5.8 miles during “ Hell Week ” training in high school nearly 20 years ago .
He had n’t run much in the last 10 years because he was too busy with work .
But now , he had plenty of time .
“ I just needed something at that time to focus on because I was so used to having the get - up - every - morning routine and having a structure -- and all of the sudden there was no structure , ” he said .
He rose at 4 a.m. and usually ran a few miles every day .
Week by week , he was able to improve one mile at a time .
He lost about 30 pounds , from 190 to 160 .
In August , he ran his first 5 K .
His anger started to subside .
He started to believe that a marathon was possible .
According to Dr. Daniel Lieberman , a Harvard professor who studies the evolutionary biology of running , the fact that humans have long Achilles ’ tendons , short toes and the ability to sweat -- among other features -- gives humans an advantage at long - distance running .
“ Pretty much every human being in reasonable shape can train and run a marathon , ” he said .
When Ward joined a local running group , he was given a 150 - page manual as part of his membership .
It told him when to run , how to run ( he has since shortened his stride ) , when to rest , how to eat , how to stretch , how to walk .
He found his new routine .
He bought $ 100 long - distance running shoes , and a watch that tells him how far he ran .
Always in the back of his head was finding a new job .
But in October , he did n’t have to think about it anymore .
Ward was hired to work at a parish in Baldwin Park , helping with social services and fundraising .
The pay is about half of the $ 75,000 he made before .
He now breaks even on his bills and is still able to cover his $ 1,215 - a - month rent .
“ The luxuries in life are gone at this point , ” he said .
Waiting for Sunday ’s marathon has been both exciting and nerve - racking .
He could n’t sleep one night two weeks ago .
He is n’t sure why .
He believes he can do it .
His group ran 20 miles recently , the farthest he had ever run .
They were given certificates , and he posted his at his desk at work .
He feels empowered .
Next to that certificate is a map of the route , which runs from Dodger Stadium to Santa Monica .
When Ward runs it Sunday , he ’ll run past his old building in Century City .
He ’ll be able to see into his old office .
It will mark 325 days since he last worked there , and 8.7 miles from the finish line .

RIO DE JANEIRO —
The battle over Brazil ’s newfound oil riches is heating up .
The lower house of Congress voted last week to share the portion of the country ’s royalties from oil revenues that go to Brazil ’s states equally among the states .
The vote , part of a broad overhaul of the nation ’s oil laws being undertaken in the wake of big offshore discoveries over the last three years , was a shocking blow to the state government of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil ’s biggest oil - producing region .
If the bill becomes law , it would deny the state of Rio and other oil - producing states billions of dollars in expected royalties .
Rio ’s annual oil revenue would fall to about $ 134 million from about $ 4.3 billion , state officials said .
But Rio ’s governor , Sérgio Cabral , is fighting back , calling the vote in Congress a “ lynching ” and contending that it was unconstitutional .
He said promised public works projects for the 2014 soccer World Cup and the 2016 Olympics in Rio could be imperiled by a sudden drop in revenues , although the federal government has pledged to back Rio ’s Olympic effort .
Mr. Cabral , an ally of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , organized a large march through Rio ’s streets on Wednesday afternoon to protest the move by Congress .
Despite a persistent rain , tens of thousands of people , many of them state employees who had been given the day off , showed up , with many arriving on buses from all over the state .
Last night , Vancouver , British Columbia welcomed the world , as over 2,600 winter athletes from 82 countries entered the BC Place arena , ready to compete in 86 events in 15 different sports .
The opening ceremony focused on Canadian diversity and heritage , with emphasis on the many cultures of the First Nations .
After the longest Torch Relay in history , the Olympic Flame has come to rest and now lights the cauldron of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics .

I do not want to overthrow the government .
In case you misread that , I am going to type it again , this time more slowly : I. Do. Not. Want. To. Overthrow the government .
I do n't want black helicopters landing on the roof of my apartment building , and I do n't want to be hunted by death squads through the jungles of Bolivia .
I always pay my taxes .
I think paying taxes is fun !
If someone asks me if I enjoy the music of Rage Against the Machine , I usually say , " Oh , they were only okay . "
Whenever I see people using the metric system , I punch them in the pancreas .
However ...
Something has been occupying my mind as of late , and I can't tell if this thought is reassuring or terrifying : I 've been thinking about the possibility of revolution , or - - more accurately -- the impossibility of revolution .
I 've started wondering what would have to happen before the American populace would try to overthrow its own government , and how such a coup would play itself out .
My conclusions are that a ) nothing could make this happen , and b ) no one would know what to do if it somehow did .
The country is too large , its social systems are too complex , and its people are too complacent , too reasonable , and too confused .
I 've decided that the U. S. government is ( for lack of a better , preexisting term ) " unoverthrowable . "
And this would probably make a man like Patrick Henry profoundly depressed , were it not for the fact that he 's been dead for 207 years .
" The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants , " wrote Thomas Jefferson , and his thoughts were far from unique : Almost all of the Founding Fathers were obsessed with the potential for insurgency on U. S. soil .
" Future citizens will need muskets to assassinate their oppressive viceroys , " James Madison might have hypothetically remarked during the intermission of a slave auction .
" In fact , this is probably the second most important freedom any of us will be able to come up with .
Somebody should write this shit down . "
Superficially , such preemptive legislation worked perfectly :
There are now roughly two hundred million guns in America , and that 's only counting the NBA 's Eastern Conference .
We have enough privately owned firepower to instantly kill a billion grizzly bears , plus a few dozen prostitutes .
But it 's hard to imagine these weapons employed in any kind of popular uprising , even if a majority of American adults unilaterally agreed that such an event was necessary .
Whom would they presumably shoot ?
Probably no one , and possibly one another .
The central issue here , I suppose , is impetus : Americans are not particularly motivated to overthrow their government .
But what if they were motivated ?
Would that even matter ?
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , countless media whores criticized the government for not doing enough for the people of Louisiana .
But let 's imagine that the government had done even less ; let 's imagine that the president and most of Congress decided that New Orleans was a lost cause , barricaded all the roads into the city , and gave up .
Let 's pretend they made no attempts to relocate the survivors or deliver aid , and New Orleans was allowed to devolve into a rogue dystopia that was no longer recognized as part of the union .
One assumes this would prompt cataclysmic outrage ; it would be no different from the state - sponsored execution of random poor people , which seems like a revolt - worthy offense .
Yet if such a nightmare scenario had actually happened , what could the average middle - class resident of Boise , Idaho ( or anywhere else ) , have done ?
He 'd lose faith in the democratic process , and he 'd possibly update his blog .
But that 's about it .
He has no options .
He 's twenty - two hundred miles from the ruins of Bourbon Street , he 's twenty - four hundred miles from Washington , D. C. , and he 's got to be at work by 9:00 A.M. , because he has a house ( and he likes his house ) .
But -- just for the sake of argument -- let 's assume this man still wants to push the envelope .
Let 's assume this patriot is beyond outraged .
Maybe he just rented The Bourne Supremacy , and maybe he thinks the time for blogging has passed .
Maybe he 's ready to make some really bad choices for some really ethical principles .
Maybe Neil Young 's " Revolution Blues " comes on his iTunes , so he loads the .30 - 30 he just bought at Wal - Mart and walks into the street .
What now ?
My aforementioned question remains unresolved : Whom , exactly , is this man supposed to shoot ?
A cop ?
The mayor of Boise ?
A FEMA employee ?
Whom would he be revolting against ?
Is it even possible for the modern man to know ?
When trying to overthrow a regime , all those unanswerable questions matter .
But then again , maybe they do n't .
I doubt most Americans would participate in a revolution , even if they understood ( and supported ) its cause completely .
I was recently discussing this with a colleague of mine over lunch ; we were trying to come up with conditions that could ignite a people 's uprising we 'd actively involve ourselves with .
These possibilities ranged from " massive water shortage " ( which could happen in India in the coming decade ) to " political infiltration by flesh - eating panda zombies " ( which happened in Nepal in 2005 ) .
My associate offered this scenario : " Suppose we had evidence that the federal government engineered 9/11 , " he said .
" Suppose we had indisputable proof that we paid the Saudis to blow up the World Trade Center , and members from both political parties had signed off on it .
And the day after this proof emerged , George W. Bush announced that he would give a speech at ground zero explaining why this decision was made .
If this happened , I assume there would be a protest rally during his speech .
And perhaps some people would start throwing rocks , and perhaps I 'd be caught up in the frenzy , and perhaps I would start throwing rocks , too . "
" So you would take part in the revolution 's inception , " I responded .
" You would throw rocks at a corrupt president . "
" Yes , " he said .
" Maybe .
Or maybe not .
Probably not .
Who knows ?
I 'm not really a rock - throwing kind of guy . "
I 'm not a rock - throwing kind of guy , either .
Moreover , I assume the type of person who hurls rocks in public is not the type of person I would agree with about anything .
Modernity has created a cosmic difference between intellect and action , even when both are driven by the same motives ; as such , the only people qualified to lead a present - day revolution would never actually do so .
Contemporary leaders are not rock - throwing guys .
And this is a problem , because it 's the rock throwers who get things done .
Here again , my feelings are mixed ; maybe I should n't have used the word problem in my previous sentence .
Perhaps I should have used the word luxury .
I 'm pretty sure there are numerous countries in this world where citizens dream of a society too rational to be influenced by rock throwers .
1
Security has a way of making philosophy irrelevant , and anyone who disagrees is either a liar or a tenured professor .
But there 's still something ominous about the reality of our sanctuary .
It seems weird that this is the country and there 's nothing we can do about it , beyond participating in the system that 's already in place .
It would not matter what the government did or to whom they did it -- nobody knows how to change things in any meaningful way , and the only people who'd try are dangerous and insane .
We have reached a point where the reinvention of America is impossible , even if that were what we wanted .
Even if that were what everybody wanted .
You might think the government is corrupt , and you might be right .
But I 'm surprised it is n't worse .
I 'm surprised they do n't shoot us in the street .
It 's not like we could do anything about it , except maybe die .

Noted US boffins have stated that habitable conditions in far - flung star systems may be more commonly found on moons in orbit around planets than on the planets themselves .
This of course suggests that space travel may be very common elsewhere in the galaxy , among aliens who are not unfortunate enough - like the human race - to live in a star system with only one habitable body .
The moon men longed to invade and plunder their super - Earth ringed primary , but knew their spindly purplish bodies would never stand up to 7G .
" Alien moons orbiting gas giant planets may be more likely to be habitable than tidally locked Earth - sized planets or super - Earths , " says Lisa Kaltenegger of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
" We should certainly keep them in mind as we work toward the ultimate goal of finding alien life . "
The search for habitable worlds orbiting other suns requires the use of a powerful space telescope - for instance the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) which NASA intends sending up to replace the Hubble - which is used to spot a " transit " when such a world passes in front of its parent star .
Such a transit is more easily seen ( when speaking of Earth - sized bodies ) in the case of a world orbiting quite near the star , meaning that it 's easier to spot worlds where liquid water could exist orbiting dimmer , less powerful stars .
But a full - blown planet orbiting a dim star close enough to be decently , life - bearingly warm would most probably be " tidally locked " like Mercury , with one face always turned toward the sun and the other eternally dark .
Thus , Kaltenegger theorises that such worlds would be only marginally habitable .
When dealing with bigger , hotter suns like our own , it 's easier to detect massive gas - giant planets like our own Jupiter or Saturn .
Once such a planet is found , it 's then possible to determine whether or not it has moons .
If the gas - planet sat within its star 's habitable zone , one or more of its moons might be of Earthly size - and habitable .
Though tidally locked with respect to the gas - planet , the moons would rotate with respect to the local sun , so getting evenly - distributed sunlight and heat .
" All of the gas giant planets in our solar system have rocky and icy moons , " says Kaltenegger .
" That raises the possibility that alien Jupiters will also have moons .
Some of those may be Earth - sized and able to hold onto an atmosphere . "
It might even be possible in some circumstances to have habitable moon (s ) orbiting a habitable " super - Earth , " a massive rocky planet much bigger than ours .
All these exo-moon possibilities raise the prospect of alien star systems containing more than one habitable body .
If such a situation had existed here in the Solar System , there would have been an immense spur to human space - travel efforts ; furthermore , journeys among moons of a single planet would be far easier to achieve than true interplanetary journeys .
It does n't seem unreasonable to speculate that any intelligent aliens inhabiting such a multi-habitat solar system would progress much faster than us in space travel .
If life on exo-moons is actually more common in the universe than life on planets proper , as Kaltenegger suggests , it seems at least possible that space travel - and with it space trade , warfare etc. - is also widespread .
Humanity may need to rise above its circumstances if we 're not to be hopelessly outclassed by the multifarious moon - man civilisations out there .
Kaltenegger has written a paper on the subject , Characterizing Habitable Exo-Moons , which may be read here . ®
Bootnote
The Center for Astrophysics people naturally went with an Avatar reference in discussing this , as the new flick is set on a habitable moon .
We ourselves prefer the " forest moon of Endor " pop-culture nod when discussing exomoonology .
Some of these not - so - secret admirers could sell their own jerseys in stadium stores .
Some should be locked up .

1. Bobby Murcer 's Biggest Fan
Our first story has a fairy - tale middle and a horrible ending .
In August of ' 77 , Bobby Murcer of the Cubs promised to hit a home run for terminally ill fan Scott Crull .
That night , Murcer hit two of them .
Pretty amazing , especially when you consider Murcer only hit nine homers the whole next season .
But that 's not why Crull — a 12 - year - old from Calumet City , Illinois , with bone cancer — makes this list .
Broadcasting the game nationally on ABC , Keith Jackson told the country how Murcer had fulfilled the dying boy 's last wish .
Eyes watered , spines tingled .
There was only one problem — nobody had ever told the boy he was dying .
His parents were horrified .
Three weeks later , Crull passed away .
2. The Good Luck Charmers
Every sport has its own strange traditions .
I 'd argue hockey 's " throwing an octopus on the ice for good luck " is the weirdest .
Tossing the eight - tentacled cephalopod was the brainchild of Detroit storeowners Pete & Jerry Cusimano .
The date : April 15 , 1952 .
The logic : one tentacle for each of the eight playoff victories it took to win the Stanley Cup .
Later that spring , most likely fueled by the good luck octopus , the Red Wings won the title .
PETA has objected to this practice , which continues to this day .
The Red Wings mascot is not a Red Wing , but Al the Octopus .
3. The John 3:16 Guy
Also known as " Rainbow Man , " the born - again Rollen Stewart and his John 3:16 signs were fixtures at major events in the 1970s and 80s .
He brought his message to the World Series , Super Bowl , Olympics , and World Cup .
He was outside Buckingham Palace when Di & Charles wed ; he went to see the Pope in Alaska .
But he was more religious fanatic than sports fan .
According to the LA Times , Stewart planned to assassinate President Bush and candidate Clinton in 1992 .
And he's now serving three life sentences for holding a maid hostage at a Los Angeles Hyatt , also in 1992 .
By the way , chapter three , verse sixteen of the Gospel of John says , " For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life . "
This is also printed on cups at the In - N - Out Burger .
4. The All - Star Heckler
For 12 years , Maryland lawyer and Washington Bullets fan Robin Ficker was the NBA 's most prominent heckler .
With season tickets behind the visiting team 's bench , his antics were legendary .
When he reminded Frank Layden of the Jazz that USA Today had rated him Worst Dressed Coach , Layden had to be restrained by security .
With the Bulls in town , Ficker loudly read excerpts of Maverick , coach Phil Jackson 's sex - laden 1975 autobiography .
During the 1993 Suns - Bulls NBA Finals , Charles Barkley ( of the Suns ) flew Ficker to Phoenix and bought him a ticket behind the Chicago bench .
Ficker was ejected in the first quarter .
The Bullets became the Wizards in 1997 and moved into the MCI Center the following season .
Ficker 's new seats were not in shouting distance of the visiting team , forcing him into heckling retirement .
In 2006 , he received 9.5 % of the vote in a losing bid for Montgomery County Executive .
5. Kim Jong-il
That 's right , the world 's most feared dictator is a hoops junkie .
During a 2000 visit , then - Secretary of State Madeleine Albright presented him a basketball signed by Michael Jordan .
The Chicago Bulls are the favorite team of Kim Jong - il , who reportedly has a video library with every game Jordan ever played .
At 5 ' 3 " , the Supreme Commander of the Korean People 's Army is roughly the same height as Mugsy Bogues .
6. David Letterman's Stalker
David Letterman 's biggest fan was also his biggest headache .
When she was arrested for stealing Dave 's Porsche in 1988 , Margaret Ray told police she was Mrs. Letterman .
She was a frequent trespasser on Dave 's estate , once camping out on his tennis court .
Ray 's antics made her a regular monologue target .
But the jokes stopped in 1998 , when Ray committed suicide .
The collective guilt spread when we learned she was schizophrenic , as were her two brothers , who also committed suicide .
7. Joe from Saddle River
A die - hard Jets , Mets and Rangers fan , Joe Benigno was a frequent caller to WFAN , New York 's all - sports radio station .
Benigno won the station 's Fan Appreciation Day contest in 1994 , earning a chance to guest - host his own show .
By 1995 , Joe was WFAN 's overnight guy , a title he held for almost a decade .
In 2004 , he was deemed ready for daytime and given the 10 am - 1 pm timeslot .
For all the lonely and passionate talk radio callers out there , Joe gives hope .
8. Steffi Graf's Biggest Fanatic
Deranged and obsessed with seeing Steffi Graf return to the top of the rankings , Gunter Parche stabbed Monica Seles during a 1993 match in one of the most disturbing incidents in sports history .
Almost as disturbing was his punishment .
Parche received a two - year suspended sentence and was ordered to attend mandatory counseling .
Even more shocking , I can't find footage of any of this on YouTube .
ATM in north Oklahoma City stolen by man with tow truck and trailer
A man used a tow truck , a flatbed trailer and a chain to haul an ATM from a bank this morning in north Oklahoma City , police said .
The man , who wore a dark hooded sweatshirt , dark gloves and stocking cap , backed a tow truck with a trailer attached about 1:10 a.m. to the drive - thru ATM at BancFirst , 702 E Memorial Road .
The driver hooked a heavy chain to the machine and pulled it onto the trailer then drove off , Wardlow said .
An alarm went off and when an officer arrived the machine was gone , she said .

An article written by University of Tennessee professor John R Garrett , " Monetary Policy and Expectations : Market - Control Techniques and the Bank of England , 1925 - 1931 " , which describes in exquisite detail the gold falsification measures undertaken by the Bank of England in the interwar period in order to impact interest rates in a favorable direction , performed with the full criminal complicity of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , may mean paranoid " gold bugs " could soon be forever absolved of their " tin hat " wearing status as outright gold , and other data , manipulation by a major central bank is now proven beyond doubt .
The implications regarding the possibility of comparable deceitful and treasonous acts by modern central bankers are staggering .
The Bank of England depleted its open - market portfolio by secretly sterilizing large gold inflows .
Thereafter interest rates were influenced by manipulating reported gold flows ....
A gold flow falsification was over two - thirds as effective as an open - market operation .
Falsifying critical gold data worked for Britain 70 years ago .
Is it working now too ?
And is the BOE alone , or is Bernanke taking advantage of the Bank of England 's experience ?
To be sure , the world was different with the Gold Standard the bedrock of monetary policy .
Yet are the similarities between then and now not greater than the differences ?
With the shadow economy exposed as hinging on the investing community 's desire to go with the prevailing " valuation " lie ( a reason why the shadow economy in broad terms will take many years to return , if ever ) the core asset is and always will be gold .
And yet the main question remains : why did the Bank of England openly and flagrantly manipulate critical data ?
Why did it mislead the citizens of the country it was supposed to serve ?
And if this happened in the past is it happening now ?
Is this the reason why the Federal Reserve is so opposed to exposing itself to public scrutiny and audits ?
If the BOE was engaging in outright fraud in the 1925 - 1931 period , why would today be any different ?
Garett 's mesmerizing report , published in the September 1995 issue of Monetary Policy and Expectations , has oddly not received much if any public notice , with not a single mention of the article or its implication in either the blogosphere or the mainstream arena .
This is very unusual as Garret 's disclosures would lend vast credence to not just gold bugs ' claims that there is blatant ( ongoing ) gold data manipulation , but that Central Banks regularly engage in outright deception when it comes to achieving desired monetary policy results .
To wit :
Montagu Norman , the Governor of the Bank of England ... engaged in a large - scale deception that greatly over - stated the size of the effective open - market portfolio , understated the size of the gold stock , and misstated the size and even the direction of gold flows .
Not only that , but Garrett provides a direct link between secret gold market operations by the BOE and accumulation of US Treasuries : a critical concept not just in interwar Britain but more so currently , when faced with the need to finance trillions in budget deficits , the market is poised to decline by 25 % + should the US government experience a failed auction .
Oh , and guess who was complicit in the BOE deception , and was used by the British central bank as a trading conduit ?
Why , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , of which Tim Geithner was president from 2003 to 2009 .
Norman sold pound - denominated securities to sterilize the additional bank reserves created by the gold inflow .
He simultaneously sold gold for dollars , lowering the Bank 's reported gold stock , and bought U.S. Treasury bills with the proceeds .
He also had all transactions carried out on the New York market by the New York Federal Reserve Bank so that they could not be traced to the Bank of England .
( see Figure 1 ) The U.S. Treasury bills were comingled with pound - denominated " other securities " in the Bank 's published open - market portfolio and were assumed by the markets to have been pound - denominated securities .
In one stroke the gold inflow and the decline in the open - market portfolio were hidden .
Bank Rate was kept at a very high level given the abysmal state of the economy , well over the level that would have prevailed under the Bank of England 's prewar reaction function .
The motive : the traditional misrepresentation of inflationary / deflationary forces to the general public .
Had it become public knowledge in the spring of 1928 that deflationary policy was three times as severe as reported and concurrently that gold inflows and the gold stock were at record levels , Norman would have been through .
And if anyone thinks the Fed 's penchant for secret is a novel thing , just look at what was happening in the dark corridors of the Bank of England in those dark days after World War I :
Sayers documents that the Committee of Treasury , the Bank of England 's day - to - day governing body , was left in the dark , as was the Court , the Bank 's de jure and , before Norman , defacto policy body .
Sayers expresses surprise at the secrecy with which open - market operations were surrounded even within the Bank 's inner corridors .
This extended to the point of declining to keep in the Bank 's confidential archives any written records of policy decisions motivating transactions .
However , for Norman 's policy model the utmost secrecy was essential .
But it does n't end there : what Montagu Norman did was virtually equivalent to treason .
One , thus , can not help but wonder what Ben Bernanke does behind closed doors .
Norman 's deception was audacious , as it involved the abrogation of Parliamentary authority over the coin of the realm and the subversion of the ancient charter of the Bank of England .
These major questions of state , however , became bureaucratic trivialities compared to Norman 's daily task of convincing the financial markets that he was in control when in fact he was not .
An effective open - market portfolio of well over 50 million pounds was required to maintain control through standard open - market operations .
From late 1926 until the end of the gold standard Norman never held the minimum portfolio , and normally could muster only one - fourth or less of the requisite strength .
And while we can be sure that the Federal Reserve is certainly not performing the same kind of illegal and treasonable activities , as otherwise Federal Reserve General Counsel Scott Alvarez would be in prison for gross perjury , courtesy of Alan Grayson , looking back at history may provide some other ideas of how the Fed could engage in other just as illicit monetary activities :
Montagu Norman maintained his tenuous grip on the market by fully exploiting all traditional policy instruments and through the creation of a wholly new expectations channel for monetary policy .
Four methods were employed : open - market operations ; special deposits ; coordinating public finances ; and false reporting of gold flows .
The quantitatively least important method of market control was using confidential special time deposits from individual financial institutions to take reserves off the market .
Special deposits had to be substantial and secret , as the Bank was claiming in its published figures that it had no reason to resort to special deposits to drain reserves .
Thus special deposits were difficult to use as a regular policy tool ( see Table 1 ) .
Although special deposits were used only three times , each instance came during a period of market - control difficulties ( see Figure 2 ) .
Yet monetary policy response were vastly limited :
As the open - market portfolio was completely exhausted by 1928 : 2 ( see Table 2 ) , contractionary monetary policy could not have been maintained otherwise .
However , there were limits to such help , as padding the Treasury 's balance at the bank required issuing more Treasury bills than necessary , which cost the taxpayer , and was therefore certain to draw inconvenient questions from the Chancellor of the Exchequer .
And here is where we enter the twilight zone :
Norman published misleading Bank of England balance sheets that falsely reported gold flows .
Up until late 1926 the gold inflow was consistently understated , but the direction of change in reported gold holdings faithfully followed actual gold holdings .
Sayers states that Norman 's intention in hiding gold was merely to accumulate a reserve cushion for a rainy day , and does not view the hidden gold as a market - control tool , though he admits that the secret reserves supported tighter monetary policy .
Sayers 's position , which is consistent with the pattern from July 1925 until October 1926 , may reflect Norman 's original intention .
However , from late 1926 , just as his open - market portfolio declined below the market - control threshold , Norman did not just underreport gold inflows , but began to under - , over - , and misreport gold flows as appropriate for his market - control needs .
Every possible type of false reporting was committed .
If after reading this historical evidence of Central Banking treason , senators are unable to pass Ron Paul 's Fed Transparency
Act then there has to be open social action to clean out the Senate of all those who claim that the Fed 's actions are pure and true , as they are merely corrupt cronies , bought entirely by interests of the Federal Reserve , and thus Wall Street .
Furthermore , we urge readers to follow through on footnote 34 of the Garrett report " For example , Woolley , Monetary Politics ; and Neumann , " Precomitment . "
Note that Woolley also finds evidence for the U.S. of a channel of influence running " backwards " from the central bank to the administration . "
We are very curious just what " evidence " , besides the circumstantial , exists that the administration is nothing but the Fed Chairman 's puppet .
The BOE 's actions , which were open and flagrant fraud and deceit , went far beyond just gold manipulation .
One can easily find parallels between the Mutual Assured Destruction wild card used by Norman and such " end of the world " exhortation by Paulson , Bernanke , Geithner , Blankfein and everyone else who stands to see their accumulated wealth disappear should there be a full audit of the Federal Reserve .
Norman 's proffered scenario called for a rise in Bank Rate supported by open - market operations .
To restore reserves the London clearing banks would call in their overnight money , the chief source of finance for the discount market 's bill portfolio .
To pay off their call - loan borrowing , the discount houses would be forced " into the Bank , " forced to discount their portfolios at Bank Rate , a full 2 percent above the call - money rate .
Thus Norman was threatening to force the discount houses to liquidate their highly leveraged portfolios at rates 3 percent above those contemplated when the portfolios were purchased ( the 2 percent differential between call money and Bank Rate plus a 1 percent increase in Bank Rate ) .
Given the thin margins and low capital levels in the discount business , this would have produced severe losses .
Despite Norman 's weekly meetings with the discount houses ' governing body , he waited to deliver his ultimatum until the pound 's seasonal autumn weakness , when the market was already nervous about an increase in Bank Rate , five months after the market - control incident began .
Why Norman had simply not drained sufficient liquidity out of the market at the time of the incident was probably puzzling to the discount houses , but the dire consequences of Norman 's threat made it unlikely that anyone would call his bluff , if anyone could have even conceived that he was bluffing .
In fact , he was .
His portfolio was empty .
Garrett 's findings ultimately provide a critical basis to reevaluate the entire foundation of modern fiat - system based economics .
The results may be summarized as follows .
Markets can not tell when a central bank is lying .
They then have the option to accept all or reject all forecast information emanating from the central bank .
Under such circumstances the credibility model asserts that private financial markets reject all central bank information .
This is possible because the financial markets ' private information is assumed to be almost complete .
However , the results presented here contradict this assumption and lend support to the opposite case : the markets ' private information is so incomplete that they can not dispense with central - bank sources .
The implication for the credibility model is devastating because pervasive ignorance and uncertainty allow the central bank to maintain its position as a disseminator of forecast information even if the central bank is guilty of extreme dishonesty , as under Norman .
Under these circumstances monetary policy will be an effective instrument to stabilize the economy against both money demand and real shocks , which contradicts the core result found in the large and influential credibility - model literature .
And , sure enough , with these findings , the death of Monetarism and Keynesianism is one step closer :
Recently support has increased for Kindleberger 's " internationalness " hypothesis and in particular the role played by the internationally shared characteristics of the macroeconomic policy system .
The three most important features of the macroeconomic policy system were fiscal policy constraints through balanced budget policy rules or laws ; the independent central bank as the uncontested policy authority ; and the gold standard as the system 's enforcer .
The postwar international financial order was managed by central bankers who were not stabilizers , whether of a Monetarist ( stabilizing the money supply ) or Keynesian ( stabilizing the level of output ) variety .
Montagu Norman 's policy model and his policy choices lend clear support to the new interpretation .
Much of the earlier literature explicitly or implicitly assumes interwar central bankers were stabilizers .
Conclusions dependent upon this premise must be reevaluated .
Garrett 's conclusion is stunning .
Should comparable deception be found at the epicenter of monetarism , i.e. , the Federal Reserve , the refutation of the entire " goal seek " science of economics as we know it may soon be at hand .
[ T ]he behavior of British financial markets is shown to be inconsistent with the microfoundations of the new classical model - expectations not only moved in a policy reinforcing rather than a policy negating direction , but expectations became a reliable , systematic policy instrument .
One of Thomas Sargent 's hopes is fulfilled - economic history proves to be fertile ground for testing the accuracy of complex macroeconomic theory - though the outcome is probably not what he had expected .
We urge readers to read the Garrett paper and to send it to their representatives and senators , with the hope that once it becomes fully clear that formerly reputable Central Bankers openly , repeatedly and in flagrant violation of their charters , engaged in outright market manipulation and data fraud , that the Federal Reserve will finally be audited or abolished , which for all intents and purposes , will end up being the same thing .
We are confident that somewhere Mark Pittman is smirking , all too knowingly .

Whether it is school or work we are all familiar with having to meet deadlines .
Some of us may find them a helpful tool while others find them a damn nuisance .
Is that ticking clock in the background really helping us work harder and more efficiently ?
Or is it giving us incentives to rush in some situations , slack off in others , or even frustrate us to the point where we neglect our work altogether ?
This article wishes to explore these situations and ask the questions :
When are setting deadlines productive and useful ?
And when do they inhibit us from doing a good job or achieving a goal ?
In the rest of this article , I describe how deadlines can sometimes set us up for disappointment , and how deadlines can sometimes rush and inhibit creativity .
But I also describe how deadlines can be a valuable tool in motivation , and how deadlines can help us keep long - term goals in mind .
Here are 4 things to keep in mind when setting deadlines to help you use them as effectively as possible .
Setting a deadline for disappointment
“ I love deadlines .
I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by . ”
Douglas Adams
I want to destroy the notion that we must set deadlines for all of our goals .
Some things just are n’t conducive to time - related constraints .
Take for example your health and fitness – is it really appropriate to take some arbitrary date and say , “ I must lose 10 lbs within the next month . ”
What if you do n’t meet your goal ?
What if you only lose a single pound ?
Are you going to feel frustrated and give - up ?
Albeit it ’s a small step , but does not meeting your quota really take away from the achievement of losing one pound ?
What if instead you said , “ It would be nice if I lost 10 lbs within the next month . ”
That is a much less restricting statement because you are n’t telling yourself what you absolutely have to do .
You are still maintaining an empowering vision of the future without setting a constricting deadline ( and setting yourself up for a potentially crippling disappointment ) .
You ca n’t rush inspiration
For some people their creativity is their main source of livelihood .
Their job depends on them to come up with riveting ideas that capture people ’s imaginations .
This is true for people like musicians , filmmakers , and artists .
When I think about this in the context of deadlines I am reminded of a scene in the movie Adaptation .
The whole movie centers around Charlie Kaufman ’s struggle to create a film based on this book called The Orchid Thief .
For those who do n’t know Charlie Kaufman , he is a real writer and director .
You might know recognize some of the films he ’s directed , such as Being John Malkovich , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , and Synecdoche , New York .
In the movie Kaufman ( who is played by Nicholas Cage ) gets a call from his boss wanting to know how the screenwriting is coming along .
He says he needs to see it on his desk in a couple weeks , and in turn Kaufman replies , “ You ca n’t rush inspiration . ”
Is this true ?
Can you put a deadline on creativity ?
Creativity can come at any moment , sometimes putting ourselves in the right environment to be creative ( and taking your time ) ) , is better than rushing to finish a project by a specific date .
Working best under pressure
“ A deadline is negative inspiration .
Still , it ’s better than no inspiration at all . ”
Rita Mae Brown
In defense of deadlines , there are some people I know who claim to work best when they are under pressure .
They thrive off of the thrill of channeling their stress into a state of flow – getting in the zone – and working their butts off until they have finally finished their project .
This could be true for some creative endeavors , but I imagine that this strategy is most effective with work that is more do - oriented and less thinking - oriented .
If you already have a clear picture in your head of what needs to get done , then setting a deadline is a great way to motivate yourself towards action .
One example I will borrow from my own life :
I have been wanting to write an ebook on well - being and happiness ever since I first got interested in mental health and personal development .
I have had ideas floating around in my head for years .
Finally earlier this year I wrote an outline on the types of lessons I wanted to include .
Now that I have everything comprehensively planned out , it all boils down to getting it done .
Realizing this , I now know it is a good time to set a deadline for actually getting this thing out of my mind and into the world .
That is why I am giving myself until the end of the month to finish writing it .
This is one case where I am OK with setting deadlines – even though I am the kind of person who usually prefers spontaneity .
A beacon of light in the distance
Because most people are so bad at time management , we often see deadlines as something that is always right in front of us – forcing us to get to work and get things completed .
However , deadlines can also be something we place in the distant future .
For example , when I first started this blog in June of 09 I gave myself two years to turn it into a profitable enterprise .
I am not even a year into it yet but this deadline has guided me to stay focused on what my bigger goals are .
It is a beacon of light – a vision for the future – that is in the background of everything that I do .
When deadlines are used in this way they can become a kind of symbol for success , something to aspire towards , and dedicate energy to gradually over time .
Deadlines do n’t always have to rush us to be effective ; they can give us room and be inspiring .
You may have already set deadlines like this without even being aware of it .
For example : when you were a young adult ( or if you are one now like me ) , you may have said at one point , “ I wo n’t get married until I am 30 . ”
This is one example of setting benchmarks way in the future .
Beware , however , that when we place these distant deadlines for the future , if we do n’t revisit those goals and aspirations from time to time , we may forget about them or run too far off track .
When do deadlines work best for you ?
This is my rudimentary analysis of deadlines .
I do n’t wish to rid the world of them completely , but I do think it is important we put them into perspective .
In some contexts they can do wonders , while in other contexts they can inhibit us severely .
Tell me – what are your experiences and thoughts on deadlines ?
When do they work best for you ?

Fox execs have been in touch with several affiliates , " applying pressure " to put Conan O'Brien on the air between 11 and midnight ... sources tell TMZ .
It 's the clearest sign so far that Conan is going to Fox .
Our sources say Fox execs and Conan 's reps have been " seriously talking , " though no deal has been made .
Some of the Fox affiliates have been resistant to running a Conan show , because they 'd make more money with the current schedule of sitcom reruns such as " The Office . "
Several execs at the affiliate stations are saying they have felt the pressure from Fox honchos to take O'Brien 's show .
And we 've learned execs at several major
Fox affiliates are saying a deal is " imminent . "
Israel last week submitted its response to the UN's Goldstone Report .
That report investigated the conduct of Israel and Hamas during the Gaza war in January 2009 , accusing both sides of war crimes .
It recommended resorting to the International Criminal Court if the sides failed to investigate the charges themselves .
One of Goldstone 's sharpest accusations , denied by Israel , was that Israel used incendiary phosphorous artillery near civilians , against the laws of war .
The Goldstone report and Israel 's response point to some of the most important questions facing Western democracies today : when can our nations legitimately resort to military action , and what is permissible in the course of military action ?
What are we allowed to do to defend ourselves ?
Different nations have had their own codes of warfare to describe acceptable purposes and means in warfare .
Growing out of work by Augustine and Thomas Aquinas on just war theory , efforts in the West beginning with the 19th and 20th century Hague and Geneva conventions aimed to limit the impact of modern warfare on civilian non-combatants and on combatants themselves , as well as to define what circumstances permitted a nation to go to war .
The call for such rules heightened with the carnage of the 20th century world wars .
A single night 's American incendiary bombing of Tokyo in March of 1945 killed some 100,000 people .
Fire bombings of London , Coventry , Dresden , and other European cities during World War II - undertaken by two sides with very different motives but similar means - killed tens of thousands .
These acts of war , like Israel 's actions in 2009 , raised hotly contested questions of " proportionality " as defined in just war theory .
Proportionality demands that a military act be proportionate in its effects on civilians to the expected military gain .
Just war theory also tries to distinguish combatants from non-combatants , with special protections for the latter .
The United States , Germany , and other NATO countries have faced questions on the proportionate nature of their actions in recent years .
The German military 's call for an air attack in Afghanistan last fall , which killed 69 enemy combatants and some 30 civilians , provoked a political and moral crisis in Germany .
The United States has , to say the least , been criticized both for its reasons to go to war in Iraq and for its conduct of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Such criticism is not new .
The Vietnam War was as contentious as Iraq for its purposes and methods ( including incendiary napalm ) .
U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton faced criticism for their reprisals against Libyan and al Qaeda terrorists , respectively .
Conversely , Western nations were charged with disproportionately weak responses in the Balkans in the mid-1990s .
Such vigorous debates are proper in democracies that seek to guide their actions by considerations of law and justice , though formal inquiries are often begun only reluctantly and political considerations always intervene .
Such is the nature of democracy .
In its response to Goldstone , Israel indicated that it had disciplined two field commanders and that 150 allegations of misconduct during the war have been investigated , with 36 referred for further criminal investigation .
This is the way Western democracies handle complex and difficult questions of accountability , even though these debates put Western militaries under constraints and pressures their enemies do not share .
And the questions are indeed complex and difficult .
Other related questions in just war conduct have become more ambiguous yet more urgent as terrorists and insurgents emerge as the main enemy .
The distinction between combatants and non-combatants is less clear .
Should terrorist abettors be treated as combatants ?
How does one handle cases of an enemy employing " human shields " or deliberately placing military capabilities in civilian facilities , a particular problem in Afghanistan , Iraq , and Gaza ?
What about civilian workers in a defense ministry or an arms plant ?
The Goldstone report charged Israel with taking disproportionate actions and disregarding the safety of civilians .
The contrast between the fire bombings of World War II , with massive death tolls for civilian populations , to the 1400 deaths in Gaza ( some significant proportion of whom were combatants ) shows how far the standards for proportionality have come in the minds of some observers .
Obviously , such measures do not demonstrate the proportionate quality of any act .
But Israel clearly did not use anything like its full military capacity in Gaza ( an indication of restraint , though again not a guarantee of proportionate action ) .
And Israel appears to have gone to great lengths to limit civilian deaths .
Yet these constraints were not enough to preclude the strong criticism of the Goldstone report .
The West - including especially Europe , the United States , Canada , and Israel - needs a new consensus on these questions .
Specialized groups of lawyers and military experts have engaged in efforts to resolve these issues .
Those efforts continue , and they are an important part of answering the questions .
But , the German Marshall Fund 's recent Transatlantic
Trends poll showing that 70 % of Europeans do not agree that the use of force is sometimes necessary to obtain a just outcome , while at the same time 70 % of Americans agree with the statement , a broader and deeper transatlantic discussion on the use of force is essential .
Such a discussion will not eliminate accidents or failures in war .
But it might allow the West to respond to its enemies with greater confidence in its own purposes and methods .
WASHINGTON – Top law enforcement officers of four states called on the Senate to take the side of the people not the predatory banks by approving a House - passed bill to create a strong Consumer Financial Protection Agency .
Speaking at a telephone news conference , Feb. 9 , the attorneys general of Connecticut , Illinois , Iowa and Ohio general debunked bank lobbyists ’ claims that existing federal agencies are enough to protect consumers .
Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller told reporters , “ The senators have to ask themselves : What side are you on ?
The side of the public ?
Or the side of the big banks ? ”
Oversight and enforcement requires a new federal consumer protection agency , Miller said .
“ It must be an independent agency to work . ”
It was a failure at the federal level that led to the subprime mortgage crisis with millions of foreclosures that triggered the worst financial crisis in 75 years , he charged .
Consumer protection was treated as a “ stepchild ” by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve , Miller charged .
They were so intent on protecting the banks that they ignored the predatory lenders rather than protect the people , he said .
Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan declared , “ Predatory lending was at the heart of the financial crisis . ”
State attorneys general in several states uncovered and pursued predatory lenders like Household Finance , Countrywide and Wells Fargo , she said , but the federal government “ did nothing to protect homeowners and credit - card holders . ”
The federal government in the past nine years brought only 11 enforcement actions against predatory lenders while state prosecutors brought 8,000 enforcement actions in that same time period , Madigan said .
“ The need for an independent consumer protection agency has never been so clear , ” she said .
“ Yet the banks are spending millions of dollars to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Agency . ”
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal debunked the arguments of Republicans that an independent federal agency will be costly and discourage entrepreneurship and innovation .
“ The cost of this new agency will be minimal considering how this agency is needed to protect the people and restore trust in our financial system , ” he said .
“ The cost of failing to establish a consumer protection agency will be much greater .
Putting this in the hands of an existing agency is the death knell to the vigorous enforcement we need . ”
He added that “ reckless risk - taking brought our economy to the brink of collapse .
This financial meltdown was foreseeable . ”
Blumenthal noted that he , himself , had sounded a warning that derivatives , hedge funds and other murky Wall Street “ products ” were a “ financial black hole ” that threatened the entire financial system .
Federal regulators under the Bush administration ignored those warnings or , worse , “ aided and abetted ” the shell game , he charged .
The only innovation a new consumer protection agency will “ stifle ” is deceptive and predatory practices that should be stifled , Blumenthal said .
“ The banks are furiously lobbying to kill or cripple this bill .
Now is the time to stand against Wall Street and with the people to repair the trust and make sure that this kind of crisis is never repeated . ”
Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray said his state was among the hardest hit with 250,000 foreclosed mortgages in the last three years .
He blamed “ predatory lending practices that were allowed to run amuck ” with no oversight or enforcement .
Cordray pointed out that long ago the federal government established consumer product protection to shield families from lead paint and toxic toys that poison children .
“ There is no question that families have suffered by a lack of a financial watchdog , ” he said .
He charged that banks , lending agencies and credit card companies were permitted to “ run wild , ” sowing financial ruin for millions .
Madigan stressed that a powerful grassroots demand for Senate passage of the bill without weakening amendments is required .
“ This crisis nearly destroyed our economy , ” she said .
“ We need to put in place common sense controls .
The American people need to get involved .
This is a democracy .
People have to let their elected officials know where they stand . ”
Miller urged the Senate leadership to call the Republicans on their filibuster threats .
“ Let these senators be seen by the people , where they stand .
Why are they against this common sense bill ?
The only way we are going to win is if the people rise up . ”

Centro Lola offers the village women healthcare and educational workshops
Lola Almudevar was a freelance journalist working for the BBC in Bolivia when she was killed in a car accident in 2007 .
Young , passionate about Bolivia and full of enthusiasm for the region , her death was a loss to Latin American journalism .
On Wednesday , a women 's centre , called Centro Lola and built using funds raised in her name , was opened in Bolivia , as Will Grant reports :
The tiny village of Choritotora is nestled in the Bolivian Andes , at around 4,000 m ( 13,123 ft ) above sea level , where the dry brushland is used for little more than potato and quinoa crops , or sheep grazing .
It could hardly be further from the green forests of Nottingham , but it is in Choritotora , amid the abode huts , that a memorial to one of Nottingham 's brightest young journalists has now been unveiled .
Amid music , dancing and fireworks , the ribbon on the Centro Lola was cut , and traditional blessings were made in Aymara , Spanish and English .
We wanted to do something special to commemorate the person she was .
Lola loved it here in Bolivia - she 'd found her spiritual home

Lola 's younger sister
The women 's drop - in centre is a shiny new orange and red building with a bright red roof .
Yet the simple construction represents something far greater .
" The most important thing about this centre is that we 're protected from the sun and the rain so that we can meet easily , " Jostina Chuquijuanca de Soria told me , her Aymara language translated by a local woman who spoke Spanish .
Jostina said that the women in her community used to meet outside .
" But it was really very uncomfortable .
Now that we have a centre we can have workshops .
" Our papers do n't fly away and we can pin them up on the walls .
We use centres like these for children 's nutrition programmes , and also for children 's early stimulation programmes where we learn how to play and to work on making toys . "
Nottingham lace
The maternal mortality rate - the number of women who die in childbirth - in this part of Bolivia is unusually high , and on a par with levels seen in sub-Saharan Africa .
Dr Carolina Hilari , health adviser to Save the Children in Bolivia which helped build Centro Lola , says the importance of such a space in health terms is invaluable .
Jane Todd swaps a gift of Nottingham lace for local textiles " There 's no health centre in this village .
So once a month , all the women who have children under five will meet here to look at their children 's growth and weigh them .
" The nurse from the next village will come here too and administer vaccinations and treatments , and give out health advice , " said Dr Hilari .
But the centre is by no means intended solely as a healthcare centre .
" The women will also meet for educational workshops , they 'll have courses , they 'll invite outside speakers on issues such as family violence , what are the rights of women , of children , and so on , " Dr Hilari explained .
As the women flocked into their newly - opened space , they blessed it with floral offerings and confetti , liberally sprinkling petals over the members of Lola 's family and friends who had made the trip from Britain for the event .
On the floor , they opened out parcels of their handicrafts and brightly coloured textiles which are the mainstay of their income .
During the opening ceremony , gifts of Nottingham lace were exchanged for Andean textiles from the women in a further connection between the two regions .
Spiritual home " Nottingham has always had a tremendous textile base , particularly lace , " said Jane Todd , the chief executive of Nottingham City Council , who travelled to Bolivia as a close family friend .
" Indeed , it 's brought us tremendous wealth over the last 200 to 300 years .
It 's really very powerful to see the women using their own , beautiful textiles , as a way of gaining economic independence .
Despite the obvious differences between our two parts of the world , the parallels really come through for me . "
Whether the Centro Lola will play primarily an economic function or a social and healthcare one , in many ways , does n't matter , said Dr Hilari .
Centro Lola will be an important space for local women " It seems such a simple thing to have a space like this , but it means something very significant for the identity of the women .
Aymara men will usually have a room for their farmers ' union meetings and so on .
" But for the women to have a space just for them is incredibly important .
It 's a definition of power , I think . "
For the members of Lola Almudevar 's family present at the inauguration , the centre was a fitting use of the money they had raised at an event in Birmingham on what would have been her 30th birthday .
" When Lola was killed in the accident close to here , " says Rebecca Almudevar , Lola 's younger sister , " we wanted to do something special to commemorate the person she was .
" Lola loved it here in Bolivia - she 'd found her spiritual home . "

Mercedes GP will wait until the season - opening Bahrain Grand Prix to bring its definitive 2010 diffuser onto its car , team principal Ross Brawn has revealed .
Although the German car manufacturer team is expected to bring a raft of aerodynamic improvements onto its car during Friday test at Barcelona , the final diffuser package will not be part of it .
When asked by Gazzetta dello Sport when the new diffuser would be fitted to the W01 , Brawn said : " At the first grand prix in Bahrain . "
Brawn acknowledged that his team 's winter preparations were nowhere near as impressive as last season's , when his eponymous team dominated the final Barcelona test .
However , despite having struggled early on with getting front tyre temperatures up to the perfect operating window , he was far from concerned about the early performance .
" We knew those performances [ from last year ] could n't be repeated , " he said .
" We can't yet say whether this car is a winner , but we know it 's not bad .
" We 've had a few small problems , but in Jerez , despite the bad weather , there have been improvements already , in the sense that the team has made progress in the process of understanding the car and the tyres . "
Brawn also welcomed the input that Michael Schumacher has given to the team since his return - although he said it was taking time for the seven - time champion to get himself fully back into the swing of things .
" It 's a big help : Michael has always been an excellent reference point for me , " said Brawn .
" We have two new drivers , but he is n't really new : he is precise , clear , he knows what he wants , and he is very good at feeling the car .
" However , he was on the sidelines for three years and the cars have changed greatly during this time .
He has to get into the system of a completely new team and he has got to begin getting to know Rosberg and understand how to work together . "
When asked if he felt Schumacher had changed , Brawn said : " No , he still has the fire inside , he is very determined and focused on what he does . "
There are times in life when we might not find what the problems that we are going through .
Whether you are going through a really serious problem or even a minor problem , getting help would be helpful and will help you balance the stress that you will have to go through .
Most of the time , …

A legal dispute that had riveted the chess world and hobbled the United States Chess Federation , the game ’s governing body , has been settled  mostly .
Papers filed on Friday in Federal District Court in Lubbock , Tex. , stipulate that two former federation board members , the federation and some of its other members are dismissing almost all of their claims and counterclaims .
The dispute began with accusations over Internet postings and evolved into a series of lawsuits in several states .
Randy Bauer , a federation board member , said the federation settled “ to stop the bleeding . ”
He said the dispute had “ hurt the federation , ” adding : “ We have had to lay off staff .
We have had to reduce services . ”
Bill Hall , the organization ’s executive director , said the federation , which has annual revenues of about $ 3 million , had spent nearly $ 750,000 in legal fees on the cases .
Third - party drives not permitted on Gen 11 servers
Thank you very much for your comments and feedback regarding exclusive use of Dell drives .
It is common practice in enterprise storage solutions to limit drive support to only those drives which have been qualified by the vendor .
In the case of Dell 's PERC RAID controllers , we began informing customers when a non-Dell drive was detected with the introduction of PERC5 RAID controllers in early 2006 .
With the introduction of the PERC H700 / H800 controllers , we began enabling only the use of Dell qualified drives .
There are a number of benefits for using Dell qualified drives in particular ensuring a positive experience and protecting our data .
While SAS and SATA are industry standards there are differences which occur in implementation .
An analogy is that English is spoken in the UK , US and Australia .
While the language is generally the same , there are subtle differences in word usage which can lead to confusion .
This exists in storage subsystems as well .
As these subsystems become more capable , faster and more complex , these differences in implementation can have greater impact .
Benefits of Dell 's Hard Disk and SSD drives are outlined in a white paper on Dell 's web site at http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/products/pvaul/en/dell-hard-drives-pov.pdf

FOR American commentators who like to denounce European complacency in the face of an increasingly assertive Islam , France is an intriguing test - case .
It is home to Europe 's biggest Muslim minority , numbering some 5 m - 6 m , and it unapologetically expects Muslims to adapt to French ways .
In 1994 the government began clamping down on religious symbols , including the Muslim headscarf , in state schools .
Ten years later it banned all “ ostentatious ” religious signs , including the veil , from state schools and other public buildings .
Now yet another tightening is in the works : a proposed ban on wearing the burqa in any public places .
Jean - François Copé , parliamentary leader of the ruling UMP party , this week submitted a draft law stating that “ nobody , in places open to the public or on streets , may wear an outfit or an accessory whose effect is to hide the face ” .
A few exceptions would be made , he said , such as for carnivals .
At other times , anybody refusing to take off a face - covering could be fined € 750 ( $ 1,090 ) .
He hopes parliament will debate the draft at the end of March , shortly after the regional elections .
The move by Mr Copé , an ambitious politician , is a parliamentary not a government - led initiative .
Yet it has broad backing .
President Nicolas Sarkozy declared last year that the burqa was “ not welcome on French soil ” .
François Fillon , the prime minister , said this week that he backed the idea of a ban .
Mr Copé says that he already has 220 deputies supporting him .
When the French refer to the burqa , they do not mean the Afghan outfit , with a cloth grille over the eyes , which is not seen in France ; they mean the niqab , the head - to - toe covering that leaves a narrow slit open for the eyes , which is traditionally found in the Gulf .
Ten years ago , even this garment was virtually unknown in France , since most French Muslims originate from north Africa , where traditionalists cover only the hair , not the face .
Today , according to intelligence estimates , some 1,900 women wear the niqab in France .
Yet even this number is tiny , so why are the French so exercised ?
One reason is their century - old secular tradition , which fiercely defends the separation of faith and state , and makes most French people uneasy about conspicuous religion .
Nativity plays or carol concerts in state primary schools are unthinkable , as would be the swearing - in of presidents over the Bible .
When the Swiss voted recently to ban the construction of minarets on mosques , Mr Sarkozy urged believers of all faiths in France to “ practise their religion with humble discretion ” .
Liberal outsiders see this as intolerance .
But to the French , who fought hard - won battles against authoritarian clericalism , it stems from a secular wish to keep religion in the private sphere .
Yet today 's concerns about the niqab go far beyond secularism .
“ The burqa is not a religious sign , ” Mr Sarkozy said last year , but rather a “ sign of subservience , a sign of debasement ” of women .
For six months , a cross-party parliamentary inquiry has been holding hearings about the burqa .
One by one , French Muslim figures have filed in to state that , as Dalil Boubakeur , rector of the Paris Mosque put it , “ neither the burqa , nor the niqab , nor any all - over veil , are religious prescriptions of Islam . ”
Moreover , as Dounia Bouzar , a French Muslim anthropologist , pointed out to the commission , most of the women she sees wearing the niqab are young .
Intelligence sources suggest that 90 % of them are under 40 .
Two - thirds are French nationals , half of them second - or third - generation immigrants , and nearly a quarter are converts .
In other words , this is not an influx of women from the Gulf , but a statement by young French Muslim women , whose own mothers did not cover their faces .
Mr Boubakeur and other mainstream French Muslim leaders are clear about its origins : it is “ an invasion of salafism ” , an ultra-puritan branch of radical Islam .
French politicians of many stripes are keen to draw a firm line in order to thwart further proselytising , particularly in the heavily Muslim banlieues .
The ( communist ) chairman of the parliamentary commission , which is due to report at the end of January , favours a burqa ban .
So do Eric Besson , a former Socialist who is now minister for immigration and national identity , and Fadela Amara , a Muslim minister and former campaigner for abused women , who once called the burqa a “ prison ” .
Yet even if it is justified on security grounds , a ban would still be controversial .
The opposition Socialist Party opposes the burqa but frets that outlawing it may be counterproductive .
The French Council of the Muslim Faith , an official body , fears that a ban would stigmatise Islam .
As it is , Mr Besson has caused unease by launching a national consultation on what it means to be French that has unleashed a torrent of anti-Muslim commentary .
Some argue that a ban would play into the hands of those who spread hardline propaganda .
Others worry that women , who are often under domestic pressure to wear the burqa , would be unfairly punished .
“ France would be the only country in the world that sends its policemen … to stop in the street young women who are victims more than they are guilty , ” wrote Laurent Joffrin , editor of Libération .
Mr Fillon said this week that he wanted first to pass a parliamentary resolution to condemn the wearing of the burqa ; legislation could follow , but only after considering its compatibility with European law and with the French constitution .
Under the 2004 law , the burqa is already banned in public schools , as it is on identity cards .
Since last year , the wearing of balaclavas can also be banned during or near protests .
The planned burqa ban would forbid the covering of the face even in the street , but not the wearing of an all - over veil that leaves the face exposed .
France is likely to come in for much outside criticism for its burqa ban .
It will be accused of illiberalism , and disregard for freedom of expression , or of imposing a Western interpretation of women 's oppression .
In his speech in Cairo last year , America 's Barack Obama said that “ it is important for Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens from practising religion as they see fit — for instance , by dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear . ”
Yet all liberal democracies have to make compromises to balance freedom and security .
France will argue that this is not a campaign against Islam , but an effort to uphold its values when they are being tested as never before .
The world may not see it that way .

The above statement comes from the man who is the center of what I call , “ climategate ” , Professor Phil Jones , the former director of the University of East Anglia ’s Climatic Research Unit until he had to step down when it was discovered there were e-mails that skeptics had claimed show scientists were manipulating data .
Professor Jones also has said , with the quotes that “ for the past 15 years there has been no statistically significant ’ warming . ”
This is all coming from the horse ’s mouth .
What it all comes down to is that all this about man-made , climate change is nothing but a PURE FRAUD .
Even today , Donald Trump has called for Al Gore to be stripped of his Nobel Peace Prize honor with more news coming out about “ climategate ” .
With this news people should rightly demand that those who have been promoting this massive lie should accept responsibility for this fraud and apologize for misleading the public .

An anonymous poster made this comment on
an earlier post
:
what dawkins is doing is to eschew all forms of inquiry that do not conform to the scientific method .
if this isnt narrow - mindedness i do n't know what it is .
angry doc asked the poster what exactly it was that Dawkins eschewed that the poster thought should not be subject to the scientific method , to which our poster replied :
How about ghosts for instance ?
I 'm not saying for sure that they exist because honestly I have n't had any encounters with the supernatural .
But there have been reported sightings .
People have claimed to have seen them .
To Dawkins , this would n't count as knowledge because you 'd find it incredibly difficult to conduct experiments to investigate the veracity of the claim due to the inconsistency with which such sightings occur .
But why should you disregard this claim simply because by scientific standards it fails to qualify as knowledge ?
Is n't there a possibility that the eyes of these witnesses were not playing tricks on them ?
Is n't there a possibility these people were not lying when they swore they had seen ghosts ?
Is n't there a possibility that there are indeed ghosts ?
Of course it is possible .
By the same argument it is also possible that unicorns , leprechauns , and the chupacabra exist , and that Elvis lives .
Everything is possible , except that the existence of all those things we ’ve mentioned are unlikely and unproven .
Well , maybe not Elvis .
But what does Dawkins have to say about the subject of ghosts ?
As it turns out he * had * heard a ghost as a child , and he touches briefly on the subject in his book The God Delusion , part of which is reposted here
angry doc abstracts the relevant parts :
One of the cleverer and more mature of my undergraduate contemporaries , who was deeply religious , went camping in the Scottish isles .
In the middle of the night he and his girlfriend were woken in their tent by the voice of the devil — Satan himself ; there could be no possible doubt : the voice was in every sense diabolical .
My friend would never forget this horrifying experience , and it was one of the factors that later drove him to be ordained .
My youthful self was impressed by his story , and I recounted it to a gathering of zoologists relaxing in the Rose and Crown Inn , Oxford .
Two of them happened to be experienced ornithologists , and they roared with laughter .
" Manx shearwater ! " they shouted in delighted chorus .
One of them added that the diabolical shrieks and cackles of this species have earned it , in various parts of the world and various languages , the local nickname " Devil Bird " .
The argument from personal experience is the one that is most convincing to those who claim to have had one .
But it is the least convincing to anyone else , especially anyone knowledgeable about psychology .
Many people believe in God because they believe they have seen a vision of him — or of an angel or a virgin in blue — with their own eyes .
Or he speaks to them inside their heads .
You say you have experienced God directly ?
Well , some people have experienced a pink elephant , but that probably does n't impress you .
…
[ The formidable power of the brain 's simulation software ] is well capable of constructing " visions " and " visitations " of the utmost veridical power .
To simulate a ghost or an angel or a Virgin Mary would be child 's play to software of this sophistication .
Once , as a child , I heard a ghost : a male voice murmuring , as if in recitation or prayer .
I could almost , but not quite , make out the words , which seemed to have a serious , solemn timbre .
I had been told stories of priest holes in ancient houses , and I was a little frightened .
But I got out of bed and crept up on the source of the sound .
As I got closer , it grew louder , and then suddenly it " flipped " inside my head .
I was now close enough to discern what it really was .
The wind , gusting through the keyhole , was creating sounds which the simulation software in my brain had used to construct a model of male speech , solemnly intoned .
Had I been a more impressionable child , it is possible that I would have " heard " not just unintelligible speech but particular words and even sentences .
And had I been both impressionable and religiously brought - up , I wonder what words the wind might have spoken .
…
That is really all that needs to be said about personal " experiences " of gods or other religious phenomena .
If you 've had such an experience , you may well find yourself believing firmly that it was real .
But do n't expect the rest of us to take your word for it , especially if we have the slightest familiarity with the brain and its powerful workings .
Well , angry doc has something to add to that :
We all require evidence of one sort or another to believe ; we just happen to have less stringent criteria for accepting someone 's claims as valid evidence when we want or wish for them to be true , and vice versa .

Valve 's Steam platform has become one of the biggest engines driving digital distribution , powering PC gaming and providing a model for online distribution in general .
But Mac users have mostly been kept out of the picture , unless they 've been persistent enough to install Boot Camp or a Windows emulator .
Now it looks like Valve is finally bringing Steam to the Mac .
Folks from the Steam forums ( via Engadget ) poked around the folders in the latest Steam beta release , and they came across a few interesting images .
Each filename begins with " osx " and the images include dock and window icons .
There 's also an " osx. menu " file featuring coding for the Steam menu functions .
Of course , it 's possible Valve is just working on getting the Steam platform running on Macs , without actually porting any of their current games .
The change could be as small as simply offering current Mac games for download .
Still , it 's a big step and one that will hopefully lead to some Half - Life goodness on Macs across the world .
TEHRAN — President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad boasted Iran was now a nuclear nation as he announced on Thursday the production of its first highly enriched uranium on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution .
“ One day they said we cannot enrich uranium , but with the resistance of our leader , nation … and with the help of God , the Iranian nation has become nuclear , ” Ahmadinejad said .

“ They ( Americans ) want to dominate our region but the Iranian people will never let them do that , ” he said in a speech at Tehran ’s Azadi ( Freedom ) Square before a crowd of hundreds of thousands .
“ The head of the atomic energy organisation ( Ali Akbar Salehi ) said the first stock of 20 percent fuel was produced and delivered to scientists , ” he added .
Iran had previously enriched uranium to just 3.5 percent but has started enriching it to the higher level required for a Tehran medical research reactor after snubbing a UN - drafted plan for the nuclear fuel to be supplied by France and Russia .
Its defiance has drawn Western warnings of new UN sanctions , and the US Treasury Department on Wednesday imposed an asset freeze on an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps commander and four subsidiaries of a construction firm owned or controlled by the elite force .
A restricted document of the International Atomic Energy Agency revealed on Thursday that Iran had informed the UN watchdog on Monday that it would start enriching uranium to 20 percent from Tuesday .

Iran to produce higher enriched uranium in days : IAEA
The one - page document said Iran had said it intended to enrich a small amount — about 10 kilogrammes ( 22 pounds ) — to the higher level and had asked for the agency ’s inspectors to be present at the enrichment plant at Natanz .
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano noted that Iran currently had just one cascade of centrifuges at the Natanz plant capable of the additional enrichment .

Iran nuclear developments
Earlier this week , Iran ’s atomic chief said the separate cascade was “ more on a lab scale , ” suggesting its output would be limited .
Ahmadinejad mocked Western governments ’ focus on removing the majority of Iran ’s existing stockpiles of low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) from the country .
ADVERTISEMENT
He boasted that the Natanz plant , where Iran has been enriching uranium in defiance of UN Security Council ultimatums and sanctions , had the capacity to produce large quantities to replace any Iran shipped out .
“ They think it is such a big job to take some hundred kilos of 3.5 pct uranium out of Iran , ” he said , referring to the UN - drafted deal , which proposed supplying the fuel for the Tehran research reactor in return for Iran shipping out most of its stockpiles of LEU .
“ We are making several kilos of this in Natanz every day .
In the near future , inshallah , our daily production will be tripled . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Ahmadinejad also questioned why Iran had drawn such a chorus of criticism with its announcement last Sunday that it would begin enriching uranium to 20 percent .
“ Why do they ( world powers ) think that 20 percent is such a big deal ?
Right now in Natanz we have the capability to enrich at over 20 percent and at over 80 percent , but because we do n’t need it , we wo n’t do it . ”
Experts say that once Iran has enriched uranium to the 20 percent level , there is nothing to stop it carrying on to the 93 percent level needed to produce nuclear weapons as the technology is the same .
The West suspects Iran of using its nuclear programme as a cover for efforts to build the atomic bomb , a charge Iran strongly denies .

Patience over Iran ‘ not inexhaustible ’ : British PM
The United States has stepped up the pressure on Iran since it announced on Tuesday that it had begun work to enrich uranium to 20 percent , which it says is for a medical research reactor in Tehran .
Also in his speech , Ahmadinejad lashed out at US President Barack Obama , whom he accused of squandering an opportunity to change Washington ’s traditional policy of support for the Jewish state .
“ Unfortunately , the hope for change ( in US policies ) is in the process of rapidly changing to despair , ” he said , referring to hopes stirred by the election of the superpower ’s first black president .

“ He ( Obama ) is missing opportunities and is not acting correctly , ” Ahmadinejad told the crowd .
On Tuesday , the US president pushed for a “ significant regime of sanctions ” unless Iran accepts international proposals aimed at curbing its nuclear ambitions .

Barbie designers say they worked with the Society of Women Engineers and the National Academy of Engineering to ensure that accessories , clothing and packaging were " realistic and representative of a real computer engineer . "
" Geek chic , " as they call it , means computer engineer Barbie wears a t - shirt featuring a binary code and carries a smart phone , a laptop case , and tops it up with some stylish pink glasses .
Overall , the effect is very Elle Woods a.k. a Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde .

I dug out the original and scanned everything .
For those of you from my era , in Boston , you ’ll bug out at everything .
Personally , I spent a lot of time remembering Sean .
For the rest of you , check out a YOUNG Rob Gangemi .
Here ’s the whole issue in one big monster post :
MEMPHIS 
In the back room of a theater on Beale Street , John Renken , 37 , a pastor , recently led a group of young men in prayer .
“ Father , we thank you for tonight , ” he said .
“ We pray that we will be a representation of you . ”
An hour later , a member of his flock who had bowed his head was now unleashing a torrent of blows on an opponent , and Mr. Renken was offering guidance that was not exactly prayerful .
“ Hard punches ! ” he shouted from the sidelines of a martial arts event called Cage Assault .
“ Finish the fight !
To the head !
To the head ! ”
The young man was a member of a fight team at Xtreme Ministries , a small church near Nashville that doubles as a mixed martial arts academy .
Mr. Renken , who founded the church and academy , doubles as the team ’s coach .
The school ’s motto is “ Where Feet , Fist and Faith Collide . ”
At one point during the more than half century of our friendship , J. D. Salinger told me he had an idea that someday , when “ all the fiction had run out , ” he might try to do something straight , “ really factual , formally distinguishing myself from the Glass boys and Holden Caulfield and the other first - person narrators I ’ve used . ”
It might be readable , maybe funny , he said , and “ not just smell like a regular autobiography . ”
The main thing was that he would use straight facts and “ thereby put off or stymie one or two vultures — freelancers or English - department scavengers — who might come around and bother the children and the family before the body is even cold . ”
A single straight fact is that Salinger was one of a kind .
His writing was his and his alone , and his way of life was only what he chose to follow .
He never gave an inch to anything that came to him with what he called a “ smell . ”
The older and crankier he got , the more convinced he was that in the end all writers get pretty much what ’s coming to them : the destructive praise and flattery , the killing attention and appreciation .
The trouble with all of us , he believed , is that when we were young we never knew anybody who could or would tell us any of the penalties of making it in the world on the usual terms : “ I do n’t mean just the pretty obvious penalties , I mean the ones that are just about unnoticeable and that do really lasting damage , the kind the world does n’t even think of as damage . ”
He talked about how easily writers could become vain , complaining that they got puffed up by the same “ authorities ” who approved putting monosodium glutamate in baby food .
When he had young children , and was living in Cornish , New Hampshire , he did the usual things .
But he was always watching .
Once , he showed me a program for the Cornish Fair .
It ’s innocent enough , and that ’s something , he said , but even the fair was guilty of its own style of hustling .
He took his children to ride on the flying swings .
“ I stand around and talk about schools with the other crummy parents , the summer parents , ” he wrote in a letter to me .
Getting back to work , he said , was “ the only way I ’ve ever been able to take the awful conventional world .
I think I despise every school and college in the world , but the ones with the best reputation first . ”
He loved children with no holds barred , but never with the sentimental fakery of admiring their “ purity . ”
After watching his son , Matthew , playing one day , he said , “ If your child likes — loves — you , the very love he bears you tears your heart out about once a day or once every other day . ”
He said , “ I started writing and making up characters in the first place because nothing or not much away from the typewriter was reaching my heart at all . ”
When I adopted my son , Erik , Jerry was almost as exuberant as I was .
Unbelievable , stupendous , he said of one picture I sent : “ He ’s roaring with laughter .
Oh , if he can only hold on to it . ”
When he read a story of mine about kids skipping around a Maypole in Central Park , he wrote to me , “ The first and last thing you ’ve done is to redeem everything , not just make everything bearable . ”
He liked the way the bystanders were described , noting that they ’d been given “ their true and everlasting unimportance . ”
Salinger was generous with writers he admired , but he was unsparing about those who had what he called “ disguises . ”
He was hard on Kenneth Tynan .
“ No matter how he stuffs his readers with verbiage , it never amounts to a core of truth , ” he said .
Tynan bent too much to current hip opinion , he thought .
“ A community of seriously hip observers is a scary and depressing thing , ” he said .
“ It takes me at least an hour to warm up when I sit down to work .
. . .
Just taking off my own disguises takes an hour or more . ”
He said he ’d never “ had the annoyance ” of meeting Truman Capote , who apparently sicced various “ crazy people ” on him , people who all closed their letters by saying that Truman sent his best regards .
Emerson was a touchstone , and Salinger often quoted him in letters .
For instance , “ A man must have aunts and cousins , must buy carrots and turnips , must have barn and woodshed , must go to market and to the blacksmith ’s shop , must saunter and sleep and be inferior and silly . ”
Writers , he thought , had trouble abiding by that , and he referred to Flaubert and Kafka as “ two other born non-buyers of carrots and turnips . ”
Over the years , Salinger told me about working “ long and crazy hours ” at his writing and trying to stay away from everything that was written about him .
He did n’t care about reviews , he said , but “ the side effects ” bothered him .
“ There are no writers anymore , ” he said once .
“ Only book - selling louts and big mouths . ”
He liked living in New Hampshire , but he often found fun and relief by coming down to New York to have supper with me and Bill Shawn , this magazine ’s editor for many years .
In a note he sent after the three of us got together for the last time , he wrote , “ It will set me up for months .
I was at peace . ”
Another time he described the fun he ’d had on a trip to London with his children , where he took them to see Engelbert Humperdinck in a stage version of “ Robinson Crusoe ” : “ Awful , but we all sort of enjoyed it , and the main idea was to see the Palladium itself , because that ’s where the last scene of ‘ The 39 Steps ’ was set . ”
Salinger loved movies , and he was more fun than anyone to discuss them with .
He enjoyed watching actors work , and he enjoyed knowing them .
( He loved Anne Bancroft , hated Audrey Hepburn , and said that he had seen “ Grand Illusion ” ten times . )
Brigitte Bardot once wanted to buy the rights to “ A Perfect Day for Bananafish , ” and he said that it was uplifting news .
“ I mean it , ” he told me .
“ She ’s a cute , talented , lost enfante , and I ’m tempted to accommodate her , pour le sport . ”
He was original even in the way he found his pleasures .
He told me that one day he went out and bought an iron , and had his housekeeper iron his shirts .
“ How it cheered me up , ” he said .
After he bought a Maytag washer and dryer , he was tickled that the salesman quoted Ruskin to him — something about where quality counts , price does n’t .
He was sure that the line was n’t part of the man ’s spiel .
“ God , how I still love private readers , ” he wrote .
“ It ’s what we all used to be . ” ♦
Manchester United 's chief executive , David Gill , was involved in a stand - up row with two fans and left in no doubt about his growing unpopularity with the club 's supporters in the latest demonstration of antipathy towards the Glazer family 's ownership of the Premier League champions .
Gill was confronted after a question - and - answer session about football finances at Birmingham University and , to his intense discomfort , asked to justify the way he had opposed the Glazers ' takeover as " overly aggressive " and " unmanageable " only to change his mind and start to criticise the fans ' protests once the Americans had seized control of the club .
In an argument that was recorded by other members of the audience and has been passed to the Guardian , Gill was asked if he remembered his comment in 2004 that " debt is the road to ruin " .
The last official figure showed that the Glazers have accrued debts of £ 716 m and have paid more than £ 260 m in interest payments since the owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers moved into English football in 2005 .
Asked to explain his volte face , Gill responded by saying it " depends on the context " but did not elaborate .
It was put to him that he had changed his mind " overnight " and he replied tersely : " How could you tell when I changed my mind ? "
United 's supporters have made a point of exposing Gill for his U - turn and unveiled a banner during the 1 - 1 draw at Aston Villa on Wednesday to remind him of his pre-takeover quote .
Gill confirmed he had seen it and explained : " Those were comments back in autumn [ 2004 ] ... and then they changed , the model changed ...
If you read all the statements . "
Pressed further , Gill said he had not resigned because " I 've got 550 employees who work for me " , and responded to more questions about the club 's financial position by pointing out the success of Sir Alex Ferguson 's team .
" How many leagues have we won in the last three years ? " he replied .
Of the Glazers , he asked : " Why are they leeches ? "
The argument was eventually ended when security staff intervened .
Gill earned £ 1.83 m in the year to June 2009 , according to figures released last month , a 60 % rise since 2006 .
( CNET ) -- AT&T said Thursday that it will invest an additional $ 2 billion in its network in 2010 to make sure it keeps up with the growing demand from new smartphones and other 3G data devices , such as the Apple iPad , on its network .
During its fourth quarter 2009 conference call , Chief Operating Officer John Stankey said AT&T plans to spend between $ 18 billion and $ 19 billion in 2010 upgrading its wireless and backhaul networks to handle the onslaught of new traffic .
This is roughly $ 2 billion more than the company had invested in the previous year .
Specifically , Stankey said AT&T will add 2,000 new cell sites and upgrade existing cell sites with three times more fiber links than it had in 2009 .
This will increase capacity for the backhaul network that connects the cell towers to AT&T 's main network .
The backhaul portion of the network is a critical component to AT&T 's network ; with these upgrades in place , Stankey said the company will be able to easily upgrade in the future to 4G wireless technology .
AT&T will begin testing its 4G network using LTE , the same technology Verizon Wireless is using for its 4G network , starting in 2010 , with a few commercial deployments ready in 2011 and more commercial deployments in 2012 .
AT&T , which is the only wireless operator in the U.S. selling the iPhone , has been the target of much criticism over this past year , as many iPhone subscribers , particularly in densely populated urban areas , have complained about dropped calls , slow Internet access , and poor all around service .
Some critics claim the company has not been spending enough on network upgrades to keep up with growing demand .
Stankey acknowledged that AT&T has faced some difficulties , particularly in cities like New York and San Francisco .
But he said the company is " closing the gap . "
He said there are periods of time during the week in some sections of Manhattan where nearly 70 percent of the phones active on its network are data - intensive devices .
He said to deal with this surge in usage , AT&T is increasing 3G radio capacity in those trouble areas by more than one third .
The company will also add additional radio network controllers on existing cell sites .
As for San Francisco , Stankey blamed the poor network performance on zoning issues that have prevented the company from getting new cell phone towers up .
But he said the company was been working to resolve these issues .
And AT&T expects to add new cell towers in the Bay Area in 2010 .
And it 's boosting capacity at convention centers , sports stadiums and along public transportation routes .
But keeping up with demand on AT&T 's network is a bit like shooting a moving target .
Usage on the network keeps increasing as AT&T adds new devices and subscribers .
In the fourth quarter , AT&T added 2.7 million new mobile subscribers .
Overall usage on AT&T 's network grew 200 percent in 2009 alone .
And the company is now servicing more than twice the number of smartphones as its competitors ; again , it is the exclusive carrier in the U.S. for the iPhone , one of the most data intensive devices on the market .
And in the fourth quarter , AT&T activated an additional 3.1 million iPhones .
The company is also adding even more smartphones to its lineup as well as other data intensive devices , that will eat up bandwidth .
In January at the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas , AT&T said it would soon offer two Palm smartphones and several Google Android handsets this year .
On Wednesday , Apple announced that AT&T will be the exclusive carrier to provide 3G wireless service to the new iPad tablet .
Many Apple fans and industry watchers groaned at this news , suggesting that if AT&T can't handle the iPhone it wo n't be able to the iPad .
But Stankey said AT&T has already made significant progress in upgrading its network in the fourth quarter and will continue to make upgrades in 2010 to keep up with demand .
He also said that much of the usage on the iPad will be offloaded to Wi -Fi hotspots , which will not affect AT&T's 3G network .

The government of Haiti is indefinitely postponing the legislative elections scheduled for February 28 because the infrastructure of the country has been so thoroughly wrecked by the January 12 earthquake that it is impossible to carry out the mechanics of the poll .
As occasional survivors are still being found , the recognized death toll approaches the predicted 200,000 , One out of every 45 Haitians has died in the disaster .
Yet Haiti is forced to think about how reconstruction is to be approached .
Now another disaster approaches : Economists .
Much lauded in “ development assistance ” circles and in the New York Times is a new report to the U.N. Secretary General by Paul Collier , identified as a faculty member of the Department of Economics , Oxford University ( Haiti : From National Catastrophe to Economic Security )
If Collier has any knowledge of Haitian history , it is not evident .
I am no expert , but even I know that Haiti ’s troubles have to do with the way the island has been used , over the last 300 years , as a source of profits for various outside interests .
Yet most of the Collier report ’s recommendations are based on continuing the exact same policies which have kept most Haitians poor and foreign investors rich .
Collier ’s major recommendation is to turn Haiti into a center for garment manufacture by transnational corporations .
The main qualification that Haiti has for this role is plentiful “ cheap labor ” as Collier bluntly puts it .
Collier recommends that a number of free trade “ export zones ” be set up in Haiti .
Takeover of land for these zones would be expedited by changes in Haitian law .
Power generation would be expanded on a privatized basis to make sure the factories have a source of cheap energy .
Haitian customs for these zones would also be privatized to prevent bottlenecks and other problems caused by “ corruption ” .
The manufacturing and exporting countries would be “ linked ” to somebody high in the government .
These export zones would be “ free trade ” operations .
If they operate similarly to other such operations in the area , it means that workers would be paid a pittance and Haiti as a nation would get precious little out of them .
Collier would also like to see Haiti move more in the direction of producing cash crops for export ( he suggests mangos ) rather than subsistence agriculture .
He thinks that this will help the Haitian food crisis and stop deforestation , which he attributes to overpopulation and too much people - intensive agriculture .
He also suggests that to get the agricultural work done and feed the people , a system might be created for “ food for work , ” which means “ work for food ” instead of “ for money . ”
( Also known as sharecropping . )
Collier thinks that this kind of approach might reverse the serious deforestation from which Haiti suffers .
To prevent food riots like those which occurred in 2008 when the prices of imported food items suddenly skyrocketed , mostly due to world market trends , Collier recommends that the Haitian government buy “ food price insurance ” from some private foreign company ( enter the Geico caveman ) .
Since few people in Haiti are rich enough to provide the capital for all of this privatized development , it is assumed capital from transnational corporations will be both the source and the beneficiary of the bonanza of exported profits .
Colliers ’ recommendations come from the “ Washington Consensus ” tool kit of neo-liberal policies :
Free trade , offshore sweatshops , privatization , austerity and the suppression of protest .
Although Collier presents these things as bright new ideas , Haiti for a long time has been part of this system :
For example , a large proportion of the world ’s baseballs are sewn in Haitian sweatshops .
The extreme poverty of the Haitian workers may indeed attract manufacturing investment ; the trouble is for this to continue to “ benefit ” Haiti , labor would have to stay cheap .
The experience of the “ maquiladora ” industry in Mexico is instructive : Indeed foreign companies came to Mexico to take advantage of the cheap labor , but the minute they found cheaper labor elsewhere , they closed up shop , leaving Mexican workers with virtually nothing to show for their sweatshop experience .
A successful “ cheap labor ” strategy also requires that any effort on the part of workers to improve their wages and working conditions has to be repressed .
This is why Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. has called this kind of policy “ the race to the bottom of the barrel . ”
Haiti used to have a profitable rice industry , which both fed the people and provided an export crop .
Starting in the mid 1980s , Haiti , under pressure to lower import tariffs , began to import more rice , mostly from the United States .
By the early to mid 1990s , huge rice imports , subsidized by U.S. taxpayers , had so undercut the Haitian rice farmers that thousands of them were driven from the land and into the capital of Port au Prince in search of jobs .
According to the Inter Press Service , citing 2008 figures , “ of the 420,000 tonnes of rice Haitians consume yearly , 340,000 tonnes are imported .
Of the 31 million eggs the Haitian population eats monthly , 30 million are imported from the Dominican Republic .
About 80 percent of farmers earn less than 135 dollars a year . ”
As for the deforestation , a problem which Haiti shares with many other poor countries , it is in part the result of people needing more land to farm , and in part of people cutting firewood because they are too poor to buy kerosene or other fuels .
Colliers ’ idea of growing mangos for export instead of food crops for home consumption is not going to solve the problem .
What other choice does the Haitian government actually have right now ?
Before the earthquake , President Rene Preval had been coming increasingly close to the ALBA ( Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America ) group of Latin American and Caribbean states .
ALBA , which includes Antigua and Barbuda , Bolivia , Cuba , Dominica , Ecuador , Nicaragua and St. Vincent and the Grenadines , is a trade , aid and political bloc whose purpose is to diminish the dominant control of the United States over the region by stimulating horizontal economic integration among its members and neighboring states .
Preval had already hooked Haiti into PETROCARIBE , an ALBA instrument which provides petroleum on good credit terms .
Further integration with ALBA would provide Haiti with trade , credit and aid opportunities more generous than what the United States and other wealthy countries are willing to offer .
Integration of Bolivia , the Western Hemisphere ’s second poorest country after Haiti , into ALBA is already producing very positive results .
However , two things that have happened that may impede further Haitian connections with the ALBA nations .
First is the coup d’etat in Honduras , which has sent the message that poor countries that try to escape from U.S. hegemony via ALBA face reprisals .
( Mauricio Funes , president of El Salvador , has angered his left - wing supporters by announcing that he is not going to bring his country into ALBA for fear of jeopardizing relations with the United States . )
Second is the earthquake , which makes it hard for Haiti to turn away any helping hand , no matter what ulterior motives may lurk .
Haiti is in no position to antagonize the United States , France , Canada and other wealthy nations , and likely will feel constrained to remain within the “ Washington consensus ” for the rebuilding period .
Progressives in the United States need to be conscious of these things and prepared to push for some policies that really will help the Haitian people without tying them down to the failed exploitative policies of the past .
These include :
• Legalization of undocumented Haitian immigrants in the United States .
Haiti depends on remittances sent by its citizens abroad for much of its foreign exchange money .
If the 200,000 or more Haitian immigrants estimated to be living without papers in the United States were given legal status , which they would be under the Ortiz - Gutierrez Bill , HR 4321 , these remittances could be increased because legal workers are able to earn more .
If , on the other hand , these immigrants are deported , it would be like another severe aftershock .
The Obama administration has extended Temporary Protected Status to Haitian undocumented immigrants , but it may only last 18 months .
• Fair trade for Haiti : Cut or stop the subsidization of U.S. based agribusiness transnationals such as Riceland Foods Inc. of Stuttgart , Arkansas , and other companies which engage in the dumping which has helped to undermine Haitian agriculture .
These subsidies benefit mostly corporate agribusiness , not American small farmers , and are the source major complaints by farmers in many poorer countries .
• Cancel all Haiti ’s foreign debts .
Venezuela , which has its own economic problems and can ill afford to do so , has canceled Haiti ’s debt for oil and natural gas .
President Chavez says that this is in recognition of Haiti ’s key role in the liberation of all of South America at the beginning of the 1800s .
We should join the Jubilee movement in fighting for all Haiti ’s foreign debts to be canceled ( See www.lawg.org for more details . )
• Aid should be in the form of grants not loans , so that the debt problem does not recur .
Haiti owes the United States absolutely nothing in exchange for current aid .
On the contrary , since Haiti gained independence in 1804 , the United States has collaborated with France and other wealthy countries to keep Haiti poor and indebted .
We should continue to send material aid and volunteers to help the earthquake victims , but also take care of the political side by fighting for justice for Haiti .

What you need to know in the Valley
Millennials : Confident .
Connected .
Open to Change
Executive Summary
Generations , like people , have personalities , and Millennials — the American teens and twenty - somethings who are making the passage into adulthood at the start of a new millennium — have begun to forge theirs : confident , self - expressive , liberal , upbeat and open to change .
They are more ethnically and racially diverse than older adults .
They ’re less religious , less likely to have served in the military , and are on track to become the most educated generation in American history .
Their entry into careers and first jobs has been badly set back by the Great Recession , but they are more upbeat than their elders about their own economic futures as well as about the overall state of the nation .
( See chapter 4 in the full report )
They embrace multiple modes of self - expression .
Three - quarters have created a profile on a social networking site .
One - in - five have posted a video of themselves online .
Nearly four - in - ten have a tattoo ( and for most who do , one is not enough : about half of those with tattoos have two to five and 18 % have six or more ) .
Nearly one - in - four have a piercing in some place other than an earlobe — about six times the share of older adults who ’ve done this .
But their look - at - me tendencies are not without limits .
Most Millennials have placed privacy boundaries on their social media profiles .
And 70 % say their tattoos are hidden beneath clothing .
( See chapters 4 and 7 in the full report )
Despite struggling ( and often failing ) to find jobs in the teeth of a recession , about nine - in - ten either say that they currently have enough money or that they will eventually meet their long - term financial goals .
But at the moment , fully 37 % of 18 - to 29 - year - olds are unemployed or out of the workforce , the highest share among this age group in more than three decades .
Research shows that young people who graduate from college in a bad economy typically suffer long - term consequences — with effects on their careers and earnings that linger as long as 15 years .
( See chapter 5 in the full report )
Whether as a by - product of protective parents , the age of terrorism or a media culture that focuses on dangers , they cast a wary eye on human nature .
Two - thirds say “ you ca n’t be too careful ” when dealing with people .
Yet they are less skeptical than their elders of government .
More so than other generations , they believe government should do more to solve problems .
( See chapter 8 in the full report ) .
They are the least overtly religious American generation in modern times .
One - in - four are unaffiliated with any religion , far more than the share of older adults when they were ages 18 to 29 .
Yet not belonging does not necessarily mean not believing .
Millennials pray about as often as their elders did in their own youth .
( See chapter 9 in the full report )
Only about six - in - ten were raised by both parents — a smaller share than was the case with older generations .
In weighing their own life priorities , Millennials ( like older adults ) place parenthood and marriage far above career and financial success .
But they are n’t rushing to the altar .
Just one - in - five Millennials ( 21 % ) are married now , half the share of their parents ’ generation at the same stage of life .
About a third ( 34 % ) are parents , according to the Pew Research survey .
We estimate that , in 2006 , more than a third of 18 to 29 year old women who gave birth were unmarried .
This is a far higher share than was the case in earlier generations .
( See chapters 2 and 3 in the full report )
Millennials are on course to become the most educated generation in American history , a trend driven largely by the demands of a modern knowledge - based economy , but most likely accelerated in recent years by the millions of 20 - somethings enrolling in graduate schools , colleges or community colleges in part because they can’t find a job .
Among 18 to 24 year olds a record share — 39.6 % — was enrolled in college as of 2008 , according to census data .
( See chapter 5 in the full report )
They get along well with their parents .
Looking back at their teenage years , Millennials report having had fewer spats with mom or dad than older adults say they had with their own parents when they were growing up .
And now , hard times have kept a significant share of adult Millennials and their parents under the same roof .
About one - in - eight older Millennials ( ages 22 and older ) say they ’ve “ boomeranged ” back to a parent ’s home because of the recession .
( See chapters 3 and 5 in the full report )
They respect their elders .
A majority say that the older generation is superior to the younger generation when it comes to moral values and work ethic .
Also , more than six - in - ten say that families have a responsibility to have an elderly parent come live with them if that parent wants to .
By contrast , fewer than four - in - ten adults ages 60 and older agree that this is a family responsibility .
Despite coming of age at a time when the United States has been waging two wars , relatively few Millennials - just 2 % of males - are military veterans .
At a comparable stage of their life cycle , 6 % of Gen Xer men , 13 % of Baby Boomer men and 24 % of Silent men were veterans .
( See chapter 2 in the full report )
Politically , Millennials were among Barack Obama ’s strongest supporters in 2008 , backing him for president by more than a two - to - one ratio ( 66 % to 32 % ) while older adults were giving just 50 % of their votes to the Democratic nominee .
This was the largest disparity between younger and older voters recorded in four decades of modern election day exit polling .
Moreover , after decades of low voter participation by the young , the turnout gap in 2008 between voters under and over the age of 30 was the smallest it had been since 18 - to 20 - year - olds were given the right to vote in 1972 .
( See chapter 8 in the full report )
But the political enthusiasms of Millennials have since cooled - for Obama and his message of change , for the Democratic Party and , quite possibly , for politics itself .
About half of Millennials say the president has failed to change the way Washington works , which had been the central promise of his candidacy .
Of those who say this , three - in - ten blame Obama himself , while more than half blame his political opponents and special interests .
To be sure , Millennials remain the most likely of any generation to self - identify as liberals ; they are less supportive than their elders of an assertive national security policy and more supportive of a progressive domestic social agenda .
They are still more likely than any other age group to identify as Democrats .
Yet by early 2010 , their support for Obama and the Democrats had reced
ed , as evidenced both by survey data and by their low level of participation in recent off - year and special elections .
( See chapter 8 in the full report )
Our Research Methods
This Pew Research Center report profiles the roughly 50 million Millennials who currently span the ages of 18 to 29 .
It ’s likely that when future analysts are in a position to take a fuller measure of this new generation , they will conclude that millions of additional younger teens ( and perhaps even pre-teens ) should be grouped together with their older brothers and sisters .
But for the purposes of this report , unless we indicate otherwise , we focus on Millennials who are at least 18 years old .
We examine their demographics ; their political and social values ; their lifestyles and life priorities ; their digital technology and social media habits ; and their economic and educational aspirations .
We also compare and contrast Millennials with the nation ’s three other living generations - Gen Xers ( ages 30 to 45 ) , Baby Boomers ( ages 46 to 64 ) and Silents ( ages 65 and older ) .
Whenever the trend data permit , we compare the four generations as they all are now - and also as older generations were at the ages that adult Millennials are now .
Most of the findings in this report are based on a new survey of a national cross-section of 2,020 adults ( including an oversample of Millennials ) , conducted by landline and cellular telephone from Jan. 14 to 27 , 2010 ; this survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.0 percentage points for the full sample and larger percentages for various subgroups ( for more details , see page 110 in the full report ) .
The report also draws on more than two decades of Pew Research Center surveys , supplemented by our analysis of Census Bureau data and other relevant studies .
What ’s in a Name ?
Generational names are the handiwork of popular culture .
Some are drawn from a historic event ; others from rapid social or demographic change ; others from a big turn in the calendar .
The Millennial generation falls into the third category .
The label refers those born after 1980 – the first generation to come of age in the new millennium .
Generation X covers people born from 1965 through 1980 .
The label long ago overtook the first name affixed to this generation : the Baby Bust .
Xers are often depicted as savvy , entrepreneurial loners .
The Baby Boomer label is drawn from the great spike in fertility that began in 1946 , right after the end of World War II , and ended almost as abruptly in 1964 , around the time the birth control pill went on the market .
It ’s a classic example of a demography - driven name .
The Silent generation describes adults born from 1928 through 1945 .
Children of the Great Depression and World War II , their “ Silent ” label refers to their conformist and civic instincts .
It also makes for a nice contrast with the noisy ways of the anti-establishment Boomers .
The Greatest Generation ( those born before 1928 ) “ saved the world ” when it was young , in the memorable phrase of Ronald Reagan .
It ’s the generation that fought and won World War II .
Generational names are works in progress .
The zeitgeist changes , and labels that once seemed spot - on fall out of fashion .
It ’s not clear if the Millennial tag will endure , although a calendar change that comes along only once in a thousand years seems like a pretty secure anchor .
Some Caveats
A few notes of caution are in order .
Generational analysis has a long and distinguished place in social science , and we cast our lot with those scholars who believe it is not only possible , but often highly illuminating , to search for the unique and distinctive characteristics of any given age group of Americans .
But we also know this is not an exact science .
We acknowledge , for example , that there is an element of false precision in setting hard chronological boundaries between the generations .
Can we say with certainty that a typical 30 - year - old adult is a Gen Xer while a typical 29 - year - old adult is a Millennial ?
Of course not .
Nevertheless , we must draw lines in order to carry out the statistical analyses that form the core of our research methodology .
And our boundaries - while admittedly too crisp - are not arbitrary .
They are based on our own research findings and those of other scholars .
We are mindful that there are as many differences in attitudes , values , behaviors and lifestyles within a generation as there are between generations .
But we believe this reality does not diminish the value of generational analysis ; it merely adds to its richness and complexity .
Throughout this report , we will not only explore how Millennials differ from other generations , we will also look at how they differ among themselves .
The Millennial Identity
Most Millennials ( 61 % ) in our January , 2010 survey say their generation has a unique and distinctive identity .
That does n’t make them unusual , however .
Roughly two - thirds of Silents , nearly six - in - ten Boomers and about half of Xers feel the same way about their generation .
But Millennials have a distinctive reason for feeling distinctive .
In response to an open - ended follow - up question , 24 % say it ’s because of their use of technology .
Gen Xers also cite technology as their generation ’s biggest source of distinctiveness , but far fewer - just 12 % - say this .
Boomers ’ feelings of distinctiveness coalesce mainly around work ethic , which 17 % cite as their most prominent identity badge .
For Silents , it ’s the shared experience of the Depression and World War II , which 14 % cite as the biggest reason their generation stands apart .
( See chapter 3 in the full report )
Millennials ’ technological exceptionalism is chronicled throughout the survey .
It ’s not just their gadgets — it ’s the way they ’ve fused their social lives into them .
For example , three - quarters of Millennials have created a profile on a social networking site , compared with half of Xers , 30 % of Boomers and 6 % of Silents .
There are big generation gaps , as well , in using wireless technology , playing video games and posting self - created videos online .
Millennials are also more likely than older adults to say technology makes life easier and brings family and friends closer together ( though the generation gaps on these questions are relatively narrow ) .
( See chapter 4 in the full report )
Work Ethic , Moral Values , Race Relations
Of the four generations , Millennials are the only one that does n’t cite “ work ethic ” as one of their principal claims to distinctiveness .
A nationwide Pew Research Center survey taken in 2009 may help explain why .
This one focused on differences between young and old rather than between specific age groups .
Nonetheless , its findings are instructive .
Nearly six - in - ten respondents cited work ethic as one of the big sources of differences between young and old .
Asked who has the better work ethic , about three - fourths of respondents said that older people do .
By similar margins , survey respondents also found older adults have the upper hand when it comes to moral values and their respect for others .
It might be tempting to dismiss these findings as a typical older adult gripe about “ kids today . ”
But when it comes to each of these traits — work ethic , moral values , respect for others — young adults agree that older adults have the better of it .
In short , Millennials may be a self - confident generation , but they display little appetite for claims of moral superiority .
That 2009 survey also found that the public — young and old alike — thinks the younger generation is more racially tolerant than their elders .
More than two decades of Pew Research surveys confirm that assessment .
In their views about interracial dating , for example , Millennials are the most open to change of any generation , followed closely by Gen Xers , then Boomers , then Silents .
Likewise , Millennials are more receptive to immigrants than are their elders .
Nearly six - in - ten ( 58 % ) say immigrants strengthen the country , according to a 2009 Pew Research survey ; just 43 % of adults ages 30 and older agree .
The same pattern holds on a range of attitudes about nontraditional family arrangements , from mothers of young children working outside the home , to adults living together without being married , to more people of different races marrying each other .
Millennials are more accepting than older generations of these more modern family arrangements , followed closely by Gen Xers .
To be sure , acceptance does not in all cases translate into outright approval .
But it does mean Millennials disapprove less .

A Gentler Generation Gap
A 1969 Gallup survey , taken near the height of the social and
political upheavals of that turbulent decade , found that 74 % of the public believed there was a “ generation gap ” in American society .
Surprisingly , when that same question was asked in a Pew Research Center survey last year — in an era marked by hard economic times but little if any overt age - based social tension — the share of the public saying there was a generation gap had risen slightly to 79 % .
But as the 2009 results also make clear , this modern generation gap is a much more benign affair than the one that cast a shadow over the 1960s .
The public says this one is mostly about the different ways that old and young use technology — and relatively few people see that gap as a source of conflict .
Indeed , only about a quarter of the respondents in the 2009 survey said they see big conflicts between young and old in America .
Many more see conflicts between immigrants and the native born , between rich and poor , and between black and whites .
There is one generation gap that has widened notably in recent years .
It has to do with satisfaction over the state of the nation .
In recent decades the young have always tended to be a bit more upbeat than their elders on this key measure , but the gap is wider now than it has been in at least twenty years .
Some 41 % of Millennials say they are satisfied with the way things are going in the country , compared with just 26 % of those ages 30 and older .
Whatever toll a recession , a housing crisis , a financial meltdown and a pair of wars may have taken on the national psyche in the past few years , it appears to have hit the old harder than the young .
( See chapter 3 in the full report )
But this speaks to a difference in outlook and attitude ; it ’s not a source of conflict or tension .
As they make their way into adulthood , Millennials have already distinguished themselves as a generation that gets along well with others , especially their elders .
For a nation whose population is rapidly going gray , that could prove to be a most welcome character trait .

Citizens United v. Federal Election commission — the recent case in which the Supreme Court invalidated a statute prohibiting corporations and unions from using general treasury funds either to support or defeat a candidate in the 30 days before an election , and overruled an earlier decision relied on by the minority — has now been commented on by almost everyone , including the president of the United States in his state of the union address .
I would like to step back from the debate about whether the decision enhances our First Amendment freedoms or hands the country over to big - money interests , and read it instead as the latest installment in an ongoing conflict between two ways of thinking about the First Amendment and its purposes .
We can approach the conflict by noting a semantic difference between the majority and concurring opinions on the one hand and the dissenting opinion — a 90 - page outpouring of passion and anger by Justice Stevens — on the other .
The word most important to Justice Kennedy ’s argument ( he writes for the majority ) is “ chill , ” while the word most important to Stevens ’s argument is “ corrupt . ”
Kennedy , along with Justices Roberts , Alito , Thomas and Scalia ( the usual suspects ) , is worried that the restrictions on campaign expenditures imposed by the statute he strikes down will “ chill ” speech , that is , prevent some of it from entering the marketplace of ideas that must , he believes , be open to all voices if the First Amendment ’s stricture against the abridging of speech is to be honored .
( “ [ A ] statute which chills speech can and must be invalidated . ” )
Stevens is worried — no , he is certain — that the form of speech Kennedy celebrates will corrupt the free flow of information so crucial to the health of a democratic society .
“ [ T ] he distinctive potential of corporations to corrupt the electoral process [ has ] long been recognized . ”
When Stevens writes “ has long been recognized , ” he is invoking the force of history and asking us to take note of the reasons why many past court decisions ( including one written by then - Chief Justice Rehnquist ) have acknowledged the dangers posed by corporations , dangers that provoked this declaration by Theodore Roosevelt in 1905 : “ All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law . ”
Behind such strong statements is a twin fear : ( 1 ) the fear that big money will not only talk ( the metaphor that converts campaign expenditures into speech and therefore into a matter that merits First Amendment scrutiny ) , but will buy votes and influence , and ( 2 ) the fear that corporations and unions , with their huge treasuries , will crowd out smaller voices by purchasing all the air time and print space .
The majority , Stevens admits , does “ acknowledge the validity of the interest in preventing corruption , ” but , he complains , it is not an interest it is interested in , for “ it effectively discounts the value of that interest to zero . ”
That ’s not quite right .
Kennedy and the others in the majority make the proper noises about corruption ; they just do n’t think that it is likely to occur and they spend much time explaining why corporations are citizens like anyone else ( a proposition Stevens ridicules ) and why , for various economic and public - relation reasons , they pose no threat to the integrity of the electoral process .
But even if they thought otherwise , even if they were persuaded by the dire predictions Stevens and those he cites make , they would come down where they do ; not because they welcome corruption or have no interest in forestalling it , or discount the value of being concerned with it , but because they find another interest of more value , indeed of surpassing value .
That is the value of being faithful to what they take to be the categorical imperative of the First Amendment , which , with respect to political speech , forbids the suppression of voices , especially voices “ the Government deems to be suspect ” ( Kennedy ) ; for if this voice now , why not other voices later ?
Even if there were substance to the charge of “ undue influence ” exercised by those with deep pockets , it would still be outweighed , says Kennedy , citing an earlier case , “ by the loss for democratic process resulting from the restrictions upon free and full discussion . ”
The question of where that discussion might take the country is of less interest than the overriding interest in assuring that it is full and free , that is , open to all and with no exclusions based on a calculation of either the motives or the likely actions of individual or corporate speakers .
In this area , the majority insists , the state cannot act paternally .
Voters are adults who must be “ free to obtain information from diverse sources ” ; they are not to be schooled by a government that would protect them from sources it distrusts .
Notice how general Kennedy ’s rhetoric has become .
The specificity of Stevens ’s concerns , rooted in the historical record and in the psychology and sociology of political actors , disappears in the overarching umbrella category of “ information . ”
The syllogism is straightforward .
Freedom of information is what the First Amendment protects ; corporation and unions are sources of information ; therefore their contributions — now imagined as wholly verbal not monetary ; the conversion is complete — must be protected , come what may .
That , Kennedy is saying , is the Court ’s job , to allow the process to go forward unimpeded .
It is not the Court ’s job to fiddle with the process in an effort to make it fairer or more representative , a point Chief Justice Roberts makes in his concurring opinion when he cites approvingly the Court ’s “ repudiation , ” in Buckley v. Valeo ( 1976 ) , “ of any government interest in ‘equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcomes of elections . ’”
Equality may be a good thing ; it might be nice if no one had a disproportionate share of influence ; but it ’s not our job to engineer it .
Let the market sort it out .
The majority ’s reasoning reaches back to a famous pronouncement by Oliver Wendell Holmes , who acknowledges in Gitlow v. New York ( 1925 ) that there are forms of discourse , which , if permitted to flourish , might very well bring disastrous results .
Nevertheless , he says , “ If in the long run the beliefs expressed . . . are destined to be accepted by the dominant forces of the community , the only meaning of free speech is that they should be given their chance and have their way . ”
Holmes ’s fatalism — let everyone speak and if the consequences are bad , so be it — stands in contrast to the epistemological optimism of Justice Brandeis who believes that if the marketplace is allowed to be completely open bad speech will be exposed and supplanted by good speech ( a reverse Gresham ’s law ) :
“ The remedy to be supplied is more speech , not enforced silence ” ( Whitney v. California , 1927 ) .
Both justices reject state manipulation of the speech market , one because he is willing to take what comes — it is Holmes who said that if his fellow countrymen wanted to go to hell in a hand - basket , it was his job to help them — the other because he believes that what will come if speech is unfettered will be good .
The justices in the Citizens United majority are more in the Brandeis camp .
They believe that free trade in ideas with as many trading partners as wish to join in will inevitability produce benign results for a democratic society .
And since their confidence in these results is a matter of theoretical faith and not of empirical or historical observation — free speech is for them a religion with long - term rewards awaiting us down the road — they feel no obligation to concern themselves with short - term calculations and predictions .
Stevens also values robust intellectual commerce , but he believes that allowing corporate voices to have their full and unregulated say “ can distort the ‘ free trade in ideas ’ crucial to candidate elections . ”
In his view free trade does n’t take care of itself , but must be engineered by the kind of restrictions the majority strikes down .
The marketplace of ideas can become congealed and frozen ; the free flow can be impeded , and when that happens the only way to preserve free speech values is to curtail or restrict some forms of speech , just as you might remove noxious weeds so that your garden can begin to grow again .
Prohibitions on speech , Stevens says , can operate “ to facilitate First Amendment values , ” and he openly scorns the majority ’s insistence that enlightened self - government “ can arise only in the absence of regulation . ”
The idea that you may have to regulate speech in order to preserve its First Amendment value is called consequentialism .
For a consequentialist like Stevens , freedom of speech is not a stand - alone value to be cherished for its own sake , but a policy that is adhered to because of the benign consequences it is thought to produce , consequences that are catalogued in the usual answers to the question , what is the First Amendment for ?
Answers like the First Amendment facilitates the search for truth , or the First Amendment is essential to the free flow of ideas in a democratic polity , or the First Amendment encourages dissent , or the First Amendment provides the materials necessary for informed choice and individual self - realization .
If you think of the First Amendment as a mechanism for achieving goals like these , you have to contemplate the possibility that some forms of speech will be subversive of those goals because , for instance , they impede the search for truth or block the free flow of ideas or crowd out dissent .
And if such forms of speech appear along with their attendant dangers , you will be obligated — not in violation of the First Amendment , but in fidelity to it — to move against them , as Stevens advises us to do in his opinion .
The opposite view of the First Amendment — the view that leads you to be wary of chilling any speech even if it harbors a potential for corruption — is the principled or libertarian or deontological view .
Rather than asking what is the First Amendment for and worrying about the negative effects a form of speech may have on the achievement of its goals , the principled view asks what does the First Amendment say and answers , simply , it says no state abridgement of speech .
Not no abridgment of speech unless we dislike it or fear it or think of it as having low or no value , but no abridgment of speech , period , especially if the speech in question is implicated in the political process .
The cleanest formulation of this position I know is given by the distinguished First Amendment scholar William Van Alstyne : “ The First Amendment does not link the protection it provides with any particular objective and may , accordingly , be deemed to operate without regard to anyone ’s view of how well the speech it protects may or may not serve such an objective . ”
In other words , forget about what speech does or does not do in the world ; just take care not to restrict it .
This makes things relatively easy .
All you have to do is determine that it ’s speech and then protect it , as Kennedy does when he observes that “ Section 441 b ’s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is . . . a ban on speech . ”
That ’s it .
Nothing more need be said , although Kennedy says a lot more , largely in order to explain why nothing more need be said and why everything Stevens says — about corruption , distortion , electoral integrity and undue influence — is beside the doctrinal point .
The majority ’s purity of principle is somewhat alloyed when it upholds the disclosure requirements of the statute it is considering on the reasoning that the public has a right to be informed about the identity of those who fund a corporation ’s ads and videos .
“ This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions . ”
Justice Thomas disagrees .
The interest “ in providing voters with additional relevant information ” does not , he says , outweigh “ ’ the right to anonymous speech . ’”
The majority ’s claim that disclosure requirements do not prevent anyone from speaking is , Thomas declares , false ; those who know that their names will be on a list may refrain from contributing for fear of reprisals and thus be engaged in an act of self - censoring .
The effect of disclosure requirements , he admonishes , is “ to curtail campaign - related activity and prevent the lawful , peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights . ”
Only Thomas has the courage of the majority ’s declared convictions .
Often the most principled of the judges ( which does n’t mean that I always like his principles ) , he is willing to follow a principle all the way , and so he rebukes his colleagues in the majority for preferring the value of more information to the value the First Amendment mandates — absolutely free speech unburdened by any restriction whatsoever including the restriction of having to sign your name .
Thomas has caught his fellow conservatives in a consequentialist moment .
The consequentialist and principled view of the First Amendment are irreconcilable .
Their adherents can only talk past one another and become increasingly angered and frustrated by what they hear from the other side .
This ongoing soap opera has been the content of First Amendment jurisprudence ever since it emerged full blown in the second decade of the 20th century .
Citizens United is a virtual anthology of the limited repertoire of moves the saga affords .
You could build an entire course around it .
And that is why even though I agree with much of what Stevens says ( I ’m a consequentialist myself ) and dislike the decision as a citizen , as a teacher of First Amendment law I absolutely love it .
Hats off to the Bank of England 's governor , Mervyn King , who found the time to go for a ride on a dog sled during the weekend 's summit of G7 finance ministers , which Canada hosted in the remote Arctic city of Iqaluit .
Above is a picture of Merv , who 's tucked up nice and warm and looks like he 's having a whale of a time .
He declared the experience " wonderful " .
Ministers at the summit agreed to forgive Haiti's debts , following the Caribbean country 's devastating earthquake .
And they pledged to continue working together on co-ordinated economic stimulus packages to fight the impact of the recession .
But as I reported earlier in the week , the summit's Arctic location meant that the ministers present , including Britain 's Alistair Darling , the US treasury minister Timothy Geithner and France 's Christine Lagarde , faced a tricky diplomatic challenge on issue of seal hunting , which would be somewhat peripheral to their portfolios in other circumstances .
The European Union has banned commercially hunted seal and , although hunting by indigenous communities was exempt from the prohibition , it 's a delicate topic .
None of the visiting ministers chose to attend a feast on Saturday night , laid on by the local Inuit community , at which raw seal was on the menu .
Canada 's Jim Flaherty was left to chow down on some seal meat alone .
And when a local reporter asked the European ministers about seal hunting at a closing press conference , there was a deafening silence .
Canada 's Globe and Mail reports that there was a five second silence as Darling and his colleagues avoided everybody 's eye .
" Do n't all go at once , " prompted the reporter .
A further five second silence ensued according to this transcript , before Flaherty came to the rescue of his visitors : " Listen , you know , the European Union makes a specific exception with respect to the Inuit people who for thousands of years have relied on the seal as part of their survival and that is the view of the European Union and its certainly our view in Canada . "
Incidentally , Darling was the only one at the press conference who appeared to be wearing a suit .
Everyone else kept warm in woolly jumpers , including a particularly attractive snowflake design sported by Flaherty , and a rather startling orange number worn by Japan 's finance minister .
There 's a video clip here .

The BIG feature .
The feature that made PostgreSQL leap from 8.4 to 9.0 .
Patch was written by Fujii Masao , and committed by Heikki Linnakangas on 15th of January 2010 :
Log Message : -----------
Introduce Streaming Replication .
This includes two new kinds of postmaster processes , walsenders and walreceiver .
Walreceiver is responsible for connecting to the primary server and streaming WAL to disk , while walsender runs in the primary server and streams WAL from disk to the client .
Documentation still needs work , but the basics are there .
We will probably pull the replication section to a new chapter later on , as well as the sections describing file - based replication .
But let 's do that as a separate patch , so that it 's easier to see what has been added / changed .
This patch also adds a new section to the chapter about FE / BE protocol , documenting the protocol used by walsender / walreceivxer .
Bump catalog version because of two new functions , pg_last_xlog_receive_location ( ) and pg_last_xlog_replay_location ( ) , for monitoring the progress of replication .
Fujii Masao , with additional hacking by me
What exactly does it mean ?
Well .
As you perhaps are aware , PostgreSQL offers replication using WAL segments – which , till 8.4 , could be used to have Warm Standby , but from 9.0 you will be able to make it actually Hot Standby .
Problem with this replication is pretty simple – replication is based on files , which get rotated ( and thus replication ) after 16 MB of data .
In some scenarios it's not a problem – if you 're generating constantly at least 16MB of writes per minute – your replication lag is basically always below one minute .
But what happens if you do n't have that many writes ?
Of course you can force WAL rotation , but this is not really good idea , and it's not suggested to force it below one minute anyway .
But now , thanks to Streaming Replication , lag should be nearly zero .
Of course it 's still asynchronous replication , but for most usecases – async is really good enough .
So , let 's see how to set it up .
On my test machine , I have PostgreSQL binaries in / home / pgdba / work , and main datadir in / home / pgdba / data ( listens on port 5850 )
Now .
let 's setup streaming replication and standby server , on the same machine in / home / pgdba / data2 , listening on 5851 .
First , I will need to stop main PostgreSQL :
/home/pgdba/work/bin/pg_ctl
-D /home/pgdba/data stop
Now let 's make some changes in config .
Before applying the changes , I copied postgresql.conf to postgresql.conf.before , so I can now show you simple diff :
=> diff -u postgresql.conf.before postgresql.conf --- postgresql.conf.before

As you can see it 's not really complicated .
Now , I can start master PostgreSQL :
/home/pgdba/work/bin/pg_ctl
-D /home / pgdba/data start
OK .
Now , I generated some traffic in database , to make it pre-generate some wal - segments .
Not much – let 's say 100 .
My test script generates around 7 wal segments per minute .
Now .
Having this , let 's setup slave server :
=> / home / pgdba / WORK / bin / psql - U postgres - p 5850 - c " SELECT pg_start_backup ( ' depesz ' ) " pg_start_backup
----------------- 0 / 74C645E8 ( 1 ROW ) => rsync - a / home / pgdba / DATA / / home / pgdba / data2 / => / home / pgdba / WORK / bin / psql - U postgres - p 5850 - c " SELECT pg_stop_backup ( ) " pg_stop_backup
---------------- 0 / 7A8FB9A8 ( 1 ROW )
Now , let 's clear data2 :
rm -f /home/pgdba/data2/postmaster.pid /home/pgdba/data2/pg_xlog/archive_status/*
/home/pgdba/data2/pg_xlog/0*
And change config .
Diff between data and data2 :

On slave I created recovery .conf :

It is critical that you can't use pg_standby or anything like this that will wait for next wal segment .
Also – as far as I understand – wal segments should be sent directly from master to slave using archive_command – i.e. copying them to some temp directory , and then rsyncing from cron , will probably not work .
Anyway .
After some time , slave system fetched all wal segments from archive directory , and switched to streaming .
It can be seen because now we have 2 new , interesting processes :

As you can see master is still doing archivization of wal segments – which should go on , but you should use some cronjob to remove no -longer - needed wal segments .
By no-longer - needed I mean – older than “ Latest checkpoint 's REDO location " from “ pg_controldata SLAVE_DATA_DIR / " .
Now .
let 's see how it really works .
I stopped my load generator – thank to this there will be basically no traffic on database – as soon as autovacuums will finish 🙂
Afterwards , I did simple test .
I have table :
# \d test Table " public.test " Column | Type | Modifiers
--------+--------------------------+-----------
x | timestamp with time zone | not null Indexes : " test_pkey " PRIMARY KEY , btree ( x )
First test :
= $ / home / pgdba / WORK / bin / psql - U depesz - p 5850 - c " insert into test ( x ) values ( now ( ) ) returning x " x
-------------------------------
2010 - 02 - 01 00 : 33 : 29.543639 + 01 ( 1 ROW ) INSERT 0 1 = $ / home / pgdba / WORK / bin / psql - U depesz - p 5851 - c " select * from test " x --- ( 0 ROWS )
Of course I do n't see it – streaming replication is fast , but not that fast 🙂
But adding even 1 second of delay worked perfectly :
= $ / home / pgdba / WORK / bin / psql - U depesz - p 5850 - c " insert into test ( x ) values ( now ( ) ) returning x " x
-------------------------------

( These command have been copy - pasted to terminal , so there was no typing - induced delay ) .
So , as we can see it works .
Is it ready ?
Definitely no .
For starters – docs are far from being usable .
If you 'd like to play with it yourself – you can check docs but you should check Wiki page .
Do I like it ?
YEAH !
Even with not ready docs , setup was not really long , and effect is well worth some sweat 🙂
Last Sunday morning , a day after notching his 900th win , Magee and Geri were drinking coffee at their home in Berwyn , reflecting on the night before spent celebrating with friends .
So much had changed between Win No. 1 and Win No. 900 .
The game is so much faster now with the shot clock and the three - point line , and the players , well , let 's just say Magee never had to tell those early teams " let 's play hard " or deal with guys who were unsatisfied with their number of " touches . "
Dear God ,
I understand that you 're busy and all , but I just thought you should know that this " plan " of yours pretty much blows !
I 've heard that you have some grand scheme in mind that us puny little humans do n't see and could never comprehend , but here 's the thing , I 'm on to your little bullshit .
I think you 're really an indecisive asshole who can't commit to a single thing , so you just keep changing your mind about what you want .
Hey , I get it , I 'm a perfectionist too , but your ADHD is really fucking shit up around here and a lot of us are getting tired of it !
Get some " YOU damn " meds and leave stuff alone already !
You just killed about 200,000 people because you wanted the Caribbean 0.8 inches east of where it is …er…was !
Oh and what 's more , smart guy , last time I checked , the most widely practiced religion in Haiti is Christianity .
Remember , that one is predominantly centered around you ( big surprise ) and your alleged son .
It is n't instructions !
Now I can kind of understand that you have major issues with having a kid AND STILL being a virgin , but you do n't need to be a jerk about it .
I 'm pretty sure THAT was n't the Happy New Year the Haitians were all looking forward to , and they probably thought Haiti was fine right where it used to be .
It 's like you 're up there with a giant laser level or something , measuring things and saying , " Nope , not right yet !
Just 20 millimeters to the east and it 'll be perfect ! "
In case you forgot , let me refresh your ancient ass memory about a similar snafu .
Remember five years ago when it was , " I think India and Indonesia should be six centimeters closer ! "
That little brain child of yours caused a tsunami that killed 230,000 people — and the day after your son's birthday , for crying out loud !
I think you have a serious problem and it 's time you own up to it .
Maybe your deal is that you get SO shitfaced on various holidays that you wake up in a party - induced coma and like any sloppy drunk , you start messing things up .
Remember Samoa last year , the day after Yom Kippur ?
" Jesus Christ , now THAT was a Yom Kippur !
Too bad , son , you could n't be there !
WAIT ?!
Is that where I put Samoa ?
Hiccup !
Let 's move those bad boys a few millimeters this way …oh whoops , sorry Samoa , my bad !
Hiccup ! "
Simply timeless , because all the watches got wet .
Look God , if you need help then there are some twelve - step programs I 'm sure you could complete rather quickly , but if you 're just being an indecisive drunk asshole , then knock it off .
Down here we 're all pretty cool with the positioning of the continents — what we are n't cool with is being treated like your personal little Sim Planet .
Oh and do n't think you 're fooling anyone with this plate tectonics horse shit either , because I think that 's just an excuse to move stuff around when you go on one of your benders .
Remember the dinosaurs and all the plate shifting you did with them , you fucking charlatan ?
Yeah , you wrote them out of " the book " but we still found them anyway .
Nice job on THAT cover - up , asshole !
Now let 's talk about cancer , because the way I see it , cancer is based on the same indecisive bullshit that your plate tectonics crap is based on .
Look , I 'm grateful and all that I am two feet taller than Napoleon was , but I 'm pretty sure all the people dying of cancer would n't have minded being shorter and NOT had their DNA slowly mutated over time .
Now it is kind of unclear in the dogma whether or not you are " for " evolution , but honestly I think that 's another convenient cover - up so you can play around with our genetic code after a night of debauchery .
I have some confusing shit in my body to prove you are all FOR evolution regardless of what your brain washed minions think .
What the fuck is my appendix all about anyway , if we can just remove it without a problem ?
Clearly this is either something that once had a function or WILL have a function 10 million years or so from now .
Whatever it's for , I 'm fine with just not having it , kind of like how people are fine with just not having cancer , you dick !
See a pattern developing here , genius ?
Leave us the hell alone instead of messing everything up !
I 'm on to you and you simply are n't selling me on this Creation vs. Evolution dichotomy crap .
If I 'm not an evolved human being , then why the hell do I have the urge to devour an entire gazelle after several hours of sex ?
Clearly that is something primal left over in the genetic code .
However , due to the absence of gazelle in my area , likely because of some plate tectonic shenanigans , I 'm also pretty satisfied with just having a sandwich instead .
See how evolved I am ?
Religious wars are another thing I want to talk to you about .
Religious wars have got to end now , and do n't pull that " free will " horse shit with me either this time .
I know you 've noticed what your infinite fucking absence of presence is causing .
I heard the smoking twin towers could be seen from space so surely you saw that transpire up on your cloud or wherever your lazy ass hangs out .
We 're all down here basically killing ourselves over different ideas about who you are , who your bastard child was or was n't , or whatever the hell else you want from us .
I mean for fuck 's sake God , even the Whos in Whoville gave a shout out to prove their measly microscopic existence .
So how about a fucking " YOP " or something to stop a significant amount of unnecessary bloodshed , or is that too much to ask of the big man in the sky ?!
Now everyone will finally know the one true word .
You know what the real problem is with all these religious wars though ?
This " book " of yours that everyone goes on about , like it was written by your hand itself and not by a bunch of stoned hippies living in several different centuries .
You need to get on board with the rewrite craze that is going on down here .
I have watched the same fucking idea made into ten different movies and you can't even pen a few updates for us ?!
We have jackasses down here still trying to fit camels through the heads of a needle for crying out loud !
There are people who still are n't eating pork , thousands of years after some sneaky politician thought it was smart to write it into your book , because there was some bad swine that year .
Look around you man , some dickhead remade the Transformers which was way more sacred to me than you 'll ever be .
The least you could do is publish a sequel for some of the mindless idiots down here .
I 'll even do you a solid and provide the title for you , " The Bible 2 : This Time , It 's Fucking Relevant ! "
Anyway , I think I 've pretty much made my point , but since I know you have the attention span of a crack whore , let me sum it up for you .
As far as this plan of yours goes , here 's my idea :
How about you get a new fucking plan , you know , one that does n't include earthquakes , tsunamis , cancer , pandemics , religious wars , and pointless death !
Just a simple thought from little me , to almighty you .
Oh and here 's another thought for you to ponder : I 'm totally going to kick your ass if I ever get to meet you , but it 's cool , because I know you will forgive me for it regardless .
Unless of course you 're as full of shit as I think you are , but then I do n't really want to be a part of YOUR heaven anyway .
From the way your little " plan " has been working out down here on Earth , Heaven is probably just like a bad office job .
A bad office job with an indecisive , micromanaging , jackass for a boss who keeps fucking up the project after changing his mind YET again .
Besides , at least
Hell is where all the bad girls go and if I have to see everyone wearing one thing for all eternity , I would much rather it be sexy black leather than oversized sterile white bathrobes .
Sincerely , you can suck it !

" If the interest rate Greece has to pay for its debts keeps rising , the country may have to default on its obligations .
The euro has been sliding against the US dollar for weeks .
Concerns about the public finances of eurozone countries Portugal , Ireland , Greece , and Spain , the so - called " PIGS , " have emerged in financial markets .
Greece is facing the severest crisis , with its 10 - year bond yield approaching 7 % .
The Greek government estimates its budget deficit at 12.7 % of GDP in 2009 .
Gross government debts amount to 113 % of its GDP .
If the interest rate Greece has to pay for its debts keeps rising , the country may have to default on its obligations .
In an attempt to recoup confidence in the future of the country , the Greek government has announced a freeze on public salaries , a reduction in the number of public servants , and an increase in taxes on gas , tobacco , alcohol , and big real - estate properties .
This should help to reduce the deficit to 8 % in 2010 .
However , the markets do not trust this solution .
While the increase in taxes will cause new problems for the Greeks , other problems remain unaddressed :
The huge public sector has not been substantially reduced .
Wage rates remain uncompetitive as a result of strong labor unions .
Moreover , it is not clear if the government can stick to these small spending cuts , as there will be a general strike in February .
In December 2008 , Greece experienced riots against comparatively minor political reforms .
As the majority of the population seems to be against spending cuts , the government may not be able to prevent the bankruptcy of the country .
For years , the Greek government has demonstrated rather thriftless spending behavior .
This was exacerbated when Greece started to pay lower interest rates on government bonds by virtue of having entered the European Economic and Monetary Union .
Greece 's interest rates were subsidized due to an implicit guarantee from the strong members of the eurozone , who were expected to support weaker members in times of trouble .
During the first years of the euro , interest rates on Greek bonds were thus reduced ; they approached German bond yields .
Greece spent wildly but paid interest rates like a much more conservative country .
Meanwhile , the Greek economy and voting public adapted to government spending subsidized by low interest rates .
When the global financial crisis broke out , deficits of both strong and weak eurozone countries widened .
Stronger countries had their own problems and people started to doubt that they would support the weaker countries in an emergency .
Furthermore , the difference between the interest rate that Greece had to pay on its bonds and the rate Germany had to pay increased .
Today the question is , will Greece be bailed out by the rest of the countries ?
The officials of the weaker countries tend to emphasize the solidarity of the union , while the stronger countries make it clear that there will be no bailout .
Yet , the whole debate is misleading : Greece is already being bailed out by the rest of the union .
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) accepts Greek government bonds as collateral for their lending operations .
European banks may buy Greek government bonds ( now paying a premium in comparison to German bonds of more than 3 % ) and use these bonds to get a loan from the ECB at 1 % interest — a highly profitable deal .
" The future of the euro is dark because there are such strong incentives for reckless fiscal behavior , not only for Greece but also for other countries . "
The banks buy the Greek bonds because they know that the ECB will accept these bonds as collateral for new loans .
As the interest rate paid to the ECB is lower than the interest received from Greece , there is a demand for these Greek bonds .
Without the acceptance of Greek bonds by the ECB as collateral for its loans , Greece would have to pay much higher interest rates than it does now .
Greece is , therefore , already being bailed out .
The other countries of the eurozone pay the bill .
New euros are , effectively , created by the ECB accepting Greek government bonds as collateral .
Greek debts are monetized , and the Greek government spends the money it receives from the bonds to secure support among its population .
Prices start to rise in Greece , and the money flows to other countries , bidding up prices throughout the eurozone .
Abroad , people see their buying costs rising faster than their incomes .
This is a redistribution in favor of Greece .
The Greek government is being bailed out by a constant transfer of purchasing power from the rest of Europe .
The future of the euro is dark because there are such strong incentives for reckless fiscal behavior , not only for Greece but also for other countries .
Some of them are in situations similar Greece's .
In Spain , official unemployment is approaching 20 % and public deficit is 11.4 % of GDP .
Portugal announced a plan to privatize national assets as its deficit is at 9.3 % of GDP .
Ireland 's housing bubble burst with a deficit of 11.5 % of GDP .
The incentives for irresponsible behavior for these and other countries are clear .
Why pay for your expenditures by raising unpopular taxes ?
Why not issue bonds that will be purchased by the creation of new money , even if it finally increases prices in the whole eurozone ?
Why not externalize the costs of the government expenditures that are so vital to securing political power ?
In our monetary system , property rights in money are not adequately defined or defended , giving rise to inflationary credit expansion .
Our fiat fractional - reserve banking system produces a tragedy of the commons , leading to an overexploitation of resources .
A typical example of a tragedy of the commons is overfishing in the ocean .
As fish swarms are not the property of anyone , the costs of fishing are externalized on all other fishers .
If I do not fish as many fishes as fast as I possibly can , my competitor will fish them .
Similarly , the property rights in bank deposits are not clearly defined .
Banks have the incentive to expand credit and externalize the costs onto society .
For the member states in the eurozone , the costs of reckless fiscal behavior can also , to some extent , be externalized .
Any government whose bonds are accepted as collateral by the ECB can use this printing press to finance its expenditures .
The costs of this strategy are partly externalized to other countries when the newly created money bids up prices throughout the monetary union .
Each government has an incentive to accumulate higher deficits than the rest of the eurozone , because its costs can be externalized .
Consequently , in the Eurosystem there is an inbuilt tendency toward continual losses in purchasing power .
This overexploitation may finally result in the collapse of the euro .
Any tragedy of the commons can be solved by privatizing the specific resource .
But instead of privatization , governments generally prefer regulation .
Such a regulation was installed for the European Monetary Union .
It is called the Stability and Growth Pact , and it requires that each country 's annual budget deficit is below 3 % and its gross public debt not higher than 60 % of its GDP .
Sanctions were defined to enforce these rules .
Yet the sanctions have never been enacted and the pact is generally ignored .
For 2010 , all but one member state is expected to have a budget deficit higher than 3 % ; the general European debt ratio is 88 % .
Germany , the main country that urged these requirements , was among the first to refuse to fulfill them .
What is the future of the euro ?
As we have seen , the inherent incentives in the eurozone encourage destruction of the currency because deficit costs are externalized .
Therefore , there are three main possibilities .

There are senators who use their power to block bills and nominations in the Senate , and then there is Senator Tom Coburn , Republican of Oklahoma .
Raising the bar on Republican opposition maneuvers in the Senate , Mr. Coburn on Thursday threatened to put future holds on any Democratic House members who switch their vote in favor of the health care bill , lose their election as a result next November , and then are rewarded with a high - ranking job in the Obama administration .
“ If you voted no and you vote yes and you lose your election and you think any nomination to a federal position is n’t going to be held in the Senate , I ’ve got news for you , it ’s going to be held , ” said Mr. Coburn , a physician known somewhat affectionately around the Senate as Dr. No .
Mr. Coburn , appearing at a news conference with 10 fellow Republican lawmakers who are also doctors , promised to scour upcoming spending bills for any special projects that may be given to lawmakers who reluctantly back the health care bill .
“ If you think you can cut a deal now and it not come out until after the election , I want to tell you that is n’t going to happen and be prepared to defend selling your vote in the House , ” Mr. Coburn warned those making up their minds across the rotunda .
With a vote in the House approaching , the intensity of the fight was being ratcheted up significantly on Capitol Hill with Republicans pulling out the stops against Democrats , and Democrats warning that the next few days would see a blizzard of Republican threats and misinformation .
“ There is no limit to what the other side will do to protect the insurance companies , ” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said .

KNOXVILLE , Tenn . --
John Calipari is one win away from clinching a Southeastern Conference championship in his first season at Kentucky -- just what he was brought in to do .
That 's why his answer was swift and decisive when Calipari was asked Friday what winning the school 's 44th conference title would mean : " Nothing . "
The No. 2 Wildcats ( 27 - 1 , 12 - 1 ) , college basketball 's winningest program , would assure themselves of at least a share of the championship by beating Tennessee on Saturday .
They would get the championship outright if Vanderbilt also loses at Arkansas .
" I 've always taken the approach that it's about the seed in the NCAA tournament , " Calipari said .
" If you want me to be honest about how I think and what we 're doing to prepare , that 's what it is .
The SEC tournament is about our seed in the NCAA tournament . "
Calipari says he is n't concerned about players slacking off down the stretch , considering some have projected that there is virtually nothing Kentucky can do to lose a top seed in the NCAA tournament .
The games remain as important as ever , he said , because everything has to do with getting better .
The Wildcats certainly saw plenty of improvement Thursday with an 82-61 victory over South Carolina , avenging their only loss .
Most improved was the team 's veteran forward Patrick Patterson , who got a season - high 23 points after managing a season - low five in the previous meeting with the Gamecocks .
" I know I have to perform well and go out there with a lot of energy and just play , " Patterson said .
" I have to come in every game , every night and play ball .
I am the veteran , the older guy out there on the court with the most experience , and I should be doing that . "
Kentucky beat Tennessee 73-62 earlier this month .
Just as Patterson seemed to jump - start his season against South Carolina , freshman guard Eric Bledsoe had one of his best outings against the Vols and has continued his consistent play since .
Once again , the Wildcats may be catching the Vols at a time their star big man , Wayne Chism , is n't 100 percent .
In Tennessee 's loss to Florida this week , Chism committed a hard foul and dropped to his knees in pain near the bench .
Even if he 's fully healthy , Kentucky seems to be hitting its stride with its post play .
The Wildcats dominated the rebounding and inside scoring against the Gamecocks , and freshman center DeMarcus Cousins got yet another double - double to extend his UK freshman record to 17 .
Tennessee has struggled lately , losing three of its last five games and dropping to fourth in the SEC East behind Kentucky , Vanderbilt and Florida .
Still , Calipari knows never to look past Vols coach Bruce Pearl , whom he 's faced numerous times over the years while leading Memphis .
" He may try to come out with some funky defense and we 'll deal with it , " Calipari said .
" This wo n't be for the faint of heart .
There are no boys in this game . "

*usr_32.txt * For Vim version 7.3 .
Last change : 2010 Jul 20 VIM USER MANUAL - by Bram Moolenaar
The undo tree Vim provides multi-level undo .
If you undo a few changes and then make a new change you create a branch in the undo tree .
This text is about moving through the branches .
| 32.1 | Undo up to a file write | 32.2 |
Numbering changes | 32.3 | Jumping around the tree | 32.4 |
Time travelling Next chapter : |usr_40.txt|
Make new commands
Previous chapter : |usr_31.txt|
Exploiting the GUI Table of contents : |usr_toc.txt|
==============================================================================
* 32.1 * Undo up to a file write Sometimes you make several changes , and then discover you want to go back to when you have last written the file .
You can do that with this command : : earlier 1f
The " f " stands for " file " here .
You can repeat this command to go further back in the past .
Or use a count different from 1 to go back faster .
If you go back too far , go forward again with : : later 1 f Note that these commands really work in time sequence .
This matters if you made changes after undoing some changes .
It 's explained in the next section .
Also note that we are talking about text writes here .
For writing the undo information in a file see |undo - persistence| .
==============================================================================
* 32.2 * Numbering changes
In section | 02.5 | we only discussed one line of undo /redo .
But it is also possible to branch off .
This happens when you undo a few changes and then make a new change .
The new changes become a branch in the undo tree .
Let 's start with the text " one " .
The first change to make is to append " too " .
And then move to the first ' o ' and change it into 'w ' .
We then have two changes , numbered 1 and 2 , and three states of the text : one | change 1 | one too | change 2 | one two If we now undo one change , back to " one too " , and change " one " to " me " we create a branch in the undo tree : one | change 1 | one too / \ change 2 change 3 | | one two me too
You can now use the |u| command to undo .
If you do this twice you get to " one " .
Use |CTRL - R| to redo , and you will go to " one too " .
One more |CTRL - R| takes you to " me too " .
Thus undo and redo go up and down in the tree , using the branch that was last used .
What matters here is the order in which the changes are made .
Undo and redo are not considered changes in this context .
After each change you have a new state of the text .
Note that only the changes are numbered , the text shown in the tree above has no identifier .
They are mostly referred to by the number of the change above it .
But sometimes by the number of one of the changes below it , especially when moving up in the tree , so that you know which change was just undone .
==============================================================================
* 32.3 * Jumping around the tree
So how do you get to " one two " now ?
You can use this command : :undo 2
The text is now " one two " , you are below change 2 .
You can use the | :undo| command to jump to below any change in the tree .
Now make another change : change " one " to " not " : one | change 1 | one too / \ change 2 change 3 | | one two me too | change 4 | not two Now you change your mind and want to go back to " me too " .
Use the |g -| command .
This moves back in time .
Thus it does n't walk the tree upwards or downwards , but goes to the change made before .
You can repeat |g-| and you will see the text change : me too one two one too one Use |g+| to move forward in time : one one too one two me too not two Using |:undo| is useful if you know what change you want to jump to .
|g-| and |g+| are useful if you do n't know exactly what the change number is .
You can type a count before |g-| and |g+| to repeat them .
==============================================================================
* 32.4 * Time travelling
When you have been working on text for a while the tree grows to become big .
Then you may want to go to the text of some minutes ago .
To see what branches there are in the undo tree use this command : : undolist number changes time 3 2 16 seconds ago 4 3 5 seconds ago
Here you can see the number of the leaves in each branch and when the change was made .
Assuming we are below change 4 , at " not two " , you can go back ten seconds with this command : : earlier 10s Depending on how much time you took for the changes you end up at a certain position in the tree .
The | :earlier| command argument can be " m " for minutes , " h " for hours and " d " for days .
To go all the way back use a big number : : earlier 100d
To travel forward in time again use the |:later| command : : later 1 m
The arguments are " s " , " m " and " h " , just like with |:earlier| .
If you want even more details , or want to manipulate the information , you can use the |undotree ( ) | function .
To see what it returns : : echo undotree ( )

Here ’s a letter that I just sent to the Washington Post :
Your favorable front - page remembrance of the late U.S. Rep .
John Murtha inadvertently testifies to the abysmally low standards to which politicians are held ( “ John Murtha dies ; longtime congressman was master of pork - barrel politics , ” Feb. 9 ) .
By your own account , Mr. Murtha was the “ King of Pork . ”
He was known for skillfully using Congressional procedures to earmark funds for his district – that is , to prompt Uncle Sam to take money from Americans at large and give it to the relatively small number of Pennsylvanians who elect Mr. Murtha to office .
His justification ?
“ I take care of my district . ”
Nothing here about spending taxpayer money wisely ; nothing about the general welfare ; nothing about principles or fiscal responsibility .
If Mr. Murtha on his own had traveled the country picking pockets , robbing banks , and burgling houses , only to bring the booty back to western PA and share it with his friends , he would have been rightly despised as a common criminal .
But because Mr. Murtha joined forces with persons having similarly questionable morals , who together pass off their thievery as “ lawmaking , ” he ’s celebrated in your pages – celebrated for doing , save on a grander scale , exactly what is done by common thieves .
Sincerely ,
Donald J. Boudreaux

Americans increased their overall consumer debt in January for the first time in a year , even as they continued to trim their credit card balances .
HOW MUCH CREDIT CARD DEBT
HAVE AMERICANS SHED ?
Americans ’ credit card debt has fallen by more than $ 111 billion from its September 2008 total of $ 975.7 billion — including a modest drop of about $ 2 billion in January .
The chart below shows how steadily consumers have pecked away at that debt — or had it charged off — during a record run of 16 straight monthly declines in credit card balances .
That ’s an average of $ 2,061 eliminated per household with credit card debt .
Note : Decrease is cumulative , and shown in billions .
According to the Fed ’s monthly G.19 consumer credit report released Friday , consumer debt rose 2.4 percent to $ 2.46 trillion in January , ending a record run of 11 straight monthly declines , dating back to January 2009 .
However , consumer credit card balances fell 2.3 percent in January .
U.S. consumers erased nearly $ 2 billion in debt , marking a record 16th straight month of decline .
The report considers various types of consumer debt , including revolving credit — a loan category comprised almost entirely of credit card debt — as well as nonrevolving debt , which includes such debt as auto loans , student loans and loans for mobile homes , boats and trailers .
The revolving debt component fell to $ 864.4 billion from $ 866.1 billion in December .
U.S. credit card debt stood at $ 975.7 billion in September 2008 .
The 16 monthly declines since then have seen a $ 111.3 billion plunge in credit card debt .
That means the average U.S. household with credit card debt — of which there are roughly 54 million , according to government data — has eliminated roughly $ 2,061 in credit card debt during that period , either by paying it down or having it charged off as uncollectable .
“ The momentum of the last 15 months or so has not been shaken , ” says David Kennett , an economics professor at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie , N.Y .
“ As long as the labor market remains weak , I expect consumers to retrench and pay down as much debt as they can . ”
Unemployment remains a challenge
Based on the latest jobs data , those consumer debt levels will continue to fall .
The U.S. Labor Department reported that 36,000 jobs were shed in February as the unemployment rate held steady at 9.7 percent , following the 26,000 jobs that were lost in January .
CONSUMER CREDIT CARD DEBT SHEDDING SLOWS
In January , Americans ’ credit card debt fell by about 2 percent , the smallest decline in recent months .
Below , the line on the left shows the percentage change in credit card debt from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the end of 2009 .
The line on the right indicates the percentage change in credit card debt over the last three months .
Although many experts agree that cardholders have shunned credit , some analysts say banks are largely responsible for the decline in card balances .
“ While there is evidence that consumers are using credit less and relying more on prepaid and debit cards as fallout from the recession , the biggest part of the runoff in credit card receivables was caused by issuers chasing customers away by closing inactive accounts and being too aggressive , ” Robert Hammer , chief executive of credit card consulting firm R.K. Hammer , tells the industry publication PaymentsSource .
Recent data from the Fed highlighted that combination of debt - shy consumers and aggressively stingy banks .
According to the Beige Book survey of the Fed ’s 12 regional banks , loan demand into February remained weak across the country , with most regions also indicating that banks stayed cautious about lending .
The Beige Book is issued eight times a year , two weeks before the Fed ’s Federal Open Market Committee meets to determine monetary policy .
Law raises awareness , tarnishes plastic
Meanwhile , experts say that anti-debt attitudes have been reinforced by the Credit CARD
Act of 2009 , which restricts some of the most unfair and deceptive lending practices .
“ The publicity around the new legislation to protect consumers has also drawn attention to what a bad way credit cards are to borrow money , ” Kennett says .
Among the CARD
Act ’s provisions that took effect on Feb. 22 is a requirement that bank statements warn consumers that making only the minimum monthly payment results in a longer payoff period , which raises the overall cost of repaying the debt .
That knowledge may help discourage borrowing , experts say .
“ The mere fact that it can take ( literally ) decades to pay off debt at minimum payment rate and the specter of the mountain of interest incurred should encourage credit card balance reduction , ” Kennett says via e-mail .
The debt will rise again
Nevertheless , consumers who have tried plastic can’t keep the debt monkey off their backs forever .
Experts say cardholders will begin to rebuild their balances later this year .
“ Unfortunately , I do not expect this trend to last forever , ” Kennett says .
“ As confidence in the future direction of the economy returns , and unemployment falls , I expect our national debt addiction to manifest itself again . ”

Togo have been punished for their decision to withdraw from the Africa Cup of Nations after a gun attack on their coach by being banned from the next two editions of the tournament , according to the Confederation of African Football ( Caf ) .
The president of Caf , Issa Hayatou , told AFP that the reason for the ban was because Togo 's decision to pull out was based on " governmental interference " .
Three people were killed after the Togo squad was ambushed whilst travelling through the Cabinda region of Angola .
Togo 's player flew home soon after , requesting time to mourn the dead , but were officially disqualified from the tournament after failing to turn up for their opening game against Ghana .
The separatist group , the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda ( Flec ) , claimed responsibility for the attack .
The final of the tournament , between Ghana and Egypt , will take place tomorrow .
Last week , it was found that the bomber had come to the attention of MI5 when he made contact with a number of individuals who were under surveillance .
However , MI5 was not thought to have identified Abdulmutallab as a threat and he was not fully investigated .
The bomber was therefore not placed on international watch lists and was able to board a plane from Nigeria to America , via Amsterdam last month .
Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s most famous novel is Slaughterhouse - Five .
You may have read it -- it 's taught in many high school English classes in the U.S. , though in others it has been banned .
So it goes .
Anyway , Slaughterhouse - Five is partially autobiographical ; it 's based partly on Vonnegut 's experiences as a Prisoner of War in World War II , when he and other POWs were imprisoned in an underground slaughterhouse meat locker in Dresden in 1944 , Germany .
By day , they worked in labor camps ; at night they slept in the slaughterhouse .
During his imprisonment in the slaughterhouse ( which was indeed slaughterhouse number five , or Schlachthof FÃ¼nf in German ) , the Allies fire - bombed Dresden , largely destroying it and inflicting mass casualties ( estimated at 250,000 by Vonnegut ) .
But Vonnegut survived .
Twenty - five years later , Vonnegut would publish the novel Slaughterhouse - Five , and the rest is history .
But what was his frame of mind during the imprisonment ?
What happened before he ended up in the slaughterhouse ?
How did he get out of it ?
The awesome blog Letters of Note publishes a letter Vonnegut wrote to his family from a repatriation camp in France , shortly after his POW experience .
Below are some excerpts ( emphasis added ) ; read the rest here .
...
Well , the supermen marched us , without food , water or sleep to Limberg , a distance of about sixty miles , I think , where we were loaded and locked up , sixty men to each small , unventilated , unheated box car .
There were no sanitary accommodations -- the floors were covered with fresh cow dung .
There was n't room for all of us to lie down .
Half slept while the other half stood .
... ... Under the Geneva Convention , Officers and Non-commissioned Officers are not obliged to work when taken prisoner .
I am , as you know , a Private .
One - hundred - and - fifty such minor beings were shipped to a Dresden work camp on January 10th .
I was their leader by virtue of the little German I spoke .
It was our misfortune to have sadistic and fanatical guards .
We were refused medical attention and clothing :
We were given long hours at extremely hard labor .
Our food ration was two - hundred - and - fifty grams of black bread and one pint of unseasoned potato soup each day .
After desperately trying to improve our situation for two months and having been met with bland smiles I told the guards just what I was going to do to them when the Russians came .
They beat me up a little .
I was fired as group leader .
Beatings were very small time : -- one boy starved to death and the SS Troops shot two for stealing food .
...
On about February 14th the Americans came over , followed by the R.A.F. their combined labors killed 250,000 people in twenty - four hours and destroyed all of Dresden -- possibly the world 's most beautiful city .
But not me .
... I 've too damned much to say , the rest will have to wait , I can't receive mail here so do n't write .
May 29 , 1945 Love , Kurt - Jr.
I urge you to read the whole letter .
It 's a riveting first - person account of being a POW in WWII , and the wry voice of Vonnegut the novelist was already apparent in his letter .
In the same way he repeats " So it goes " in Slaughterhouse - Five , he repeats " But not me " in this letter .
( Via Daring Fireball . )
“ You can not say that we are important allies and then you are negotiating with people whom we are hunting and you do n’t include us , ” he said .
An American official in Washington who has been briefed on the arrest denied that there had been negotiations with the Taliban commander or that Pakistani intelligence engineered the arrest to ensure a role in negotiations .
“ That ’s a conspiracy theory to which I give no credit , because it ’s just not true , ” the official said .
But whether or not that was Pakistan ’s intention , it may be the effect .
The Taliban are longtime Pakistani allies in Afghanistan , and Pakistan has signaled its interest in preserving influence there .
Though the Obama administration has been divided on whether and how to deal with the Taliban , the Pakistani move could come at the expense of the Afghan government of Hamid Karzai and complicate reconciliation efforts his government has begun .

An American intelligence official in Europe conceded as much , while also acknowledging Mullah Baradar ’s key role in the reconciliation process .
“ I know that our people had been in touch with people around him and were negotiating with him , ” the official said , speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue .
“ So it does n’t make sense why we bite the hand that is feeding us , ” the official added .
“ And now the Taliban will have no reason to negotiate with us ; they will not believe anything we will offer or say . ”
• Informant offered to sell tax data to for € 2.5 m • Angela Merkel facing opposition from within her party
Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , signalled her government 's readiness today to purchase stolen secret Swiss bank account data on 1,500 alleged tax evaders from an informant .
The informant , who used to work at the Swiss arm of the British bank , HSBC , has offered to sell the data to the government for € 2.5 m ( £ 2.2 m ) Experts say the information , which is contained on a CD , could reap up to € 200 m ( £ 174.60 m ) in tax revenue .
Despite strong voices of opposition within her own party , Merkel said : " Our goal should be to obtain this data , if it is relevant .
" We should try everything to get information on possible tax evaders .
Every reasonable person knows that tax evasion needs to be uncovered . "
But Swiss president Doris Leuthard hit back , saying it was " insidious " for a state that operates under the rule of law " to make use of illegal data " .
Merkel 's willingness to buy the data , which has rattled relations between Germany and Switzerland , already at odds over the controversial issue of banking secrecy , was in contrast to members of her own conservative Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) and its sister party the CSU .
Several spoke out against buying the stolen data at the weekend , saying it was morally questionable to use it to ensnare potential tax evaders .
Opposition politicians accused the conservatives of trying to protect their own interests as they pushed for the government to buy the data .
An estimated € 175bn is held in Swiss bank accounts by German citizens .
A spokesman for the German finance minister , Wolfgang Schäuble , said before any decision was made it would be necessary to " establish legal clarity " over using illegally acquired data .
Thomas Sutter , the spokesman for the Swiss Bankers Association , cautioned Germany over acquiring " stolen property " .
He said he did not believe that the German government " would want to be seen as the recipient of stolen goods " and warned that " if Switzerland was put under pressure " , it could be " counterproductive " for current negotiations between the two countries over a new double taxation treaty .
Schäuble 's spokesman warned that if the government bought the data , it could " severely shake " the relationship between the two countries .
But it said the precedent had been set two years ago when Germany purchased stolen bank data from the former employee of a bank in Liechtenstein and used it to pursue tax evaders .
The information , for which it paid € 4.2 m , included data on around 600 Germans , the most prominent of whom was Klaus Zumwinkel , the former CEO of Deutsche Post .
Zumwinkel was subsequently fined € 1 m in tax evasion charges and given a two - year suspended prison sentence .
The alleged seller of information this time has been named as the 37 - year - old former HSBC banker , and French citizen , Hervé Falciani , who is believed to have also offered bank data to the French authorities last August .
German authorities involved in the investigation said from the samples of the data they had seen they had no doubt it was authentic .
Joachim Poss , the deputy chief whip of the opposition Social Democrats urged the conservatives and their junior coalition party , the Free Democrats , to act objectively , and to not attempt to " protect the interest of their own voters who are on the whole the owners of larger fortunes " .
It would be awkward for anyone at the CBC to publicly condemn the actions of a competing broadcaster .
But this is not a matter of business or politics , but rather of prejudice .
When Johnny Weir took to the ice in the Men ’s Figure Skating competition last Wedneswday , two male talking heads from RDS were ready to add some colour to their commentary .
Quoted text from CTV Montreal
“ This may not be politically correct , ” Mailhot said during the segment , in which Weir , who is known for his extravagant performances and fashion flair , was shown sporting a semi- sheer , pink - and - black costume he designed himself .
“ But do you think he lost points due to his costume and his body language ? ”
Goldberg replied that Weir ’s feminine style may reflect badly on other male figure skaters .
“ They ’ll think all the boys who skate will end up like him , ” he said .
“ It sets a bad example . ”
“ We should make him ( Weir ) pass a gender test at this point , ” Goldberg said , and Mailhot then jokingly suggested Weir should compete in the women ’s competition . ”
Claude Mailhot and Alain Goldberg
RDS is owned by CTVGlobeMedia , the parent company of CTV , and describes these two men as “ veteran sportscasters ” .
Later , the two apologized , and RDS issued a statement :
“ All discriminatory statements , or those appearing discriminatory , have neither a place in society nor in media .
Mr. Mailhot and Mr. Goldberg made tactless comments on the appearance and manner of a figure skater .
As soon as they were made aware of the reaction their comments sparked , and because they never meant to defame an individual or a sexual orientation , they decided to offer an apology . ”
But this runs a little deeper than just talk .
It demands that RDS do more than issue a statement .
It must walk the talk .
These two men deserve to take a break , and become edumacated .
And very , very quickly , before they ’re allowed to be broadcasting again .
They prove that being an adult , or being on TV , does n’t necessarily mean that you ’re either smart or grown - up .
Or even understand the fundamentals of human rights , let alone fair play .
It also makes you wonder why there are n’t other and equally competent people available .
You ’d think there ’d be at least three or four other people in la belle provance who could do television sports for a while .
Why not give a few rookies a chance , RDS ?
You ca n’t lose any more credibility than you already have by allowing these two men on the air making stupid remarks .
And could you remind us again , RDS … how long ago was it that we celebrated Toller Cranston and his achievements .
And to this day honour him as one of the greatest Canadians .

In 2009 , Obama ’s White House fought a much - publicized “ war ” with Fox News .
In 2010 , they might have a new opponent ; but instead of battling conservatives who consider themselves “ fair and balanced , ” the White House press secretary took aim at the liberal host of a network widely perceived as “ liberal - leaning . ”
Addressing a crowd of progressive talk radio fans in Minnesota Saturday , MSNBC ’s Ed Schultz claimed he exchanged harsh words with White House spokesman Robert Gibbs off the air last week .

“ I told him he was full of sh*t is what I told him , ” Schultz claimed .
“ And then he gave me the Dick Cheney f- bomb the same way Senator Leahy got it on the Senate floor .
I told Robert Gibbs , I said , ‘ I ’m sorry you ’re swearing at me , but I ’m just trying to help you out . ”
The Plum Line garnered a response from Gibbs which Greg Sargent believes “ probably wo n’t do much to turn down the temperature . ”
Asked about Schultz ’s account , Gibbs emailed that in their private talk , he strongly took issue with Schultz ’s claim that the health care bill is a gift to the insurance industry .
Gibbs adds that he demanded Schultz tell him “ why he ’d tell his viewers something so completely and knowingly wrong in an attempt to get people to watch his show . ”
It ’s an unusually harsh charge , given that the Obama White House would presumably like to calm frayed nerves on the left , and one imagines that in response , Schultz will not do a great deal to dial down the volume .
Sargent did n’t specify what exactly Gibbs said regarding Schultz ’s lie , but many liberals unhappy with the Senate passed health reform bill have used similar language .
In an exclusive interview with RAW STORY last week , which received much attention on the web , Ohio Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich pointedly said , “ There ’s nothing liberal about giving insurance companies carte blanche to charge anything they want for health care …
Since when did that become liberal ? ”

In December , before changing his mind and backing the bill , former DNC chair Howard Dean wrote in a Washington Post op - ed , “ In short , the winners in this bill are insurance companies ; the American taxpayer is about to be fleeced with a bailout in a situation that dwarfs even what happened at AIG . ”
Filmmaker Michael Moore said last November , “ The health insurance companies are going to make an extra $ 70 billion dollars as a result of Americans being forced to buy their health insurance .
What company would n’t love this bill ? ”
When contacted by RAW STORY to respond to the White House statement which Sargent characterized as an “ unusually harsh charge , ” a producer for Ed Schultz responded with a terse “ no response .
sorry . ”

Schultz producer James
Holm was then asked to specify if his statement of “ no response ” meant “ now , to us , or period ” and if he thought the MSNBC host might respond at a later point , but RAW STORY ’s last e-mail went unanswered .
NPR recently reported that “ White House aides believe a lot of the liberal angst about health care will go away once the president actually signs a bill .
And to the extent that the Democrats have a problem motivating their core voters , they ’ve got time to fix it . ”

White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer told NPR a few weeks ago , “ We ’re not overly concerned about these things , first and foremost because there is n’t an election tomorrow , not an election the next day . ”
Think Progress ’ Faiz Shakir writes ,
The White House has tried repeatedly to dispute the concern that health insurance companies would profit from the current reform proposal .
In November , White House health policy adviser Nancy - Ann DeParle argued that “ insurance companies will profit if status quo remains . ”
And in December , White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer argued that insurance companies would n’t be spending vast amounts of money to lobby against the bill if it were good for them .
How Obama got Keynes wrong
Allan Meltzer with Timothy Geithner ( right ) and Charles Plosser , Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia president ( left )
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- The Obama White House likes to say that the theories of John Maynard Keynes form the foundation for its fiscal policies .
Most notably , it draws upon the legendary British economist 's idea of spending big to pull out of a recession .
But one economist says the administration has gotten Keynes only half right .
Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon is one of the most influential monetarists of the past 50 years .
He has served in the Department of the Treasury under President Kennedy and on the Council of Economic Advisors during the Reagan Administration .
He also authored the book , Keynes 's Monetary Theory : A Different Interpretation .
While the Obama team is laying out huge sums of money , Meltzer says it 's neglecting a key part of Keynes ' plan :
You can't run up a debt without a way to cover it .
Meltzer recently sat down with Fortune editor - at - large Shawn Tully .
Below are edited excerpts from their conversation .
If Keynes were alive today , what would he think of President Obama 's fiscal policies ?
He would roll over in his grave if he could see the things being done in his name .
Keynes was opposed to large structural deficits .
He thought that they chilled rather than stimulated the economy .
It 's true that we 're stuck with large deficits now .
The goal should be to reduce them , not to take on new spending that makes them worse .
Today , deficits are getting bigger and bigger with no plan to significantly lower them .
Keynes understood what the current administration does n't understand that the proper policy in a democracy recognizes that today 's increase in debt must be paid in the future .
We paid down wartime deficits .
Now we have continuous deficits .
We used to have a rule people believed in , balanced budgets .
And now that 's gone .
Did n't Keynes advocate temporary deficit spending in a recession ?
Keynes wanted deficits to be cyclical and temporary .
He would n't have been in favor of efforts to raise tax rates in a recession to eliminate deficits .
He viewed that as suicidal .
He was opposed to the idea that governments should balance the budget during a downturn , and advocated running short - term deficits to spur the economy .
The type of stimulus he advocated was very specific .
He said it should be geared towards increasing private investment .
He viewed private investment , as opposed to big government spending , as the source of durable job creation .
He also said that the deficits should be self - liquidating , so that the increased economic activity caused by the stimulus inevitably generated a combination of extra tax revenues and lower unemployment payments .
With higher revenues and lower outlays , the deficit would disappear .
The Obama administration 's main objective , in the name of Keynes , is boosting consumption .
That sounds very different from the focus on investment that you say Keynes advocated .
Keynes did n't favor at any time that I know spending to increase consumption .
He did n't want that , and in fact he believed that was taken care of by the marketplace .
Keynes wanted to increase employment by smoothing the amount of investment through the up and down parts of the business cycle .
He knew that recessions cause a decline in investment , and that the fall in investment caused unemployment to rise .
So he wanted the government to stabilize investment through a recession .
What specific policies did Keynes advocate for smoothing investment ?
Keynes is very vague on the subject .
He believed that the government should plan and direct investment , but not nationalize it .
He talked about how well utilities were run under state regulation in Britain .
Keynes wanted to apply that model to more of the economy .
He thought government planning of investment was the best way to reduce risk for private companies and lower interest rates to spur investment .
Did Keynes champion tax cuts or government spending increases in a recession ?
Again , he was extremely vague .
On spending , he did say that deficits should be temporary and self - liquidating .
He clearly did not advocate long - term spending in excess of revenues , since that causes structural deficits .
Nor did he specifically recommend tax reductions for individuals or companies .
Those types of cuts , however , are an obvious way to achieve his goal of boosting investment in a recession .
And it 's been used with great success by his Keynesian disciples .
For example , the Kennedy Administration tax cuts were championed by Keynesian economists , and proved very successful at raising investment .
And one of the leading Keynesians , Franco Modigliani , developed a theory of consumption stating that temporary tax cuts are mainly saved or used to reduce debt .
Milton Friedman , the ultimate champion of free markets , independently developed an alternative model that came to the same conclusion .
The temporary reductions under Carter , George W. Bush and Obama were all failures , since people spend more only when they 're confident their take home pay will rise permanently .
This is standard economic theory that the current administration ignores .
What would Keynes think of Obama 's stimulus plan ?
It 's unbelievable that a man whose main theme was to smooth investment comes to be the proponent of redistributing income away from the people and companies who do the investing .
My advice on the stimulus plan was , do n't do it .
Let 's look at the plan .
First , a lot of the money was used to reduce the deficits of state and local governments by increasing the federal debt .
It was simply money transferred from the federal government .
The economic multiplier effect was zero .
Second , the temporary tax cuts went to paying off credit cards and other debts , not spending that would have increased economic growth .

In 2008 , 53 percent of all households headed by an immigrant ( legal or illegal ) with one or more children under age 18 used at least one welfare program , compared to 36 percent for native households with children .
Immigrant use of welfare tends to be much higher than natives for food assistance programs and Medicaid .
Use of cash and housing programs tends to be very similar to natives .
A large share of the welfare used by immigrants is received on behalf of their U.S. - born children .
But even households with children comprised entirely of immigrants still have a welfare use rate of 47 percent .
The above figures come from an analysis of the public use file of the March 2009 Current Population Survey collected by the Census Bureau .
The survey asks about use of welfare programs in the calendar year prior to the survey .
The eight major welfare programs reported above are SSI ( Supplemental Security Income for low - income elderly and disabled ) , TANF ( Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ) , WIC ( Women Infants and Children food program ) , free school lunch , food stamps ( now called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ) , Medicaid ( health insurance for those with low incomes ) , public housing , and rent subsidies .
High immigrant welfare use is partly explained by the low education level of many immigrants .
Of immigrant households with children , almost one in three is headed by someone who did not graduate high school , compared to one out of ten for native headed households with children .
Most of the immigrant households accessing the welfare system have at least one person who worked during 2008 .
However , because such a large share of immigrants have relatively little education , their incomes tend to be low and they or their children still qualify for one or more welfare programs .
Although most new legal immigrants are barred from using certain welfare programs for the first five years , this provision has only a modest impact on household use rates for several reasons : most immigrants have been in the U.S. for longer than five years ; the ban only applies to some programs ; some state governments provide welfare to new immigrants with their own money ; by becoming citizens , immigrants become eligible for all welfare programs ; and perhaps most important is that the U.S. - born children of immigrants ( including those born to illegal immigrants ) are automatically eligible for all welfare programs at birth .
Examining welfare use by household is very common among researchers .
See for example figures 20 - 1 , 20 - 2 , and 21 - 3 in Census Bureau publication " Profile of the Foreign - Born Population " and " Immigration and the Welfare State : Immigrant Participation in Means - Tested Entitlement Programs " by George Borjas and Lynette Hilton .

Mount St. Helens , Washington ( CNN ) --
A climber who fell into the crater of Mount St. Helens volcano on Monday has been found dead , an official said Tuesday .
A U.S. Naval helicopter lifted the body of Joseph Bohlig , 52 , from the south crater wall at 2:45 p.m. local time and flew it to Carson , Washington , for transport to the Clark County Medical Examiner 's Office for autopsy , said David L. Cox , undersheriff of the Skamania County Sheriff 's Office .
Bohlig , of Kelso , Washington , was at the edge of the volcano 's crater Monday when the cornice on which he was standing crumbled , causing him to plunge 1,500 feet down its ice - and rock - covered inner wall , authorities said .
" The snow gave way , the cornice overhang gave way as he was standing there and he essentially fell the distance that he did , " Skamania County Sheriff Dave Brown said .
" Nobody saw him after he went over the crater rim , did n't see where he landed . "
Fellow climber Scott Salkovics told CNN affiliate KGW that Bohlig had handed his camera to another climber and was about to pose for a picture with Mount Rainier in the background when he turned around and took a final step on the cornice .
" Boom , it busted off and I saw him clawing for the edge with a startled look on his face , and then he disappeared , " Salkovics told KGW .
" I was looking right at him , he was only 10 feet away ... then he just disappeared . "
KGW : " He was only 10 feet away ... then he just disappeared "
Bohlig was a veteran climber , CNN affiliate KATU reported .
Salkovics and Bohlig had recently returned from a climbing trip in Ecuador and thought it would be fun to do a trip on Mount St. Helens , KGW reported .
Warnings about unstable cornices on the crater rim are posted , according to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest Web site .
Every year , thousands of climbers trek to the rim of the active volcano , according to the Web site .
Mount St. Helens erupted on May 18 , 1980 , killing 57 people and leveling nearly 150 square miles of forest .
CNN 's Amanda O'Donnell , Patty Lane , Melanie Whitley and Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report .
Paul Krugman talks money
Nobel Laureate warns of second slump
On Friday , February 5th , Princeton professor Paul Krugman PhD ’ 77 , 2008 Nobel Laureate in Economics , New York Times opinion columnist and former MIT professor spoke about the economic crisis , comparing it to the Great Depression .
His talk , planned by the Undergraduate Economics Association ( UEA ) and the Department of Economics , completely filled 32 - 123 and had several hundred people waiting outside .
The theme for the lecture was “ What Have We Learned , If Anything ? ” , citing how America once again found itself in a situation similar to the Great Depression and referencing the mistakes the United States has made within the past few years .
The financial crisis of 2008 , Krugman said , was strikingly similar in its progression to the events that led to the Great Depression 80 years ago .
“ We ended up having a teched - up , 21st century version of what happened in 1930 , ” he said .
Krugman discussed the “ Mistake of 1937 ” as the reason for the length of the Great Depression .
He said President Roosevelt was convinced that the economy had recovered from the first financial crash , and withdrew government support too soon , resulting in a severe recession .
People today , Krugman argued , forgot that lesson and thought they were safe .
The extra banking regulation enacted after the Depression lulled people onto a false sense of security .
Krugman also accused people of not taking the recession seriously enough .
“ The actual slump has not been as bad as the Great Depression , ” he said , but there has since been “ some self - congratulation about that , probably excessive . ”
He said that the United States is not yet out of the recession .
Krugman argued that the reason the recession was not as great this year because of the bigger government , not because of the guidance of the Federal Reserve .
That “ the world did n’t end on his watch is not good enough reason to make Ben Bernanke man of the year ” Krugman said , jibing about the Federal Reserve Chairman .
He added that the continuing function of Medicare and social security aided in cushioning the crisis .
Still , keeping true to his stereotypical pessimism , Krugman forecasted a grim future over the next few years , especially for students who are just graduating .
Stastitical estimates , he said , have shown that students who graduate into a bad market will be considerably more worse off than those students who graduate into a good market , even 25 years later .
The biggest effect of the recession will be on “ young people graduating from college facing a terrible job market . ”
“ Sorry about that , guys , ” Krugman said to laughs .
Krugman furthermore predicted a second dip in our current recession .
After the stimulus reaches its peak during the summer , it will fade out and we will face the same situation as the “ Mistake of 1937 , ” he said .
Krugman largely blamed the political system for how things got so bad so quickly .
There is a “ real difficulty in getting things through ” the political process , he said .
Even if a decent policy makes it through the legal system , the political conclusion is that the policy failed if the economy continues to look bad .
Krugman also blamed his profession , saying that economists themselves were confused .
It was “ startling to watch economists reinventing 1930s vintage fallacies as if they were fresh insights , ” he said .
After the 40 minute speech , UEA President Charles Wu ’10 and UEA Vice President Manisha Padi ’ 10 presented Krugman with one of the UEA ’s t- shirts — a green shirt that reads “ Economists Do It with Models ” .
Krugman spent the following 25 minutes answering questions from students , ranging in topics from the future of Europe to what students should plan for the future .
Of all of the things at MIT , Krugman said he missed the healthcare the most .
“ I thought that I got really good assisted care .
I like socialized medicine , ” he said , laughing .
“ Princeton has a fine health plan , but they just hand you your UnitedHealthcare card and you ’re on your own . ”
Afterwards , Krugman had dinner with the faculty as the economics department ’s guest .
The UEA did not expect the crowds that gathered at Stata on Friday , and Wu noted that the UEA expected only to fill 32 - 123 .
The UEA was unsuccessful in securing 10 - 250 or 26 -100 for the talk .
Had the talk been 10 - 250 or 26 - 100 , it would have had to be much later in the day .
32-123 was filled by 3:30 , forty five minutes before Krugman began his talk , and at 4:00 , nearly 300 people were standing in the main hall .
Rachel Lee ’13 and Steve Drapcho ’ 13 , who were seated in the second row , had arrived around 3:15 .
“ I read his blogs and I ’ve always wanted to hear him speak , ” Lee said .
“ He ’s talking about a topic that has a lot of relevance to us right now , ” Drapcho said .
“ He ’s definitely an authority in this field . ”
Earlier in the day , nineteen undergraduates and one faculty member sat around and chatted for an hour over cookies with Krugman .
Undergraduates in economics submitted questions to the UEA they wanted to ask Krugman in advance , and UEA officers invited the authors of the top 15 questions to the luncheon .
The officers moderated the discussion by starting with the 15 questions and going from there .
“ We talked a bit more about specific economics ; the main lecture was a little more general , ” Wu said , saying that they discussed the math of economics more in detail at the luncheon .
They spoke at length about international trade theory , the field in which Krugman received his Nobel Prize , as well as some of his academic work .
Krugman ’s talk is available online at the UEA website , http://web.mit.edu/uea/www.

I can't believe how many people I meet who do n't like mushrooms .
Mushrooms have a great earthy , meaty taste .
If prepared right , there 's nothing quite like them .
Mushrooms are universally low in calories , and research is starting to suggest that they both prevent and treat various diseases .
Today I paired some cremini mushrooms with winter herbs from my garden .
Fresh herbs like rosemary , sage , and thyme really complement mushrooms well .
This recipe is best with a homemade vegetable stock , but it 's still very good with vegetable stock powder mixed with water .
Herbed Winter Mushrooms ( vegan & gluten free )
Serves 1 - 2
12 cremini or button mushroom caps
2 sprigs rosemary
2 sprigs thyme
1 large sage leaf
1/2 cup vegetable broth
Place all the ingredients in a small sauce pan .
Cook on medium - high , stirring occasionally until the water is almost evaporated .
Once there is hardly any water left , stir constantly until all the water is evaporated .
Serve immediately .
Variations : Experiment with different types of mushrooms for this dish .
Consider using wine instead of vegetable stock .
Add some sliced shallot or garlic .

To the shock of his parents , 3 - year - old , Teddy Ruxpin , announced , " I hate Jesus ! " after his little kitten died on Wednesday morning .
The boy was immediately rushed to the Landover Baptist " Christian Crisis Center " where he was prayed over and slapped about the face for nearly 12 hours .
Concerned pastors were appalled when the child refused to budge in his admonition .
" I still hate Jesus ! " he announced .
" And I hate all of you , and I wish everyone was dead ! "
In fear of losing their church membership , Teddy 's mother and father resorted to drastic measures that evening .
" We locked him in a closet for the whole night , " Mrs. Ruxpin said .
" We told him , ' Teddy !
you are not coming out of that closet until you tell us that you love Jesus ! ' "
Mrs. Ruxpin reported that her child became abusive at that point , screaming through the closet wall like a limp - wristed nancy boy , telling his parents that they were a bunch of " ( unChristian word ) holes . "
The following day , little Teddy met with Christian child psychiatrist , Pastor Horace Wilkins .
It took the reverend five minutes to diagnose the child .
" It 's demons , " he concluded .
" A whole mess of 'em , just runnin ' around in that little boy 's head .
You need to get him out of my office , RIGHT NOW !
He do n't need no psychiatrist !
He needs an exorcist ! "
An exorcism was arranged immediately .
Teddy was tied to a bed and beaten across the back of his thighs with a bull whip as a last ditch effort to see if it was really demons that had gotten hold of him .
With each beating , the child yelled out , " I hate you ! "
Those present were absolutely convinced that the demons inside the child were talking to Jesus !
They stopped the beatings after several hours and began the exorcism .
For nearly five days , the pastors labored over the boy 's soul .
They used boiling water and copper wires on his tiny privates .
" We know where the Devil lives , " said one pastor .
" It does n't take a degree in Demonology to know what Satan fancies . "
Hours later , the pastors began to realize that they were dealing with more than one demon .
They had exhausted all of the power in the electric generator .
The next step was to hang the boy from his toes and deprive him of food and drink .
Pastor Deacon
Fred recalls , " We read scripture for 48 hours , screaming it over the poor boy 's cries of ' I hate you !
I hate you ! ' "
It was all to no avail .
The demons refused to budge .
The filthy child was given one last chance at the end .
" We are going to give you one more chance to say you love Jesus or we are going to ship you off to North Dakota to the Landover Baptist Home for the Demonically Possessed ! " the pastors yelled .
The child only responded with pitiful demonic moans and blasphemous whispers .
" I hate you ... " he moaned , " I hate you ... and I wish you were all dead ... "
The next day , the boy was caged up and put on a church bus headed to North Dakota .
" Lord knows we tried , " Pastor Deacon Fred told Teddy 's parents .
" It breaks my heart to have to ask you folks to leave , but we cannot take any chances with this little boy 's immediate family .
You folks could be demon magnets . "
Teddy 's parents had two hours to pack up their belongings and vacate church property .
" We do n't know where the Ruxpins might go , " Deacon Fred related .
" All we know is that this church is demon free !
Always has been , always will be . "

Stanford 's Hank Greely puts neuroscience on trial
Although MRI scans showing a malfunctioning brain could conjure empathy and a finding of innocence for a criminal defendant , they might just as well lead jurors and judges to opt for convictions and long sentences , the law professor says .
L.A. Cicero Stanford law professor Hank Greely
A lawyer is trying to convince a jury that his client really is crazy .
It 's usually a tough argument to sell in a court of law .
But what if the lawyer has a picture of his client 's brain that shows there 's something biologically wrong with it ?
Can that evidence help persuade a jury ?
Should it even be allowed as evidence ?
Those are some of the questions addressed during a presentation and mock trial Feb. 20 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) in San Diego .
Hank Greely , a Stanford law professor and expert on the legal , ethical and social issues surrounding the biosciences , took on the role of prosecutor during a presentation titled " The Brain on Trial : Neuroscience Evidence in the Courtroom . "
" The prosecutor 's typical position is that brain scan evidence should n't be used because they say it's not scientifically useful , " Greely said .
" They say it will confuse the jury , that it 's not relevant , that the technology is n't good enough yet .
But most of all , they 'll say that 's fine that you found this person has an abnormal brain – but how many other people have similar abnormalities and do n't commit crimes ?
The answer will be : quite a few . "
With no hard - and - fast rules on whether neuroscience evidence should be allowed in state and federal courts , Greely is studying criminal cases in California that have featured brain scan images to help prove guilt or maintain innocence .
He 's so far found that defense attorneys are more likely than prosecutors to try using neuroscience evidence , but he cautions that the tool is a double - edged sword .
While an MRI result showing a deformed or malfunctioning brain could conjure empathy and a finding of innocence , it could also lead jurors and judges to opt for convictions and long sentences based on the assumption that such a damaged mind will only convince the person using it to offend again .
" Neuroscience evidence will probably mostly be used alongside behavioral evidence , " Greely said .
" There will always be behavioral evidence to show a defendant was crazy as a loon .
Neuroscience will be able to further hammer home the idea that the person truly has a problem . "

The fiscal year ended on October 1 , and we can say with certainty that 2009 ’s budget deficit was the largest since World War II , approaching one - tenth the size of the entire U.S. economy .
Since we have now the benefit of specific data from the full fiscal year , we can also get a better sense of what actually produced that record high deficit .
The main culprits might not be who you expected .
For instance , it turns out that a massive decline in tax revenues had as much to do with the ballooning deficit as any increase in spending .
And you might also be surprised to find out that the vast majority of new spending in fiscal year 2009 was actually committed before President Obama even took office .
Taking a closer look at both sides of the 2009 balance sheet reveals some important lessons as we face our fiscal future .
Considering all the claims about an “ Obama spending spree ” it is important to begin by looking at exactly how much money the government spent in FY09 .
It ’s true that spending in 2009 was much higher than it was the previous fiscal year , by about $ 602 billion , excluding payments on the national debt ( which actually declined in 2009 because of low interest rates ) .
But it turns out that a huge chunk of that increase actually happened before President Obama took office .
In fact , fully 41 percent , or $ 245 billion , came in the form of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the rescues of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , actions taken in the fall of 2008 under President George W. Bush .
In other words , before President Obama had even taken office , federal spending was already up by about 9 percent over fiscal year 2008 levels .
So the other $ 350 billion must be that spending spree we ’ve been hearing so much about , right ?
Not exactly .
Another 18 percent of the spending increase came not from President Obama ’s pen , but from growth in mandatory programs set in place many years prior to his presidency .
Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid , for example , cost the government $ 110 billion more in 2009 than they did in 2008 .
These cost increases were n’t the result of policy changes made by President Obama — they stem from longstanding demographic trends and the ever - increasing costs of health care .
Of course , the president did take action to address the most expensive portion of this increase — the rising cost of Medicare and Medicaid — by pushing comprehensive health reform .
Such reform is absolutely necessary to rein in these costs , but something that complicated was n’t going to happen in time to affect the 2009 fiscal year that was already 112 days old when the president took office .
Besides Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security , the other major jump in mandatory spending was in unemployment benefits , which shot up by $ 51 billion — an 8 percent increase in total spending — with millions of people looking for work .
So where does the big stimulus bill fits into all of this ?
Unlike TARP or Social Security , stimulus spending is definitely the work of this president and this Congress , right ?
And did n’t it cost $ 787 billion ?
Yes , except that about one - third of the stimulus bill was n’t spending at all — it was tax cuts ( we ’ll get to the tax side of the equation in a minute ) .
Also , the spending in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , which has already saved or created more than 600,000 jobs , was spaced out over two full years , only seven months of which was in fiscal year 2009 .
As a result , only about 18 percent of the new spending , or $ 108 billion , came from ARRA , all of which is temporary .
In short , of the $ 602 billion increase , more than 40 percent was actually passed under President Bush , another 26 percent was automatic spending to pay for mandatory programs set in place long ago , and only 20 percent was for the president ’s Recovery Act , measures that are helping the economy back to its feet .
Not exactly the huge Obama expansion of government that some have been railing against .
Turning our attention to the other side of the balance sheet reveals another surprising fact :
The great deficit of 2009 was the result not just of increased spending , but also of dramatically lower tax revenues .
In 2009 , federal receipts were $ 419 billion below 2008 levels , a 17 percent drop , which was the largest decline from one year to the next in more than 70 years .
Individual income tax receipts decreased by 20 percent , and corporate income tax revenues plummeted by more than 54 percent , which means corporations paid less than half in taxes than they paid the year before .
Of course , the main culprit here is the economic recession .
Corporations paid lower taxes because they made lower profits .
Individuals paid less in taxes because they lost their jobs , did n’t get raises , and did n’t make as much on their investments .
The tax cuts directed at both families and businesses passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act had a part to play here as well — about 15 percent of the decline in tax revenues can be attributed to provisions in ARRA — but the overall trend was driven primarily by the weak economy .
This part of the story , that the deficit was the result of a huge decline in tax revenues just as much as it was driven by increased spending , does n’t get nearly the amount of attention it deserves .
After all , tax revenues were down by just about as much spending was up — a drop of 17 percent versus an increase of 18 percent , respectively .
In fact , as a share of the economy , total tax revenues in 2009 were at their lowest levels since 1950 : just 14.8 percent of GDP and way below the historic average .
Indeed , it ’s worth noting that the overall decline in tax revenues was more than four times as large as the total increase in spending that came out of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
Fiscal year 2009 is officially behind us and so is its record high deficit .
But with the economy still weak and more effort needed to create jobs , the deficit in 2010 is likely to be only slightly smaller .
This is necessary as deficit spending is critical to get us out of the Great Recession .
The real fiscal problem we face is our long - term budget gap , not the deficit this year or next year .
That wo n’t stop some people from claiming the sky is falling right now , but before we allow ourselves to get worked up into a frenzy of fiscal fear , we would do well to remember the lessons of 2009 .
First , beware those claiming an “ explosion in government spending ” because their claims are n’t backed up by the data .
Second , do n’t forget about the tax side of the balance sheet .

B : " The first piece of heavy artillery across the Rhine River was hauled by the tractor I drove .
That was a 155 mm and it came across a pontoon bridge under very little fire .
In fact the only firing that came my way was from a machine gun and that was quickly knocked out .
I did the same work all through four campaigns and was in the line of fire a lot of times , but never had any real close ones until one day while travelling along the Autobahn .
I got strafed by a plane that time and those bullets landed all around me , but I got away all right by diving in a ditch on the side of the road .
That one was too close for comfort . " [ click image to enlarge ]

I did that kind of work through 4 campaigns and was always far enough in the rear so that it seemed like an ordinary day 's work .
But I got one of the best deals of all later on when I was put in charge of the guard over 500 Polish WACs who had been captured by the Germans and released by the Americans .
The guard was placed there to keep the GI wolves away and it was a tough job as those guys tried all kinds of tricks to get near them .
Still it was interesting and funny too .

Version 0.12.0 of gevent has been released on PyPI .
Install it with
easy_install - U gevent
The major new feature is a gevent.ssl module , that provides cooperative implementation of the standard ssl module .
It does not require any additional extensions on Python ≥ 2.6 .
It also works on 2.4 and 2.5 if ssl package is installed .
The old , PyOpenSSL - based implementation of SSL objects is still available , but the new version is the preferred way now .
The library now compiles and passes most of the relevant tests on Windows .
It ’s still has a few rough edges ( e.g. Ctrl - C is not working ) , so it should be considered experimental .
The socket object gained some performance improvements as well as a number of bugfixes .
Several incompatibilities of wsgi module with the WSGI spec have been fixed .

If you think the Fed is a contrarian indicator , your hair may be standing straight up after you read this : James Bullard a voting member of the Fed says US deflation no longer seen as a risk .
The US has escaped the danger of a Japanese - style deflationary trap , according to James Bullard , a voting member of the Federal Reserve ’s key policy - setting committee .
Mr Bullard , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis , told the Financial Times in an interview that his preoccupation throughout 2009 had been deflation , but the risk had “ passed ” .
Last week ’s
Fed meeting produced a dissenting vote for the first time in a year when Thomas Hoenig , president of the Kansas City Fed and a rate hawk , argued that financial conditions no longer warranted a policy of holding rates at “ exceptionally low levels . . . for an extended period ” .
Mr Bullard , who is considered a centrist member of the FOMC , said he was happy to continue with the current guidance , but he did have some sympathy for Mr Hoenig ’s argument that “ if you come off zero and you move up a little bit , it ’s still a very easy policy .
You ’ve still got a very large balance sheet and you ’re still at very low interest rates . ”
The broader post - crisis economy was “ on track ” with its recovery , he said .
“ It ’s not a real strong recovery but that ’s what we had predicted anyway .
But it will be above - average growth for the first half of 2010 and we ’ll probably see some positive jobs growth in the first part of 2010 here . ”
When the Fed does come to raise rates it may have to switch from its traditional benchmark of targeting the federal funds rate to targeting a repurchase rate because of the upheaval in the two markets over the last two years .
So , small confession , and a bit of history .
I actually wrote this code about three years ago , over a couple evenings , in a hotel in New Delhi .
It was the seed of the whole project actually , after a colleague told me he ’d write tic - tac - toe to learn a new language .
So , impressions .
After I wrote this , I started acutely noticing the absence of type inference and , especially , pattern matching in the rest of my life .
It pushes your thinking to the start of the project in a very elegant and rewarding way .
The win-condition code especially drove this home , because even though it was a bit more verbose than other methods , it was easy to make patterns that obviously , visually depicted what I was trying to do .
I did spend a fair bit of time fighting with the compiler , but by the time I satisfied it , damned if the thing did n’t just work on the first try .
( I had that impression coming to Java from C many years ago , so who can say if that means anything … )
I can also imagine working against some deadline and having the language force me into doing things The Right Way instead of the expedient , hacky , get - it - done - NOW way being pretty frustrating .
Does the extra discipline mean you find yourself in those kinds of predicaments less often ?
Would love to hear from a real Ocamler on the subject .
As my computer languages professor said about SML , “ its concrete syntax is not the most attractive . ”
I actually kind of like how it flows on the screen , but figuring out the rules about when expressions terminate , and when to use “ ; ; ” and did involve some head - scratching .

OTTAWA – Stung by public criticism that they put Parliament on an extended Christmas break , the federal Conservatives want to cancel week - long breaks in March and around Easter , saying that MPs have a “ lot of work to do . ”
Government Whip Gordon O’Connor warned Tory MPs Wednesday to “ arrange your schedules accordingly ” as the government made plans to sit through scheduled breaks the weeks of March 15 and April 12 .
The change in plans could mean that the Conservatives are feeling the heat from the public outcry over Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s New Year ’s Eve move to prorogue Parliament and delay its return to March 3 , instead of Jan. 25 .
O’Connor sent a note to Tory MPs warning that the House of Commons will likely sit during those weeks .
“ The purpose of prorogation is to allow time to prepare for a new Throne Speech and budget , not to reduce the amount of time that the House sits , ” he wrote in his note .
“ Once Parliament resumes there will be a lot of work to do , ” O’Connor said .
Prorogation has proven controversial and even unpopular for the Conservatives , who have seen their popularity sag in the weeks since .
Several weeks ago , thousands of protesters gathered in cities across Canada to voice their unhappiness at the fact that Parliament was not sitting .
But because any change to the parliamentary calendar requires the consent of other parties , the proposed new schedule could also be a challenge for the Liberals and the NDP .
While changes to the parliamentary calendar require the blessing of other parties , O’Connor said , “ there is no reason for the House of Commons to take constituency breaks during these weeks .
Quite frankly , we would be surprised if the Opposition disagreed .
After hearing the news , the NDP argued that the House of Commons should resume sitting immediately .
“ Instead of playing silly games , the PM should recall Parliament right away to deal with all the important issues facing Canadians , ” said Karl Belanger , spokesperson for NDP Leader Jack Layton .
Liberal House Leader Ralph Goodale mocked the Conservatives ’ sudden change of heart from demanding time to “ recalibrate ” to now wanting to toil straight through .
“ It ’s clearly a government in full panic mode . . . trying to scramble out of a mess they created , ” Goodale said in an interview Wednesday night .

He said the Liberals , who have remained in Ottawa holding public roundtable discussions on issues of the day , would entertain any “ serious proposition ” from the Conservatives .
“ We ’ve been here all the time . . .
They ’re the ones who took the holiday , not us , ” he said .

However beautiful the shinogi line of a charcoal - forged Santoku , and no matter how solidly made the vintage steel of a French chef 's knife , I have to admit that after years of collecting the world 's finest knives I have settled on one that has more in common with the knives found in the average American 's kitchen .
I prefer a cheap , solid , stainless steel knife .
Some of the best can be picked up at a kitchenware or restaurant supply shop for well under 40 dollars .
Brands that work well at this price are F. Dick , Victorinox , and LamsonSharp .
Plastic or wood is a matter of personal preference , but I pay the premium for a wood handle and then promptly scrub the finish off the wood .
Why , you might ask ?
Simple : fat .
I will sometimes spend a solid hour breaking down carcasses , and , after a while , that animal fat renders a knife with a plastic handle as slippery as a live eel .
Wood , on the other hand , absorbs the fat , ensuring that the all - important grip is maintained .
More on this later when we get to the " ways to horribly wound yourself " section .
Keeping it sharp , one of the keys to not cutting yourself :
In this age of the Internet I wo n't bore you with sharpening techniques .
To be perfectly honest , I do n't even sharpen my own knives anymore .
I leave that to Mr. Robert Ambrosi of Ambrosi Cutlery , and I recommend you outsource your knife sharpening as well unless you are looking for a new hobby .
If your knife is made of the tough and cheap type of stainless steel you will never get it as sharp as the guy at your local housewares shop .
High - end Japanese and carbon steel can be made especially deadly , but you have to know what you 're doing .
Keep your eyes on the prize : keeping it sharp , which brings us to the matter of the sharpening steel .
Learning to use a steel properly is far more important than spending the better part of a night laboring over the whetstone .
There are as many YouTube videos and online guides to using a steel as there are stars in the sky , but the key is to do it lightly .
By using a steel , you 're attempting to realign a few molecules of steel back into a cutting edge ; heavy pressure will only lead to a truly dull blade .
Cutting yourself :
I am an expert .
I have sliced off thumb tips and fingernails .
I have shaved paper - thin wafers of my knuckle and buried a breaking / cimeter knife an inch and a half into my forearm .
If it were n't for the stainless steel chainmail " butcher bra " that Josh from Fleisher 's bought me for Christmas last year , I might not be alive to write this essay , having perhaps bled out from one of the many horrible chest wounds averted by its Mithril magic .
The most important thing when it comes to cutting yourself ( or avoiding it ) is awareness of where you and the cutting edge of your blade are in relation to each other .
This is not such a big deal for a home cook slicing vegetables , but for a butcher it becomes a matter of life and death .

I would suggest checking out the Java Content Repository API .
While it has n't been adopted to the level I was hoping , for example EMC Documentum does n't support it at all ; content repositories are an effective abstraction above databases that add valuable services like APIs for versioning of data ; metadata ; transactions ; observation of changes in data ; and import or export of data to XML in a standard way .

in response to Douglas Allen " The main goal being that they will be collapsing Sun software technology into their current software stack where it makes sense , and to push conflicting Sun Software products such as Glassfish down to a role of being used for non-mission critical department apps . "
I guess there goes the clustering and the general excellence that I 've enjoyed with Glassfish over the past few years .

This would be a really good time for IBM or Google to move in with their own standardized open source J2EE stack based on JCP standards and existing reference implementations .
Just like IBM did with Eclipse , they could change the game here .
I think a lot people will feel more comfortable with IBM , and certainly Google , than with Oracle .
Hard nosed business does n't always mix so well with open source .
This whole idea of just supporting the big iron makes me shiver .
I mean , I 'm just curious , for the average J2EE implementation , who has ( ever ) used Oracle software ( excluding SUN obviously ) ?

No offense , but I see the CE version as a big waste of time for IBM .
I think it would have been much more thoughtful to have OS'd the core of WAS way back when , and competed through non-OS parts that they wanted to charge for .
I 'm sure one reference customers that use it , but I have n't seen or heard of one myself ( perhaps I 'm in a cave ) .
Personally , I 'd love to be able to work in a place that forces ( for lack of a better word ) the use of big vendor products and have the same experience of shooting up Glass Fish v3 in 1/2 second ( actually 483 ms ) on my underpowered laptop instead of getting up to get a cup of coffee and stir in the sugar , and check email , and .... then check to see if code is committed yet .. back to email ...etc.etc .
I 'd give CE more of a chance if it was actually the base to the pay for WAS product ( which I do n't think it is , but please correct me if I 'm wrong ) .

Time to Start Porting ( Java EE to Sping ) ?

in response to Douglas Allen I 've been a firm Java EE follower for quite a while now , however , there have been quite a number of occasions that I found myself picking up bits and pieces of open source software to get a couple of things done that may not be elegantly covered in the Java EE stack .
So while the projects started out as honest to goodness standard by the book Java EE projects , things like iBatis , Quartz , Struts , and Jakarata Commons , were being " sprinkled " here and there throughout the projects .
Now as of late , I 've been doing a lot of work with Wicket , including JPA , and EJB 3.x .
So while I want to support the Java EE standard initiative , I recently began to ask myself , " if I keep using these open source techs , what 's really left in the Java EE standard to keep hanging on to for me to continue deploying my apps to a standard Java EE app server ? "
The only answer I came up with was EJB 3.x , and maybe CDI .
However , the takeover of Sun by Oracle , has now left me really wondering if the economics of the Java EE Application server will make sense for webscale projects going forward ?
Many developers will expend a lot of time on various threads on the web arguing about the functional / performance attributes of Websphere vs Weblogic vs Glassfish vs Tomcat vs whatever , but for me , I 'm wondering if we as developers have thrown economics and common sense out the window .
The reality is that these application servers do n't come cheap , and unless you work at a company where money does n't matter , breakout companies like a Google , or Facebook , and other great start - ups currently in the dark looking to bust out , surely could n't have taken the initial road of saying , " lets build everything on Weblogic , Websphere , and Oracle . "
That just would n't make economic sense for companies looking to build web - scale sized projects .
I mean , recently Facebook donated a whole US$ 100 K to the Apache Software Foundation saying how they could n't have done it without them - and I 'm sure there are many more companies like that .
So , if Facebook , Google , Yahoo , and others are doing open source , why not join the party I say ?
Heck , just two days ago I decided on really looking at Spring , and you know what ?... I love it already , even though I 'm just a couple a chapters through the Spring Recipes book .
That 's why I do n't like to join the technology bashing game when it makes no real comparison on price , functionality , and performance .
So after I 'm done learning Spring , it looks as if I can finally cut the Java EE umbilical cord , and port the current Java EE app I 'm working on over to a Wicket +
Spring + Jetty / Tomcat + MySQL / PostgreSQL stack .
If I 'm going bananas here , I would love for someone to point out where I 'm going wrong with this decision ?
And I 'm not looking for people to say vague things like " Weblogic is faster than Jetty , " or " Java EE is a standard and Spring and Wicket are not , " type of arguments .
As far as I see it , it is becoming clear to me that the label of Java EE being a standard is becoming harder to sell even though the latest Java EE 6 implementation looks functionally good .
The only standard seems to really be , what people want , and I want good , affordable , well supported , well documented , portable , and interoperable components that work and scale well together .
From where I sit , it seems that things like Apache Software Foundation is the real standard .

in response to Douglas Allen One thing Oracle has always been good at is , " killing products " .
Sometimes they kill good products , but more often they have managed more successful acquisitions and killed bad products .
I would be happy to see Glassfish out of the way from JEE .
It is an useless crap alive only to try out sample apps whenever new JEE spec comes out .
Once you have other app servers compliant with new spec , no one touches Glassfish .
Oracle will kill Netbeans eventually and follow Eclipse more strongly .
Oracle and Weblogic had tried their best earlier with their own IDE and failed miserably .
Netbeans is not a great product to bet on to compete against Eclipse .
MySQL may find its place in open source world with no commitment from Oracle in few years and developed purely open source .
Eclipse was started by IBM , but now it is on its own with many vendors sponsoring and supporting it .
Hopefully MySQL follows same path .
MySQL is used extensively by big companies and they will not let it die so easily .
If MySQL cannot come out of Oracle control , you will see most companies planning exit strategy to move away to another opensource DB ( may be Progresql . . )

in response to A D
The issue is that before this , Sun was committed to making Glassfish an " enterprise " class and capable app server .
It was designed , polished , and promoted to compete with the like the of Weblogic and WebSphere .
How well it accomplished that is a matter for debate , but the intent was clear that this was the direction they wanted to go .
The way it sounds now is that Glassfish will be downgraded to a " reference implementation " .
Any " cross BEA and Glassfish DNA " will likely ensuring that Weblogic can run Glassfish application with minimal changes , plus taking any technology out of the Glassfish that Weblogic needs ( notably JEE 6 tech ) and incorporating it in to Weblogic .
I do n't see any indication of motivation from Oracle to push tech down from Weblogic in to Glassfish , to promote or ensure that Glassfish is " enterprise class " , or to even support it at that level .
Rather they 'll likely create as " painless " an upgrade path to move applications from GF to WLS , and upsell WLS to clients to solve " big problems " rather than improve GF to meet those needs .
" Glassfish is for departmental servers , you need WLS for ' the enterprise ' . "
This is basically a golden opportunity for RedHat / JBoss to step up , because it 's primary OSS JEE app server competitor is going to have it 's reigns pulled back stopped in its tracks .
I also question if there will ever be a " JEE 7 " .
I have n't seen anything from Oracle that suggests they 'll be pushing for a new specification , particularly if they think they 'll be on the hook for implementing the reference platform for it .
Rather , they 'll just " featurize " their existing products to distinguish their servers from their competitors .
Basically , I fear that the app server market is going to fragment at this point , with the common core at JEE 6 ( once others get up to speed ) .
The bright side , is that if this happens , it happens at JEE 6 rather than 5 , but the dark side is considering what nice improvements were made between JEE 5 and JEE 6 , who knows what will be lost if there is no JEE 7 .

@ Will Harthung
I agree with everything you have said here , and yes , some of these speculations were also confirmed by Oracle as their future plans .
The plus side to all of this I hope , is that the JRockit deterministic JVM GC capabilities are as good as they say in regards to their plans to mix JRockit JVM features with those of the Hotspot JVM to get one unified JVM having all the best features from both - i.e. Oracle JVM .
I will concede though that Oracle like any other business in this situation has to somehow consume , digest , and produce a common technology platform set to support .
It might not be business feasible for them to be supporting everything from Sun as is with their already existing and overlapping technologies , that according to them is already making good money for them - hence , somethings will have to be either put on the chopping block or assimilated into Oracle 's technology portfolio over the short to medium term .
I will miss Glassfish for sure .
Peace .

Red Hat Indeed .
This is a pleasant exercise for the combined JRockit and HotSpot teams :-)
If you have followed the public announcement you already know that our plan is to carry both forward and merge the technologies over the long term .
The exact method and timeframe is not clear yet .
These are early days and we need to get the development teams time to do the due diligience - the code bases are quite different and both have strong and weak points .
Luckily , our new ex-Sun colleagues have experience in merging code bases from previous acquisitions .
OpenJDK will remain the single open source Java and JVM implementation that Oracle contributes to .
Open sourcing the current JRockit code base simply does not make sense .
Better focus our efforts on the future unified offering which will be a merge of some kind between the two technologies .
Another thing worth mentioning here is that some features in JRockit do not make sense as part of an open source JVM .
One example is integration with the Fusion Middleware logging infrastructure - definitely not of interest outside of an Oracle context .
The open source codebase should not be polluted by such proprietary extensions .
I do n't have an answer to how to accomplish this yet , but it 's possible that the modularity work in JDK7 can help .
I fully understand that the community is anxious to know the details of where this is heading but I must plead for patience .
Our clear goal is to keep Java strong and vibrant for the benefit of Oracle , our customers , partners and the community ( including our esteemed competitors ) .
The role of steward of the Java community and provider of the reference implementation is new to us and we do n't want to upset anyone by rocking the boat .

The way it sounds now is that Glassfish will be downgraded to a " reference implementation " .
I think you are reading too much into this and it is understandable if you feel strongly about Glass Fish .
The fact at the moment is that nothing has changed or likely to change in the near future .
Glass
Fish simply has too much traction for the pretty smart Oracle folks to do something stupid here and Oracle can easily support two product lines that do n't really compete directly .
I think you guys should give Cameron 's post a close look in this regard and respect the fact that he probably can't overstep his personal boundaries either .
In the highly unlikely scenario that Oracle does really do something stupid , folks like us or JBoss are no dummies and can easily fill any gap in the market .
I also question if there will ever be a " JEE 7 " .
I can pretty much guarantee you are dead wrong on this one .
Oracle has every intention of continuing Java SE , Java EE and Java ME .
No matter how pessimistic of a mood you guys are in at the moment , the simple fact is that Oracle just made a gigantic investment in Java and they would maximize those investments , not do things to reduce their ROI .
The only thing that endangers Java is willy - nilly making these kind of statements that really do n't have much basis in fact :-) .
That 's as far as I can go on this .
What you choose to believe after that is really up to you .
After all , you can't make someone believe there is no bogey man hiding in the closet if you are dead - set in believing that there is :-) .
Maybe the Oracle guys will think it is worth it to go a step further and keep the line of communication wide open and minimize rumors / speculation the best they can considering the size of the company and the long chain - of - command .
Hope it helps guys , Reza Will / Douglas , Hopefully , you guys know by now that I do n't say nonsense that I do n't believe in ( at the end of the day , the truth is that I really have no a reason to ) .
Here is what I can say without overstepping my personal boundaries and jeopardizing hard - earned relationships : I think you are reading too much into this and it is understandable if you feel strongly about Glass Fish .

Fish simply has too much traction for the pretty smart Oracle folks to do something stupid here and Oracle can easily support two product lines that do n't really compete directly .
I think you guys should give Cameron 's post a close look in this regard and respect the fact that he probably can't overstep his personal boundaries either .
In the highly unlikely scenario that Oracle does really do something stupid , folks like us or JBoss are no dummies and can easily fill any gap in the market .
I can pretty much guarantee you are dead wrong on this one .
Oracle has every intention of continuing Java SE , Java EE and Java ME .
No matter how pessimistic of a mood you guys are in at the moment , the simple fact is that Oracle just made a gigantic investment in Java and they would maximize those investments , not do things to reduce their ROI .
The only thing that endangers Java is willy - nilly making these kind of statements that really do n't have much basis in fact :-) .
That 's as far as I can go on this .
What you choose to believe after that is really up to you .
After all , you can't make someone believe there is no bogey man hiding in the closet if you are dead - set in believing that there is :-) .
Maybe the Oracle guys will think it is worth it to go a step further and keep the line of communication wide open and minimize rumors / speculation the best they can considering the size of the company and the long chain - of - command .

You may well be better informed with your place in the industry , I am but a casual outside observer .
I 've always considered GF a competitor to WLS .
Arguably it was more competition to JBoss , that 's valid , but it certainly competed with WLS on the low end , and strived to make a dent on the high end .
There was even marketing materials and benchmarks contrasting GF with WLS in terms of a " value " solution .
From the SPEC marks , WLS appears to be the fastest , per instance , on really high end hardware , but it also seemed that GF compared favorably .
If you were stuck on a small amount of large machines , WLS performed very well .
But if you were willing ( and able , given application design ) to throw cores at the problem , GF scaled pretty good .
While GF may not have been able to take WLS on the top and , the bulk of the app server market is n't at that level ( at least in terms of number of instances / licenses , perhaps the top tier is there in terms of revenue ) .
So , I have always considered GF a competitor to WLS , as it offered the licensing value and options of JBoss ( i.e. free if you want , cheaper if you want support ) , with the ease of use , and polish of WLS ( arguably GF is easier to use , but I have n't used WLS in some time ) with " performance enough " for many applications .
That said , it is hard to imagine Oracle putting the time and money into making GF even more enterprise level , to be even more competitive at the top end .
I 'm not doubting Oracles vision or commitment , I just see GF , for the most part , redundant in their line up .
Make migration from GF to WLS as painless as possible ( native support for sun-web.xml , along with an appropriate class loader model is a good start , letting many GF apps simply deploy ) and slowly phase it out or leveraged solely as a reference platform .
It is reassuring that you feel they are committed to the JEE as an industry standard , and to its improvement .

This is indeed fact and has been fact for as long as the acquisition has been on the table .
If this is what you are wishing for , I agree that is not going to happen now ( the same , BTW , is true for MySQL vs. Oracle DB ) .
That does n't mean Glass Fish is not valuable as a community outreach / R&D tool for Oracle that has decent licensing revenue on its own , meets mid-market needs and will likely result in up - sell customers .
All these factors mean that it will be a bit more than " just a reference implementation " - meaning likely continuing to have clustering , load - balancing , management , etc .
If you sincerely mean Glass Fish well , selling Oracle short is the wrong thing to be doing at the moment , especially if it is based on shallow stereotypes / ignorance .
Oracle is exactly the right company for taking the helm of Java at this point .
From where I stand , their hard - nosed , no - nonsense approach to things is a lot better than Sun 's constant struggle to find business chops / make the tough decisions and they are far more progressive and open than some other large companies that would have been likely candidates for an acquisition of this magnitude .
From a personal standpoint , their track record at the JCP makes them great partners for some of the changes we need to be making to Java EE in the next coming years and I look forward to working with them for that reason alone if not anything else .
They have certainly helped make decisions that are pretty community oriented , much more so than some of the people / organizations that you might believe to be community oriented .
As far as stuff that 's generally visible , Cameron mentioned some of those .

in response to Reza Rahman Something that our marketing folks did not put on the page but is clearly stated in Hasan Rizvi 's broadcast around 8:25 in voice and slideware is the additional statement of : " Glass Fish also available as a standalone offering " - that is to be read that as independent of the commercial packaging with WebLogic Server .
It is also , perhaps more important , to remind everyone that the Glass Fish community / implementation remains open source - there is no change in the Glass Fish project per the various commitments you can see on the Oracle sites .
The software remains in open source , downloadable and usable as pure open source software independent of commercial licensing .
Folks like Eduardo Pelegri -Liopart and team still are the voice and conscience that will drive Oracle 's plans around GlassFish and work with the community to shape the Glass Fish implementation .
Eduardo's summary post today gives related links :
http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/summary_of_post_oracle_changes
Clearly as Oracle we made a very large commitment to WebLogic Server underpinning Fusion Applications and Fusion Middleware and executed on that over the last 18 months with the delivery of Fusion Middleware 11g .
Adding GlassFish to the portfolio enables our customers to take advantage of capabilities in Glass Fish as they see fit for Java applications .
Frankly we have a fair number of customers who use both and that is a good thing .
Interestingly , with Glass Fish being the only production quality Java EE 6 implementation on the market is a great example where the open source community using Glass Fish and anyone else including Oracle customers can take advantage of production quality software that is standards compliant with the latest innovations * now * ( for example the Web profile being an important one for many folks to try out and get their heads around in practice ) .
Further as we articulated at Open World this year we also are very much pursuing Java EE 6 on WebLogic Server as well and have further incentive to do so given Oracle 's increased role in the Java community .
I look forward to IBM and JBoss stepping up to their formal roadmaps around Java EE 6 to so that we continue to have a strong competitive ecosystem around Java EE ( as JBoss did a week or so ago ) .
We want to go head to head with other servers - you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to see where the servers differ and are stronger / weaker than one another and having choice is a good thing .
Lastly , at Oracle , as hardhearted as folks may think we are , there is an equal commitment during acquisitions to preserve customer 's existing investments in software and either carry forward that commitment or provide a clear transition path .
Sometimes those decisions can be painful but on the positive side we tend to be pretty clear about them and provide the roadmap with pretty reasonable support timelines for those transitions .
As Reza notes from the oracle.com pages and Hasan 's broadcast that carry forward commitment is pretty public in the case of GlassFish Server and Sun Java System Web Server - the product ( current and old versions ) continue and existing customers will be supported , it remains available standalone as well as in new packages that provide the option to use WebLogic .
We are very excited to have Glass Fish on board at Oracle .
Areas like GlassFish proper and key constituent pieces like Metro , Grizzly , Jersey etc are state of the art ; there is huge incentive to shepherd them correctly .
You will have to judge us on how we execute over the next few months while we realign roadmaps and delivery schedules but I hope we can surprise folks with some good turns we can do as a combined company .
Mike .

Keeping in mind that the following is my opinion only ( as I do not work directly on WLS or Glassfish ) : Glassfish is an extremely effective JBoss competitor in the market , judging both by download statistics and market penetration , so I would guess ( and hope ) that Oracle will find a way to continue to grow it .

While I 'm certainly not in the business of defending Sun / Oracle ( they should be doing a much better job at that themselves with their deep pockets and not simply assume some high - level web presentations are sufficient in addressing people 's real concerns :-) ) , I see this kind of statements as way too speculative / sentimental / reactionary and is likely the wrong predictions by all signs that I can see and have known about for quite some time now .
In fact , it seems to me that Oracle is committed to supporting NetBeans , GlassFish and MySQL without sacrificing their " bread - and - butter " large enterprise market .
I certainly have nothing but respect for the folks that I know personally at Oracle as outstanding , progressive , grounded and open - minded engineering professionals .

in response to Richard Livingstone " It is an useless crap alive only to try out sample apps whenever new JEE spec comes out "
It 's absolutely not true that Glassfish is n't and can't be used for anything other than playtime apps .
We use it for a high volume telephone vote system capable of handling 32 K votes per second and it works damned well .
We built our system around 64 bit Linux , Glassfish , Wicket , MySQL and J2EE 1.6 ( Jrockit 64 bit ) and it goes like a ( J ) rocket .
http://www.clickvision.co.uk/
if you 're interested ...
Just to add to this , we 've used the system to run the Comres opinion polling for the British election leadership debates for the past 3 weeks ( including tonight 's , which is on at the moment ) .
Glassfish has so far performed very well and managed , on commodity hardware , a callout to several thousand of the public , the management and appropriate weighting of the results and the publication of the collated results for the ITN News .
All this within 2 minutes .
Not bad for useless crap .

in response to gopi mr I 'll have to chime in with the others and heartily reject your notion that Glassfish is crap .
It was solid at version 1.0 and has been getting better with each release .
Much easier to get up and running than JBoss , much more natural to configure than Weblogic , a really nice admin GUI , a REALLY nice admin CLI , native integration with Apache HTTP , and in version 3.0 , services on demand .
I too , will miss it , and am really sorry to see it go now that the 3.0 version is out , which is so lightweight .
My guess , and I 'm pretty much 100 % on this , is that you 've never actually even used the product .
There 's no way you could come to the " crap " conclusion if you did .
And as to Reza 's defense of Oracle , basically , " Surely Oracle would n't be stupid enough to kill Glassfish " ( paraphrased ) , all I can say is , really ?
Have you paid attention to Oracle ?
Sound technological decisions are not their forte .
Decisions based on how much money they can generate for sales guys and overpriced support contracts are far more in their wheelhouse .
The whole Oracle / Sun buyout is really like a nightmare scenario for me .
I can't imagine a company less qualified or motivated to make good decisions based on the needs of developers or customers .

Agree - just as in any good public company , revenue will drive product decisions .
GlassFish is at risk currently and Oracle 's statements around aligning Glass Fish with WLS stack gives clues on what direction they are taking .
The good news is that for majority of web applications , users can and will easily migrate to Apache Tomcat .

in response to Andrew Clifford So Oracle is going to offer lots of " integrated " bells and whistles on top of its database as loss leaders .
The database model with value - add might work better than Sun 's hardware model with value - add .
But at least Sun had style .
Loss leaders ?
Honestly , there are a lot of things you can complain about with Oracle , but " loss " is not one of those .
Oracle has a very good track record at finding ways to make business , including with software that has an open source license .
To quote from a recent email that I received on this topic : Open Source is just one of the licensing and distribution models Oracle uses with some of its software products to make those products available to customers .
Oracle has a history of using the licensing and distribution model that makes sense for a given product and market .
Even prior to the Sun acquisition , Oracle had a long track record in Open Source products in terms of distributing , evolving and adding value to Open Source products while also leading and contributing back to Open Source projects .
Examples of this include Linux , Virtualization ( Xen ) , Databases ( BerkeleyDB , InnoDB ) , Developer Tools ( Eclipse ) , and Middleware ( EclipseLink , TopLink in Glass Fish , Apache ) .
You said : I hope we see start - ups and small ( MySQL - type ) companies move more towards Amazon / Google clouds for hosted app / data needs .
Oracle is a great database but I just do n't see their tight " cathedral " integration story winning anyone over .
Especially with open - source and app / data hosting becoming even more accessible .
Sure , why not ?
And chances are very good that they 'll be using some technology products and / or open source packages from ( or contributed to by ) Oracle to do so .
Oracle's in a great position to show real technology leadership , and while that includes leadership in traditional areas ( databases , applications , integration and now hardware from Sun ) , it goes well beyond that .
Peace , Cameron Purdy | Oracle Coherence Andrew -

It is fantastic to see you reaching out to the community once again !
It is a breath of fresh air that Oracle is accelerating the pace of development for Java SE , Java EE and Java ME and showing progressive technological leadership in the same way that you guys have done for Java EE 5 + , EJB 3+ , JPA 1 + and CDI .
The commitment to greater openness / participation in the JCP as well as putting your financial muscle behind Java is much appreciated ( beyond the somewhat understandable nay - saying / fears / doubts given the scale of change ) .
Personally , I hope for much better days ahead for Java with a strong Oracle instead of a weakened Sun behind it .

in response to Ichiro Hashiya Does JavaFX have a future at Oracle ?
Take a look at the announcements / analysis on JavaLobby that focuses on the concrete parts of the Oracle / Sun road - map .
Oracle plans to invest heavily on JavaFX / RIA , not to mention concrete plans for the JCP , Java SE , Java ME , Java EE , modularity , JavaFX , NetBeans , GlassFish , Kenai , OpenOffice , MySQL , JavaOne , SPARC and Solaris .
I am sure you can always find negative things to say if that 's what you are looking for , but I personally think the road - map is overwhelmingly positive .
The only thing I am unsure of is the decision to continue down the SPARC / Solaris path .
These two product lines were some of the major sources of chronic weakness for Sun despite being critical to their early success ( along with Java of course ) .
Like James Gosling , I really like the idea of Java stewardship being in the hands of a progressive ( and aggressive ) software company at heart rather than a hardware engineering shop .
The other regret of course is that us mid-market guys I am sure will have to work harder to earn our keep now , but then I 'd rather be earning my supper fair and square against a capable contender I respect any day ...

After all , Oracle has its own ADF Faces Components .
Today some of ADF
Faces components actually generate Flash UI today ( for example the graph components which can also generate simple PNG ) - we could create ADF Faces components that spit out JavaFX UI if it would make sense .

in response to paul perez Hello Douglas ,
Your paper is so right .
we come to the same conclusion .
The vertical stack with Oracle , Oracle and Oracle from the disk to the application send me back to the OS / 360 Cobol that rule the 60's and 70's .
Every one worked hard to convince our customers , partners , managers and colleagues that open standard approach is credible and beneficial .
Sun provided a support to this movement ( Thanks to Jonathan Schwarzt ) .
After Wednesday Oracle's web cast , we understand that this movement will not a priority for BIG RED .
I hope we are wrong and we will no go back the middle age
http://www.pymma.com/eng/People/Blog-Paul-Perez-Chief-Architect/Back-to-the-middle-age2
Paul Perez Hi Paul .
Happy you got a chance to sit in on that webcast too .
It was quite long as you mentioned .
Many things were said , but you and I seemed have picked out the key / salient points apart from the individual announcements made about the myriad of technologies Oracle has to meld together and / sieve through .
I agree with Reza that a perceived weakness in Oracle 's game plan may be to continue with the Sparc processor line , and by extension , big iron servers .
That was how Sun got into trouble in the first place .
They did n't see that the market had shifted to x86/x64 based commodity / mid range machines until it was too late .
Dell and HP were killing them .
We have our work cut out for us - i.e. -
Those who have been preaching to customers and clients , good low cost , quality , commodity solutions to tackle their big expensive problems .
If Oracle wants to sell big iron systems that 's ok .
I just hope they do n't go evangelizing to the whole world that big iron , expensive is more reliable , and better performing than everything else .
God knows they carry a lot of clout in the technology market and with no other big vendors like Sun to preach otherwise , things can get sticky quickly .
Maybe Reza and Caucho can help out here . : ) )
I remember in the webcast there was a CEO from an IT company in West Africa complaining to Larry about Larry allowing Oracle to go directly to his big Telco customer that he was already providing support for , which would mean killing his business .
Larry simply said to him not to worry .
To paraphrase Larry , " If Oracle goes to his customer and they confirm that they were already receiving quality service from his IT company , then Oracle would leave them alone , otherwise , they Oracle are going in to take business where no real support value is being provided . " :)
To me , that 's in your face business brawn / brute force . :)
What was also funny to me yet serious , was when the same CEO of the West African IT company mentioned how a couple years ago Larry was over there somewhere in Africa preaching at some technology conference about how Unbreakable Linux , running on commodity based servers , in clusters was the way to go to run Oracle DBs - " now , " the CEO said , " you , Larry , are now talking about Big Iron systems being the future ... what 's up here ? " to paraphrase the CEO . :)
From where I sit , anybody who owns , operates , or works in a company that provides , Java EE based app servers , or platforms , should be very concerned about these kinds of developments .
At least they should plan for the worst case . :)
Peace .

I just hope they do n't go evangelizing to the whole world that big iron , expensive is more reliable , and better performing than everything else .
God knows they carry a lot of clout in the technology market and with no other big vendors like Sun to preach otherwise , things can get sticky quickly .
Maybe Reza and Caucho can help out here . : ) )
I remember in the webcast there was a CEO from an IT company in West Africa complaining to Larry about Larry allowing Oracle to go directly to his big Telco customer that he was already providing support for , which would mean killing his business .
Larry simply said to him not to worry .
To paraphrase Larry , " If Oracle goes to his customer and they confirm that they were already receiving quality service from his IT company , then Oracle would leave them alone , otherwise , they Oracle are going in to take business where no real support value is being provided . " :)
To me , that 's in your face business brawn / brute force . :)
What was also funny to me yet serious , was when the same CEO of the West African IT company mentioned how a couple years ago Larry was over there somewhere in Africa preaching at some technology conference about how Unbreakable Linux , running on commodity based servers , in clusters was the way to go to run Oracle DBs - " now , " the CEO said , " you , Larry , are now talking about Big Iron systems being the future ... what 's up here ? " to paraphrase the CEO . :)
From where I sit , anybody who owns , operates , or works in a company that provides , Java EE based app servers , or platforms , should be very concerned about these kinds of developments .
At least they should plan for the worst case . :)
Peace .

in response to Douglas Allen I appreciate the concerns expressed in many of the posts in this thread .
Some of these concerns are based in interpretations of segments of the webcast , some are based on market analysis and some on expectations of Oracle 's behavior .
The concerns about lack of future investment on JavaEE 7 seem the easiest to address .
* All * of Oracle 's middleware is based on JavaEE , Oracle has a history of strong support for the JCP , and there are several places in the webcasts where Jeet and Thomas / Hasan talk about a desire to invest on the JCP .
The discussion about GlassFish / WebLogic is trickier to address effectively .
I know - from having talked with " Oracle classic " folks in the last few days - that some of the phrases used in the Webcasts are being interpreted in a way different to how they were intended .
For example Oracle said " Glass Fish remains the RI " and they just meant that , but some observers interpret that sentence as code for " we will remove production features " because * many * years ago Sun had separate RI and AppServer groups and two AppServer offerings .
Now , Sun stopped doing that because it was too expensive to keep two code bases ... and Oracle is more cost conscious than Sun ever was , but I surely understand why the phrase raises eyebrows .
Another example of tricky phrasing is " Departmental " ; on that , I 've been told that that specific nuance was discussed up to the last minute .
Another example is the slide shown at 7'40 '
http://bit.ly/9hsHKb
One could interpret it as saying " left column is GlassFish - for development ; while right column is WebLogic - for production " .
Actually , that 's how I read the slide it the first time !
But that is not what it says , nor what it was intended - what it says is that the combination of GF +WLS addresses the needs of development and deployment .
Now , at this point , I can just have a plea for not rushing to ( mis ) interpret what was said at CiC .
You can read what Mike Lehman ( WebLogic PM ) says in his post in this thread for some other comments , but I think only a RoadMap for Glass Fish will address people 's concerns .
Paraphrasing Miguel de Cervantes : " the proof of the pudding is in the roadmap " - and Oracle has not provided one ( yet ) .
Which I think should be interpreted by pro-GlassFish folks as a " good sign " because it shows that the " Oracle classic " folks have waited 9 months to be able to work with the " Glass Fish classic " group to put together a combined roadmap , rather than just dictating one .
So , my suggestion to Glass Fish fans is to please give us some time to put together that roadmap , and then use it to make your own decisions .
Thanks for your support of Glass Fish .

I would n't want you and Reza to lose too much sleep over the previous Java EE 7 statement .
Do n't read too much into it , as from where I sit , I did n't take it at its literal meaning but rather that developers anticipate a significant slow down in the release of subsequent Java EE versions much like the way most developers see how long an IBM takes to get their Java EE app servers implemented to the latest Java EE specs .
Glad that you responded to it though , to further shed light on this perceived grey area .
Now , in regards to you and the other Oracle folks on this thread trying to do damage control after the last Oracle webcast , I fear that you guys may have go beyond this little thread as I 've seen the same negative developer sentiments appearing on other tech news websites apart from TSS .
I know - from having talked with " Oracle classic " folks in the last few days - that some of the phrases used in the Webcasts are being interpreted in a way different to how they were intended .
You can't blame the viewing / listening audience for how they interpret things that were explicitly said by Oracle senior executives ( i.e. Glassfish to be RI App Server , and Glassfish for Departmental apps ) .
I do n't like to feel as if my intelligence is being insulted .
If Oracle folks said some things in a webcast that did n't go over well with some people listening on , do n't come and say that you did n't mean .... , you meant ....
It 's not like they were talking to lay people .
They were addressing a technology centric audience , hence , you should be clear in what you try to communicate .
Saying something is to be used for departmental apps is not a statement to make off the cuff without backlash if you did n't mean it that way , especially when you went further to say that Weblogic will continue to be strategic app server for enterprise deployments .
Two contrasting statements here .
I 'm sorry for being a stickler for language and exposition . :)
Now , at this point , I can just have a plea for not rushing to ( mis ) interpret what was said at CiC ...
Even you seemed to have been doing a little deciphering yourself .
I can only try to ask Oracle folks to try and get the communication right the first time please .
Most Java techie folks I suspect are INTP / INTJ personality types .
This Sun / Oracle merger is a very significant event in the technology space - hence the lines of communication from Oracle needs to be frequent , and clear .
You do n't need someone like a Reza who does n't work for Oracle trying to do damage control for Oracle .
We now have a situation where a camp of Sun techie fans are being pushed into a situation to now join the Oracle camp of which they were originally not apart .
You 're going to have a clash of cultures , and expectations .
To ensure some balance here , I 've always agreed with the view that Java needs a savvy and strong business steward with deep pockets behind them , and I think that Oracle has that going for them .
It helps to portray the image to big business of Java being upscale , and gated community like - much like a .
Net rather than say a PHP :) )
Peace .

If Oracle folks said some things in a webcast that did n't go over well with some people listening on It was not my intent to dismiss anybody 's concerns but rather to provide some additional context to what was said in the presentations .
Remember , all this was happening pre-CiC and the Sun / Glass Fish team had no opportunity to review any of the presentation .
We could not say : " hey , the GF community will likely interpret * that * statement in * this* way "
As I said , I think the only way to address the ( valid ) questions about the future of Glass Fish at Oracle is through actions like delivering a roadmap .
We are working on these but wo n't happen overnight .

in response to Douglas Allen Douglas , I really do n't think there is any reason to expect delays on Java EE 7 .
On the contrary , I believe it will be a faster and even more effective release than Java EE 6 :-) .
I do agree some of the other media outlets / blogs seemed to have interpreted things the same way you ( guys ) did .
Now that we all hopefully have a better understanding of things , perhaps we should do our part in helping ensure bad things do n't happen to a platform all of our livelihoods depend on ( at least avoidably ) :-) ?
As such , I see it as my privilege to speak out on anything that I see as being incorrect , there really is no burden here .
The good folks at Oracle / Sun certainly deserve that much and so much more ...
For one thing , I am in a position to have better insight than most folks , so I would be remiss if I did not use it where it is needed ...

Netbeans future

in response to Reza Rahman
As a long - time Netbeans user , I 'm most curious about that IDE 's future .
It 's gained a lot of traction but is / will probably never be as popular as Eclipse .
Netbeans is a great IDE .
JDeveloper is also a really good IDE .
So , Oracle - aside from supporting Eclipse in many ways - has 2 really good , though not heavily used ( compared to Eclipse ) , IDEs which are free .
I could be wrong , but I can't really see Netbeans as having a great future with Oracle .
I 'd love to see them spin it off .

DS3232 ( $ 7.63 Digikey )
SOIC to DIP breakout board ( $ 4.17 Digikey - This is for a SOIC - 24 instead of the SOIC - 20 that the DS3232 is , but it is the exact same board , except that they cut off the last four pins for you , and charge a dollar extra )

1 5x7 LED dot matrix - common cathode row , common anode columns ( I sourced locally for $ 2.95 at Halted ) ( $ 3.83 Digikey )
There is no way to set the clock as is .
I have a separate piece of code hacked together where you can send a DS3232 or DS1307 the current date and time over the serial port .
This code is unfortunately not of release quality , so consider setting the clock a challenge for the student .
The DS3232 2 ppm is way overkill for a freakin wall clock like this , so feel free to replace it with a cheaper RTC such as the DS1307 , which happens to require no software modifications , since they both use the same I 2 C address and register mapping .
C address and register mapping .
The DS3232 features are sorely underutilized .
Realize that it has two time of day alarms , which you might possibly be able to put to good use , if you felt so inclined .
The two 100 kΩ resistors in parallel with the super caps are meant to swamp the very much higher , but unpredictable internal leakage resistance of each cap such that neither drifts above its rated voltage of 2.7V after being charged for an extended period of time .
The super caps have easily kept the DS3232 running for several days without power , and this could be improved by powering down some of the DS3232 subsystems ( 32k Hz square wave , slower temperature conversions , etc ) .
I did n't bother noting all of the pin numbers for the LED driver , so refer to the source code and datasheet for where to connect the DATA , CLOCK , LATCH , and OUT 0 - OUT 6 pins .
I also did n't bother drawing in all of the tedious power and ground connections for all of the ICs , so read the datasheet ( which you should be doing for the fun of it anyways , right ? ) and figure out where to apply power and ground .
- OUT pins .
I also did n't bother drawing in all of the tedious power and ground connections for all of the ICs , so read the datasheet ( which you should be doing for the fun of it anyways , right ? ) and figure out where to apply power and ground .
Yes , that is a hair on the schematic .
We 're all sad about that misfortune on my part .
The great adventure that is building clocks continues .
Points of interest in this build is that it was the first chance I got to play with the dot matrix display I picked up over winter break , and it 's the first time I 've soldered and used a surface mount package ( albeit I soldered it to a DIP breakout board so that I could plug it into a breadboard ; I know , very meta ) .
This clock displays all of its values in binary , which means that each row , from bottom to top , is worth one , two , four , eight , 16 , and 32 , and as each LED is lit , you add them together to get the final value .
From left to right is the current month , current day of the month , hour ( twelve hour based with PM indicator top center ) , minutes and seconds .
There is currently no way to set the time short of plugging the board into a computer over a serial port to talk to the ATMega , but since these clocks rarely last longer than a few weeks , this is n't of much concern .
Feel free to add buttons to set the date and time manually .
The time is kept by a DS3232 , which is a very cool chip in that it has a built in temperature sensor , which it uses to compensate the crystal to try and keep better time , and the crystal itself is built into the package , which is an advantage since I 'm using this on a breadboard , and crystals do n't seem to like the stray capacitance on the boards that much .
This chip is quite a bit more expensive than the DS1307 I 've usually been using for these projects , but both use the same address over IC , so replacing one with the other is simply a matter of connecting the correct pins .
Also new in this project is a time lapse video of start to finish !
This is me assembling all of the parts on a pair of breadboards , as well as me writing all of the source code to get it running .
Total work time was approximately two hours , with a break in the middle which was edited out .
Enjoy !
Parts list : Schematic : Notes :
Liz Cheney : Guilty ’til proven innocent .
Earlier this month , the conservative organization Keep America Safe launched a p.r. fusillade against Department of Justice ( DOJ ) attorneys who represented Guantánamo detainees .
“ The crux of the matter , ” says Liz Cheney , chair of the organization , “ is the American people have a right to know whether lawyers who used to represent and advocate on behalf of terrorists ” are working at DOJ .
They just want to know who the terrorist lawyers are .
An innocent question , to be sure .
Bill Kristol , a board member for Keep America Safe , chimes in that another question is “ whether former pro bono lawyers for terrorists should be working on detainee policy for the Justice Department . ”
Perhaps the terrorist lawyers should have more harmless roles -- say , advocating for low - income tenants over at HUD .
The important claim here is not the stated argument that terrorist lawyers should be publicly revealed , or that they should n’t be working for the DOJ .
It ’s the assumption that they are representing terrorists .
The assumption permeates conservative rhetoric on issues of torture and detainee rights .
Consider some brief passages from a recent column by former Bush speechwriter Marc Thiessen :
Unless they have been charged before military commissions or civilian courts , the al - Qaeda terrorists held at Guantánamo do not have a right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment .
They are not accused criminals .
They are enemy combatants held in a war authorized by Congress .
...
Yet thanks to the habeas campaign , al - Qaeda terrorists who violate the laws of war now enjoy all these privileges .
... [ The DOJ lawyers ] have reached outside the judicial system and dragged the terrorists in .
...
The same is true if they choose to devote their time to freeing America ’s terrorist enemies from lawful confinement under the laws of war [ emphasis added ] .
Thiessen makes explicit the position that the rhetoric about “ terrorist lawyers ” is meant to imply - - namely , that terrorists should not have lawyers at all .
The conclusion flows naturally when you begin by defining the defendants as “ terrorists . ”
The truth , though , is that a good number of these “ terrorists ” are not terrorists at all .
One CIA intelligence analyst well - versed in Islamic extremism who interviewed detainees at Guantánamo determined that one - third had no connection to terrorism at all .
A subsequent study by Seton Hall University Law School found that over half of the detainees were not determined to have committed any hostile act against the United States , and only 8 percent were characterized as Al Qaeda fighters .
The vast majority of the detainees were turned in not by U.S. forces but by Pakistani or Afghan locals , many of whom received financial bounties .
And some of the detainees were hardly caught red-handed on the battlefield .
The process for screening detainees was “ horrible , ” a former Pentagon official told McClatchy newspapers .
“ ‘ Captured with weapon near the Pakistan border ? ’
Are you kidding me ? ”
This , of course , is why lawyers were needed in the first place .
The family of former Haitian dictator Jean - Claude ( Baby Doc ) Duvalier can reclaim at least $ 4.6 million US from Swiss bank accounts that had previously been promised to aid groups , Switzerland 's highest court said Wednesday .
Former Haitian dictator Jean - Claude ( Baby Doc ) Duvalier , shown at a press conference in 1980 , and his entourage have been accused by many Haitians of robbing millions from public funds before he was ousted in 1986 .
(( Kathy Willens / Associated Press ) )
The Federal Supreme Court in Lausanne reversed a lower court 's ruling that the money should go to charities working in the impoverished Caribbean country .
The decision was reached hours before Haiti 's devastating earthquake on Jan. 12 but was not published until Wednesday .
Such delays are common in Switzerland 's legal system .
The decision cannot be appealed , but the Swiss Foreign Ministry said it would try to keep the money blocked while it works on a new law dealing with assets of " criminal origin . "
It said the amount of money actually totalled $ 5.7 million , though the reason for the discrepancy was unclear .
The government " wants to avoid the Swiss financial centre serving as a haven for illegally acquired assets , " the ministry said a statement , adding that a new law working retroactively could be ready later in February .
Duvalier succeeded his father , François ( Papa Doc ) Duvalier , Haiti 's president from 1957 until his death in 1971 .
By the time the junior Duvalier was ousted in 1986 , he and his entourage had robbed millions from public funds , Haitians have alleged .
Duvalier is believed to be living in exile in France and has always denied wrongdoing .
Family a ' criminal organization ' ?
The top court said the alleged crimes in the case fell outside the statute of limitations , reversing an August decision by a lower court that found the Duvalier family had acted as a " criminal organization " by diverting public funds through a Liechtenstein foundation to accounts in Swiss bank UBS AG .
The Supreme Court said it was unhappy about the ruling released Wednesday but its hands were tied because the statute of limitations expired in 2001 .
It urged lawmakers to make it easier for assets belonging to deposed dictators to be repatriated to national governments .
Haiti made its first request for the money in 1986 , shortly after Duvalier 's ouster .
The cash has been frozen ever since , but Switzerland has refused to give it back to Haiti because the Haitian government was n't charging Duvalier with any crimes in its own justice system .
As a way out , the Swiss government had proposed giving the money to aid groups working in Haiti .
January 7 , 2010
Michael Ratner , president of the Center for Constitutional Rights , recently traveled to the Middle East as part of the Gaza Freedom March , a delegation of activists who planned to challenge Israel 's blockade of Gaza by delivering desperately needed humanitarian supplies .
The Egyptian government blocked the 1,360 activists taking part in the Freedom March from using the Rafah border crossing to enter Gaza .
Ratner then traveled to East Jerusalem , where he witnessed firsthand the brutality of the Israeli government .
Here , he describes his trip .
TODAY , WE came away stunned , shocked and almost numb from our trip to East Jerusalem with Jeff Halper of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions .
And when I say we , I mean my family -- my wife and two children , 19 and 21 .
We have spent the last 10 days trying to get into Gaza from Egypt ; demonstrating against the Gaza siege and joining demonstrations in Israel at the Erez crossing and protesting the evictions in the Sheikh - Jarrah area of East Jerusalem .
But nothing , and I mean nothing , prepared me for today and our trip through East Jerusalem and to Ma'ale Adummin , a city a few kilometers away .
It was not the Palestinians we met , although each had heart - breaking stories .
Rather , it was our seeing firsthand the deliberateness of the Israeli annexation project and its seeming inevitability .
If you want to be made almost speechless , stand at the edge of East Jerusalem and look out at a vast construction project on someone else 's land .
Look out at the commission of a monstrous crime , open and notorious .
As one of my children asked , " Why have the countries of the world done nothing to stop this ? "
A Palestinian family stands in the wreckage of their East Jerusalem home , bulldozed by Israeli forces
I said , " It 's worse , the U.S. and others have aided and abetted this crime . "
Today , we traveled with Jeff through East Jerusalem and to what some , at least in the media in the U.S. , refer to as the settlement of Ma'ale Adummin .
It is not a settlement , but a new city of 50,000 Israeli Jews , soon to be expanded to 70,000 .
Ma'ale Adummin , built on a hilltop , will ultimately be , or is already , part of the expansion of East Jerusalem into a wider municipality that is called by some the " Jerusalem envelope . "
Before we drove through the valley to get to Ma'ale Adummin , Jeff showed us a bit of East Jerusalem .
He pointed out the Israeli Ministry of Interior , the police headquarters and the courts , all now in East Jerusalem ; all a means of asserting Israeli control over the area and its Palestinian inhabitants .
Then we went close to the 25 - foot - high concrete separation wall which will ultimately lock out Palestinians from Israel , Jerusalem and many cities , towns and settlements in the occupied territories .
On a knoll above that particular piece of wall , we saw a prison and an interrogation center for Shabak , the Israeli internal security agency .
Jeff then drove us to a viewing site at the edge of East Jerusalem , where we overlooked what is called by Israel " Area E1 . "
It was a valley with roads criss - crossing it , a few houses and trees , and on the distant other side -- there it was , Ma'ale Adummin .
WHILE I had heard of Area E1 , I never understood what was meant .
I think I understand it now .
It is -- at least the valley area I was looking at -- the road system and land that will link Ma'ale Adummin to East Jerusalem and other settlements .
Area E1 will also cut off Palestinians traveling north and south ; they will be forced to make circuitous routes from one Palestinian area to another .
And remember all of this land is in occupied territory , including all of East Jerusalem .
Israel 's actions are in flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions .
As we drove toward Ma'ale Adummin , Jeff took us to what are known as Areas A , B and C .
Area
A is where there is full Palestinian control ; B is where there is joint Palestinian and Israeli control ; and C is where there is full Israeli control .
It is in the C area of East Jerusalem where many of the house demolitions are occurring -- another story for later .
We also went to the Shuafat refugee camp in East Jerusalem , where some 35,000 Palestinians live in poverty with no municipal services .
We drove past small sheet metal shacks of Jumalat Bedouins , who , like many Palestinians , are facing eviction .
We saw field after field of olive tree stumps , 100 - year - old trees that once belonged to the Bedouins that had been cut down by the Israelis -- insuring that Bedouins could not stay in or near East Jerusalem .
We passed an almost - completed road with a high metal wall separating two concrete strips ; one side was for Palestinians and the other Israelis .
Finally , we began our drive up to the city on the hill , Ma'ale Adummin .
What first strikes one is the color .
The city is green and lush .
There is grass everywhere and palm trees lining cleanly paved concrete roads .
This is all in an area where water is almost non-existent , and many Palestinians have no water .
In the center of each of the roundabouts on the way up is an olive tree -- not just an ordinary olive tree , but a wide squat one that is perhaps 400 or even 500 years old , likely an olive tree taken from a Palestinian farm .
At the entrance to the city is one of the more incongruous and Orwellian monuments to erect in this stolen city : a huge white metal sculpture of two doves , with wings unfolded sheltering a globe and inscribed on its base with the word -- and it seems like a nasty joke - -" Peace . "
Peace , apparently defined , as the dismembering of the Palestinian people .
As we continued our ride up , we passed a suburban shopping mall with some big box stores , stores that are part of international chains that hopefully will become targets of the BDS movement .
We finally stopped at the end of a street that could come out of any middle - class suburb in America : neat houses and apartments with small yards .
Ma'ale Adummin is called a dormitory community or as we would say , a bedroom community .
Its residents work in Tel Aviv .
They live here rather than in Jerusalem because of price ( half that of Jerusalem ) and lower taxes , not because of religious ideology .
It is a secular community that can shop at the mall and will be able to drive to work in a few minutes on segregated roads .
We went to a lookout over the E1 area and toward Jerusalem .
As we looked down the hill , we saw a construction site for a huge swimming pool - - a swimming pool in this parched land , where only the select have water .
Across the valley , we saw the building of the architecture of apartheid : the segregated roads and separation walls .
I could have been standing in a white - only town in South Africa , but I was standing in an Israeli Jewish - only town in the occupied territories .

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS ….
In the fall of 2008 , as the global economic crisis started to come into focus , then - Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson spent a fair amount of time talking to lawmakers from both parties .
The Republican cabinet member was able to size up the intelligence and credibility of lawmakers in his own party .
Meetings with Senate Republicans were “ a complete waste of time for us , when time was more precious than anything ” ( page 275 ) .
Ideas that Republicans do add are “ unformed , ” like Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor ’s plan to replace TARP with an insurance program .
In a rare moment of sarcasm , Paulson goes off on the minority Whip : “ I got a better idea .
I ’m going to go with Eric Cantor ’s insurance program .
That ’s the idea to save the day ” ( page 285 ) .
This is n’t entirely new .
Kevin added that last year , Paulson offered plenty of praise for Democratic officials , but considered Republicans to be “ preening , ignorant , ideologues . ”
Remember , this was Bush ’s Treasury secretary , commenting on lawmakers from his political party , and reflecting on the fact that they appeared to be complete idiots .
I mention this in part because it ’s interesting , and in part because it speaks to a larger truth — congressional Republican too often seem like they are so conspicuously unintelligent , the notion of them being in a position of power and authority during a time of crisis can be rather terrifying .
Years ago , when I was , say , 14 or 15 , I had certain assumptions about the political world .
I thought , for example , that members of Congress must be fairly bright , regardless of party or ideology .
Even those on the far right with whom I disagreed had to be knowledgeable and well informed , I thought , because there they are , shaping federal policy of the United States government .
It was n’t until I was an adult that I realized that the moron caucus on Capitol Hill has a few too many members .
What ’s more , it was n’t until I actually worked in Washington that I realized finding a reasonably smart Republican lawmaker was nearly impossible .
This is not to say that all conservative Republicans are dumb .
This is to say that conservative Republicans in Congress are dumb , or at least do a surprisingly convincing imitation of being dumb .
It was n’t always this way .
When Reagan and congressional Republicans pushed through a major tax - cut package in 1982 , it was based on a coherent economic theory .
I think the theory was wrong and the policy was a mistake , but I can appreciate the fact that GOP officials at the time actually thought this through .
They did their homework .
To borrow a cliche from math classrooms everywhere , they showed their work .
Today , Republican calls for tax cuts are more habitual than intellectual .
They ca n’t explain why their proposals make sense or what they hope to accomplish .
There ’s no economic theory or policy analysis .
Tax cuts create jobs .
Why ?
Because they do .
And if it were just tax policy , this would be easier to ignore .
Tragically , we ’re dealing with a Republican Party that celebrates ignorance , and has given up on the pretense of substance and depth altogether .
As Paulson found , even during a crisis that risked the future of the global economy , Republican lawmakers not only had nothing intelligent to offer , but even trying to communicate with them on an adult level was a “ complete waste of time . ”
This has only gotten worse .
Faced with an economic crisis , Republicans demanded a five - year , across - the - board spending freeze — and they still think that was a good idea .
They presented a budget blueprint that offered oddly - drawn charts and no numbers .
They see snow and assume global warming is n’t real .
They know they ’re against health care reform , but ca n’t explain why with anything more sophisticated than bumper - sticker slogans .
They make arguments , are confronted with evidence that their arguments are wrong , and then repeat the arguments anyway .
At the recent Q&A between President Obama and House Republicans , members repeatedly whined that Democrats refuse to take GOP proposals seriously .
The truth , which the president probably felt uncomfortable saying , is that they ’re right — but only because GOP proposals should n’t be taken seriously .
They ’re ridiculous .
Maybe this does n’t matter .
There ’s a strong strain of anti-intellectualism in American life that may appreciate the Republican caucus ’ inanity .
But I ca n’t help but wonder what happens when confused conservative lawmakers control the levers of government , and the nation needs an immediate , intelligent response to a crisis .
In January a group of self - declared " sceptics " hit the headlines with an attention - grabbing publicity stunt .
If you instinctively interpret that sentence as a reference to the battle - scarred topic of climate change , then it is a mark of how successfully those opposed to the scientific consensus on climate change have appropriated the term sceptic " .
In fact , the event in question is the mass homeopathy " overdose " staged by the Merseyside Skeptics .
Do the Merseyside Skeptics ( and hundreds of other groups like them ) share much common ground with the army of Freedom of Information requesters currently swarming around climate science databases ?
Or could it be that climate change sceptics are giving wider scepticism a bad name ?
Over the past three months climate change scepticism seems to have reached new levels .
The Guardian 's investigation into the emails hacked from the University of East Anglia has shone a rather uncomfortable light into the sock - drawer of science .
But it has revealed nothing that challenges the fact that the climate is changing – or that human activity is responsible .
Trust has been diminished , embarrassing exchanges have been revealed , but the clunking wheels of the anti-climate change lobby have gone into overdrive , falsely claiming that the case for human - caused climate change has been discredited .
Climate change sceptics often position themselves as the antidote to the hysterical , exaggerated claims of climate scientists and environmentalists , adopting the tools and language of " rational enquiry " .
But something is missing from this picture - where are the voices of the truly sceptical thinkers that the climate sceptics claim to represent ?
The website of the long - running US magazine Skeptic describes scepticism as a method rather than a position , and one that is embodied in the scientific method .
A search of the magazine 's online archives reveals not one article disputing the science of climate change .
However , there are several debunking unsubstantiated claims that climate change sceptics have made .
The not - for - profit organisation UK Skeptics is even less welcoming to climate sceptics , with a helpful note stating :
We are nothing to do with opposition , activist , or denialist groups who wrongly refer to themselves as ' skeptics ' because they adopt a position of non-belief ( eg global warming skeptics , vaccine skeptics , etc ) .
The distinction between scepticism and non-belief is a crucial one .
While scepticism is healthy , non-belief in the face of overwhelming evidence is the antipathy of scepticism .
Recent climate scepticism has been characterised by a visceral mistrust of science , scientific institutions and scientific governance .
Never mind that the case for climate change has been painstakingly pieced together over decades – climate change sceptics are busy writing it off on the basis of a few inconsistencies .
But embarrassingly for climate change sceptics , the people who have thought longest and hardest about what it means to be a truly sceptical thinker seem in a hurry to distance themselves from their fellow sceptics .
Michael Marshall , from the Merseyside Skeptics group that organised the homeopathy overdose is clear about the legitimacy of climate change sceptics : " In our view , climate change sceptics are not sceptics .
A sceptic looks at the available evidence and makes a decision , and for homeopathy the evidence is that it does n't work .
But the sceptical position on climate change is that it is happening . "
John Jackson , from UK Skeptics , agreed , added : " Terms like " climate change sceptic " are very damaging to scepticism - basically because this is not what scepticism is .
We often get people calling us , referring to themselves as climate sceptics , but we argue with them .
We accept global warming because the evidence is overwhelming . "
With trust in climate change and climate science rapidly dwindling , statements such as these could become incredibly powerful .
Here are groups of intelligent , rational , scientifically literate , independent and sceptical thinkers , directly contradicting the view of the so - called climate sceptics .
Debate continues about whether " denier " is an appropriate term for those who oppose the climate science consensus .
But it seems clear that " sceptic " is no better – the sceptics themselves reject the climate contrarians ' claim to their title .
Along with preachy eco-warriors and morally bankrupt politicians , climate scientists are in danger of being added to the list of sources that are n't trusted to communicate climate change .
Perhaps it is time for the silent army of rational thinkers to stand up for the science .
They could be the one authoritative group that could argue the climate change case – and all from a position of scepticism .

Buy Books by PG Wodehouse Had his only contribution to literature been Lord Emsworth and Blandings Castle , his place in history would have been assured .
Had he written of none but Mike and Psmith , he would be cherished today as the best and brightest of our comic authors .
If Jeeves and Wooster had been his solitary theme , still he would be hailed as the Master .
If he had given us only Ukridge , or nothing but recollections of the Mulliner family , or a pure diet of golfing stories , Doctor Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse would nonetheless be considered immortal .
That he gave us all those - and more - is our good fortune and a testament to the most industrious , prolific and beneficent author ever to have sat down , scratched his head and banged out a sentence .
If I were to say that the defining characteristic of PG Wodehouse , the man , was his professionalism , that might make him sound rather dull .
We look for eccentricity , sexual weirdness , family trauma and personal demons in our great men .
Wodehouse , who knew just what was expected of authors , was used to having to apologise for a childhood that was " as normal as rice - pudding " and a life that consisted of little more than " sitting in front of the typewriter and cursing a bit " .
The only really controversial episode of that life , namely Wodehouse 's broadcasts to friends from Berlin while an internee of the Germans in France and Belgium during the Second World War , is dug up from time to time by mischief - makers and the ignorant .
It would not be worth mentioning now if it had not been unearthed yet again recently , together with headlines in the British newspapers linking the name Wodehouse with words such as " Nazi " , " Fascist " and " traitor " .
Anyone who has examined the affair closely will agree with the Foreign Office official who wrote in 1947 that it was unlikely ... that anyone would seriously deny that " l' Affaire Wodehouse " was very much a storm in a teacup .
It is perfectly plain to any unbiased outsider that Mr Wodehouse made the celebrated broadcasts in all innocence and without any evil intent .
He is reported to be of an entirely apolitical cast of mind ; much of the furore of course was the result of literary jealousies .
For Wodehouse 's view on Fascists , one need only consult the descriptions of Sir Roderick Spode in The Code of the Woosters to see how a political innocent may still be capable of scorching satire .
Enough of all that .
If the episode reveals anything , it is Wodehouse 's other - worldliness , a quality that shines through his work and a quality that in our muddied and benighted times ought in fact to be celebrated from the hilltops .
Many have sought to " explain " Wodehouse , to psychoanalyse his world , to place his creations under the microscope of modern literary criticism .
Such a project , as an article in Punch observed , is like " taking a spade to a soufflé " .
His world of sniffily disapproving aunts , stern and gooseberry - eyed butlers , impatient uncles , sporty young girls , natty young men who throw bread rolls in club dining - rooms yet blush and stammer in the presence of the opposite sex - all may be taken as evidence of a man stuck in a permanently pre-pubescent childhood , were it not for the extraordinary , magical and blessed miracle of Wodehouse 's prose , a prose that dispels doubt much as sunlight dispels shadows , a prose that renders any criticism , positive or negative , absolutely powerless and , frankly , silly .
When Hugh Laurie and I had the extreme honour and terrifying responsibility of being asked to play Bertie Wooster and Jeeves in a series of television adaptations , we were aware of one huge problem .
Wodehouse 's three great achievements are plot , character and language , and the greatest of these , by far , is language .
If we were reasonably competent , then all of us concerned in the television version could go some way towards conveying a fair sense of the narrative of the stories and revealing , too , a good deal of the nature of their characters .
The language , however , lives and breathes in its written , printed form .
Let me use an example , taken at random .
I flip open a book of stories and happen on Bertie and Jeeves discussing a young man called Cyril Bassington - Bassington .
" I 've never heard of him .
Have you ever heard of him , Jeeves ? "
" I am familiar with the name Bassington - Bassington , sir .
There are three branches of the Bassington - Bassington family - the Shropshire Bassington - Bassingtons , the Hampshire Bassington - Bassingtons , and the Kent Bassington - Bassingtons . "
" England seems pretty well stocked up with Bassington - Bassingtons . "
" Tolerably so , sir . "
" No chance of a sudden shortage , I mean , what ? "
Well , try as hard as actors might , such an exchange will always work best on the page .
It may still be amusing when delivered as dramatic dialogue , but no actors are as good as the actors we each of us carry in our head .
And that is the point , really : one of the gorgeous privileges of reading PG Wodehouse is that he makes us feel better about ourselves because we derive a sense of personal satisfaction from the laughter mutually created .
Every comma , every " sir " , every " what ? " is something we make work in the act of reading .
" The greatest living writer of prose " , " the Master " , " the head of my profession " , " akin to Shakespeare " , " a master of the language " ...
If you had never read Wodehouse and only knew about the world his books inhabit , you might be forgiven for blinking in bewilderment at the praise that has been lavished on a " mere " comic author by writers such as Compton Mackenzie , Evelyn Waugh , Hilaire Belloc , Bernard Levin and Susan Hill .
But once you dive into the soufflé , once you engage with all those miraculous verbal felicities , such adulation begins to make sense .
Example serves better than description .
Let me throw up some more random nuggets .
Particular to Wodehouse are the transferred epithets : " I lit a rather pleased cigarette " , or , " I pronged a moody forkful of eggs and b " .
Characteristic , too , are the sublimely hyperbolic similes : " Roderick Spode .
Big chap with a small moustache and the sort of eye that can open an oyster at sixty paces " , or , " The stationmaster 's whiskers are of a Victorian bushiness and give the impression of having been grown under glass " .
Here is an example that certainly vindicates my point about his prose working best on the page .
Reading this aloud is not much use : " Sir Jasper Finch - Farrowmere ? " said Wilfred .
" ffinch - ffarrowmere , " corrected the visitor , his sensitive ear detecting the capitals .
Then there is a passage such as this , Lord Emsworth musing on his feckless younger son , Freddie Threepwood .
Unlike the male codfish , which , suddenly finding itself the parent of three million five hundred thousand little codfish , cheerfully resolves to love them all , the British aristocracy is apt to look with a somewhat jaundiced eye on its younger sons .
If you are immune to such writing , you are fit , to use one of Wodehouse 's favourite Shakespearean quotations , only for treasons , stratagems and spoils .
You do n't analyse such sunlit perfection , you just bask in its warmth and splendour .
Like Jeeves , Wodehouse stands alone , and analysis is useless .
Chronology , with Wodehouse , is not necessarily reliable or relevant , but it seems sensible to describe his creations in a more or less historical order - an order compromised by his tendency to introduce a character in a short story and only later pick up and , as it were , run with the ball .
He started writing at the end of the 19th century and continued until his death , manuscript on lap , on 14 February 1975 at the age of 93 .
It can be clearly stated that Wodehouse 's first great creation , and for some his finest , was Psmith ( the " P " is silent ) .
Said to have been drawn from life ( one Rupert D'Oyley Carte , of the Savoy Opera family ) , Psmith is a startling sophisticate , an expelled old Etonian whose delicately attuned nervous system can be shocked by loud colours , celluloid cuffs and the mere mention of an inadequately pressed trouser crease .
He has adopted his own brand of " practical socialism " and retains to the end the habit of referring to everyone as " Comrade " .
Much as Jeeves was to extricate Bertie time and time again from the soup , so Psmith is the eternal saviour of stolid , dependable Mike Jackson - the Doctor Watson to Psmith 's Sherlock Holmes .
There is in fact a little thread of autobiography in the second Psmith novel , Psmith in the City .
Mike , whose only real ambition is to play cricket , at which he excels to the point of genius , is denied by family ill fortune his chance of going to Cambridge University and is forced instead to earn his crust at the New Asiatic Bank .
The young Wodehouse , too , was obliged to work for some years at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in the City , until the time came when he realised that he was earning more from his writing than from his weekly stipend .
The second Wodehouse immortal to come along at this time ( pre-First World War ) was Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge ( pronounced Stanley Fanshawe Ewkridge ) .
Ukridge keeps his pince - nez together by means of ginger - beer wire , wears pyjamas under a mackintosh , calls his friends " old horse " , uses exclamations such as " Upon my Sam " and is eternally in search of funds .
The master of the scam , he forever embroils his chief biographer , Corky , in a series of terrible money - making schemes .
It is not yet the age of cocktails and nightclubs and sporty two - seaters .
But Ukridge is , for all that , deeply loveable ; his amorality and blithe disregard of others do not irritate .
Imperishable optimism and a great spaciousness of outlook inform the spirit of these stories .
He is capable , when occasion demands , of splendid speech : " Alf Todd , " said Ukridge , soaring to an impressive burst of imagery , " has about as much chance as a one - armed blind man in a dark room trying to shove a pound of melted butter into a wild cat 's left ear with a red - hot needle . "
Wodehouse never lost his affection for Ukridge and continued writing about him until 1966 , always setting the stories back in a pre-Wooster epoch .
In 1915 Wodehouse published Something Fresh , the first of the Blandings novels .
I think he knew what he was doing when he chose that title , for with the creation of Blandings Castle , he hit upon something original , something different .
He was beginning his stride into mid-season form .
Wherever lovers of Wodehouse cluster together , they fall into debate about whether it is the Jeeves stories or the Blandings stories that take the trophy as Wodehouse 's greatest achievements .
The group will , of course , dispel , muttering embarrassedly , for they know that such questions are as pointless as wondering whether God did a better job with the Alps or the Rockies .
The question is bound to be asked , however , because each time you read another Blandings story , the sublime nature of that world is such as to make you gasp .
The cast of resident characters here is greater than that of the Wooster canon .
There is Lord Emsworth himself , the amiable and dreamy peer , whose first love - pumpkins - is soon supplanted by the truest and greatest love of his life , the Empress of Blandings , that peerless Black Berkshire sow , thrice winner of the silver medal for the fattest pig in Shropshire ; Emsworth 's sister , Connie , who , when sorely tried , which was often , would retire upstairs to bathe her temples in eau - de - Cologne ; the Efficient Baxter , Emsworth 's secretary and a hound from hell ; Emsworth 's brother , Galahad , the last of the Pelicans ( that breed of silk - hatted men about town who lived high and were forever getting thrown out of the Criterion bar in the Eighties and Nineties ) ; the younger son , Freddie , the bane of his father 's life ...
The cast list goes on and is frequently supplemented by young men we will have met elsewhere , Ronnie Fish , Pongo Twistleton and even Psmith himself .
Blandings comes , in the Wodehouse canon , to stand for the absolute ideal in country houses .
Its serenity and beauty are enough to calm the most turbulent breast .
It is an entire world unto itself and , one senses , Wodehouse pours into it his deepest feelings for England .
Once you have drunk from its healing spring , you will return again and again .
Blandings is like that : it enters a man 's soul .
The young men I mention as visiting Blandings are all members of Wodehouse 's great fictional institution the Drones Club , in Dover Street , off Piccadilly .
There are dozens of individual stories about members of the Drones , and two principal collections , Eggs Beans and Crumpets and Young Men in Spats .
The title of the first derives from the Drones ' habit of referring to each other as " old egg " , " old bean " , " my dear old crumpet " and so on .
The Drones Club is a refuge for the idle young man about town .
Such beings are for the most part entirely dependent on allowances from fat uncles .
Indeed the name Drones is a reference to the drone bee , which toils not , neither does it spin , unlike its industrious cousin , the worker .
An archetypal member would be Freddie Widgeon , intensely amiable , not very bright up top and always falling in love .
The only Drone who is distinctly unlikeable is Oofy Prosser , the richest and meanest member .
He sports pimples , Lobb shoes and the tightest wallet in London .
The second - richest member of the club is the most likeable .
He is Bertram Wilberforce Wooster , descendant of the Sieur de Wooster who did his bit in the Crusades , and young Bertram retains the strict code of honour handed down from his ancestor , the code of the preux chevalier , the gentil parfit knight .
Bertie Wooster is , of course , the employer of Jeeves , the supreme gentleman 's personal gentleman .
Jeeves made his first appearance in 1917 in the short story " Extricating Young Gussie " .
Wodehouse liked to mock himself for not seeing straight away that he had hit a rich seam with Jeeves , but in fact it was only two years later that he wrote four more stories .
From then on he gave the world Jeeves and Wooster right up until his last complete novel , Aunts Are n't Gentlemen ( 1974 ) .
Much has been written about Jeeves .
His imperturbability , his omniscience , his unruffled insight , his orotund speech , his infallible way with a quotation ... in short , his perfection .
It would be a pity , however , to overlook the character of Bertie Wooster , who is himself a great deal more than the silly ass or chinless wonder that people often imagine .
That he is loyal , kind , chivalrous , resolute and magnificently sweet - natured is apparent .
But is he stupid ?
Jeeves is overheard describing him once as " mentally negligible " .
Perhaps that is n't quite fair .
While not intelligent within the meaning of the act , Bertie is desperate to learn , keen to assimilate the wisdom of his incomparable teacher .
He may only half - know the quotations and allusions with which he peppers his speech , but proximity to the great brain has made him aware of the possibilities of exerting the cerebellum .
Wodehouse 's genius in the Jeeves and Wooster canon lies in his complete realisation of Bertie as first - person narrator .
Almost all the other stories depend upon standard , impersonal narration .
The particular joy of a Jeeves story comes from the delicious feeling one derives from being completely in Bertie 's hands .
His apparently confused way of expressing him - self both reveals character and manages , somehow , to develop narrative with extraordinary economy and life .
Since the Jeeves stories often lead one from the other , he will often need to repeat himself , which he manages to do with great ingenuity .
He is called upon more than once , for example , to remind the reader about the dread daughter of Sir Roderick Glossop .
The first example shows Bertie 's way with Victorian poetry : I once got engaged to his daughter Honoria , a ghastly dynamic exhibit who read Nietzsche and had a laugh like waves breaking on a stern and rockbound coast .
Another description of precisely the same characteristics in Honoria give us a very Woosteresque mixture of simile : Honoria ... is one of those robust , dynamic girls with the muscles of a welter - weight and a laugh like a squadron of cavalry charging on a tin bridge .
Sometimes Bertie 's speech moves towards a form of comic imagery so perfect that one could honestly call it poetic :
As a rule , you see , I 'm not lugged into Family Rows .
On the occasions when Aunt is calling to Aunt like mastodons bellowing across primeval swamps ... the clan has a tendency to ignore me .
The masterly episode where Gussie Fink - Nottle presents the prizes at Market Snodsbury grammar school is frequently included in collections of great comic literature and has often been described as the single funniest piece of sustained writing in the language .
I would urge you , however , to head straight for a library or bookshop and get hold of the complete novel Right Ho , Jeeves , where you will encounter it fully in context and find that it leaps even more magnificently to life .
I think I should end on a personal note .
I have written it before and am not ashamed to write it again .
Without Wodehouse I am not sure that I would be a tenth of what I am today - whatever that may be .
In my teenage years , his writings awoke me to the possibilities of language .
His rhythms , tropes , tricks and mannerisms are deep within me .
But more than that , he taught me something about good nature .
It is enough to be benign , to be gentle , to be funny , to be kind .
He mocked himself sometimes because he knew that a great proportion of his readers came from prisons and hospitals .
At the risk of being sententious , is n't it true that we are all of us , for a great part of our lives , sick or imprisoned , all of us in need of this remarkable healing spirit , this balm for hurt minds ?

The Winter 2009 issue of Methods & Tools contains an interesting article from Rachel Davies about Agile Coaching Tips .
She shares her experience that is also available in the excellent book that she wrote with Liz Sedley .
When I reviewed her book this summer , I started thinking about the coaching role that external people are now assuming versus the traditional consultant position .
On the same question I saw a recent blog post discussing the utility of agile coaches .
The author said that you should accept advice only from people that had achieved themselves something big , citing personalities like John Carmack or Linus Torvalds .
Software consultants are people hired on a temporary base mostly for what they are able to achieve .
They will develop part of a software system or manage a project ( I do n’t want to talk here about consultants that are just hired to produce PowerPoint presentations ) .
They will also provide some knowledge transfer to internal employees that are new to a specific technology .
On the other side , the goal of agile coaching is more often to improve behavioral skills .
Sport teams provide the first example of a coaching role that could come to your mind .
There are however some differences .
The agile coach aims at producing a self - organizing team and he acts only when issues occur to suggest solutions .
The sport coach has authority over teams .
He directs players ’ roles and activities , although you should not minimize the roles of players as leaders especially in professional teams .
The situation of coach of individual champions is also different , as the athlete usually chooses them … and fires them also .
The current agile adoption trend favors coaching and the economic crisis could be a catalyst to change work practices .
However , I have few illusions that most of the corporations ’ managers are truly embracing agile values .
Getting up in higher management is still predominantly a power struggle , with more political consideration than the goal to empower employees .
Many managers ’ main objective is to justify their job ( did you ever wonder why there are so many meetings ? ) and creating a self - organizing team is not intuitively something that helps to achieve this goal .
Upper managers mostly do n’t care about the type of software development process .
They want working software applications delivered quickly and for a minimum cost .
They will pay for Agile practices as long as they think that it could provide what they want and “ cure ” the problems that they attribute to their current software development model .
They did the same thing before with Structured Analysis , Information Engineering , RAD , Object Orientation , CMM , ISO 9000 or UML – RUP ( you can add your own silver bullet approach in this list ) .
The name of “ coach ” or “ consultant ” can be used for external help , but ultimately companies will pay for people that deliver short term results and improving developers working condition is not always included in the list of valuable results .
This is sad for Agile and developers as it could be one of the few approaches that value “ Individuals and interactions over processes and tools “ .
Oven -Fried Onion Rings
These oven - fried onion rings are less mess than the deep - fried version , but just as crunchy and delicious !
Yesterday , I teased you with a recipe for a copycat version of the dipping sauce that is served alongside the bloomin ’ onions at Outback Steakhouse … today I ’m back with a killer recipe for oven - fried onion rings .
All of the fabulous flavor and crunch but without the hassle of deep frying !
These onion rings are absolutely delicious – crunchy and full of authentic fried flavor without needing to actually boil a vat of oil and smell up the house .
I baked them up for an appetizer a couple of Sundays ago and everyone absolutely raved about them – they could n’t believe how crunchy they were , and all agreed that the accompanying dipping sauce definitely put them over the top .
The secret to these amazing onion rings ?
The breading is made from crushed saltines and kettle - cooked potato chips !
The saltines help to absorb extra grease from the potato chips , which keeps them from becoming too oily while still retaining a great “ fried ” consistency and flavor .
Genius !
I also love that the seasonings ( cayenne , salt and pepper ) are added to the buttermilk mixture instead of the initial flour dusting .
I think this helps give the onion rings great flavor , as the buttermilk batter adheres in a much more pronounced way than the initial dusting of flour does .
If I have n’t convinced you that these are amazing , I have a killer recipe for beer - battered onion rings that ’s amazing , but I think you ’ll be pleasantly surprised by how great this recipe is .
More than one person said that these were the best onion rings they ’d ever had !

Oven -Fried Onion Rings Servings 4 to 6 servings Prep 45 minutes Cook 15 minutes Total 1 hour Course : Side Dish Cuisine : American Author : Michelle
These oven - fried onion rings are less mess than the deep - fried version , but just as crunchy and delicious !
Ingredients : ½ cup all - purpose flour , divided
1 egg ( at room temperature )
½ cup buttermilk , at room temperature
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
30 saltine crackers
4 cups kettle - cooked potato chips
2 large yellow onions ( cut into ½-inch rings , discarding any less than 2 inches in diameter )
6 tablespoons vegetable oil US Customary - Metric Directions : Adjust oven racks to lower - middle and upper - middle positions and heat oven to 450 degrees F . Place ¼ cup of the flour in a shallow baking dish .
Whisk the egg and buttermilk together in a bowl .
Whisk the remaining ¼ cup flour , salt , pepper and cayenne into the buttermilk mixture .
Pulse the saltines and potato chips together in a food processor until finely ground ; about 8 to 10 pulses .
Place the crumb mixture in a second shallow baking dish .
Working one at a time , dredge each onion ring in flour , shaking off excess .
Dip rings in buttermilk mixture , allowing excess to drip back into bowl , then drop into crumb coating , turning rings to coat evenly .
Transfer coated onion rings to a large plate or tray .
Pour 3 tablespoons oil onto each of two rimmed baking sheets .
Place the baking sheets in oven and heat until just smoking , about 8 minutes .
Carefully tilt the heated sheets to coat evenly with oil , then arrange onion rings on the sheets .
Bake , flipping onion rings and switching and rotating position of baking sheets halfway through baking , until golden brown on both sides , about 15 minutes .
Briefly drain onion rings on paper towel - lined plate .
Serve immediately .
Recipe Notes : Note :
The onion rings can be breaded in advance and refrigerated for up to an hour .
Let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before baking them ; if baked while still chilled from the refrigerator , the onions will not cook enough to soften and will remain crunchy .

Ben Bernanke Wins Second Term As Federal Reserve Chief
The Senate vote follows intense criticism of Bernanke 's role in crisis .
WASHINGTON , Jan. 28 , 2010  -- Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke was reconfirmed by the Senate today to a second term as the head of the central bank after surviving weeks of bipartisan criticism for his failure to see the emerging financial crisis that triggered the worst recession since the Great Depression .
The final vote to reconfirm was 70 - 30 .
At the start of the month Bernanke seemed a surefire bet to win the support of lawmakers after he passed a committee vote and was elected TIME magazine 's man of the year .
But that all changed when the Democrats lost a crucial Senate seat in Massachusetts , in part due to widespread populist backlash about the nation 's ongoing recession .
Support for Bernanke suddenly dwindled .
Detractors multiplied .
Even as lawmakers today debated a second term for Bernanke , opposition to the Fed chief brought together some strange bedfellows on Capitol Hill .
" I think this is probably the biggest mistake we 're going to make in a long time , " Sen . Jim DeMint , R - S.C. , warned his colleagues before the vote .
Across the aisle Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , agreed .
" I think people have to be held accountable for their actions along the way , " Boxer said .
" Chairman Bernanke has to be held accountable for his . "
But confirmation was assured after his nomination survived a Senate cloture vote 73 - 27 , blocking any chance for a filibuster .
Bernanke 's critics have claimed that the Fed chief did not do enough to prevent the nation 's financial meltdown in the fall of 2008 .
While even some of his supporters shared that view , Bernanke eventually won the backing of lawmakers who argued that the central bank boss may have helped avert a second Great Depression .
" He basically allowed the Fed to become the lender of the nation , " said Sen. Judd Gregg , R - N.H .
" The way he did it was extraordinary in its creativity and the results were that the country 's financial system did not collapse .
And many Americans , every day Americans ' lives were not fundamentally disrupted because of the actions of chairman Bernanke . "
With the country 's economy on the verge of a full - scale collapse in the fall of 2008 , Bernanke and other policy - makers in Washington led the charge for massive government intervention .
The Fed has since spent trillions on economic rescue programs .
Bernanke was first appointed Fed chairman four years ago by President Bush .
Last August President Obama interrupted his summer vacation on Martha 's Vineyard to nominate the central bank chief to a second term .
It was the possibility of President Obama nominating someone else should Bernanke lose today 's vote that prompted the number - two Republican in the Senate to support the Fed boss .
" I must vote to reconfirm chairman Bernanke simply because I am concerned that another nominee chosen by President Obama would be less independent than chairman Bernanke and would direct the Federal Reserve 's resources to support the administration 's policy interests , " said Sen. Jon Kyl. R - Ariz .
Bernanke 's first term at the Fed was set to expire on Sunday .
His unexpectedly close reconfirmation fight had sent shivers through the stock market in the past week .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended last week down 5 percent when doubts about Bernanke 's chances began to emerge .
As the vote came closer on Thursday , the market improved from its earlier lows for the day .
A handful of lawmakers had even placed a hold on Bernanke 's reconfirmation , meaning that it took 60 votes for the Senate to break a filibuster and move on to the final vote .
Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders from Vermont , one of the lawmakers who insisted on a procedural vote , railed on the Senate floor today , " I think ordinary people do not understand ?
average Americans have a hard time understanding how we reward failure , how we say to somebody who was asleep at the switch in terms of regulating our financial institutions , ' Congratulations , you failed ?
there 's a major recession .
You 're getting reconfirmed . ' "
Bernanke also found himself under fire on the opposite side of Capitol Hill earlier this week for his role in the government 's record $ 182 billion rescue of AIG .
According to an e-mail cited Tuesday by Sen. Jim Bunning , R - Ky. , and confirmed by a whistleblower speaking to Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif. , staff at the central bank in September 2008 " recommended that the Federal Reserve not touch AIG " and " did not agree " with Bernanke 's support for the bailout .
On Wednesday lawmakers on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing on the insurance giant 's controversial bailout .
Although Bernanke did not testify before the panel , the hearing 's contentious exchanges and vitriolic criticisms demonstrated the intense emotions and divided opinions that lawmakers and the general public have about the government 's efforts to save the economy .
But ultimately it appeared that lawmakers after a last - minute weekend push by White House officials concluded that to change direction at the Fed with the country 's economic recovery still in jeopardy would have been too risky a move .
To leave the Federal Reserve without a leader right now would be " beyond shameful , " said Senate Banking Committee chairman Chris Dodd , D - Conn .
" It would be the height of irresponsibility . "
While the Fed chief today won a second term , the central bank may now lose some of its power .
Dodd , for instance , has unveiled financial regulatory reform legislation that would strip the Fed of some of its consumer protection responsibilities .

The famous naturalist and his furry friend are inseparable from the day Brutus was a 2 weeks old cub .
Casey saved the bear from an overpopulated wildlife park , and raised him with lot of attention , love and respect .
Brutus the bear is living in a sanctuary that Casey built so he can freely live like a grizzly bear is supposed to live .
Being around Brutus is not dangerous because he is comfortable around people , but Casey is still not letting anybody have physical contact with Brutus but himself .
He is not afraid that the bear will ever attack him because he knows and predicts his every move .
The two of them are so close that Brutus was Casey ’s best man at his wedding
Favorite things that Brutus likes to do is to sleep , play with other grizzly bears , eat marshmallows and Twinkies , and get attention from people , especially when he “ flirts ” with women .
He is really comic and intelligent , and will always do something silly to make everybody laugh .
Casey and Brutus are actually having their own show on National Geographics that ’s called “ Expedition Grizzly “ .
There are several other people that have wild animals as pets , like a hyena or a baboon .
Russia gets the first Olympic win over Latvia ( Photo © Getty Images )
Russia got an easy win in the first game of the 2010 Olympics against Latvia .
Team Russia did n’t look overly impressive , most likely saving some energy for the games against better opponents .
Alexander Ovechkin and Danis Zaripov scored two goals each in team Russia ’s 8 - 2 win .
KHL players got the first two goals of the match .
Danis Zaripov opened the score after a couple of minutes thanks a great pass by Sergei Fedorov , while Alexander Radulov made it a 2 - 0 game at 7:46 .
Alexander Ovechkin scored the third goal for Russia with only thirty seconds to go in the first period .
In the second period Russia relaxed and left little room to Lavtia .
They scored only one goal , with Evgeni Malkin .
The third stanza has been more frenetic , at least on its start .
Latvia stripped out Evgeny Nabokov of the shut out with a goal by Herberts Vasiljevs .
After this goal Russia pushed the gas and got three quick goals , with Ovechkin , Zaripov and Ilya Kovalchuk .
A quick shot by Gints Ankipans surprised Nabokov for the 7 - 2 .
Alexei Morozov scored the eight goal for Russia with just about one minute to play .
Evgeni Nabokov stopped 18 shots for Russia .
Team Russia ’s next match will be on February 18th against Team Slovakia .
Was Sen. Scott Brown ( R - MA ) rationalizing the Joe Stack ’s anti-tax plane attack down in Texas today in an interview with Neil Cavuto ?
I ’m not sure that ’s exactly it .
But he did seem weirdly close to describing the incident as another example of the voter frustration that sent him to Washington .
I ’m curious to know what you think .
Let me know .
Transcript after the jump …
Well it ’s certainly tragic and I feel for the families obviously being affected by it .
And I do n’t know if it ’s related , but I can just sense not only in my election , but since being here in Washington , people are frustrated .
They want transparency , they want their elected officials to be accountable and open and talk about the things that are affecting their daily lives .
So I ’m not sure that there ’s a connection , I certainly hope not .
But we need to do things better .
Cavuto :
Um , you know invariably people are going to look at this and say , well , that ’s where some of this populist rage gets you .
Is n’t that a bit extreme ?
Brown :
Well , yeah , of course it ’s extreme .
You do n’t know anything about the individual .
He could have had other issues , certainly .
No one likes paying taxes , obviously .
But the way we ’re trying to deal with things and have been in the past , at least until I got here is , there ’s such a logjam in Washington .
And people want us to do better .
They want us to help solve the problems that are affecting Americans in a very real way .
And I think we , I ’m hopeful that we can do that , with a lot of the things that are coming forward .
At least what I ’m hearing through , and speaking with my colleagues this seems to be a diff feel there ’s kind of a message that was sent with my election , the fact that I was elected by a substantial margin taking the former Ted Kennedy ’s seat .
They want difference up here and I ’m hopeful that ’s going to happen .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States has expanded land - and sea - based missile defense systems in and around the Gulf to counter what it sees as Iran ’s growing missile threat , U.S. officials said .

The deployments include expanded land - based Patriot defensive missile installations in Kuwait , Qatar , UAE and Bahrain , as well as Navy ships with missile defense systems within striking distance in and around the Mediterranean , officials said .
General David Petraeus , who as head of U.S. Central Command is responsible for military operations across the Middle East , said this month that the United States has stationed eight Patriot missile batteries in four Gulf countries , which he did not identify .
The buildup began under the Bush administration , but has expanded under President Barack Obama , who is pushing for a new round of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program .
Officials said the expansion was meant to increase protection for U.S. forces and key allies in the Gulf .
The chairman of the U.S. military ’s Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , said last month the Pentagon must have military options ready to counter Iran should Obama call for them .
“ The chairman has made it clear many times that he remains concerned about the ballistic missile threat posed by Iran , but it would be inappropriate to discuss any mitigation or defense measures we might have in place to deter / defeat that threat , ” a spokesman for Mullen said .
Obama announced a revised missile defense system last year that included the deployment of Aegis ships equipped with missile interceptors to help defend Europe and U.S. forces against Iranian rockets .
The Pentagon said it envisioned keeping three ships at any given time in and around the Mediterranean and the North Sea to protect areas of interest , with the possibility of sending additional ships to the region as needed .
The Obama administration said the decision to change plans was based mainly on technological developments and a shift in intelligence assessments to meet short - and medium - range missile threats posed by Iran .
Pentagon officials said deploying ships with SM - 3 interceptors , made by Raytheon Co. , would provide the flexibility to move U.S. missile defense capabilities as may be needed .
Ships with Aegis interceptor systems are capable of blowing up ballistic missiles above the atmosphere .
The system can track over 100 targets , military officials said .
After a recent surge of male ' pick - up schools ' , one has now started for women .
Helen Croydon hones her seduction skills in the busy bars of central London
Five of us sit huddled round a notebook and a bottle of pink cava in a quiet corner of a busy bar in Leicester Square , central London .
It is 6 pm on a Friday and it is starting to fill with men and women in office attire .
" So who are you targeting , Helen ? " Gulp .
" Erm , well , I have n't looked around yet . "
I am immediately chastised .
Concentrating on immediate company and not looking over shoulders to scan rooms is , in flirting school , a D minus .
Sue Ostler , a flirt coach and the author of four relationship manuals , has started a weekly learn - on - the - job flirting tour of the heaving bars of London 's West End .
During our briefing , we are warned of our male rivals who operate in the same territory .
The so - called Pick - Up Artists crawl Friday night bars in small tuition groups with a guide to talk them through pulling tactics .
The phenomenon caught on in the UK after the success of Neil Strauss 's memoir , The Game .
" You can smell them when you enter a bar , " Ostler says .
" They home in on anyone without a male by their side and come up with cringeworthy lines .
We wo n't do that .
We are focusing on our personalities and developing a sense of warmth and likeability . "
Tonight , we are told , is not about getting a date , but about practising .
It does n't matter who we approach or if they are our type .
We just need guinea pigs on whom to test Ostler 's theory , which she is now explaining over a second glass of fizz .
Apparently , it 's all about exuding a lively , approachable vibe .
" It 's Friday night , look like you 're having fun ! " we are told .
Sitting down is not allowed , as that " puts us out of reach " .
We have to smile a lot and look confident , yet relaxed .
We should take in our surroundings in case we want them to be conversation openers .
Is there a jukebox ?
Is anyone drinking a cocktail that we can comment on ?
We should never embark on a night out without an accessory that could invite someone to open a conversation - a hat or a striking necklace , for instance .
Most importantly , we need to make plenty of eye contact : " We instinctively look away when our eyes lock with a stranger .
Tonight you are going to hold it for five seconds , smile , maybe even wink , and see what happens , " Ostler instructs .
I am absolutely terrified .
At crowded bar number one , Ostler unleashes us into the crowd : " Go ! " She follows behind to observe our amateur tactics .
Instead of staring straight ahead , as I would usually , I smile at a man to my left .
Disastrously , the crowds prevent me from continuing forward , so I am stuck awkwardly next to him and do n't know where to look .
My smile worked , though , because he opens a conversation .
I lean back , away from his vodka breath .
" No ! " growls Ostler in my ear .
" You need to lean inwards .
Think friendly , warm , welcoming persona . "
I obediently endure three minutes of his slurring .
It 's practice , remember .
In the next - thankfully quieter - location , I select a clean - cut business type as my practice piece .
He is deep in conversation , so I walk straight past .
How can I infiltrate that ?
Ostler is unimpressed : " You should have made a detour to walk past him .
Why did you walk around that other guy ?
You could have tapped him on the shoulder , smiled and said excuse me and gently squeezed past .
Go back . "
I protest on the grounds that he has obviously seen us conspiring .
But I am forced .
Despite my flirting being under duress , it works again .
On my return journey , the clean - cut suit stops his conversation and asks : " Are you looking for your friends ? "
Cue a conversation .
Ostler has a formula for the conversation stage : A - E - I - O - U. A is for ask lots of questions .
E is for ears to listen , rather than talk .
I is for the essence of ' I ' - making sure your personality oozes out .
O is for Oh my God - showing some animation and a human side .
U is for you - the person you are talking to - making them the focus of conversation .
The theory behind girl flirt school is very different to the equivalent male camp .
Groups such as puatraining.com , which teach wannabe Romeos on the ground in real bar settings , draw their technique from that described in Strauss 's book .
The core skill seems to be sickly sweet one - liners , and success is judged on getting a girl into bed .
I witnessed this theory put into practise when we bumped into a suspected group of trainee pick - up artists in our final bar .
No sooner had I taken off my coat than a guy who looked about 12 approached me : " Your shoes match the colour of your dress exactly - I 'm impressed . "
It was said with laughingly manufactured charm , but it was so assertive it was hard not to respond , so there must be something to the tactic .
Thankfully Ostler came to my rescue .
" He 's one of them .
Stay away . "
The 12 - year - old shrugged and moved on to a nearby brunette .
Ostler claims that learning to flirt should have a far higher - reaching aim than getting someone 's phone number .
" It is about lighting the spark to your personality and letting people see it shine through .
Flirting opens yourself up to new people and opportunities .
What I teach helps ladies socially and in work situations . "
It seems then that flirting is more about learning to be liked , not learning to be fancied .
From what I saw , the pick - up theory for the boys is far less advanced .

Though comets are thought to be some of the oldest , most primitive bodies in the solar system , new research on comet Wild 2 indicates that inner solar system material was transported to the comet - forming region at least 1.7 million years after the formation of the oldest solar system solids .
The research by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory scientists and colleagues provides the first constraint on the age of cometary material from a known comet .
The findings are published in the Feb. 25 edition of Science Express .
The NASA Stardust mission to comet Wild 2 , which launched in 1999 , was designed around the premise that comets preserve pristine remnants of materials that helped form the solar system .
In 2006 , Stardust returned with the first samples from a comet .
Though the mission was expected to provide a unique glimpse into the early solar system by returning a mix of solar system condensates , amorphous grains from the interstellar medium and true stardust ( crystalline grains originating in distant stars ) , the initial results painted a different picture .
Instead , the comet materials consisted of high - temperature materials including calcium - aluminum rich inclusions ( CAIs ) , the oldest objects formed in the solar nebula .
These objects form in the inner regions of the solar nebula and are common in meteorites .
Corresponding false color mineral map overlaid on a montage of brightfield Transmission Electron Microscope ( TEM ) images .
The presence of CAIs in comet Wild 2 indicates that the formation of the solar system included mixing over radial distances much greater than has been recognized by scientists in the past .
" The inner solar system material in Wild 2 underscores the importance of radial transport of material over large distances in the early solar nebula , " said lead author Jennifer Matzel of the Laboratory 's Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Science and the Glenn T. Seaborg Institute .
" These findings also raise key questions regarding the timescale of the formation of comets and the relationship between Wild 2 and other primitive solar nebula objects . "
Analysis showed that the inner solar system materials formed 1.7 million years after the onset of CAI formation .

It has won 21 Emmies , five Golden Globes and even been parodied by Hillary Clinton in her presidential campaign ; reasons enough to explain why The Sopranos – the violent and compelling tale of murderous New Jersey mobsters – has been voted the greatest TV drama series of all time by a panel of Guardian TV critics .
Second place went to Brideshead Revisited , ITV's 1981 11 - part adaptation of Evelyn Waugh 's novel about nobility , religion and romance .
In 2000 the BFI placed it 10th in its 100 greatest TV programmes .
The Wire – the HBO network 's widely praised and much discussed study of ­Baltimore street life – only managed to make it to No 14 .
Sex and the City did not even make the top 50 , just scraping to 51st place , behind Grange Hill .
Other drama series often acclaimed as classics , such as I , Claudius , also failed to make the list .
Ahead of some of the great contemporary US drama that has attracted praise and fans in the last 10 years came a raft of British drama from the 1980s and 1990s : Our Friends in the North , A Very Peculiar Practice , Talking Heads , The Singing Detective , Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit and Boys from the Blackstuff .
Mad Men , the saga of 1960s New York advertising executives , made the No 4 slot .
The seven regular Guardian TV writers , who individually rated the shows , praised The Sopranos ' original , absorbing and " affectionate take on family values " .
The series stars James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano , a mobster in therapy , and Edie Falco as his wife , Carmela .
Nancy Banks - Smith called it " ancient Rome with good jokes " .
But they also rated Brideshead highly .
" You do n't realise at the time what goodies you 've got , " said Banks - Smith .
" I remember watching it in a preview theatre with [ the critic ]
Sean Day - Lewis , who stood up and said ' This is what TV was born for ' , and then stormed out .
We all came round to it rather more slowly . "
" It 's the most beautiful thing that 's ever been on TV , " said Sarah Dempster .
" It 's exquisite in every way .
The dialogue is incredibly well written . "
Charles Sturridge , the Bafta - winning director of the adaptation , declared himself delighted that the series was in " honourable company " with the mafia drama .
The reason for its enduring appeal ?
" It was n't bowing to a particular fashion of the day .
It was quite unlikely that it would be popular at the time .
It had an integrity that survives and that 's perhaps what other programmes on the list show . "
" Some visitors have written me emails , accusing me of being cruel to my rabbit and that I am abusing my pet .
This was never my intention when I included numerous links to photographs , showing Oolong 's unique ability to hold objects on his head .
This is not a site to mock rabbits , or demonstrate animal abuse . "

Surprise attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy on the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor in Hawaii
Coordinates :
The Attack on Pearl Harbor[nb 3 ] [ 11 ] was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service upon the United States ( a neutral country at the time ) against the naval base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu , Territory of Hawaii , just before 08:00 , on Sunday morning , December 7 , 1941 .
The attack led to the United States ' formal entry into World War II the next day .
The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI , [ 12 ] [ 13 ] and as Operation Z during its planning . [ 14 ]
Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States .
Over the course of seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S. - held Philippines , Guam , and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya , Singapore , and Hong Kong . [ 15 ]
The attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time ( 18:18 GMT ) .[nb 4 ] [ 16 ]
The base was attacked by 353 [ 17 ]
Imperial Japanese aircraft ( including fighters , level and dive bombers , and torpedo bombers ) in two waves , launched from six aircraft carriers . [ 17 ]
Of the eight U.S. Navy battleships present , all were damaged , with four sunk .
All but USS Arizona were later raised , and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war .
The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training ship , [ nb 5 ] and one minelayer .
A total of 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed ; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded . [ 19 ]
Important base installations such as the power station , dry dock , shipyard , maintenance , and fuel and torpedo storage facilities , as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building ( also home of the intelligence section ) were not attacked .
Japanese losses were light : 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost , and 64 servicemen killed .
Kazuo Sakamaki , the commanding officer of one of the submarines , was captured . [ 20 ]
Japan announced a declaration of war on the United States later that day ( December 8 in Tokyo ) , but the declaration was not delivered until the following day .
The following day , December 8 , Congress declared war on Japan .
On December 11 , Germany and Italy each declared war on the U.S. , which responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy .
There were numerous historical precedents for the unannounced military action by Japan , but the lack of any formal warning , particularly while peace negotiations were still apparently ongoing , led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7 , 1941 , " a date which will live in infamy " .
Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning , the attack on Pearl Harbor was later judged in the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime . [ 21 ] [ 22 ]
Background to conflict
Diplomatic background
War between Japan and the United States had been a possibility that each nation had been aware of , and planned for , since the 1920s .
The relationship between the two countries was cordial enough that they remained trading partners . [ 23 ] [ 24 ]
Tensions did not seriously grow until Japan 's invasion of Manchuria in 1931 .
Over the next decade , Japan expanded into China , leading to the Second Sino - Japanese War in 1937 .
Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and endeavored to secure enough independent resources to attain victory on the mainland .
The " Southern Operation " was designed to assist these efforts . [ 25 ]
Pearl Harbor on October 30 , 1941 , looking southwest
Starting in December 1937 , events such as the Japanese attack on USS Panay , the Allison incident , and the Nanking Massacre swung Western public opinion sharply against Japan .
Fearing Japanese expansion , [ 26 ] the United States , United Kingdom , and France assisted China with its loans for war supply contracts .[ citation needed ]
In 1940 , Japan invaded French Indochina , attempting to stymie the flow of supplies reaching China .
The United States halted shipments of airplanes , parts , machine tools , and aviation gasoline to Japan , which the latter perceived as an unfriendly act . [nb 6 ]
The United States did not stop oil exports , however , partly because of the prevailing sentiment in Washington that given Japanese dependence on American oil , such an action was likely to be considered an extreme provocation . [ 27 ] [ 24 ] [ 28 ]
In mid-1940 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Hawaii . [ 29 ]
He also ordered a military buildup in the Philippines , taking both actions in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East .
Because the Japanese high command was ( mistakenly ) certain any attack on the United Kingdom 's Southeast Asian colonies , including Singapore , [ 30 ] would bring the U.S. into the war , a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to prevent American naval interference . [ 31 ]
An invasion of the Philippines was also considered necessary by Japanese war planners .
The U.S. War Plan Orange had envisioned defending the Philippines with an elite force of 40,000 men ; this option was never implemented due to opposition from Douglas MacArthur , who felt he would need a force ten times that size .[ citation needed ]
By 1941 , U.S. planners expected to abandon the Philippines at the outbreak of war .
Late that year , Admiral Thomas C. Hart , commander of the Asiatic Fleet , was given orders to that effect . [ 32 ]
The U.S. finally ceased oil exports to Japan in July 1941 , following the seizure of French Indochina after the Fall of France , in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption . [ 33 ]
Because of this decision , Japan proceeded with plans to take the oil - rich Dutch East Indies . [nb 7 ]
On August 17 , Roosevelt warned Japan that America was prepared to take opposing steps if " neighboring countries " were attacked . [ 35 ]
The Japanese were faced with a dilemma – either withdraw from China and lose face , or seize new sources of raw materials in the resource - rich European colonies of Southeast Asia.[ citation needed ]
Japan and the U.S. engaged in negotiations during 1941 , attempting to improve relations .
In the course of these negotiations , Japan offered to withdraw from most of China and Indochina after making peace with the Nationalist government .
It also proposed to adopt an independent interpretation of the Tripartite Pact and to refrain from trade discrimination , provided all other nations reciprocated .
Washington rejected these proposals .
Japanese Prime Minister Konoye then offered to meet with Roosevelt , but Roosevelt insisted on reaching an agreement before any meeting . [ 36 ]
The U.S. ambassador to Japan repeatedly urged Roosevelt to accept the meeting , warning that it was the only way to preserve the conciliatory Konoye government and peace in the Pacific . [ 37 ]
However , his recommendation was not acted upon .
The Konoye government collapsed the following month , when the Japanese military rejected a withdrawal of all troops from China . [ 38 ]
Japan 's final proposal , delivered on November 20 , offered to withdraw from southern Indochina and to refrain from attacks in Southeast Asia , so long as the United States , United Kingdom , and Netherlands supplied one million gallons of aviation fuel , lifted their sanctions against Japan , and ceased aid to China . , [ 39 ] [ 38 ]
The American counter - proposal of November 26 ( November 27 in Japan ) , the Hull note , required Japan completely evacuate China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with Pacific powers .
On November 26 in Japan , the day before the note 's delivery , the Japanese task force left port for Pearl Harbor .[ citation needed ]
The Japanese intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States .
Over the course of seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S. - held Philippines , Guam , and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya , Singapore , and Hong Kong . [ 15 ]
Additionally , from the Japanese viewpoint , it was seen as a preemptive strike ' before the oil gauge ran empty ' . [ 27 ]
Military planning
Preliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the " Southern Resource Area " ( the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally ) had begun very early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , then commanding Japan 's Combined Fleet . [ 40 ]
He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters , including a threat to resign his command . [ 41 ]
Full - scale planning was underway by early spring 1941 , primarily by Rear Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka , with assistance from Captain Minoru Genda and Yamamoto 's Deputy Chief of Staff , Captain Kameto Kuroshima . [ 42 ]
The planners studied the 1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto intensively .
[ nb 8 ] [nb 9 ]
Over the next several months , pilots were trained , equipment was adapted , and intelligence was collected .
Despite these preparations , Emperor Hirohito did not approve the attack plan until November 5 , after the third of four Imperial Conferences called to consider the matter . [ 45 ]
Final authorization was not given by the emperor until December 1 , after a majority of Japanese leaders advised him the " Hull Note " would " destroy the fruits of the China incident , endanger Manchukuo and undermine Japanese control of Korea " . [ 46 ]
By late 1941 , many observers believed that hostilities between the U.S. and Japan were imminent .
A Gallup poll just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52 % of Americans expected war with Japan , 27 % did not , and 21 % had no opinion . [ 47 ]
While U.S. Pacific bases and facilities had been placed on alert on many occasions , U.S. officials doubted Pearl Harbor would be the first target ; instead , they expected the Philippines would be attacked first .
This presumption was due to the threat that the air bases throughout the country and the naval base at Manila posed to sea lanes , as well as to the shipment of supplies to Japan from territory to the south . [ 48 ]
They also incorrectly believed that Japan was not capable of mounting more than one major naval operation at a time . [ 49 ]
Objectives
The Japanese attack had several major aims .
First , it intended to destroy important American fleet units , thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and to enable Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference .
Second , it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 Vinson - Walsh Act erased any chance of victory . [ 50 ] [ 51 ]
Third , to deliver a blow to America 's ability to mobilize its forces in the Pacific , battleships were chosen as the main targets , since they were the prestige ships of any navy at the time . [ 50 ]
Finally , it was hoped that the attack would undermine American morale such that the U.S. government would drop its demands contrary to Japanese interests and would seek a compromise peace with Japan . [ 52 ] [ 53 ]
Striking the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor carried two distinct disadvantages : the targeted ships would be in very shallow water , so it would be relatively easy to salvage and possibly repair them , and most of the crews would survive the attack , since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor .
A further important disadvantage was the absence from Pearl Harbor of all three of the U.S. Pacific Fleet 's aircraft carriers ( Enterprise , Lexington , and Saratoga ) .
IJN top command was attached to Admiral Mahan's " decisive battle " doctrine , especially that of destroying the maximum number of battleships .
Despite these concerns , Yamamoto decided to press ahead . [ 54 ] [ page needed ]
Japanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short , victorious war also meant other targets in the harbor , especially the navy yard , oil tank farms , and submarine base , were ignored , since — by their thinking — the war would be over before the influence of these facilities would be felt . [ 55 ]
Approach and attack
Route followed by the Japanese fleet to Pearl Harbor and back
On November 26 , 1941 , a Japanese task force ( the Striking Force ) of six aircraft carriers — Akagi , Kaga , Sōryū , Hiryū , Shōkaku , and Zuikaku — departed Hittokapu Bay on Kasatka ( now Iterup ) Island in the Kurile Islands , en route to a position northwest of Hawaii , intending to launch its 408 aircraft to attack Pearl Harbor : 360 for the two attack waves and 48 on defensive combat air patrol ( CAP ) , including nine fighters from the first wave .
The first wave was to be the primary attack , while the second wave was to attack carriers as its first objective and cruisers as its second , with battleships as the third target . [ 56 ]
The first wave carried most of the weapons to attack capital ships , mainly specially adapted Type 91 aerial torpedoes which were designed with an anti-roll mechanism and a rudder extension that let them operate in shallow water . [ 57 ]
The aircrews were ordered to select the highest value targets ( battleships and aircraft carriers ) or , if these were not present , any other high value ships ( cruisers and destroyers ) .
First wave dive bombers were to attack ground targets .
Fighters were ordered to strafe and destroy as many parked aircraft as possible to ensure they did not get into the air to intercept the bombers , especially in the first wave .
When the fighters ' fuel got low they were to refuel at the aircraft carriers and return to combat .
Fighters were to serve CAP duties where needed , especially over U.S. airfields .[ citation needed ]
Before the attack commenced , the Imperial Japanese Navy launched reconnaissance floatplanes from cruisers Chikuma and Tone , one to scout over Oahu and the other over Lahaina Roads , Maui , respectively , with orders to report on U.S. fleet composition and location . [ 58 ]
Reconnaissance aircraft flights risked alerting the U.S. , [ 59 ] and were not necessary .
U.S. fleet composition and preparedness information in Pearl Harbor were already known due to the reports of the Japanese spy Takeo Yoshikawa .
A report of the absence of the U.S. fleet in Lahaina anchorage off Maui was received from the Tone 's floatplane and fleet submarine I - 72 . [ 60 ]
Another four scout planes patrolled the area between the Japanese carrier force ( the Kidō Butai ) and Niihau , to detect any counterattack . [ 61 ]
Submarines
Fleet submarines I - 16 , I - 18 , I - 20 , I - 22 , and I - 24 each embarked a Type A midget submarine for transport to the waters off Oahu . [ 62 ]
The five I - boats left Kure Naval District on November 25 , 1941 . [ 63 ]
On December 6 , they came to within 10 nmi ( 19 km ; 12 mi ) of the mouth of Pearl Harbor [ 64 ] and launched their midget subs at about 01:00 local time on December 7 . [ 65 ]
At 03:42 Hawaiian Time , the minesweeper Condor spotted a midget submarine periscope southwest of the Pearl Harbor entrance buoy and alerted the destroyer Ward . [ 66 ] [ 67 ]
The midget may have entered Pearl Harbor .
However , Ward sank another midget submarine at 06:37 [ 67 ] [ nb 10 ] in the first American shots in the Pacific Theater .
A midget submarine on the north side of Ford Island missed the seaplane tender Curtiss with her first torpedo and missed the attacking destroyer Monaghan with her other one before being sunk by Monaghan at 08:43 . [ 67 ]
A third midget submarine , Ha -19 , grounded twice , once outside the harbor entrance and again on the east side of Oahu , where it was captured on December 8 . [ 69 ]
Ensign Kazuo Sakamaki swam ashore and was captured by Hawaii National Guard Corporal David Akui , becoming the first Japanese prisoner of war . [ nb 11 ]
A fourth had been damaged by a depth charge attack and was abandoned by its crew before it could fire its torpedoes . [ 70 ]
Japanese forces received a radio message from a midget submarine at 00:41 on December 8 claiming damage to one or more large warships inside Pearl Harbor . [ 71 ]
In 1992 , 2000 , and 2001 , Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory 's submersibles found the wreck of the fifth midget submarine lying in three parts outside Pearl Harbor .
The wreck was in the debris field where much surplus U.S. equipment was dumped after the war , including vehicles and landing craft .
Both of its torpedoes were missing .
This correlates with reports of two torpedoes fired at the light cruiser St. Louis at 10:04 at the entrance of Pearl Harbor , and a possible torpedo fired at destroyer Helm at 08:21 . [ 72 ]
Japanese declaration of war
The attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan , but this was not Admiral Yamamoto 's intention .
He originally stipulated that the attack should not commence until thirty minutes after Japan had informed the United States that peace negotiations were at an end . [ 73 ]
However , the attack began before the notice could be delivered .
Tokyo transmitted the 5000 - word notification ( commonly called the " 14 - Part Message " ) in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington .
Transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it on schedule ; in the event , it was not presented until more than an hour after the attack began .
( In fact , U.S. code breakers had already deciphered and translated most of the message hours before he was scheduled to deliver it . ) [ 74 ]
The final part is sometimes described as a declaration of war .
While it was viewed by a number of senior U.S government and military officials as a very strong indicator negotiations were likely to be terminated [ 75 ] and that war might break out at any moment , [ 76 ] it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations .
A declaration of war was printed on the front page of Japan 's newspapers in the evening edition of December 8 ( late December 7 in the U.S. ) , [ 77 ] but not delivered to the U.S. government until the day after the attack .
For decades , conventional wisdom held that Japan attacked without first formally breaking diplomatic relations only because of accidents and bumbling that delayed the delivery of a document hinting at war to Washington .
In 1999 , however , Takeo Iguchi , a professor of law and international relations at International Christian University in Tokyo , discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how , and indeed whether , to notify Washington of Japan 's intention to break off negotiations and start a war , including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying , " [ O ] ur deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success . "
Of this , Iguchi said , " The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war , or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations ... and they clearly prevailed . " [ 78 ] [ 79 ]
In any event , even if the Japanese had decoded and delivered the 14 - Part Message before the beginning of the attack , it would not have constituted either a formal break of diplomatic relations or a declaration of war .
The final two paragraphs of the message read :
Thus the earnest hope of the Japanese Government to adjust Japanese - American relations and to preserve and promote the peace of the Pacific through cooperation with the American Government has finally been lost .
The Japanese Government regrets to have to notify hereby the American Government that in view of the attitude of the American Government it cannot but consider that it is impossible to reach an agreement through further negotiations . [ 80 ]

The first attack wave of 183 planes was launched north of Oahu , led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida . [ 81 ]
Six planes failed to launch due to technical difficulties . [ 61 ]
The first attack included three groups of planes : [ nb 12 ]
As the first wave approached Oahu , it was detected by the U.S. Army SCR - 270 radar at Opana Point near the island 's northern tip .
This post had been in training mode for months , but was not yet operational . [ 84 ]
The operators , Privates George Elliot Jr. and Joseph Lockard , reported a target . [ 85 ]
But Lieutenant Kermit A. Tyler , a newly assigned officer at the thinly manned Intercept Center , presumed it was the scheduled arrival of six B - 17 bombers from California .
The Japanese planes were approaching from a direction very close ( only a few degrees difference ) to the bombers , [ 86 ] and while the operators had never seen a formation as large on radar , they neglected to tell Tyler of its size . [ 87 ]
Tyler , for security reasons , could not tell the operators of the six B - 17s that were due ( even though it was widely known ) . [ 87 ]
As the first wave planes approached Oahu , they encountered and shot down several U.S. aircraft .
At least one of these radioed a somewhat incoherent warning .
Other warnings from ships off the harbor entrance were still being processed or awaiting confirmation when the attacking planes began bombing and strafing .
Nevertheless , it is not clear any warnings would have had much effect even if they had been interpreted correctly and much more promptly .
The results the Japanese achieved in the Philippines were essentially the same as at Pearl Harbor , though MacArthur had almost nine hours warning that the Japanese had already attacked Pearl Harbor .[ citation needed ]
The air portion of the attack began at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time [ 16 ] ( 3:18 a.m. December 8 Japanese Standard Time , as kept by ships of the Kido Butai ) , [ 88 ] [ nb 4 ] with the attack on Kaneohe .
A total of 353 [ 17 ]
Japanese planes in two waves reached Oahu .
Slow , vulnerable torpedo bombers led the first wave , exploiting the first moments of surprise to attack the most important ships present ( the battleships ) , while dive bombers attacked U.S. air bases across Oahu , starting with Hickam Field , the largest , and Wheeler Field , the main U.S. Army Air Forces fighter base .
The 171 planes in the second wave attacked the Army Air Forces ' Bellows Field near Kaneohe on the windward side of the island and Ford Island .
The only aerial opposition came from a handful of P - 36 Hawks , P - 40 Warhawks , and some SBD Dauntless dive bombers from the carrier Enterprise .[ citation needed ] [ nb 13 ]
A destroyed Vindicator at Ewa field , the victim of one of the smaller attacks on the approach to Pearl Harbor
In the first wave attack , about eight of the forty - nine 800 kg ( 1760 lb ) armor - piercing bombs dropped hit their intended battleship targets .
At least two of those bombs broke up on impact , another detonated before penetrating an unarmored deck , and one was a dud .
Thirteen of the forty torpedoes hit battleships , and four torpedoes hit other ships . [ 89 ]
Men aboard U.S. ships awoke to the sounds of alarms , bombs exploding , and gunfire , prompting bleary - eyed men to dress as they ran to General Quarters stations .
( The famous message , " Air raid Pearl Harbor .
This is not drill . " , [ nb 14 ] was sent from the headquarters of Patrol Wing Two , the first senior Hawaiian command to respond . )
The defenders were very unprepared .
Ammunition lockers were locked , aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip in the open to prevent sabotage , [ 90 ] guns unmanned ( none of the Navy 's 5 " / 38s , only a quarter of its machine guns , and only four of 31 Army batteries got in action ) . [ 90 ]
Despite this low alert status , many American military personnel responded effectively during the attack .[ citation needed ] [ nb 15 ] Ensign Joseph Taussig Jr. , aboard Nevada , commanded the ship 's antiaircraft guns and was severely wounded but continued to be on post .
Lt. Commander F. J. Thomas commanded Nevada in the captain 's absence and got her under way until the ship was grounded at 9:10 a.m. [ 91 ]
One of the destroyers , Aylwin , got underway with only four officers aboard , all ensigns , none with more than a year 's sea duty ; she operated at sea for 36 hours before her commanding officer managed to get back aboard . [ 92 ]
Captain Mervyn Bennion , commanding West Virginia , led his men until he was cut down by fragments from a bomb which hit Tennessee , moored alongside .[ citation needed ]
Second wave composition
The second planned wave consisted of 171 planes : 54 B5 Ns , 81 D3As , and 36 A6Ms , commanded by Lieutenant - Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki . [ 82 ]
Four planes failed to launch because of technical difficulties . [ 61 ]
This wave and its targets also comprised three groups of planes : [ 82 ]
1st Group – 54 B5 Ns armed with 550 lb ( 249 kg ) and 132 lb ( 60 kg ) general - purpose bombs [ 83 ]
27 B5 Ns – aircraft and hangars on Kaneohe , Ford Island , and Barbers Point 27 B5Ns – hangars and aircraft on Hickam Field
– 54 B5Ns armed with 550 lb ( 249 kg ) and 132 lb ( 60 kg ) general - purpose bombs 2nd Group ( targets : aircraft carriers and cruisers ) 78 D3 As armed with 550 lb ( 249 kg ) general - purpose bombs , in four sections ( 3 aborted )
( targets : aircraft carriers and cruisers ) 3rd Group – ( targets : aircraft at Ford Island , Hickam Field , Wheeler Field , Barber 's Point , Kaneohe ) 35 A6 Ms for defense and strafing ( 1 aborted )
– ( targets : aircraft at Ford Island , Hickam Field , Wheeler Field , Barber 's Point , Kaneohe )
The second wave was divided into three groups .
One was tasked to attack Kāneʻohe , the rest Pearl Harbor proper .
The separate sections arrived at the attack point almost simultaneously from several directions .
American casualties and damage
Arizona during the attack Nevada , on fire and down at the bow , attempting to leave the harbor before being deliberately beached West Virginia was sunk by six torpedoes and two bombs during the attack .
Ninety minutes after it began , the attack was over .
2,008 sailors were killed and 710 others wounded ; 218 soldiers and airmen ( who were part of the Army prior to the independent United States Air Force in 1947 ) were killed and 364 wounded ; 109 marines were killed and 69 wounded ; and 68 civilians were killed and 35 wounded .
In total , 2,403 Americans were killed , and 1,143 were wounded . [ 93 ]
Eighteen ships were sunk or run aground , including five battleships . [ 10 ] [ 94 ]
All of the Americans killed or wounded during the attack were legally non-combatants , given that there was no state of war when the attack occurred . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 95 ]
Of the American fatalities , nearly half were due to the explosion of Arizona 's forward magazine after it was hit by a modified 16 - inch ( 410 mm ) shell . [ nb 16 ]
Author Craig Nelson wrote that the vast majority of the U.S. sailors killed at Pearl Harbor were junior enlisted personnel .
" The officers of the Navy all lived in houses and the junior people were the ones on the boats , so pretty much all of the people who died in the direct line of the attack were very junior people " , Nelson said .
" So everyone is about 17 or 18 whose story is told there . " [ 96 ]
Among the notable civilian casualties were nine Honolulu Fire Department ( HFD ) firefighters who responded to Hickam Field during the bombing in Honolulu , becoming the only fire department members on American soil to be attacked by a foreign power in history .
Fireman Harry Tuck Lee Pang of Engine 6 was killed near the hangars by machine gun fire from a Japanese plane .
Captains Thomas Macy and John Carreira of Engine 4 and Engine 1 respectively died while battling flames inside the hangar after a Japanese bomb crashed through the roof .
An additional six firefighters were wounded from Japanese shrapnel .
The wounded later received Purple Hearts ( originally reserved for service members wounded by enemy action while partaking in armed conflicts ) for their peacetime heroism that day on June 13 , 1944 ; the three firefighters killed did not receive theirs until on December 7 , 1984 at the 43rd anniversary of the attack .
This made the nine men the only non-military firefighters to receive such award in U.S. history . [ 97 ]

Already damaged by a torpedo and on fire amidships , Nevada attempted to exit the harbor .
She was targeted by many Japanese bombers as she got under way and sustained more hits from 250 lb ( 113 kg ) bombs , which started further fires .
She was deliberately beached to avoid blocking the harbor entrance .
California was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes .
The crew might have kept her afloat , but were ordered to abandon ship just as they were raising power for the pumps .
Burning oil from Arizona and West Virginia drifted down on her and probably made the situation look worse than it was .
The disarmed target ship Utah was holed twice by torpedoes .
West Virginia was hit by seven torpedoes , the seventh tearing away her rudder .
Oklahoma was hit by four torpedoes , the last two above her belt armor , which caused her to capsize .
Maryland was hit by two of the converted 16 " shells , but neither caused serious damage .
Although the Japanese concentrated on battleships ( the largest vessels present ) , they did not ignore other targets .
The light cruiser Helena was torpedoed , and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer Oglala .
Two destroyers in dry dock , Cassin and Downes , were destroyed when bombs penetrated their fuel bunkers .
The leaking fuel caught fire ; flooding the dry dock in an effort to fight fire made the burning oil rise , and both were burned out .
Cassin slipped from her keel blocks and rolled against Downes .
The light cruiser Raleigh was holed by a torpedo .
The light cruiser Honolulu was damaged but remained in service .
The repair vessel Vestal , moored alongside Arizona , was heavily damaged and beached .
The seaplane tender Curtiss was also damaged .
The destroyer Shaw was badly damaged when two bombs penetrated her forward magazine . [ 98 ]
Of the 402 American aircraft in Hawaii , 188 were destroyed and 159 damaged , 155 of them on the ground . [ 17 ]
Almost none were actually ready to take off to defend the base .
Eight Army Air Forces pilots managed to get airborne during the attack , [ 99 ] and six were credited with downing at least one Japanese aircraft during the attack : 1st Lt. Lewis M. Sanders , 2nd Lt. Philip M. Rasmussen , 2nd Lt. Kenneth M. Taylor , 2nd Lt. George S. Welch , 2nd Lt. Harry W. Brown , and 2nd Lt. Gordon H. Sterling Jr. [ 100 ] [ 101 ]
Of 33 PBYs in Hawaii , 30 were destroyed and three on patrol at the time of the attack returned undamaged .
Friendly fire brought down some U.S. planes on top of that , including five from an inbound flight from Enterprise .[ citation needed ]
At the time of the attack , nine civilian aircraft were flying in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor .
Of these , three were shot down . [ 102 ]
Japanese losses
Fifty - five Japanese airmen and nine submariners were killed in the attack , and one , Kazuo Sakamaki , was captured .
Of Japan 's 414[ 82 ] available planes , 350 took part in the raid in which 29 were lost ; nine in the first wave ( three fighters , one dive bomber , and five torpedo bombers ) and 20 in the second wave ( six fighters and 14 dive bombers ) [ 103 ] [ nb 17 ] with another 74 damaged by antiaircraft fire from the ground .[ citation needed ]
Possible third wave
Several Japanese junior officers including Fuchida and Genda urged Nagumo to carry out a third strike in order to destroy as much of Pearl Harbor 's fuel and torpedo [ nb 18 ] storage , maintenance , and dry dock facilities as possible .
[ 104 ]
Genda , who had unsuccessfully advocated for invading Hawaii after the air attack , believed that without an invasion , three strikes were necessary to disable the base as much as possible .
[ 105 ]
The captains of the other five carriers in the task force reported they were willing and ready to carry out a third strike .
[ 106 ]
Military historians have suggested the destruction of these shore facilities would have hampered the U.S. Pacific Fleet far more seriously than the loss of its battleships .
[ 107 ]
If they had been wiped out , " serious [ American ] operations in the Pacific would have been postponed for more than a year " ; [ 108 ] according to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz , later Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet , " it would have prolonged the war another two years " .
[ 109 ]
Nagumo , however , decided to withdraw for several reasons :
American anti-aircraft performance had improved considerably during the second strike , and two thirds of Japan 's losses were incurred during the second wave . [ 110 ]
Nagumo felt if he launched a third strike , he would be risking three quarters of the Combined Fleet 's strength to wipe out the remaining targets ( which included the facilities ) while suffering higher aircraft losses . [ 110 ]
The location of the American carriers remained unknown .
In addition , the admiral was concerned his force was now within range of American land - based bombers . [ 110 ]
Nagumo was uncertain whether the U.S. had enough surviving planes remaining on Hawaii to launch an attack against his carriers . [ 111 ]
Nagumo was uncertain whether the U.S. had enough surviving planes remaining on Hawaii to launch an attack against his carriers .
A third wave would have required substantial preparation and turnaround time , and would have meant returning planes would have had to land at night .
At the time , only the Royal Navy had developed night carrier techniques , so this was a substantial risk . [ 112 ]
The task force 's fuel situation did not permit him to remain in waters north of Pearl Harbor much longer , since he was at the very limit of logistical support .
To do so risked running unacceptably low on fuel , perhaps even having to abandon destroyers en route home . [ 113 ]
He believed the second strike had essentially satisfied the main objective of his mission — the neutralization of the Pacific Fleet — and did not wish to risk further losses . [ 114 ]
Moreover , it was Japanese Navy practice to prefer the conservation of strength over the total destruction of the enemy . [ 115 ]
At a conference aboard his flagship the following morning , Yamamoto supported Nagumo 's withdrawal without launching a third wave . [ 114 ]
In retrospect , sparing the vital dockyards , maintenance shops , and the oil tank farm meant the U.S. could respond relatively quickly to Japanese activities in the Pacific .
Yamamoto later regretted Nagumo 's decision to withdraw and categorically stated it had been a great mistake not to order a third strike . [ 116 ]

Salvage
After a systematic search for survivors , Captain Homer N. Wallin was ordered to lead a formal salvage operation .
[ 120 ] [nb 19 ]
Around Pearl Harbor , divers from the Navy ( shore and tenders ) , the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard , and civilian contractors ( Pacific Bridge Company and others ) began work on the ships that could be refloated .
They patched holes , cleared debris , and pumped water out of ships .
Navy divers worked inside the damaged ships .
Within six months , five battleships and two cruisers were patched or refloated so they could be sent to shipyards in Pearl Harbor and on the mainland for extensive repair .[ citation needed ]
Intensive salvage operations continued for another year , a total of some 20,000 man -hours under water . [ 122 ]
Arizona and the target ship Utah were too heavily damaged for salvage and remain where they were sunk , [ 123 ] with Arizona becoming a war memorial .
Oklahoma , while successfully raised , was never repaired and capsized while under tow to the mainland in 1947 .
When feasible , armament and equipment was removed from vessels too damaged to repair and put to use aboard other craft .
News coverage
The initial announcement of the attack on Pearl Harbor was made by the White House Press Secretary , Stephen Early , at 2:22 p.m. Eastern time ( 8:52 a.m. Hawaiian time ) : " The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor from the air and all naval and military activities on the island of Oahu , principal American base in the Hawaiian islands . " [ 124 ]
As information developed , Early made a number of additional announcements to approximately 150 White House reporters over the course of the afternoon . [ 125 ]
Initial reports of the attack moved on news wires at approximately 2:25 p.m. Eastern time .
The first radio coverage ( which , at the time , represented the earliest opportunity for ordinary people to learn of the attack ) was on the CBS radio network 's scheduled news program , World News Today , at 2:30 p.m. Eastern time .
John Charles
Daly read the initial report , then switched to London , where Robert Trout ad - libbed on the possible London reaction .
The first report on NBC cut into a play , a dramatization of The Inspector - General , at 2:33 p.m. Eastern time and lasted only 21 seconds .
Unlike the later practice with major news stories , there were only brief interruptions of scheduled commercial programming . [ 126 ]
A contemporaneous newspaper report compared the attack to the Battle of Port Arthur in which the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the Imperial Russian Navy , triggering the Russo - Japanese War , 37 years prior . [ 127 ]
Modern writers have continued to note parallels between the attacks , albeit more dispassionately . [ 128 ]

Aftermath
In the wake of the attack , 15 Medals of Honor , 51 Navy Crosses , 53 Silver Stars , four Navy and Marine Corps Medals , one Distinguished Flying Cross , four Distinguished Service Crosses , one Distinguished Service Medal , and three Bronze Star Medals were awarded to the American servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat at Pearl Harbor . [ 129 ]
Additionally , a special military award , the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal , was later authorized for all military veterans of the attack .
The day after the attack , Roosevelt delivered his famous Infamy Speech to a Joint Session of Congress , calling for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan .
Congress obliged his request less than an hour later .
On December 11 , Germany and Italy declared war on the United States , even though the Tripartite Pact did not require it . [ nb 20 ]
Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day .
The UK actually declared war on Japan nine hours before the U.S. did , partially due to Japanese attacks on Malaya , Singapore , and Hong Kong , and partially due to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill 's promise to declare war " within the hour " of a Japanese attack on the United States . [ 130 ]
The attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater .
Further losses compounded the alarming setback .
Japan attacked the Philippines hours later ( because of the time difference , it was December 8 in the Philippines ) .
Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor , the battleships Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk off the coast of Malaya , causing Churchill later to recollect " In all the war I never received a more direct shock .
As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me .
There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California .
Over this vast expanse of waters Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked . " [ 131 ]
Throughout the war , Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda . [ 132 ]
One further consequence of the attack on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath ( notably the Niihau incident ) was that Japanese - American residents and citizens were relocated to nearby Japanese - American internment camps .
Within hours of the attack , hundreds of Japanese - American leaders were rounded up and taken to high - security camps such as Sand Island at the mouth of Honolulu harbor and Kilauea Military Camp on the island of Hawaii . [ 133 ] [ 134 ]
Eventually , more than 110,000 Japanese Americans , nearly all who lived on the West Coast , were forced into interior camps , but in Hawaii , where the 150,000 - plus Japanese Americans composed over one - third of the population , only 1,200 to 1,800 were interned . [ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ]
The attack also had international consequences .
The Canadian province of British Columbia , bordering the Pacific Ocean , had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their Japanese - Canadian descendants .
Pre -war tensions were exacerbated by the Pearl Harbor attack , leading to a reaction from the Government of Canada .
On February 24 , 1942 , Order- in - Council P.C. no. 1486 was passed under the War Measures Act , allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia , as well as the prohibiting them from returning to the province .
On March 4 , regulations under the Act were adopted to evacuate Japanese - Canadians . [ 138 ]
As a result , 12,000 were interned in interior camps , 2,000 were sent to road camps , and another 2,000 were forced to work in the prairies on sugar beet farms . [ 139 ]
Niihau Incident
Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi's aircraft shown ten days after it crashed
Japanese planners of the Pearl Harbor attack had determined that some means were required for rescuing fliers whose aircraft were damaged too badly to return to the carriers .
The island of Niihau , only 30 minutes flying time from Pearl Harbor , was designated as the rescue point .[ citation needed ]
The Zero flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of Hiryu was damaged in the attack on Wheeler , so he flew to the rescue point .
The aircraft was further damaged on landing .
Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiians , who , aware of the tension between the United States and Japan , took the pilot 's pistol , maps , codes , and other documents .
The island 's residents had no telephones or radios and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor .
Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese - American residents in an attempt to recover the documents .
During the ensuing struggles , Nishikaichi was killed , and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded ; one collaborator committed suicide , and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison .[ citation needed ]
The ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to Nishikaichi's assistance was a source of concern for many and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted . [ 140 ]
Strategic implications
Admiral Hara Tadaichi summed up the Japanese result by saying , " We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war . " [ 141 ]
While the attack accomplished its intended objective , it turned out to be largely unnecessary .
Unbeknownst to Yamamoto , who conceived the original plan , the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon ' charging ' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war ( in keeping with the evolution of Plan Orange ) . [ 31 ]
The U.S. instead adopted " Plan Dog " in 1940 , which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia , while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany . [ 142 ]
Fortunately for the United States , the American aircraft carriers were untouched ; otherwise the Pacific Fleet 's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more ( given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet ) .
As it was , the elimination of the battleships left the U.S.
Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines — the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance .
While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service , their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment , and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles ( their only major action being the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944 ) .
A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships , in keeping with the doctrine of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan .
As a result , Yamamoto ( and his successors ) hoarded battleships for a " decisive battle " that never happened . [ 143 ]
The Japanese confidence in their ability to win a quick victory meant that they neglected Pearl Harbor 's navy repair yards , oil tank farms , submarine base , and old headquarters building .
[ 55 ]
All of these targets were omitted from Genda 's list , yet they proved more important than any battleship to the American war effort in the Pacific .
The survival of the repair shops and fuel depots allowed Pearl Harbor to maintain logistical support to the U.S. Navy 's operations , [ 144 ] [ 145 ] such as the Doolittle Raid and the Battles of Coral Sea and Midway .
It was submarines that immobilized the Imperial Japanese Navy 's heavy ships and brought Japan 's economy to a virtual standstill by crippling the importation of oil and raw materials : by the end of 1942 , the amount of raw materials brought in was cut in half , " to a disastrous ten million tons " , while oil " was almost completely stopped " .
[ nb 21 ]
Lastly , the basement of the Old Administration Building was the home of the cryptanalytic unit which contributed significantly to the Midway ambush and the Submarine Force 's success . [ 146 ]
Retrospective debate on American intelligence
Ever since the Japanese attack , there has been debate as to how and why the United States had been caught unaware , and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans and related topics .
As early as 1924 , Chief of U.S. Air Service Mason Patrick displayed a concern for military vulnerabilities in the Pacific , having sent Gen. Billy Mitchell on a survey of the Pacific and the East .
Patrick called Mitchell 's subsequent report , which identified vulnerabilities in Hawaii , a " theoretical treatise on employment of airpower in the Pacific , which , in all probability undoubtedly will be of extreme value some 10 or 15 years hence " . [ 147 ]
At least two naval war games , one in 1932 and another in 1936 , proved that Pearl was vulnerable to such an attack .
Admiral James Richardson was removed from command shortly after protesting President Roosevelt 's decision to move the bulk of the Pacific fleet to Pearl Harbor . [ 148 ] [ 149 ]
The decisions of military and political leadership to ignore these warnings have contributed to conspiracy theories .
Several writers , including decorated World War II veteran and journalist Robert Stinnett , author of Day of Deceit , and former United States Rear Admiral Robert Alfred Theobald , author of The Final Secret of Pearl Harbor : The Washington Background of the Pearl Harbor Attack , have argued that various parties high in the U.S. and British governments knew of the attack in advance and may even have let it happen or encouraged it in order to force the U.S. into war via the so - called " back door " .
However , this conspiracy theory is rejected by mainstream historians .

I came upon this koan this morning , and it felt like a perfect follow - up to yesterday ’s post :
Groundhog Day and the serious problem of impermanence
May this koan be a gentle nudge , or thunderclap , that leads to awakening — just this .
Coming empty - handed , going empty - handed — that is human .
When you are born , where do you come from ?
When you die , where do you go ?
Life is like a floating cloud which appears .
Death is like a floating cloud which disappears .
The floating cloud itself originally does not exist .
Life and death , coming and going , are also like that .
But there is one thing which always remains clear .
It is pure and clear , not depending on life and death .
Then what is the one pure and clear thing ?

Big Labor got some big love from President Obama and congressional Democrats yesterday after they agreed to exempt union workers from the whopping “ Cadillac tax ” on high - cost health - care plans until 2018 .
The sweetheart deal , hammered out behind closed doors , will save union employees at least $ 60 billion over the years involved , while others wo n’t be as lucky — they ’ll have to cough up almost $ 90 billion .
The 40 percent excise tax on what have come to be called “ Cadillac ” health - care plans would exempt collective - bargaining contracts covering government employees and other union members until Jan. 1 , 2018 .
RICH LOWRY : ANOTHER RANK DEAL
EDITORIAL : OBAMACARE’S LATEST BRIBE
In another major concession to labor , the value of dental and vision plans would be exempt from the tax even after the deal expires in eight years , negotiators said .
Under the plan to help fund health - care reform , the tax would kick in for plans valued at $ 8,900 or more for individuals and $ 24,000 or more for families .
That ’s slightly higher than the $ 8,500 and $ 23,000 thresholds in the bill passed by the Senate last month .
The threshold will be even higher for certain plans with many older workers and women — a move to benefit unions with a high proportion of female membership , sources said .
New York labor leaders — who had initially campaigned against the Cadillac tax , favoring instead a surcharge on the wealthy — said they are thrilled .
“ We can live with it .
We have an agreement that nothing will be taxed until 2018 , ” crowed George Boncoraglio , regional president of the Civil Service Employees Association .
Officials said the deal was thrashed out over more than 15 hours of negotiating at the White House that ended after midnight Wednesday .
Powerful unions were well - represented around the bargaining table .
Participants included AFL - CIO President Richard Trumka and Andy Stern , head of Service Employees International Union ; Anna Burger , head of Change to Win ; and the leaders of unions representing teachers , government workers , food and commercial workers , and electricians .
Stern has been among the most frequent visitors to the White House over the last year , showing up more than 20 times , according to logs .
Originally , the Cadillac tax included in the Senate bill was estimated to raise $ 149 billion through 2019 .
But Trumka said the exemption would reduce that amount by $ 60 billion — money that negotiators will now have to find elsewhere , or reduce the coverage in the legislation .
Boncoraglio said CSEA leaders were meeting in Albany — preparing to wage a major offensive against the tax — when their Washington lobbyist called and briefed them on the changes .
Obama backs the Cadillac excise tax , citing economists who say it would drive down costs by encouraging insurance companies to offer employers and workers a chance to buy lower - cost health plans to avoid the levy .

Not just a quarter of Republicans believe this ludicrous premise , but another third think it 's a matter open to debate .
How do you negotiate with a party whose rank and file are that divorced from reality ?
And speaking of divorced from reality ...

42 percent of Republicans are n't really patriotic .
They pretend to love America only when they approve of the president .
These traitors do n't believe in democracy , in our nation 's founding ideals , or in our flag .
To them , those colors run .
They are cowards .
Note , secession sentiment is MUCH stronger in the South than elsewhere -- 33 percent want out , compared to just 52 percent who want to stay .
In the Northeast , " just " 10 percent want out , in the Midwest , its 18 percent , and in the West , it 's 16 percent .

Oof .

In all of these questions , respondents from the South are slightly crazier , and those from the Northeast slightly less crazier , than the average .
In these two questions , the differences are particularly exaggerated .
In the South , the sex - ed question comes out 39 - 56 , compared to 47 - 45 in the Northwest .
For the creationism question , it 's 82 - 9 in the South , compared to 70 - 23 in the Northwest .
I must admit , however , that I expected fewer Republicans to back sex ed .
Another big surprise :
WOMEN

Not Sure 11
Should women work outside the home ?
Yes 86
No 4
Not Sure 10
Phyllis Schlafly is crying .
That looks a lot more enlightened than I expected , likely because the economic reality is that few people can get away with single - income homes .
But whatever the reason , on this front , there 's progress .
But that 's where the progress ends :

Do you believe the birth control pill is abortion ?
Yes 34
No 48
Not Sure 18
Do you consider abortion to be murder ?
Yes 76
No 8
Not Sure 16
Over a third of Republicans believe the birth control pill is abortion , which explains why nearly a third of them want contraceptive use outlawed .
This is so wingnutty , it 's hardly believable .
But it 's true , just a bare majority oppose outlawing contraceptives .
What we did n't ask was whether the 76 percent who consider abortion to be murder would advocate executions for women who have them .
Since 91 percent of respondents support the death penalty .
One last question :
Do you believe that the only way for an individual to go to heaven is though Jesus Christ , or can one make it to heaven through another faith ?
Christ 67
Other 15
Not Sure 18
Two - thirds of Republicans assume anyone that is not a Christian is going to hell .
It certainly makes it easier for them to dehumanize their enemies , either real or perceived .
I 'll address the presidential straw poll questions in a separate post .

SAN FRANCISCO --
Fear , uncertainty and doubt is an integral part of the security industry .
Vendors sell FUD , the media loves reporting it , and trade shows thrive on it .
So it 's not surprising that the RSA Security Conference held here this week had vendors , analysts and assorted others serving up huge dollops of FUD .
But two themes in particular appeared to be fueling much of the trepidation at this year 's show : the recent attacks against Google , and the change being forced on enterprise security models by the increasing adoption of mobile and Web 2.0 technologies by end users .
The attacks on Google and dozens of other high - tech companies , including Intel and Juniper Networks , by operatives apparently based in China have stirred a lot of emotions .
Although there has been some discussion on exactly how sophisticated ( or not ) those attacks really were , the mere fact that even such technology - savvy companies could be compromised for an extended period of time is stirring considerable anxiety .
The attacks clearly appear to have convinced many in the industry that U.S. government , commercial and military networks are being systematically targeted in an escalating campaign to steal trade secrets and intellectual property .
Many see the attacks as being state - sponsored and increasingly focused .
Off the record , some say that the attacks against Google were not really about merely stealing e-mail accounts .
Rather , they see a more fundamental compromise of the company 's networks at a time when it is migrating more corporate and government accounts to its cloud infrastructure .
The fact that the company has asked for the National Security Agency 's help and has threatened to walk away from China are indicative of a far more serious problem than has been acknowledged .
FBI director Robert Mueller gave voice to some of those concerns during a keynote address at RSA , where he warned about hackers making subtle changes to software source code in order to create a " permanent window " into a company 's operations .
Such changes , he said , were resulting in a bleeding of data and intellectual property .
Tom Kellerman , vice president of security awareness at Core Security Technologies and a member of a commission that developed a set of cybersecurity recommendations for President Obama last year , said it 's time for the government to regard the problem with the seriousness it deserves .
Over the past two years , there has been a 200 % increase in attacks against government targets .
Global supply chains and the virtual networks behind them are also under constant attack , Kellerman said .
Although the U.S continues to host the greatest number of bot - infected computers , almost all of the servers controlling them are based overseas , he noted .
Dealing with the issue will require concerted action on the part of the U.S government , and cybersecurity needs to be to become an item on the agenda at the next G20 summit , Kellerman said .
The U.S also needs to raise the issue at the World Trade Organization under the premise of IP theft , he contended .
It 's crucial to stop thinking only in terms of deterrent action when it comes to eliminating hacker havens , Kellerman explained .
Instead , a focus on using economic aid to help hacker - friendly countries improve their abilities to go after cybercriminals is also needed .
Robert Rodriguez , a former Secret Service special agent and founder of the Security Innovation Network , said it 's time for the Department of Defense and the NSA to take a broader role in responding to such attacks .
He said he suspects that there is no longer such a thing as a trusted supply chain and that many commercial and government networks are already penetrated and ready to be exploited .
It 's important not to make any assumption about the real motivations behind such attacks just by looking at what 's going on at the surface , Rodriguez warned .
" Like the Statue of Liberty play in football , [ these attacks ] could be a kind of trick play , " Rodriguez said .
" We have to take the position that we are already compromised [ when formulating a response . ] "
Meanwhile , the growing ubiquity of mobile devices and the increasing adoption of Web 2.0 tools and social networking sites such as Facebook and YouTube also appeared to be fueling much of the FUD at this year 's RSA .
The main concerns appeared to be focused on the issue of users getting control over enterprise data in ways that were not anticipated a few years ago .
The growing use of smartphones and other mobile technologies -- some enterprise - owned , but many of them not -- to access and store enterprise data , for example , appeared to be a major concern .
So too is the trend by many to use tools such as Gmail and Google Voice to access and store enterprise data .
There are considerable fears also of enterprise data being leaked via sites such as Facebook , LinkedIn and YouTube by users indiscriminately posting sensitive material there .
" You need to be aware of the fact that users have more control over data , " said Asheem Chandna , a partner at venture capital firm Greylock Partners .
Increasingly , " enterprise data is going where your users are going , " Chandna said .
Many of the tools that are being used to store and access corporate data do n't support robust security features such as remote wipe technologies and data encryption , he said .

Gov. Brian Schweitzer , left , and Premier Gordon Campbell finalize the deal Thursday morning in Vancouver , British Columbia . -

Leaders from Montana and British Columbia have signed an agreement that bans mining and drilling in a valley along the U.S. - Canadian border north of Glacier National Park .
Gov. Brian Schweitzer and Premier Gordon Campbell finalized the deal Thursday morning in Vancouver , British Columbia .
In a phone interview with the Beacon , Schweitzer said the agreement marks a recognition that the Flathead is “ a pretty special place . ”
“ For 400 generations , the First People recognized that it is the lifeblood of Mother Earth , ” Schweitzer said .
“ We have a shared responsibility ; we have a shared opportunity and we have a shared destiny . ”
The deal , announced last week , halts ongoing exploration work and prohibits future development of coal , oil and gas in the sprawling Flathead Valley , just upstream from Glacier National Park .
Efforts to stop mining in the region date to the 1980s , when a U.S. - Canada joint commission rejected an open pit coal mine in the valley because of potential environmental damage .
Schweitzer described his role in brokering the deal as a “ baton ” passed to him when he took office five years ago from previous Montanans who have worked to protect the Flathead watershed .
“ All I did was run as hard as I could for one lap , ” he said , adding that the baton now goes to Montana ’s Congressional delegation to pass legislation buying out or retiring dormant oil and gas leases south of the border so the protection extends to both sides .
“ Hopefully , they will be able to finish the job , ” Schweitzer said .
For more on the agreement , check out our lead story this week .

Last night , MSNBC ’s Countdown with Keith Olbermann dubbed Wal - Mart the “ Worst Person in the World ” for suing severely brain - damaged Wal - Mart employee , Debbie Shank , for $ 470,000 .
According to Olbermann , “ … You know why people think of Wal - Mart and evil in the same sentence ?
Because of the crap you guys do like this …Wal - Mart : may your stores melt in the hot sun .
Today ’s worst person in the world . ”
When Missouri Wal - Mart employee Debbie Shank was left severely brain - damaged and disabled after a collision with a semi- trailer truck seven years ago , her Wal - Mart health care plan paid her initial medical bills .
The Shank family won a $ 417,000 settlement ( after legal fees ) from the trucking company , which was placed in a trust fund for Debbie ’s future medical care .
Wal - Mart subsequently sued the family for $ 470,000 – for medical expense reimbursement , plus interest and legal fees – and won .
The Shanks appealed , but last week , the Supreme Court refused to hear their case so the Shank family must pay Wal - Mart .
Debbie lives in a nursing home , is disabled , memory - impaired and requires 24 - hour care .
Her husband , Jim Shank , works two jobs and does n’t know how he will pay for Debbie ’s future nursing home expenses .
Shank spoke about the family ’s tragedy and Wal - Mart ’s heartlessness toward his family on CNN Headline News yesterday and CNN ’s Anderson Cooper 360 last night .
“ Despite its public relations efforts to improve its image , this tragic situation exposes the truth about how poorly Wal - Mart treats its employees , ” said David Nassar , Wal - Mart Watch Executive Director .
“ Wal - Mart claims it must recover the money from the Shank family in ‘ fairness ’ and to ‘ protect ’ the plan , but those claims are absurd because Wal - Mart self - funds its health care plan .
Wal - Mart can and should do the right thing and let the family keep this money to take care of Debbie Shank . ”
Wal - Mart CEO
Lee Scott earns more than $ 470,000 a week and Wal - Mart earns $ 470,000 every 38 seconds .
Surely the largest company in the world , with $ 11 billion in profits and run by the nation ’s wealthiest family , could spare the $ 470,000 , do the right thing and give this poor family a break .
In December , Wal - Mart Watch conducted a fundraiser and in conjunction with SEIU contributed $ 15,000 to the Shank family .
In addition , the organization appealed to the Wal - Mart ’s Associates in Critical Need Foundation , the Wal - Mart Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation to assist the Shank family , but received no reply to its requests .
Wal - Mart Watch is currently circulating a petition to the company .
TOKYO  Japan ’s defense minister ordered the nation ’s naval ships to return from the Indian Ocean on Friday , fulfilling a pledge by his government to end an eight - year refueling mission in support of the war in Afghanistan .
A destroyer and a supply ship that had been refueling American and other warships are to head home at midnight , when a special law authorizing the mission expires .
Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama refused to renew the law , ignoring requests from the Obama administration to continue the mission as a show of diplomatic support for Washington .
The Japanese withdrawal had been expected for months , and military experts have said it will not affect military operations in Afghanistan .
But it is symbolic of Mr. Hatoyama ’s efforts to reduce his country ’s dependence on the United States , and assert more independence on diplomatic issues .
Members of Mr. Hatoyama ’s left - leaning coalition have criticized the operation for violating the nation ’s pacifist Constitution and for aligning their nation too closely with Bush administration wars that many Japanese saw as unilateral .
Ending the mission was a campaign pledge of Mr. Hatoyama ’s Democratic Party , which swept aside a half - century of Liberal Democratic rule last summer .
Setting Up A PXE Install Server On Ubuntu 9.10
This tutorial shows how to set up a PXE ( short for preboot execution environment ) install server with Ubuntu 9.10 ( Karmic Koala ) .
A PXE install server allows your client computers to boot and install a Linux distribution over the network , without the need of burning Linux iso images onto a CD / DVD , boot floppy images , etc .
This is handy if your client computers do n't have CD or floppy drives , or if you want to set up multiple computers at the same time ( e.g. in a large enterprise ) , or simply because you want to save the money for the CDs / DVDs .
I want to say first that this is not the only way of setting up such a system .
There are many ways of achieving this goal but this is the way I take .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1. Preliminary Note
It is important that you have a decent internet connection because your client computers will fetch all needed packages from the repositories in the Internet .
And the most important thing is that your client computers support booting over the network .
You should check each computer 's BIOS for this option .
I am going to be using a computer with two network connections , I will have two networks as well one for the internet and one for the client computers .
My server name will be pxe-server my user will be pxe and all passwords will be vadmin .
Most tasks in this guide will be carried out in terminal to access this follow :
Applications -->
Accessories -->
Terminal
2. Installing Ubuntu 9.10
First thing we are going to need is a Ubuntu 9.10 CD / DVD .
This can be obtained though many different distributors or downloaded from ubuntu.com
Insert your Ubuntu install CD into your system and boot from it .
Select Install to the hard disk :
The installation starts , and first you have to choose your language :
Then select your location and time zone :
Then select your keyboard layout :
Next partitionor will start , and you will need to partiton the hard drive , I have selected the whole disc for ubuntu :
Now enter your user details , my password is vadmin :
Next you will be asked to confirm options and install :
Ubuntu will now install onto your system .

DALLAS -- Oklahoma State wide receiver Dez Bryant , whose draft stock is uncertain , will visit the Dallas Cowboys ' practice facilities at Valley Ranch on April 1 , according to multiple sources .
Bryant will have a personal workout for NFL teams March 30 in his hometown of Lufkin , Texas , before going to Valley Ranch .
His agent , Eugene Parker , said that Bryant will not work out for the Cowboys .
Players cannot have private workouts without a special waiver from the NFL .
Bryant , projected to be the first wide receiver taken in the upcoming NFL draft , did not work out at the NFL scouting combine or at Oklahoma State 's pro day because of a recent hamstring injury , which has given several teams pause .
The words were shocking and so unfamiliar that Cheryl Khan 's friends could not believe her boss used them .
" Paki , " he called her , according to Khan 's testimony before the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal .
" Half - nigger babies , " he said of her two little boys .
" That 's what you get for sleeping with a nigger . "
In his decision , tribunal adjudicator Eric Whist accepted Khan 's testimony , slamming her former employer , Lynn Tompkins of Lynx Trucking Transportation in Rexdale with a $ 25,000 fine along with an order that he create an anti-harassment policy and undergo training himself .
During the hearing , Tompkins said he was a tough boss , and yelled and swore at his employees , but denied using racist words .
Reached at his office last week , Tompkins again said he did not use those terms , claiming that he was " set up . "
He requested a face - to - face interview but later called back and cancelled .
The ruling , said Khan 's lawyer , Bruce Best , sends a powerful message .
" Employees do n't have to put up with this behaviour , " said Best , of the Human Rights Legal Support Centre .
" You have rights and if you stand up for them , people will be forced to change . "
In an interview , Khan said that changing Tompkins ' behaviour toward future employees was her priority .
" I have been in Canada close to 35 years and had never experienced racism ever .
Not in school , not in work , never , " she said .
" To think that Canada is so multicultural and yet there are still people who say these words , and behave this way ... "
Khan has worked in the trucking business for 11 years , mostly as a dispatcher , connecting drivers with the loads they carry .
She was hired by Tompkins in September 2007 .
His company picks up and delivers large freight containers that are used to hold goods on trains and ships .
According to Khan 's testimony before the tribunal , it did n't take long before her boss began ridiculing her , and other minority employees – many of his truck drivers were South Asian men .
He said that people of " East Indian " heritage were stupid and ignorant , she testified , saying he called her a stupid immigrant .
Another witness testified that Tompkins referred to his South Asian employees as " stupid or dumb , " saying , " Why did we hire them ?
Are there not any good white people we could hire ? "
When several employees of South Asian background wanted to take time off in October to attend Diwali , an important religious occasion for Hindus , Khan recalled her boss saying " the f--- ing Indians do n't want to work . "
Khan said she tried to laugh off his comments at first , saying she could n't believe that anyone would say those words and mean it .
Later , she told Tompkins that he was not allowed to speak that way , testifying he responded by saying it was " his f--- ing company . "
She was fired on Jan. 30 , after taking two days off while her youngest son was in the Hospital for Sick Children .
She said doctors told her that he might have liver cancer , but later diagnosed him with swollen lymph nodes .
Tompkins testified that said he decided to fire her on the prior Friday , for poor work habits , such as using Facebook on company time and showing up late for work .

Khan said she was occasionally late , used Facebook during work , and often worked overtime .
Khan has since found another job in the trucking business .
Her children know what happened .
They watched her work through depression and know that words can be used like weapons , she said .
During the five - day hearing last fall , several former employees testified on behalf of Khan .
Tompkins brought in his own witnesses , employees who still worked for him .
The former employees described a poisonous atmosphere , where minority workers were repeatedly told they were lazy and lucky to have a job .
One said he heard Tompkins use the term " nigger " every day .
Tompkins ' witnesses told the hearing that he was a tough boss , who might have yelled , or raised his voice , but never used racist language .
In his written decision , adjudicator Whist said the issue of credibility was at the core of his findings .
The testimony of Khan and her witnesses was " clear and unproblematic , " Whist wrote .
He described the testimony of Tompkins and his witnesses as " inconsistent , troublesome and ultimately less persuasive . "
" Having weighed the evidence before me I find , on a balance ( of ) probabilities , that ( Tompkins ) did repeatedly use the terms " Paki " and " nigger " as well as making other offensive comments to the applicant that he knew would be unwelcome . "
Whist ordered Tompkins to pay $ 25,000 to Khan for discrimination under the Ontario Human Rights Code and another $ 6,750 for lost wages as a result of being fired from her job .
Released last Thursday , Khan said the ruling has taught her children the simple concept of right from wrong .
" They know now that if somebody ever calls them that name , they should defend themselves .
If I did n't fight for this , they would have thought it was okay . "
How much would it cost the European Union to cobble together the Linux kernel from scratch ?
The development costs would reach over a billion euros ( or about £ 900 m , or $ 1.4bn USD ) , according to researchers from the University of Oviedo , Spain .
Jesús García - García and Mª Isabel Alonso de Magdaleno are set to present this open source thought experiment at the European Union 's Conference on Corporate R&D next month .
The pair calculated those intangible Linux kernel costs using the Constructive Cost Model 81 ( COCOMO 81 ) , an algorithmic model usually applied to estimate the cost of traditional software development projects .
A base salary of 31,040 euros per year was punched in , based on the EC's Eurostat figures for 2006 .
The results came to an estimated total value for the Linux kernel version 2.6.30 ( released in December 2009 ) of 1,025,553,430 euros .
About 985 developers would be needed over a span of just under 14 years , the researchers claim .
The research and development expenses need to build the Linux kernel in this alternative universe would have risen significantly over the last few years .
The research claims that annual R&D expenses in 2005 ( going from version 2.6.11 to 2.6.16 ) would be about 80 m euros ( ~ £ 70 m , $ 108 m ) , whereas in 2008 ( versions 2.6.25-2.6.30 ) , the cost would have risen to about 228 m euros ( £ 200 m , $ 308 m ) .
This is consistent with the growth of R&D expenses in the EU 's IT sector , the researchers say .
Putting a traditional cost model on the Linux kernel does n't quite make sense , as the researchers freely admit , but their model does help to illustrate the enormous value in the project .
The report concludes by saying that despite a lack of book value , commons - based innovation should receive a " higher level of official recognition that would set it as an alternative to decision - makers . "

( CNN ) --
Twenty - eight suspected pirates were taken into custody Friday by the European Union Naval Force after a handful of failed attacks on fishing vessels in the Indian Ocean , the EU mission said .
In the first incident , the mission intercepted a mother ship and two skiffs early Friday in the southern Indian Ocean between the Seycelles and Mombasa , Kenya .
The mission said the suspected pirates were in an area where an earlier attack had occurred .
A helicopter from the French warship FS Nivose then tracked the vessels and saw the suspects throwing things overboard , the mission said .
When a French team arrived at the scene , it found 11 suspected pirates and " pirate paraphernalia " in the skiffs : a rocket launcher , grappling hooks and several fuel barrels .
The forces destroyed the pirate ship and a skiff and took the suspected pirates into custody .
The fate of the second skiff was not immediately known .
Soon after , pirates tried to attack a French fishing vessel near two other fishing boats , said Cmdr. John Harbour , spokesman for the EU Naval Force .
The French fishing vessel collided with the suspected pirates ' vessel and sank it , Harbour said .
Six suspected pirates were picked out of the water by the EU force , he said .
It was not immediately clear if they had been transported to the FS Nivose , although that had been planned , he said .
Later , pirates tried to attack a Spanish fishing vessel , Harbour said .
The boat alerted the EU Naval Force , and air and naval units intervened , he said .
Eleven suspected pirates were taken into custody and were on board the Nivose , Harbour said .
Harbour said an increase in pirate attacks was likely over the next few weeks as the monsoon season was ending and the ocean was becoming calmer , he said .
" The pirates have been preparing for it .
...
We are prepared as well , " he said .
On Thursday , pirates on two skiffs in the Indian Ocean attacked the Spanish fishing vessel Albacan , the EU Naval Force said .
The pirates fired a rocket - propelled grenade , which exploded on the Albacan 's deck and burst into flames , force said .
Armed guards on the Albacan fired shots at the skiffs and repelled the attack , it said .
No crew members were injured , and the small fire was extinguished .
The EU mission tries to deter and stop piracy off Somalia , which has been mired in chaos since the early 1990s .
It escorts vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean carrying World Food Program humanitarian aid to displaced people in Somalia .
It also seeks to protect " vulnerable vessels " in the Gulf of Aden and off the Somali coast , according to the mission 's Web site .
In this next installment of Mark Dery ’s personal essay - cum - cultural critique , the author , stranded in 1974 suburbia at the age of 14 , has his born - again Christian brain short - circuited by the gender - bent but heart - stoppingly beautiful Ziggy .

CHARING CROSS STATION , London , 9:10 P.M :
And when he arrived they screamed and they cried , and they rushed , and gushed forth and beat their feverish feminine fists into the backs of the indeed brave coppers who shielded HIM .
For he is indeed HIM .
One girl , her face bloated , and most ugly with tears and ruddy emotion , fell half - way twixt train and rail .
A young copper dragged her to safety .
Ten yards down the platform HE was pretty close to injury to HIM .
Bowie , despite all the fierce bodyguarding , was being kissed , and pinched , and touched , and ripped at .
His hair now untidy ; his eyes wild ; his mouth open .
A picture of terror .
But his open mouth also bore the shadow of a crazed smile .
They pushed him against a carriage door .
It took Spartan constabulary to lift this small squirrel - haired figure to safety ; his face now very creased with every emotion a face could ever squeeze itself into .
And they squeezed him into a car that was battered , and clawed at .
And that car squeezed its way to safety .
And Mr. Bowie was back in England .
And on Platform One , in a dirty wet huddle , lay two plumpish girlies , crying , and holding each other , and just crying .
Everyone had gone , except them .
Their tights all ripped , their knickers showing .
And they just lay there crying .
— Roy Hollingworth , “ Cha…cha…cha …changes : A journey with Aladdin , ” Melody Maker , May 12 , 1973
Crowd :
Will you touch , will you mend me Christ ?
Wo n’t you touch , will you heal me Christ ?
Will you kiss , you can cure me Christ ?
Wo n’t you kiss , wo n’t you pay me Christ ?
Jesus :
Oh , there ’s too many of you , do n’t push me Oh , there ’s too little of me , do n’t crowd me Heal yourselves !
— “ The Temple , ” Jesus Christ Superstar ( 1970 ) •
On July 3rd , 1973 , Bowie ceremonially retired his Ziggy Stardust persona before a crowd of true believers , a melodramatic gesture immortalized in the D.A. Pennebaker documentary Ziggy Stardust : The Motion Picture .
Actually , it was more ritual sacrifice than retirement : Bowie sentenced Ziggy to death , partly because the leper messiah ’s shock value was losing its jolt , partly because the strain of playing the Jesus of Cool , onstage and off , was beginning to tell on him .
“ It was quite easy to become obsessed night and day with the character , ” he later recalled .
“ Everybody was convincing me that I was a messiah … ”
Returning for an encore , Bowie leans into the mic with a knowing , almost coy smile .
“ Of all the shows on this tour , this particular show will remain with us the longest because not only is it the last show of the tour , but ” — pause for dramatic effect — “ it ’s the last show that we ’ll ever do . ”
A collective gasp from the stunned crowd , intermingled with stricken cries of “ No ! ”
On cue , pianist Mike Garson pulses the opening chords of “ Rock ‘ n ’ Roll Suicide ” : “ Time takes a cigarette / puts it in your mouth … ”
Ziggy was our savior .
He rescued my only friend Lisa and [ me ] ( two American kids with very British taste in music ) from teenage boredom and launched us through outer space to his very own planet , somewhere beyond Pluto .
The U.S. TV show [ Don Kirshner ’s Rock Concert ] featured the final Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars concert at London ’s Hammersmith Odeon .
It was the first and only time we would see Ziggy live in action ( besides the hundreds of magazine photos and posters we had ) .
The stage was dark , the focus was soft , and the camerawork shaky and evasive .
Ziggy was shrouded in mystery .
He was definitely from the cosmos ; androgynous , surreal and seductive , perfect porcelain skin , unearthly mismatched eyes with a foreign , piercing stare . [ … ]
We saw this on a black & white TV , yet it was still utterly compelling .
We had found our ultimate icon , and there he was announcing his final performance .
Our devastation mounted .
— Madeline , a Bowie fan
Late on the night of October 25 , 1974 in a San Diego suburb hard by the Mexican border , a 14 - year - old me kneels close to the TV , flicker bathing my rapt face .
It ’s the only light in the house .
I ’m watching Ziggy Stardust : The Motion Picture , D.A. Pennebaker ’s 1973 film of Bowie ’s farewell performance as Ziggy , on Don Kirshner ’s Rock Concert — the same broadcast that ’s saving the bored teenage souls of Madeline and her friend Lisa , somewhere in New York .
Down the hall , my parents are asleep .
It ’s past midnight , and I know , somehow , that I ’m the only kid in my chicken - coop suburb beholding this miraculous visitation , wondrous as the presentation of the hermaphrodite in Fellini ’s Satyricon .
To be sure , Bowie ’s a freak — code for “ fag ” among the real - life Jeff Spicolis in my junior high class , righteous dudes whose idea of total radness is firing up a beer bong , dropping the needle on Pink Floyd ’s Dark Side of the Moon , and watching The Wizard of Oz with the sound turned off .
But he ’s so heart - stoppingly beautiful , in such a confusingly feminine way , that he short - circuits my teenage brain , a brain whose congenital straightness I ’ve never questioned … until now .
Those Venus de Milo shoulders ; that slim - hipped teenage - boy torso on top of those Rockette legs ; that otherworldly face — moon - white , immaculate , like Dietrich in cryo-sleep .
And the way he moves : biker - butch one minute , swivel - hipped the next , with a predatory grace true to Ziggy ’s boast in “ Hang on to Yourself ” that he and the Spiders “ move around like tigers on Vaseline . ”
“ Come on , come on , ” he pants , in time , syncopating the Spiders ’ skidding , careening beat .
I catch myself thinking how sexy he is .
And I wonder what that means .
And I realize I do n’t care .
•
Riding the volume knob , I split the difference between waking my parents and coaxing all the ecstasy I can from the TV ’s tin-can speaker .
I do n’t know how to take this
I do n’t see why he moves me
He ’s a man
He ’s just a man Should I bring him down
Should I scream and shout
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out ?
I never thought I ’d come to this
What ’s it all about ?
— Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber , “ I Do n’t Know How to Love Him , ” Jesus Christ Superstar
Earlier that night , I ’d gone looking for another sort of ecstasy .
Crowded into the House of Abba with the other Jesus Freaks , I prayed with eyes closed and palms uplifted , whispering sweet nothings in God ’s ear , beseeching him to fill me with his holy spirit .
Part 3 : In The House of Abba , a Friday night coffee house church that scrapped the liturgy and smudged the historically sharp line between congregation and clergy , our teenage narrator finds Jesus Christ Superstar and discovers a Christianity that rocks .
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott got first - hand experience of an accident blackspot after his car narrowly avoided being hit by a truck on Wednesday morning .
Mr Abbott was on his way to be briefed on safety issues on the Princes Highway south - west of Melbourne when the near miss occurred .
His car was waiting to turn right on a single - lane section of the road at Winchelsea when the truck nearly rammed him from behind .
The truck was forced to swerve to the left around a small bus directly behind Mr Abbott 's car which also ended up on the side of the road .
Amid a cloud of smoke and dust the truck driver managed to go to the left of Mr Abbott 's stationary car and pull up on the roadside .
Speaking after the incident near a billboard which read , " Choose a car that could save your life " , Mr Abbott said he was relieved no - one was hurt .
" I 've got to say that the driver did a great job in keeping his vehicle upright in that situation , " he said .
" I 'm just very pleased and relieved no - one was hurt because it could have been a very nasty situation . "
After the near - miss Mr Abbott spoke with the local Liberal candidate about road safety in the area .
" I 'm out here on this highway experiencing myself just how difficult and dangerous it can be , " he said .
The semi-trailer 's driver , Luke McRae , was on a Melbourne to Warrnambool run with groceries and is back on the road after the incident .
His boss Graham Ryan says he was " shaken up " but his years of experience on the road helped him keep control of the vehicle .
After removing Google 's Android driver code from the Linux kernel , Novell Fellow and Linux developer Greg Kroah - Hartman has argued that the mobile OS is incompatible with the project 's main tree .
Kroah - Hartman deleted the Android drivers on December 11 - Android code is no more as of version 2.6.33 of the kernel release - and yesterday , with a post to his personal blog , he explained the move in detail .
" No one cared about the code , so it was removed , " writes Kroah - Hartman .
" As I 've stated before , code in the staging tree needs to be worked on to be merged to the main kernel tree , or it will be deleted . "
But the larger problem , he continues , is that Android uses a new lock type , new hooks for its " sometimes bizarre " security model , and a revamped framebuffer driver infrastructure .
All this , he says , prevents " a large chunk " of Android drivers and platform code from merging into the main kernel tree .
Google , he ultimately argues , has forked its mobile OS .
Google did not immediately respond to our request for comment .
But in a pair of posts to LWN.net , Mountain View open source guru Chris DiBona says that Android is n't in the main tree because the main tree does n't want it .
" I think if the Android kernel were important enough to the mainline , then this would n't be a problem .
The reality is that the mainline does n't want the code , so a fork is a normal response to this , " DiBona writes .
" This whole thing stinks of people not liking Forking .
Forking is important and not a bad thing at all .
From my perspective , forking is why the Linux kernel is as good as it is . "
From where Kroah - Hartman is sitting , Google has built a platform that 's incompatible with the Linux kernel .
" Any drivers written for Android hardware platforms can not get merged into the main kernel tree because they have dependencies on code that only lives in Google 's kernel tree , causing it to fail to build in the kernel.org tree , " he writes .
" [ Google is ] effectively creating a kernel branch that a number of different vendors are now relying on . "
And , he continues , this fork is " much worse " than the typical fork .
" Because Google does n't have their code merged into the mainline , these companies creating drivers and platform code are locked out from ever contributing it back to the kernel community , " he says .
" The kernel community has for years been telling these companies to get their code merged , so that they can take advantage of the security fixes , and handle the rapid API churn automatically .
And these companies have listened , as is shown by the larger number of companies contributing to the kernel every release .
" But now they are stuck .
Companies with Android - specific platform and drivers can not contribute upstream , which causes these companies a much larger maintenance and development cycle . "
According to Kroah - Hartman , Google " shows no sign of working to get their code upstream anymore , " and he says that the company 's cooperation is essential .
" A number of [ necessary ] changes will affect the kernel / userspace boundry , so some changes to the Android userspace logic would also need to be changed if these kernel changes are made , preventing anyone except a Google employee from making the changes , " he says .
DiBona bears this out .
But he believes the fork is nothing but a good thing .
" If you do n't like how we architected android , do n't complain that the code is n't being mainlined , " he says .
" You can't have your cake and eat it too .
We get it : you do n't like how we put together the kernel for android .
We 're okay with that .
Other companies coming to you for help is fine , too , you can choose who you help .
Others might see that as an opportunity , but whatever . " ®

Sarah Palin is a PR genius .
The same way that Madonna is a PR genius or Al Sharpton is a PR genius .
No matter how tired we get of them , somehow they always figure out a way to keep themselves in the public eye .
Yesterday Palin delivered a routine stemwinder to a medium sized crowd and managed to get a ton of publicity for it .
But that ’s not all !
It turns out that last night ’s speculation was right : she really did have a cheat sheet on the palm of her hand that she consulted during the softball Q&A after the speech .
Just like your average seventh grader taking an algebra test .
Has any politician in history ever done this before ?
And even the notes themselves are fascinating .
Here ’s what she wrote down :
Energy Budget Tax Cuts Lift American Spirits
The most obvious question is : why would anyone need to write this stuff down ?
It ’s not like she ’s trying to remember the quadratic equation or anything .
For someone who swims in the seas that Palin swims in , this is about the equivalent of writing down a note to remember your birthday .
But enough mockery .
At this blog we prefer a more high - minded , policy - oriented critique of our major politicians .
So here it is : it turns out that Sarah Palin does n’t believe in budget cuts .
In fact , she went to the trouble of deliberately crossing it out .
Just like every other garden variety faux fiscally conservative Republican , she does n’t really want to cut the budget because that runs the risk of annoying some interest group or another .
She only wants to cut taxes .
Normally , though , we do n’t have graphological proof of this .
With Palin , now we do .
The Canadiens said forward Andrei Kostitsyn will be out indefinitely after undergoing knee surgery on Friday in Montreal .
The 24 - year - old , selected to play on Belarus ' Olympic team , suffered a knee injury at Florida on Dec. 31 and has missed the team ’s last three games .
Kostitsyn has 25 points ( 12 goals , 13 assists ) in 40 games with the Canadiens this season .
He missed three games from Nov. 25 to Dec. 1 with to a foot injury .
His brother Sergei has n't played since Dec. 30 due to an ankle injury .

Romain Grosjean 's hopes of retaining his position as a Renault driver have taken a hit , after new team principal Eric Boullier said his second driver was unlikely to be French .
Grosjean replaced Nelson Piquet
Jnr last season but struggled to get to grips with the car and scored no points in the seven races he entered .
Boullier , who was made team principal on Tuesday , said he recently narrowed his shortlist for Robert Kubica 's team - mate down to five .
He hinted that Grosjean was on the list but was n't likely to get the seat .
" There are several possible scenarios , one of them French , " Boullier told French radio station RMC .
" But , today , that is the scenario with perhaps the least chance of success .
We have made progress but are still far from being able to disclose the name . "
Earlier this week Boullier said his second driver could be one from the Genii - linked driver management outfit , Gravity Sport .
Ho - Pin Tung and Jerome d'Ambrosio are two of the biggest names under Gravity contracts , but they would have to be chosen over Nick Heidfeld , who is still without a drive in 2010 , and other experienced candidates .

Grist photo / Jonathan HiskesAs a tanker driver in Iraq , U.S. Army veteran Robin Eckstein saw firsthand the risk that fossil - fuel dependence posed to American troops .
She drove a water truck in convoys with fuel tankers , and every trip outside the secure zone at Baghdad International Airport meant a potential meeting with sniper fire or improvised explosive devices .
But field stations in the surrounding area depended on that fuel for their vehicles and equipment that ran off generators .
“ It was a logistical nightmare that they have to wait for us , because , frankly , we were slow , we were poorly equipped , and we were trying to get through Baghdad to get to them , ” said Eckstein , 33 .
“ Otherwise they ca n’t operate .
“ If they had solar panels to charge their laptops and other equipment , they would n’t need our slow - moving vehicles coming out to them .
They would be more efficient .
We would be putting less American lives at risk . ”
Eckstein , who finished her service with the National Guard in 2007 , has also come to see the larger threat that fossil fuels and climate change pose to the military .
Climate change causes droughts and natural disasters around the world , which in turn drives instability , mass migrations , and conflict — and the U.S. military will increasingly be called on to respond .
The Pentagon agrees .
The recently released Department of Defense Quadrennial Review , which assesses threats and priorities for the military , states : “ Climate change will contribute to food and water scarcity , will increase the spread of disease , and may spur or exacerbate mass migration .
While climate change alone does not cause conflict , it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict , placing a burden to respond on civilian institutions and militaries around the world . ”
Says Eckstein , “ As long as the U.S. military is the 911 for the world , every time there ’s a natural disaster , we are going to be there .
Unfortunately , climate disruption just speeds that up . ”
Ultimately , promoting national security means doing something about climate change , Eckstein argues .
That ’s why she joined up with Operation Free , a coalition of veterans that ’s traveling the country in support of a national clean - energy bill .
Eckstein is currently on her second multi-state trip with Operation Free , which is organized by the Truman National Security Project and other progressive veterans ’ groups .
The warm responses the first time around convinced her to do it again .
“ Normally people see [ climate ] as a left issue , but it ’s a bipartisan issue , ” she said .
“ Everyone wants our nation to be secure .
The fact that they ’re willing to listen to us as veterans , and that they understand it , they get it , makes me very hopeful we ’re going to be able to make this change and take back our energy future . ”
Eckstein says the Pentagon already gets it and has plans to increase fuel efficiency and use more rechargeable energy devices in combat zones .
Now the rest of the country needs to get it too : Supporting the troops means consuming less oil .
“ It ’s hard to find an issue in the United States that has such an impact on national security , ” said Matt Victoriano , a former Marine who served in Iraq and another member of Operation Free .
“ It ’s evident to everyone that our dependence on foreign oil is fueling terrorist insurgencies , and we ’re paying for it through our military .
We ’re funding both sides of a war , which is pretty ridiculous . ”
The U.S. spent $ 66 billion on oil from Saudi Arabia alone in 2008 , he said .
Saudi Arabia was the top source of funding for Al Qaeda and other extremist networks that year , according to the government ’s top financial counter - terrorism official .
“ There ’s no positive outcome to continuing on our path , ” said Patrick Bellon , an Army veteran on the tour .
“ So we can listen to old men who make a ton of money who are calculating that maybe they wo n’t be around when [ oil ] runs out .
Or we can look out for the next generation .
That ’s the only question in my mind . ”
Samir ' Asfur , 52
My son Ahmad , 19 , was injured on 9 January 2009 by fragments of missiles that were fired by an unmanned aerial vehicle and landed next to our house , east of Khan Yunis , in New ‘ Abasan .
He was taken to Egypt , where he was treated for seven months .
When he got back to the Strip , his doctors referred him to Germany for treatment .
To do that , he had to go to the German embassy in Tel Aviv , and he could n't get a permit to enter Israel .
Rather than going to Germany , Ahmad received a referral from St. Joseph 's Hospital , in Gaza , to St. Joseph 's French Hospital , in Jerusalem .
He was given an appointment for 23 November 2009 .
At first , he did n't receive an entry permit , but then , on 24 November , an official from the Palestinian liaison office called and told me that he had to go the next day to the Erez checkpoint at 11:00 A.M .
At 11:00 , we went to the checkpoint .
We were searched , they took our ID cards and the cooler with insulin that Ahmad needs to take and his blood sample .
They took Ahmad , who was on crutches , and I have n't seen him since .
Two hours after they took him , I told the soldiers that Ahmad had to undergo a blood test every two hours because his pancreas is not functioning , and that he has to take insulin , which is in the cooler that they took .
I waited another hour or so , feeling that something was not right .
Nervously , I asked them where my son was and said that I can't leave him even for a short period of time .
An officer came over and told me my son had been detained .
He gave me back my ID card and told me to return to Gaza .
I refused , but soldiers forced me out of the checkpoint .
I could n't believe what was happening .
I left without Ahmad and without our things .
I went to the Palestinian liaison office at the checkpoint and told them what happened .
One of the office 's drivers drove me to the Red Cross offices , and I told them and Physicians Without Borders what happened .
Ahmad is injured .
He is disabled and can barely walk with crutches .
He has an eye injury , iron splints on his right hand , his left hand is also injured , and some of his fingers have been amputated .
His pancreas is not functioning properly , which caused diabetes .
Since that day , I 've been worried sick about my injured son .
I am afraid that his blood - sugar level will rise , which will cause other problems , and that he will suffer in detention and not receive the treatment he needs .
I do n't understand why they detained him .
He is a simple person and has no connection to any organization , and he has trouble functioning .
Attorney Muhammad Jabarin called me today and said that he saw Ahmad for a short time .
His detention was extended until 10 December .
He is not allowed to meet a lawyer until 6 December .
Note : ' Asfur 's attorney informed B'Tselem in late December 2009 that his client was still in prison and his medical condition was stable , but he was not receiving the rehabilitation for which he requested to enter Israel .
After he was detained for 24 days , an indictment was filed against him for twice observing Israeli troop movements in Gaza on ' behalf of Islamic Jihad , and for concealing weapons in his house for several hours on two other occasions .
Samir Muslem Muhamad ' Asfur , 52 , is a father of 13 and a resident of New ' Abasan , in the southern Gaza Strip .
He gave his testimony to Muhammad Sabah on 2 December 2009 .

Psychologists have long studied the grunts and winks of nonverbal communication , the vocal tones and facial expressions that carry emotion .
A warm tone of voice , a hostile stare — both have the same meaning in Terre Haute or Timbuktu , and are among dozens of signals that form a universal human vocabulary .
But in recent years some researchers have begun to focus on a different , often more subtle kind of wordless communication : physical contact .
Momentary touches , they say — whether an exuberant high five , a warm hand on the shoulder , or a creepy touch to the arm — can communicate an even wider range of emotion than gestures or expressions , and sometimes do so more quickly and accurately than words .
“ It is the first language we learn , ” said Dacher Keltner , a professor of psychology at the University of California , Berkeley , and the author of “ Born to Be Good : The Science of a Meaningful Life ” ( Norton , 2009 ) , and remains , he said , “ our richest means of emotional expression ” throughout life .
The evidence that such messages can lead to clear , almost immediate changes in how people think and behave is accumulating fast .
Students who received a supportive touch on the back or arm from a teacher were nearly twice as likely to volunteer in class as those who did not , studies have found .
A sympathetic touch from a doctor leaves people with the impression that the visit lasted twice as long , compared with estimates from people who were untouched .
Research by Tiffany Field of the Touch Research Institute in Miami has found that a massage from a loved one can not only ease pain but also soothe depression and strengthen a relationship .
The White House is turning its nose up at last month 's spurt in temporary work — the one bright spot in an otherwise grim jobs report .
It claims that such work is proof that the economy is still malfunctioning .
The truth is that this surge in temporary workers is not only good news for the economy , it 's the future of the 21st century labor market .
If Washington wants to jump start job growth for the 3.5 million white - collar workers who have lost jobs in this recession , it should start by scrapping the outdated legal and regulatory hurdles to temporary work .

A Word to the Wise on Race Correction 06/06/05
An atheist / skeptic audio program that I sometimes listen to , The Infidel Guy , recently had a debate  On the Merits of Racial Diversity  between white nationalist doyen Jared Taylor and energetic ZNet race pundit / author Tim Wise .
The debate is about two hours long ( download to listen here ) , and several race - related topics are covered , though , hilariously ,  the merits of racial diversity  is nt really one of them .
Wise and Taylor are an interesting pair of kooks who mix occasionally reasonable perspectives on isolated issues with distasteful racialized politics .
Much of the debate has to do with the nature of xenophobia , and while there is much disagreement between the two , there is no red meat and the issues are so loosely formulated , and sometimes metaphysical , that no one says anything false per se , but when the topic turns to genetics , race , and intelligence testing , Wise starts churning out logical errors and unambiguous factual errors with powerful and devoted consistency .
Wise is a good example of the deep and willful ignorance sociologists often have about genetics .
The transcript can be found here if you want to fact - check me or follow along , but to set up the context , Taylor and Wise argue over whether differences between black , white , and Asian Americans on traits such as IQ and crime are genetic or are really caused by economic circumstances and majority discrimination , with Taylor taking the former position and Wise taking the latter .
At this point the host lets a caller chime in who asks if maybe both Taylor and Wise are taking an extreme position on race differences , and that maybe both genetics and environment both played big roles .
Unexpectedly , Tim Wise immediately answers the caller saying yes ! :  CALLER : . . .
Do you think that there could be some moderation here and realize that its not such extremes here , that it [ i.e. racial differences ] is a combination of nature and nurture , its in fact both , its not either / or .
TIM :
Oh , I dont doubt that for a second .
I think its true for any human trait .
It s one of the reasons , for example , that you have , there is some evidence , that there may be genetic predisposition among certain indigenous American communities , American Indian communities , toward hypertension , high blood pressure , et cetera . . .
Having admitted that any trait can differ genetically between , quote , communities  , and having agreed with the caller that the reasonable position on racial differences is the middle way  between genetic and environmental determinist arguments , Wise has set himself in a truly awkward position , because while he agrees this is the reasonable position in theory , this is not the position that Wise takes in practice at all .
So how does he reconcile this ?
Having tipped his hat to the reasonable position , as a gesture of politeness , he immediately disowns it ( Isnt there , after all , a famous dictum about hypocrisy being Wises tribute to virtue ? . . .
OK , that s the last  Wise pun , I swear ) :  So theres no question that any trait can by affected by either [ nature or nurture ] .
The point I would simply make is that that s true for individuals .
There is no , however , inherent reason to believe that those tendencies cluster on the basis of race for the simple reason that the racial designations that we currently use are principally based on three characteristics .
They are facial structure , skin color , and hair texture .
Those are things that are controlled by six genes out of thirty thousand genes in the human genome and those genes have never been shown by any geneticist on the planet , any biologist on the planet , to be connected , or what geneticists call concordant ,  with any other trait known as intelligence or known as temperament or behavior or ethics or morality or any of those kinds of things .
So even though individuals absolutely have certain genetic predispositions towards everything from certain diseases to the ability to sing , to play music , to jump high , to run fast , theres no reason to believe that those things would cluster on the basis of this thing that we now call race .

OK , that s the last  Wise pun , I swear ) :
So having admitted that hypertension clusters by a specific ancestry , Wise quickly turns around and contradicts himself by arguing that traits cant cluster by ancestry .
To do this he pulls a common slight of hand by rudely conflating ancestry with isolated appearance traits .
The specious logic here - that since isolated appearance traits dont have a pleiotropic effect on behavioral traits ( incidentally , a questionable assertion in its own right ) behavioral traits cant differ with ancestry - is incompatible with Wises earlier statement about American Indian communities  having higher rates of hypertension , and one could easily turn that on him and ask what the red skin and hair texture of those Indian populations has to do with hyper-tension .
How did skin color predispose some Indian groups toward hypertension ?
By the same specious logic we could say that Wise must be a liar about the Indians and hypertension because the small number of genes for red - skin has nothing to do with hypertension .
To clarify whats wrong with Tims argument , genes ( and hence gentically influenced traits ) are jumbled together incidentally through common selection histories , which are captured by what we call ancestry ; that doesnt mean that appearance and behavioral traits cause each - other or are caused by the same genes , it just means they are found together with a certain statistical likelihood that is predictable with knowledge about ancestry .
So for instance , African Pygmies are both short and have tight curly hair .
Now this doesnt mean that genes for shortness cause tight curly hair or that these traits are caused by the same genes , it means those genes were jumbled together in that selection environment ; most likely the selection pressures for each trait was entirely different .
Similarly theres no reason that behavioral traits shouldnt be jumbled together in every uniquely differentiated population just like appearance traits are jumbled together in every uniquely differentiated population .
The mind is like any other organ and is in no way off limits to selection .
The argument is erroneous .
 Six genes  for skin color , and facial features and hair texture , by the way , is another manufactured fact - the number is completely fabricated .
Tim compounds this absurd argument by arguing that black Americans share appearance genes with their West African cousins but thats it ( later he expands on this curious idea by arguing that the average European is 10 times more related to any given African than to any given European and vice versa .
Dont try to figure it out youll give yourself a headache . . . ) , his evidence  for this is to use basketball awards as a pseudo - genetic marker :  It s the reason why youll find African Americans in the NBA but you wont find many West Africans , who are certainly blacker  and according to the racist theorist , athleticism and blackness somehow run together , you would expect West Africans to dominate the NBA and African teams to dominate international basketball competitions , and they dont because these things are not concordant on the basis of race .
They do not cluster on the basis of so - called racial categories , because these categories are highly artificial and they are not anything where you can actually . . . even IQ testing , when I sit down to take an IQ test they simply take for granted that I m white because I identify as white .
But theres no way to tell whether a third of my lineage could be black .
If I look white and I self - identify as white , I m white .
Similarly if someone whos black , 85 % of all blacks in the US have European ancestry .
Someone who comes in but who identifies as black or who is seen by the test - givers as black will be classified as black .
You dont know what percentage of their lineage is European or vice versa .
So these categories have never been delineated in scientific terms where you can say ,  This is Asian , this is black , this is white , and then you compare the scores . 
Until that can be done , to sit here and have this conversation about nature / nurture or to have a conversation about racial difference as opposed to individual difference , which I m in total agreement with the caller on that , is I think an artificial debate .
Tim makes three separate assertions here which are easily debunked with hard data and a fourth which is a clear logical non sequitur :
Tim makes three separate assertions here which are easily debunked with hard data and a fourth which is a clear logical non sequitur : 1 ) Black Americans only share a few superficial appearance traits with their current West African relatives .
2 ) Black Americans dont share identifiable athletic talents with their current West African relatives .
3 ) We dont know if black and White American social identities correlate with any precision to coherent ancestry / genetic profiles , so . . .
4 ) . . . we cant scientifically explore / discuss whether genes play a role in group differences .
Assertions number 1 and 3 are falsified by a paper published this year in the American Journal of human Genetics .
In Genetic Structure , Self - Identified Race / Ethnicity , and Confounding in Case - Control Association Studies , Hua Tang and a large number of other scientists recruited 3,636 subjects from 12 different locations in the U.S. and 3 in Taiwan who all identified themselves as black , white , Hispanic , or Asian .
Tang et al. analyzed these subjects at 326 genetic markers .
The data was then blindly analyzed .
Do four American groups who use four ethnic labels , correspond to four major genetic clusters ( as predicted ) , or sixteen , or a hundred ?
Do African Americans on the east coast and west coast differ more from each other than either does from a native African ( as admixture and the " 6 gene " hypothesis would predict ) ?
If such a difference even exists , do 0 % , 50 % , or 100 % of the people who say they are black actually turn out to be genetically white ?
All these types of questions are answered by this study .
Wise appears to be suggesting that African - Americans only share 6 genes related to appearance with West - Africans and nothing more .
Is that true ?
The authors tell us :  We note that the genetic cluster results indicate that older geographic ancestry rather than recent geographic originis highly correlated with racial / ethnic categorizations and , thus , is the major determinant of genetic structure in the population .
Although our results suggest that genetic stratification may exist within racial / ethnic groups specifically , whites and African Americans sampled from different geographic locations in the United States we found the differences based on current geography to be quite modest .
In other words African Americans , even with white admixture , are more closely related to each other and distant Africans than white Americans , Asians , and Hispanics ( as determined by ancestry profiles ) .
Likewise , white Americans are more closely related to each other and distant Europeans than their fellow African - Americans who they have lived with and exchanged a certain amount of genes with for four - hundred years in the New World .
In other words African Americans , even with white admixture , are more closely related to each other and distant Africans than white Americans , Asians , and Hispanics ( as determined by ancestry profiles ) .
Likewise , white Americans are more closely related to each other and distant Europeans than their fellow African - Americans who they have lived with and exchanged a certain amount of genes with for four - hundred years in the New World .
Wise also asserts , quite dubiously , that we are not allowed to ask whether socially labeled black and white Americans differ for genetic reasons on any given trait because blacks and whites are intermixed , so self - identified ancestry is only mysteriously linked to meaningfully stable genetic populations .
This self - serving casuistry is so shamefully idiotic , hypocritical and illogical that it marks anybody who uses it as nothing better than a religious Fundamentalist .
First Tangs data again refutes Wise .
Of the 3,636 subjects who the authors describe as an unbiased sampling of individuals who self - describe within the major categories we included , the data showed four major genetic clusters with nearly perfect correspondence between genetic cluster and SIRE [ Self - Identified Race / Ethnicity ] for major ethnic groups living in the United States .
Of the 3,636 subjects only 5 ( or 0.14 % ) reported an ancestry that did not match what they thought or reported .
So note that this directly meets Wises necessary pre-condition for asking if American ethnic differences between blacks , white , and Asians are genetic :
So these categories have never been delineated in scientific terms where you can say ,  This is Asian , this is black , this is white , and then you compare the scores . 
Until that can be done , to sit here and have this conversation about nature / nurture or to have a conversation about racial difference as opposed to individual difference , which I m in total agreement with the caller on that , is I think an artificial debate .
So Wises own conditions for legitimately asking questions about the genetic basis to racial difference have been satisfactorily met because Tangs data shows us that self - identified American racial labels such as black , white , and  Asian do correspond to actual genetic clusters with virtually 100 % accuracy .
So Wises own conditions for legitimately asking questions about the genetic basis to racial difference have been satisfactorily met because Tangs data shows us that self - identified American racial labels such as black , white , and  Asian correspond to actual genetic clusters with virtually 100 % accuracy .
In reality , I should point out Tangs data is simply further confirmation of what weve already known ( e.g. if we found some sort of cosmic videotape of human evolution it would further confirm it , but human evolution is already a fact . )
Similar data from methods as numerous and diverse as physical anthropology and comparative genealogies ( in the olden days ) to polymorphisms , such as blood groups , and genetic admixture studies ( in more modern times ) could have been used as evidence to make the exact same point for as long as these nature questions have existed .
So Wises pre-condition for asking nature questions had already been met , but this is irrelevant anyhow , Wises pre-condition  for asking nature questions was both disingenuous and illogical , and only a way for Wise to cut off debate at his own ideological convenience .
For one , if the social identities known as black and white Americans were somehow just shifting non-identities , with no assumable temporal coherence , then it wouldnt make sense for us to find a consistently identifiable trait difference of any sort to begin with .
How would we be able to find a replicable pattern in what is by definition noise ??
Second , even if we ignore this logical contradiction , if social labels do not meaningfully correlate with ancestry or a coherent historical social grouping , then Tim has also cannibalized any logical argument he has for reparations , Affirmative Action or any social policy that recognizes African - Americans as a group with any logical social coherence or historical continuity .
If we dont know who is really black and white for the purpose of trait study , or genetic evaluation , then we dont know who is really black and white for the purpose of racial dispensation either .
In fact any argument about group uncertainty  that can be used to cut off debate about nature questions can be used just as legitimately to cut - off debate about nurture questions .
So for instance , if Wise wanted to assert that blacks were being discriminated against and were disproportionately being kept out of higher paying jobs , even if he had incontrovertible data to show this , Taylor could have just as logically said that there is no way of knowing if those socially defined black people who were being kept out of that job were actually black or white , so the debate would be artificial .
Of course this wouldnt make sense for the same reasons listed above .
If there is a reliable pattern of people of a certain social identity not getting jobs despite equal qualifications , then it is certain that this social label corresponds to a real group ( even if definable in this one sense ) and that pattern has an etiology which can be explored .
And if there is a reliable pattern of a certain social group averaging a certain score on an IQ test then it is certain that this social label corresponds to a real group ( even if definable in this one sense ) and that pattern has an etiology which can be explored .
There are no a priori reasons that we cant ask or explore a phenomenon as if it had a naturist etiology , or why nurture , has a priori ontological legitimacy for social science puzzles while nature does not - there are just as many limitations and unknowns confounding environmental puzzles , if not more , as there are confounding genetic ones .
Wises metapysicalization of genetics is an ideological strategy , and a shamefully common one at that .
The suggestion that American blacks only share an appearance ( or six genes ) with their West African cousins has already been debunked , but while I use a genetics reference that shows a common racial ancestry , Wises proof for his assertion is not only laughably irrelevant , it is also wrong .
According to Wise , see , we know that the shared skin color and facial features of American blacks and West African blacks tell us that there should be no other disease risk , behavioral , biochemical , and physiological similarities , because they dont have the same track record for slamming dunks :
 It s the reason why youll find African Americans in the NBA but you wont find many West Africans , who are certainly blacker  and according to the racist theorist , athleticism and blackness somehow run together , you would expect West Africans to dominate the NBA and African teams to dominate international basketball competitions , and they dont because these things are not concordant on the basis of race .
This argument shows absolutely nothing of importance , and certainly doesnt show what Wise wants it to show , but its worth noting that West African blacks do share many identifiable athletic talents with their American relatives that have known links to physiological and biochemical similarities due to shared ancestry .
To name a few that Science :  Various studies have shown that West African [ descended ] athletes have denser bones , less body fat , narrower hips , thicker thighs , longer legs , and lighter calves than whites . 
Note that these physiological differences are found in West African blacks in the U.S. ( American blacks trace the grand majority of their ancestry to West - Africa ) , Britain , Canada , the Caribbean , Brazil , and of course in West - Africa .
Independently those traits are advantageous towards certain types of athletic performance no matter what race you are , they just happen to be found at higher frequencies ( and hence are more likely to be clustered ) in people of West African descent .
Similarly when it comes to short distance running , geography and culture doesnt predict elite winning , a specific ancestry does : Athletes of primarily West African descent which includes the majority of U.S. blacks hold all but six of the 500 best times in the 100 - meter race So Wises theory is wrong - race does not equal skin color and it is not reducible to 6 skin color genes .
Race is ancestry and ancestry , whether we are talking about mom and dad ancestry or the ancestry of much larger families , such as American Indian communities , involves genetic differences that run deeper than skin and hair color .
Race is not a trait , its ancestry , and ancestry has wide - ranging genetic implications .
This argument shows absolutely nothing of importance , and certainly doesnt show what Wise wants it to show , but its worth noting that West African blacks do share many identifiable athletic talents with their American relatives that have known links to physiological and biochemical similarities due to shared ancestry .

Race is not a trait , its ancestry , and ancestry has wide - ranging genetic implications .
Wises next paragraph of arguments is so full of make - believe that I am quoting it in full .
Literally every sentence is a made - up - on - the - spot fact :  . . . genetic differences between . . . so - called races are still about one tenth the size of any other subspecies on the planet .
In other words , generally biologists or geneticists argue , this is the generally accepted science , that in order for two groups or any multiple of groups to be considered subspecies or races or breeds of the same species , they must differ , or they usually will differ , in fact they always will , there will be more difference between the breeds , between the subspecies , between the so - called races , than there will be within the so - called breed , within the so - called subspecies or within the so - called race .
In humans , that is not the case .
On average , humans will vary by eight to nine times more within a population group than between a population group so that I as a European - descended person will be eight to nine times more different from another European person genetically than I would be from someone who is not at all European , who was Asian , or who was African .
HOST : That s evolution for you .
TIM : That is not true for any other species on the planet .
The other species tend to differ by five times , ten times , twenty times more between groups than within the groups .
So we do not meet the test as human beings for subspecies or for races . 
To list the lies and then discuss them in turn :
To list the lies and then discuss them in turn : 1 ) Genetic differences between human races are 10 times smaller than between the races of any other animal on earth .
2 )  The generally accepted science for determining sub-species is that the genetic differences between the two populations must be larger the differences within the populations .
3 ) Animal sub - species typically differ five times , ten times , twenty times more between groups than within the groups .
4 ) Any given European is eight to nine times more genetically similar to any given African and Asian than he is to any other given European ( Lewontins Fallacy ) .
First lets examine Wises claim that genetic differences between . . . so - called races are still about one tenth the size of any other subspecies on the planet . 
Jared Taylor challenges
Wise on this claim using dogs and Wise boldly and smugly repeats his claim as a scientific fact : JARED : Well , and do you think the genetic differences between subspecies of dogs are greater or less than genetic differences than say between Australian Aborigines and Japanese ?
Are they greater or less ?
TIM : Well the differences between the breeds , the differences between , lets say , German Shepherds , and a , I dont know , cockapoo or something , that s even a pure breed , a poodle , those differences would absolutely be , I think they re on the order of ten times the difference between ...
JARED : Wrong .
Wise doesnt know what he is talking about .
Not only are the genetic differences within any one dog breed greater than the differences between any of them , the differences within a single dog breed , such as Chihuahuas , is actually greater than the genetic difference between two different recognized SPECIES of animals - wolves ( Canis Lupus ) and coyotes ( Canis latrans ) .
To quote James Serpells  Recently using genetic and biochemical methods researchers have shown domestic dogs to be virtually identical . . . to other members of the genus . . .
Results using mtDNA ( mitochondrial DNA ) data . . . reveal startling similarities among canids . . .
Greater mtDNA differences appeared within the single breeds of Doberman Pinscher or poodle than between dogs and wolves . . . to keep things in perspective , it should be pointed out that there is less mtDNA difference between dogs , wolves , and coyotes , than there is between ethnic groups of human beings . ( pp. 32-33 ) So contrary to Wise there are larger genetic differences between a West African , a Northwest European , and an Northeast Asian , then there is between two separate species , a wolf and a coyote , or between a Shih Tzu and a German Shepherd .
So if you think that that meaningless Lewontin 85 - 15 statistic about within - between  is some sort of scientific debunking of functional genetic differentiation between humans ( which is his whole fallacious point for making and disseminating it ) I urge you to be consistent and make the same claim about the behavioral uniformity of wolves , coyotes , and Jack Russell Terriers , because the same fallacious logic should apply .
Lets see what happens in the Lewontin logic world when a coyote tries to hunt large prey , or a wolf tries to hunt solo for some small prey , or when Paris Hiltons dog joins the police on a drug raid .

Wise also completely invented the fact that human races are less genetically differentiated than animal races .
Using Sewall Wrights genetic distance statistic , FST , the value of differentiation for human races is typically 12 - 15 % , Wright suggested this figure is on the high to moderate end of genetic differentiation among other animal races .
This figure , by the way , clumps together a number of low differentiation populations and drags the number down ; if we compare just the two largest sub-divisions of the human species 
Africans and non-Africans - we get a number of 25 - 30 % , which is huge .
So at the very least we can say the human species has two enormously genetically differentiated races compared with the rest of the animal world .
Wise asserts as fact : generally biologists or geneticists argue , this is the generally accepted science , that in order for two groups or any multiple of groups to be considered subspecies or races or breeds of the same species , they must differ , or they usually will differ , in fact they always will , there will be more difference between the breeds , between the subspecies , between the so - called races , than there will be within the so - called breed , within the so - called subspecies or within the so - called race . 
Generally biologists or geneticists  argue no such ludicrous thing , and Wises generally accepted science  is nt accepted by one scientist much less all of them .
Wise argues that recognized sub - species will always differ more between than within ; this claim is absurd , scientists dont even have this sort of genetic information for but a tiny handful of animals , and this information is worthless for what scientists communicate with classification ( Wise also exaggerated his own lie by arguing that races almost always differ by  10 " and  20 " times as much between than within .
This is another Wise invention ) .
Since genetic distance and / or variability is not even what determines species ( which is simply determined by the presence or absence of breeding in natural zones of contact ) much less sub-species , differences within species ( not just races ) can easily be greater than differences between species ( not just races ) .
If we used the within - between statistic to classify nature it would destroy the biological species concept !
Wises confused blarney is just a dubious interpretation of Richard Lewontins already dubiously interpreted non-fact about why the human species doesnt have races ( and the fault lies with Lewontin just as much as it does with Wise ) .
Thanks to the Endangered Species
Act the criteria scientists really use for determining subspecies in nature is more or less standardized .
In response to questionable interpretations of the U.S. Endangered Species Act , and to help ensure the evolutionary significance of populations deemed  subspecies ,  a set of criteria was outlined in the early 1990s by John C. Avise , R. Martin Ball , Jr. [ 10 ] , Stephen J. OBrien and Ernst Mayr [ 11 ] which is as follows : members of a subspecies would share a unique , geographic locale , a set of phylogenetically concordant phenotypic characters , and a unique natural history relative to other subdivisions of the species .
Although subspecies are not reproductively isolated , they will normally be allopatric and exhibit recognizable phylogenetic partitioning .
Furthermore , evidence for phylogenetic distinction must normally come from the concordant distributions of multiple , independent genetically based traits . [ 12 ]
This is known as the phylogeographic subspecies definition , and a review of recent conservation literature will show that these principles have gained wide acceptance .
Contrary to Wise and what you mightve heard in the media ( the grand majority of biologists agree that there are human races ( There is a widespread feeling that the word race indicates something undesirable and that it should be left out of all discussions .
This leads to such statements as there are no human races .
Those who subscribe to this opinion are obviously ignorant of modern biology .
Races are not something specifically human ; races occur in a large percentage of species of animals . . . the geographic races of the human races established before the voyages of European discovery and subsequent rise of a global economy - agree in most characteristics with the geographic races of animals .
Recognizing races is only recognizing a biological fact .
Wise claims that a European will be nine times more genetically similar to an African than to another European :  On average , humans will vary by eight to nine times more within a population group than between a population group so that I as a European - descended person will be eight to nine times more different from another European person genetically than I would be from someone who is not at all European , who was Asian , or who was African .
HOST : That s evolution for you .
That s clearly stupid misinformation for you .
This is what Nature Genetics last year :  Frequently , it is erroneously contended that the high ( 8595 % ) within group variance of human populations is inconsistent with the existence of races because differences between individuals are greater than differences between groups .
Such low FST values are sometimes misinterpreted to mean that genetic differences between individuals within sub-Saharan Africa , Asia or Europe are typically greater than differences between individuals on different continents .
A positive FST indicates , however that individuals from different populations are , on average , slightly more different from one another than are individuals from the same population  ( p. 5 - 7 ) Wise claimed that there are no races because they arent  concordant ( which he attempted to prove using basketball accomplishment as a genetic marker ! ) , but it is precisely the concordance of traits found in populations that puts this claim to shame .
How , for instance , can we tell apart Europeans and Africans if so much more variation is within each race than between them ?
How can we tell apart a coyote and a Afghan ( a different species ) when they are even less genetically differentiated from each other than is a European and an African ?
The answer that Lewontin didnt tell you , and as I described above , is that ancestry jumbles together certain genes .
Two different Chihuahuas might differ on a number of genes which dont add up to any consistent pattern , but the relatively smaller number of genes that distinguish the Chihuahuas from the wolves are also found together in a statistically predictable way according to and predictable by ancestry .
This means that while , on average , two Chihuahuas will be more genetically different from each other than either is to a wolf , the genetic structure , created by two separate population histories , results in two very different population phenotypes .
The combination of extreme traits that form a Chihuahua are almost all right there in the wolf genome and vice versa , but a wolf would never give birth to anything that looked like a Chihuahua and vice versa because it would be an impossible genetic shuffle to randomly generate .
This miracle is the essence of natural selection - shuffling together ordered patterns over time from raw genetic noise .
Genetic structure is just as important as genetic amount .
Jared Taylor ( who has his own problems correctly interpreting genetics , as weve been over  JARED :
Were you suggesting earlier that whites can be more similar to people of different races than they are to each other ?
Is that what you were suggesting earlier ?
TIM : Im not suggesting it , thats what science says .
JARED : No , no , no , no white people are [ nt ] more similar to blacks , say genetically , than they are to other whites .
TIM : Of course we are .
JARED : That s completely false .
TIM : It is not false . 
You re both wrong .
Taylor is wrong because a white person can easily be more genetically similar to a black person than to another white person .
Bamshad also tested this out :  To quantify how often an individual is more similar to another individual from the same group versus a different group , we defined racial groups a priori using . . . five categories for race based on physical features and / or country of origin : African American ,  White , American Indian or Alaska Native , Asian , and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander . . . and estimated how often an individual was more different from a person in a different racial group than a person from the same racial group based on 377 STR genotypes .
Regardless of the racial group to which an individual belonged , two people from different racial groups were more different than two individuals from the same racial group approximately two - thirds of the time .
Only approximately one - third of the time were two people from the same racial group more different that two individuals from different racial groups . ( p. 7 ) Note that this result is without using genetic structure , as mentioned above , so its reasonable to suppose that similar results could be obtained using Chihuahuas and German Shepherds ( just so people dont get the wrong idea about the phenotypic implications of this ) .
But like Wise , Taylor and many other White Nationalists have occasionally ignored genetic structure too , focusing in on shared genes to the exclusion of structure , in order to make the argument that races share more genes with each other than they do with other races , and therefore must have some sort of special kin-selected bond like mothers and their children do Generally biologists or geneticists  argue no such ludicrous thing , and Wises generally accepted science  is nt accepted byscientist much less all of them .
Wise argues that recognized sub - species will always differ more between than within ; this claim is absurd , scientists dont even have this sort of genetic information for but a tiny handful of animals , and this information is worthless for what scientists communicate with classification ( Wise also exaggerated his own lie by arguing that races almost always differ by  10 " and  20 " times as much between than within .
This is another Wise invention ) .
Since genetic distance and / or variability ( which is simply determined by the presence or absence of breeding in natural zones of contact ) much less sub-species , differences within ( not just races ) can easily be greater than differences between ( not just races ) .
If we used the within - between statistic to classify nature it would destroy the biological species concept !
Wises confused blarney is just a dubious interpretation of Richard Lewontins already dubiously interpreted non-fact about why the human species doesnt have races ( and the fault lies with Lewontin just as much as it does with Wise ) .
Thanks to the Endangered Species
Act the criteria scientistsuse for determining subspecies in nature is more or less standardized .
John Goodrum notes : Contrary to Wise and what you mightve heard in the media ( though , not in the New York Times ) , we know that Lieberman et. al. 1992 ) .
Ernst Mayrs definition of sub-species is the standard one accepted by scientists ( the record is in the scientific literature , look in it and see how many scientists are using the nutty Lewontin within - between formula to determine sub-species of animals - about as many that are using  punctuated equilibrium 
I would guess ) and has been the standard since the initiation of the Darwinian New Synthesis .
Mayr has publicly addressed the misinformation that evolutionary biologists believe there arent human races :
Wise claims that a European will be nine times more genetically similar to an African than to another European : That s clearly stupid misinformation for you .
This is what A.W.F .
Edwards has termed  Lewontins Fallacy  , which we have dealt with previously here .
Basically this idea that Wise is expressing is exactly what Lewontin intended to communicate by his within - between figure .
As Michael Bamshad noted inWise claimed that there are no races because they arent  concordant ( which he attempted to prove using basketball accomplishment as a genetic marker ! ) , but it is precisely the concordance of traits found in populations that puts this claim to shame .
How , for instance , can we tell apart Europeans and Africans if so much more variation is within each race than between them ?
How can we tell apart a coyote and a Afghan ( a different species ) when they are even less genetically differentiated from each other than is a European and an African ?
The answer that Lewontin didnt tell you , and as I described above , is that ancestry jumbles together certain genes .
Two different Chihuahuas might differ on a number of genes which dont add up to any consistent pattern , but .
This means that while , on average , two Chihuahuas will be more genetically different from each other than either is to a wolf , the genetic , created by two separate population histories , results in two very different population phenotypes .
The combination of extreme traits that form a Chihuahua are almost all right there in the wolf genome and vice versa , but a wolf would never give birth to anything that looked like a Chihuahua and vice versa because it would be an impossible genetic shuffle to randomly generate .
This miracle is the essence of natural selection - shuffling togetherover time .
Geneticis just as important as genetic .
Jared Taylor ( who has his own problems correctly interpreting genetics , as weve been over many times on this site before ) also messes up when he attempts to correct Wise : You re both wrong .
Taylor is wrong because .
Bamshad also tested this out : Note that this result is without using genetic , as mentioned above , so its reasonable to suppose that similar results could be obtained using Chihuahuas and German Shepherds ( just so people dont get the wrong idea about the phenotypic implications of this ) .
But like Wise , Taylor and many other White Nationalists have occasionally ignored genetic structure too , focusing in on shared genes to the exclusion of structure , in order to make the argument that races share more genes with each other than they do with other races , and therefore must have some sort of special kin-selected bond like mothers and their children do [ 1 ] .
This result flies in the face of Taylor and any such theory or attendant dubious gene - eye - view ethic for White Nationalism .
Wise , of course was wrong about both structure and amount , believing improbably not just that races were somehow equally related , but that they were somehow more genetically similar than people of the same race by a factor of 10 !
I guess I can understand how Tim or someone might think that any random white person was just as related to any random black person than to any other white person .
If they really believed that race was just skin color or an isolated appearance trait it would make sense .
After all fat people arent more related to other fat people , even though they might share some fat genes .
This would be a wrong idea about race but it is at least understandable .
But how in the world - please someone tell me - can someone believe that the average European is more related to the average African ?
What logic can possibly bridge that gap ?
Genome similarity would have to have an inverse relationship with endogamy and ancestry .
Wises assertions are so bizarre that they are only understandable as a willful mental effort to not understand genetics as much as possible :  Yes , there are population groupings , they relate to the primary point of origin or dispersal or development .
But they do not break down as black , white , Asian , mestizo or indigenous American or whatever categories we might want to construct .
Those categories change over time .
If [ race ] were a biological concept , how would it have been possible for one in Alabama under segregation to be black if you had one eighth black blood but in Mississippi one drop of black blood and in South Carolina one quarter black blood ?
How could it be biological if we could not even and still cannot agree on what it is that makes you black , what it is that makes you white , what it is that makes you Asian ?
How much black blood does it take to cancel out all the white blood ?
How much white blood does it take to cancel out all the Asian blood and make you white ?
Whether we know how to self - identify , of course we do .
We live in a society where race has been given meaning , but I m not in touch with my genotype .
I am not in touch with my DNA .
I dont converse with it on a daily basis to know that I m being instructed by the proteins in my system and the genetic coding on my chromosomes to consider myself white .
I consider myself white because I m accepted and received and treated as white .
Therefore I experience myself as white .
It s a social distinction . "
Wise argues that race is just a social construct , but for Wise to be correct , a change of social label would need to be able to change our genes .
This is the only way that Wise can be correct , and for race to not be a biological concept .
Social rules and choices can determine who we breed with , and can determine the finger - printed mixtures of ancestries we pass on to our children , but social choices do not and can not change our current ancestry .
Wise notes , for instance , that someone couldve been labeled either white or black according to three different rule systems in different parts of the Jim Crow South .
But Wise omits or is just too thick to realize the fact that racial ancestry is not a social label but a verbalized statistic that can be precisely measured and accurately reported with a DNA test .
Words and labels dont change the objective facts of nature .
This is the race that a biologist , if not a sociologist , speaks of , and there is no debating whether or not it exists , and it is also the race that Wise needs to start confronting instead of evading for the purposes of arguments about genetic differences .
Genetic differences do not go away because we dont name them .
If certain American Indian communities  are considered white in one part of the U.S. , this doesnt mean that their red skins will change color or that their peculiar genetic disease susceptibilities will go away .
Wise argues that the Irish became white and that Jews became white , but this doesnt mean that a different social label changed them genetically as individuals ; though assimilation , into non-Irish and non-Jewish populations would genetically change their children as they took ethnically , and hence genetically , different sexual partners .
Irish people who are accepted as , or self - identified as Nigerians , do not therefore acquire black skin and sickle - cell anemia .
Jews who become white do not magically shed Tay - sachs disease , and do not magically lose distinctive Semitic features in the place of distinctive Anglo - Saxon ones ( except , of course , according to the but Wise succumbs to a Platonic fallacy ; when he believes something needs to be forever unchanging in order for it to be real .
I provided a study above that affirmed that these social labels do correspond , with virtual perfection , to coherent , unmanufactured American genetic clusters , which in turn reflect deep evolutionary ancestry .
If Tim Wise has any humility , any integrity , he will stop repeating arguments he cant defend , stop inventing statistics , stop evading the issue of genetic differences with absurd red herrings , non sequiturs and false facts , and start making room for human biodiversity in his ethical world - view , because time is not on the side of genetic equalitarianism when it comes to ancestry and genetic differences .
True liberals accommodate information into their ethical world - views , and shouldnt have any trouble doing it if their convictions are properly justified .
Liberals who evade facts , create a dangerous vacuum and open the door for demagogues like Jared Taylor to fill it .
By his own dishonesty Tim Wise actually assists people like Jared Taylor , and in that sense , ironically , Tim Wise is actually enabling racism .
When the human biodiversity Pandora 's box is finally unleashed , those Creationist liberals who scoffed at and distorted the facts of evolution in the name of social justice will find themselves needlessly discredited , and they will have only themselves to blame as they transparently scramble for the ethical justifications they should have swore by in the first place .

To do this they fallaciously attempt to get from A ( shared genes ) to C ( altruism ) by side - stepping the fundamental bridge , B ( kin-selection ) .
In this way the magical science of ethnic nepotism reminds me of that South Park joke ( which I only know second - hand ) about that air - tight plan for how to make money : Step 1 : collect underpants .
Step 2 : ??
Step 3 : $ $ profit $ $ See ,  Step 2  is the whole story .
Taylor has psychotically argued that it is more ethically justified from a genetic point of view ( whatever that means ? ? ) for a person to prevent the immigration of two African blacks into America than it is for them to save their own drowning child ; a nonsensical , poorly justified ethic that Taylor ( who obviously doesnt have children himself ) is actually promoting .
But according to the Bamshad results , what would actually be justified from a genetic point of view would be for a white person to prefer the immigration of , or to save the life of a black person over another white person about 1/3 of the time  an ethic which actually contradicts White Nationalism .
Taylor , of course , already knew what his ethics were , the ludicrous quasi- scientific gene rationale was drawn entirely post hoc from the newly minted church of Frank Salter .
The Salter crowd , including academic White Nationalists like Kevin MacDonald , is the far Right version of what Alan Sokal was scathingly exposing on the far Left , where marginalized political philosophies , seeking depth and legitimacy , turn themselves into cargo cults by co-opting the language of math and science .
What else can we call it when intellectually decadent academics mine terms and ideas from biology , and use them out of their original functional scientific context to promote ethno - states ?
How is it different from those other Post - Modern academics on the other side of the political spectrum who use out - of - proper - context terms from physics to promote socialism ?
Correction

" Frequently , it is erroneously contended that the high ( 8595 % ) withingroup variance of human populations is inconsistent with the existence of races because differences between individuals are greater than differences between groups .
Such low FST values are sometimes misinterpreted to mean that genetic differences between individuals within sub -Saharan Africa , Asia or Europe are typically greater than differences between individuals on different continents .
A positive FST indicates , however , that individuals from different populations are , on average , slightly more different from one another than are individuals from the same population . . . two people from different racial groups [ are ] more different than two individuals from the same racial group approximately two - thirds of the time . "
Bamshad pp. 5 - 7 Gregory Cochran and Birch Barlow have brought to my attention that the claim that people from different races are more genetically similar 1/3 of the time , whether the intended interpretation of Bamshad 's paper or not , is not true except for single DNA segments .
First Gregory Cochran writes :
The chance that the genetic distance between a European and a sub-Saharan African is going to be less than the genetic distance between two Europeans is effectively zero , not one - third . . .
I faked up two gene frequency data sets such that their Fst was 0.15 I use random sampling to create two individuals from distribution A and one from distribution B : then I calculate the A1 - A2 genetic distance and the A1 - B1 genetic distance .
If I look at 10 loci , A1 is closer to B1 than to A2 about 30 % of the time .
If I use 100 loci , A1 is closer to B1 about 1.9 % of the time .
If I use 1000 loci , A1 is never closer to B1 than A2 in 20,000 runs .
Barlow adds in the comment section , that :
The " 1/3 of the time , someone is more related to someone of another race their own race , " seems like a misintepretation ( or at least very poor representation ) of the fact that one could have a single gene or other DNA segment shared with someone of another race but not someone else of their own race .
Indeed , a 2/3 frequency of a " + " version of a DNA segment vs. a " - " version corresponds fairly well to the ~ 10 - 15 % of variation between races figure ( .67^2+.33^2=.558 , 2*.67*.33=.442 , difference=.116=11.6 % ) .
Slightly different figures ( slightly below 1/3 ) can give
Fst values close to the African vs. non-African one quoted here ; i.e. .25-.30 .
For ex. , .75^2+.25^2=.625 , 2*.75*.25=.375 , difference=.25=25 % ) .
So the criticisms of Taylor for making this claim must be retracted , which is no small admission .
Though I will add that criticisms of Taylor based on poorly justified ethics and Sokal - worthy Salterism are not related to , and hence effected by , this news .

Enlarge By Mark Lennihan , AP CHOKE HAZARDS CHOKE HAZARDS
Most non-fatal choking episodes involve food , according to a study of 17,537 children ages 14 and younger .
Source : Pediatrics
By Frank Pompa , USA TODAY
Nutritionists have long warned of the perils of hot dogs : fat , sodium and preservatives to name a few .
Now , the American Academy of Pediatrics wants foods like hot dogs to come with a warning label — not because of their nutritional risks but because they pose a choking hazard to babies and children .
Better yet , the academy would like to see foods such as hot dogs " redesigned " so their size , shape and texture make them less likely to lodge in a youngster 's throat .
More than 10,000 children under 14 go to the emergency room each year after choking on food , and up to 77 die , says the new policy statement , published online today in Pediatrics .
About 17 % of food - related asphyxiations are caused by hot dogs .
" If you were to take the best engineers in the world and try to design the perfect plug for a child 's airway , it would be a hot dog , " says statement author Gary Smith , director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children 's Hospital in Columbus , Ohio .
" I 'm a pediatric emergency doctor , and to try to get them out once they 're wedged in , it 's almost impossible . "
The Consumer Product Safety Commission requires labels on toys with small parts alerting people not to give them to kids under 3 .
Yet there are no required warnings on food , though more than half of non-fatal choking episodes involve food , Smith says .
" No parents can watch all of their kids 100 % of the time , " Smith says .
" The best way to protect kids is to design these risks out of existence . "
Though Smith says he does n't know exactly how someone would redesign a hot dog , he 's certain that some savvy inventor will find a way .
Janet Riley , president of the National Hot Dog & Sausage Council , supports the academy 's call to better educate parents and caregivers about choking prevention .
" Ensuring the safety of the foods we service to children is critically important for us , " Riley says .
But Riley questions whether warning labels are needed .
She notes that more than half of hot dogs sold in stores already have choking - prevention tips on their packages , advising parents to cut them into small pieces .
" As a mother who has fed toddlers cylindrical foods like grapes , bananas , hot dogs and carrots , I ' redesigned ' them in my kitchen by cutting them with a paring knife until my children were old enough to manage on their own , " Riley says .
The Food and Drug Administration , which has authority to recall products it considers " unfit for food , " plans to review the new statement , spokeswoman Rita Chappelle says .
Given the health risks of obesity , pediatrician Alan Greene , author of Feeding Baby Green , says , " The last thing we need is to redesign candy and junk food with cool shapes , so we can give them to kids even younger . "

Discredited wingnuts lawyer up with high - powered GOP attorneys , downplay crime , go on offensive , blame the ' liberal media '
Latest public explanation for alleged crime quickly shredded ...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/30/2010 , 10:19 pm PT
You folks do realize that James O'Keefe never actually wore his ridiculous pimp costume into those ACORN offices on those doctored and illegally recorded video tapes , right ?
But , rather , he was filmed outside of the offices wearing his get - up , while appearing as the conservatively dressed boyfriend of a hooker trying to escape an abusive pimp when the cameras were rolling inside the offices .
That 's just one of many deceptions O'Keefe carried out .
As one of two independent investigations of the incidents which clear ACORN of wrong - doing noted , this one by former MA Attorney General Scott Harshbarger [ PDF ] :
Although Mr. O'Keefe appeared in all videos dressed as a pimp , in fact , when he appeared at each and every office , he was dressed like a college student - in slacks and a button down shirt .
Since Crazy Andy Breitbart , who released the phony video tapes on his propaganda website , did n't bother to man up and point that out before , during , or after posting them , or while appearing on Fox " News " and elswhere to promote both them and himself , or even after the reports came out , you may not have realized that salient fact .
You may also not have known that while both independent reports , the other one by the Congressional Research Service [ PDF ] , found no criminal wrong doing by ACORN , they did find that O'Keefe likely the broke the law in at least two states by secretly recording the videos which had voice - overs deceptively edited into them later , " in some cases substantially , " according to Harshbarger 's report , so that it was " difficult to determine the questions to which ACORN employees are responding . "
In other words , the videos were a scam perpetrated by both Breitbart and his employee O'Keefe , who now faces felony charges that Breitbart has been tweeting his adorable angry little heart out over the last few days trying desperately to downplay .
Who can blame him ?
Nothing less than whatever little credibility he ever had is on the line after all .
No doubt P.T. Barnum faced similar circumstances as he plied his trade to the suckers born every minute .
So do actual pimps .
Like Andy .
But just imagine the years of outrage and endless repetition of the charges from the Rightwing media and their acolytes --- folks like Crazy Andy --- that would accompany four operatives allied with the Democratic Party , perpetrating a scheme to dress up as phony telephone company employees in order to access and manipulate the phone system in the office of a sitting Republican U.S. Senator .
Of course , it would be the Crime of the Century to the wingnuts , likely led by Breitbart , accompanied by cries of " What did Obama , Pelosi , Reid , ACORN , SEIU and Saul Alinsky know and when they did they know it ? ! " along with calls for resignations in disgrace because of it .
But when the " Liberal MSM " report on a very serious federal felony offense allegedly committed by four Republicans disguising themselves and attempting to interfere with the the phone system of a sitting Democratic U.S. Senator , well , that 's just another example of the outrageously " Liberal MSM , " at least according to Breitbart and O'Keefe 's latest attempted gambit .
That 's the embarrassing meme that the Rightwing propagandist and GOP operative Breitbart is busy Twittering himself to death in hopes of selling , as he desperately tries to reclaim any credibility that he or his GOP " news " outlets might have ever had .
Crazy
Andy is angrily and frantically using the tried and true tactics of Republican Reframing Magic® in the wake of the felony arrest of his own employee O'Keefe , the dirty trickster , and junior propagandist - cum - failed - superspy .
And given the rubes and dopes in the Not - Liberal - At - All MSM , it 's likely they 'll fall for it as hard as they fell for Breitbart / O'Keefe 's ACORN video scheme .
Case in point :
The " liberal " New York Times is already running a fawning 2,250 - word feature story on Breitbart and his gang of desperados in Sunday 's paper .
Can you imagine any such coverage of accused Democratic Party criminals like that ?!
And the GOP outrage that would accompany it if it did ?!
But now that Breitbart and O'Keefe , as of Friday , have decided on a cover story ( posted in full below ) , and seem prepared to stick to it and sell it , let 's give it a look before it all falls completely apart , as it largely already has , even before I had time to finish this story which I got distracted from after beginning to write it yesterday ...
Breitbart 's recent Twittered attempts at spinning wingnut gold out of his employee 's federally felonious straw comes in conjunction with his release on Friday of O'Keefe 's first full statement since Monday 's arrest along with three others Republican dirty trickster co-conspirators --- one , the son of Lousiana 's acting U.S. Attorney William J. Flanagan --- during the alleged attempt to illegally interfere with the phones of U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) .
As posted on Crazy Andy's BigGovernment.com site Friday , O'Keefe 's statement explains that his arrest according to an FBI affidavit , for having " aided and abetted ... in the execution of the plan " to manipulate the Democratic Senator 's phone system after gaining access to it " by falsely and fraudulently representing that the [ sic ] were employees of a telephone company , " was all just one great patriotic " investigation " , O'Keefe informs us , for which , now that he 's been arrested , he 's learned he " could have used a different approach " .
His thin explanation for the incident --- absurd on its face , but well promoted by Breitbart , naturally --- hangs on the notion that the Repub tricksters were n't trying to bug Landrieu 's office , they were just there to " ask the staff if their phones were working " after some complained in December they were unable to get through to the office during the health care vote , when busy signals were the rule of the day .
It 's unclear why they 'd need a scheme at all --- which included dressing up as phone company employees , " manipulating " the phone the at the reception desk , seeking access to the main phone closet , and keeping one man outside in the car with a listening device --- to simply " ask the staff if their phones were working " , but reasonable explanations are n't really required for this bunch of con-men , or the one who employs at least one of them .
Neither does O'Keefe explain in his statement what he had hoped to discover regarding Landrieu 's phone system at the end of January , in regard to apparent complaints that some had trouble reaching her office in Mid-December .
His lame explanation for it all --- both before and after blaming the MSM for his own troubles , rather than taking personal responsibility for it , as an actual conservative might have done --- hangs in this attempted sleight - of - hand from his statement :
When asked about [ " constituents ... having trouble getting through to her office " ]
Senator Landrieu 's explanation was that , " Our lines have been jammed for weeks . "
I decided to investigate why a representative of the people would be out of touch with her constituents for " weeks " because her phones were broken .
Uh , yeah .
But Landrieu 's representative never actually said " her phones were broken " .
The representative said they were " jammed for weeks " .
So O'Keefe 's explanation is a complete FAIL in that regard , for a start , not that the tea baggers who 've come to idolize Breitbart and O'Keefe , or the " liberal MSM " ( who do so as well ) will bother to notice .
There is much more that can be taken apart in O'Keefe / Breitbart 's statement --- for example the hypocrisy of calling for the release of the video tapes he made during the incident , even while both he and Breitbart still refuse to release the full and unedited ACORN tapes months after that scam was pulled --- and I had hoped to do so over the weekend .
But happily , Marcy
Wheeler over at emptywheel beat me to it today .
Her analysis utterly destroys O'Keefe 's ridiculously desperate excuse for violating federal law .
It 's short , sweet , and a must read , so please do so !
Breitbart has still failed to offer an explanation as to how it is that he should be let off the hook for what his employees do ( he now enjoys Twittering that O'Keefe , who he 's admitted he has on salary , is n't actually an employee , or some such falderal ) and that O'Keefe is " innocent until proven guilty " ( twittered disingenuously by Crazy Andy here , here , here and here ) even while extending no such benefit of the doubt to anybody employed by ACORN , naturally .
ACORN , of course , deserves no such benefit of the doubt because , after all , they have the temerity to actually help millions of low and middle - income Americans legally participate in their own democracy , and other such GOP crimes .
J. Garrison Jordan , the attorney for Robert Flanagan --- the accused perp who is also the son of the acting U.S. Attorney in Louisiana --- downplayed all of it on Friday as little more than a youthful prank , telling the AP " You 're dealing with kids . "
[ Update 3/29/10 :
The link to AP 's story at the NPR website now shows up as " File Not Found " for some reason .
Here 's another link to the same story . ]
A " kid " , of course , whose father is an acting U.S. Attorney .
And another " kid " who is , apparently well - connected and / or wealthy enough to afford a Superstar Republican Attorney .
O'Keefe , who is 25 years old ( the others are 24 ) has now lawyered up with Superstar Republican Watergate Attorney , Michael Madigan .
Ironically , Madigan served as the attorney to Republican Howard Baker who famously asked , as the ranking member of the Senate committee investigating Watergate : " What did the President know and when did he know it ? "
But , ya know , we 're just " dealing with kids " here , right ?
Nothing to see .
Move along .
ACORN may be plotting right now to steal another election after all !!!
O'Keefe 's statement follows in full below , but do n't bother looking for Wheeler 's devastating analysis of it over at Breitbart 's site as he 's apparently too cowardly to share it with the very readers he 's conned into believing they are receiving " fair and balanced " coverage of " news " and stuff .
Pimps like Andy , whether they 're wearing the threads are not , turn lots of tricks --- and make lots of dirty money in the bargain .
* * *
The " Statement from James O'Keefe " follows in full below .
Marcy
Wheeler 's analysis shredding it , is here ...
The government has now confirmed what has always been clear :
No one tried to wiretap or bug Senator Landrieu 's office .
Nor did we try to cut or shut down her phone lines .
Reports to this effect over the past 48 hours are inaccurate and false .
As an investigative journalist , my goal is to expose corruption and lack of concern for citizens by government and other institutions , as I did last year when our investigations revealed the massive corruption and fraud perpetrated by ACORN .
For decades , investigative journalists have used a variety of tactics to try to dig out and reveal the truth .
I learned from a number of sources that many of Senator Landrieu 's constituents were having trouble getting through to her office to tell her that they did n't want her taking millions of federal dollars in exchange for her vote on the healthcare bill .
When asked about this , Senator Landrieu 's explanation was that , " Our lines have been jammed for weeks . "
I decided to investigate why a representative of the people would be out of touch with her constituents for " weeks " because her phones were broken .
In investigating this matter , we decided to visit Senator Landrieu 's district office - the people 's office - to ask the staff if their phones were working .
On reflection , I could have used a different approach to this investigation , particularly given the sensitivities that people understandably have about security in a federal building .
The sole intent of our investigation was to determine whether or not Senator Landrieu was purposely trying to avoid constituents who were calling to register their views to her as their Senator .
We video taped the entire visit , the government has those tapes , and I 'm eager for them to be released because they refute the false claims being repeated by much of the mainstream media .
It has been amazing to witness the journalistic malpractice committed by many of the organizations covering this story .
MSNBC falsely claimed that I violated a non-existent " gag order . "
The Associated Press incorrectly reported that I " broke in " to an office which is open to the public .
The Washington Post has now had to print corrections in two stories on me .
And these are just a few examples of inaccurate and false reporting .
The public will judge whether reporters who can't get their facts straight have the credibility to question my integrity as a journalist .

UPDATE 2/1/10 : Our 7 questions for Andy , as AP investigates ...
Should I write Unit Tests ?
The key is to test the areas that you are most worried about going wrong .
That way you get the most benefit for your testing effort .
you find yourself working on an insurance application for a company that stores it 's policies by customer SSN .
Your application is likely to have several validations for customer information .
The validation that ensures a SSN is 9 numeric digits is obviously very important .
The validation that the customer name is alpha - only is probably closer to the category of " nice to have " .
If the alpha - only name validation is broken or removed , the application will continue to function almost entirely normally .
And , the most likely problem is a typo - probably not the end of the world .
It 's usually easy enough to add validations , but you do n't need to test every single validation .
The value of each validation should be used to determine if a test is warranted .
How do I improve the maintainability of my tests ?
That 's it ?
At speakerconf 2010 discussion repeatedly arose around the idea that unit tests hinder your ability to refactor and add new features .
It 's true that tests are invaluable when refactoring the internals of a class as long as the interface does n't change .
However , when the interface does change , updating the associated tests is often the vast majority of the effort .
Additionally , if a refactoring changes the interaction between two or more classes , the vast majority of the time is spent fixing tests , for several classes .
In my experience , making the interface or interaction change often takes 15 - 20 % of the time , while changing the associated tests take the other 80 - 85 % .
When the effort is split that drastically , people begin to ask questions .
The answer at speakerconf was : Probably , but I 'm interested in hearing other options .
Ayende proposed that scenario based testing was a better solution .
His examples drove home the point that he was able to make large architectural refactorings without changing any tests .
Unfortunately , his tests suffered from the same problems that Integration Test advocates have been dealing with for years : Long Running Tests ( 20 mins to run a suite ! ) and Poor Defect Localization ( where did things go wrong ? ) .
However , despite these limitations , he 's reporting success with this strategy .
In my opinion , Martin Fowler actually answered this question correctly in the original Refactoring book .
It 's a bit of a shame that sentence lives in Refactoring and not in every book written for developers beginning to test their applications .
After years of trying to test everything , I stumbled upon that sentence while creating Refactoring : Ruby Edition .
That one sentence changed my entire attitude on Unit Testing .
I still write Unit Tests , but I only focus on testing the parts that provide the most business value .
An exampleMake them more concise .
Once you 've determined you should write a test , take the time to create a concise test that can be maintained .
The longer the test , the more likely it is to be ignored or misunderstood by future readers .
There are several methods for creating more concise tests .
My recent work is largely in Java , so my examples are Java related .
I 've previously written about my preferred method for creating objects in Java Unit Tests .
You can also use frameworks that focus on simplicity , such as Mockito .
But , the most important aspect of creating concise tests is taking a hard look at object modeling .
Removing constructor and method arguments is often the easiest way to reduce the amount of noise within a test .
If you 're not using Java , the advice is the same : Remove noise from your tests by improving object modeling and using frameworks that promote descriptive , concise syntax .
Removing noise from tests always increases maintainability .
Yes .
I find when I only test the important aspects of an application and I focus on removing noise from the tests that I do write , the maintainability issue is largely addressed .
As a result the pendulum swings back towards a more even effort split between features & refactoring vs updating tests .

To many , they are the wonder women of Europe : the Gallic mothers who juggle work and babies with an effortless cool and help keep France a beacon of fertility on an ever - greying continent .
But , according to one leading feminist , the French model of motherhood is facing an unprecedented threat from a " dangerous " new brand of thought which seeks to keep women at home and make them the slaves of their children .
Elisabeth Badinter , 65 , a prominent author and philosopher , declared this week that France was at a turning point in its attitude towards female emancipation .
Thanks to a new coalition of ecologists , breastfeeding advocates and behavioural specialists , she argued , young women are facing increasing pressure to be perfect mothers who adhere to strict guidelines for how to care for their babies .
If this " regressive " movement takes hold , French feminism could be set back decades , she argued .
" The majority of French women [ now ] reconcile maternity with professional life .
Many of them work full - time when they have a child .
They are resisting the model of the perfect mother , but for how long ? "
Badinter said in an interview with Libération newspaper .
" I get the impression that we may now be at a turning point . "
Such views – in her new book , Conflict , Women and Mothers , published today – have seen Badinter plunged into the boiling cauldron that is contemporary French feminist thought .
Attacked by her critics as out of touch with the new generation she is ­attempting to salvage , Badinter has stuck to her guns .
She says that the new image of the " ideal mother " – one who breastfeeds for six months , does not rush to return to full - time work , avoids painkillers in childbirth , rejects disposable nappies and occasionally lets her baby sleep in her bed – makes impossible demands on any woman who has a life outside of her child .
" ' Good motherhood ' imposes new duties that weigh heavily on those who do not keep to them .
It contravenes the model we have worked for until now [ and ] which makes equality of the sexes impossible and women 's freedom irrelevant .
It is a step backwards , " she said .
Cecilé Duflot , the 35 - year - old mother of four children who leads the French Green party , reacted angrily to suggestions that feeding her children organic broccoli and washing nappies made her regressive .
" She is completely wrong … The examples she uses totally miss the point , " Duflot said in a radio interview .
In support of Badinter , Sabine Salmon , president of the association Femmes Solidaires , said that during school visits over the past two years her employees had noticed more and more French schoolgirls expressing a desire to stay at home .
" It 's a very worrying indicator , " she said .
Women in France , which has a fertility rate of 2.0 compared with Britain 's 1.8 and Germany 's 1.4 , have , in recent decades , been discouraged from seeing maternity as their sole raison d'etre .

Salvador DaliX ( 2008 ) / Self - Portrait – B&W photography on paper ( 30 x 40 cm ) .
I was always interested in the person of Salvador Dali .
As a ‘ provocateur ’ and surrealist per excellence he made several legendary interventions and performances which rarely were documented by fotos or film .
They mainly exist as stories and legends .
Through these stories I discovered many details about the sexual life of Salvador Dali : his initial trauma regarding sex due to his severe father who teached him the dangers of sex when he was only a child , showing him a book with pictures of male genitalia suffering from sexually transmitted diseases .
This supposedly lead Dali to become ‘ The great masturbator ’ in order to avoid intercourse .
Then the trauma with his student friend – the writer Garcia Lorca – who presumably tried to rape him but did not succeed according to Dali .
His relatively late discovery of various sexual pleasures with his wife and muse Gala and finally his passion for Amanda Lear , a transvestite and a popstar , with whom he had a long time relationship and helped financially to make a sex change operation .
All these stories inspired me to start producing the ‘ Salvador DaliX ’ paintings , as an ‘ hommage ’ to Dali and as a challenge : to make paintings ‘ Ã la Dali ’ under the identity of an obscure impostor called Salvador DaliX .
This ‘ X - rating ’ of Dali with a pseudonym reflects the already very erotic character of Dalis original oeuvre and hints at the numerous Dali forgeries existing on the market – many of them co-produced by Dali himself .
I am interested in the idea of creating ‘ problematic paintings ’ .
This started with the ‘ Painting China Now ’ series that I made together with Ondrej Brody in 2007 and continues with a different purpose in the Salvador DaliX series .
The Salvador DaliX paintings are based on pornographic photographs stolen from the internet , then manipulated with the computer and finally painted by ‘ my assistants ’ in China : commercial painting companies who specialize in reproducing any picture you e-mail them .
All the paintings are ‘ original ’ oil on canvas – handmade of course .
It seems that the ‘ Made in China ’ stamp devaluates the commercial value of the paintings even more than the fact that they were painted by ( a poor artists ) assistants .
At the same time many people admire paintings of famous contemporary artists that are produced by chinese , russian or eastern european assistants who paint for 10 US dollars an hour in New York , Berlin and London .
The Salvador DaliX paintings refer to many contradictions and problematic aspects ( conceptual , economical , political and visual ) that I find interesting .

British supermarkets are driving rapid destruction of the Amazon rainforest by using meat from farms responsible for illegal deforestation , according to a three - year investigation of the global trade in Brazilian cattle products .
The report names Tesco , Sainsbury 's , Asda , Morrisons and Marks and Spencer among dozens of high - profile companies it says profit from products supplied by Brazilian farms on illegally deforested land .
Much of the trade is in processed beef , used for pies , canned meat and frozen ready meals .
The supermarkets insist it is not from the Amazon .
The Greenpeace investigation also tracked the global trade in other Brazilian goods made from cattle .
It names Nike , Adidas , Timberland and Clarks Shoes among companies it says use leather linked to Amazon destruction .
Greenpeace wants companies to refuse to buy products sourced from farms that have carried out illegal deforestation .
It wants consumers to pressure supermarkets and high - street brands identified in the report to clean - up supply chains .
Sarah Shoraka , Greenpeace forests campaigner , said : " Shoes , handbags and ready meals are n't normally associated with rainforest destruction and climate change , but we 've found a smoking gun .
UK companies are driving the destruction of the Amazon by buying beef and leather products from unscrupulous suppliers in Brazil .
These products are ending up on our shelves . "
She added :
" The cattle industry is the single biggest cause of deforestation in the world and is a disaster for the fight against climate change .
Global brands must take a stand . "
Officials from around the world gather in Bonn for talks on a new treaty on global warming , which is expected to include urgent efforts to protect forests .
Clearing tropical forests for agriculture is estimated to produce 17 % of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions – more than the entire global transport system .
Many of the companies named in the Greenpeace report promote their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions .
The Greenpeace report compiles government records , company documents and trade data from Brazil , China , Europe , Vietnam and the USA , to piece together the global movement of meat , leather and cosmetics ingredients made from Brazilian cattle .
Campaigners used satellite images , surveillance flights and undercover visits to assess deforestation on dozens of ranches across the Amazonian states of Para and Mato Grosso .
Cattle farming is now the biggest threat to the remaining Amazon rainforest , a fifth of which has been lost since 1970 .
Big ranches are blamed for 80 % of all deforestation in the region ; the number of cattle in the Amazon grew from 21 m in 1995 to 56 m in 2006 .
The report , Slaughtering the Amazon , describes how ranches responsible for illegal deforestation sell cattle to slaughterhouses controlled by a handful of Brazilian companies .
These ship beef or hides to facilities in the south of Brazil and process them for export .
They are often processed again in the importing country .
Greenpeace says records show that cattle from hundreds of farms across the Amazon are mixed and processed in this way , making it currently impossible to trace the origins of products .
" In effect , criminal or ' dirty ' supplies of cattle are ' laundered ' through the supply chain . "
The investigation focused on three Brazilian companies , Bertin , JBS and Marfrig , which operate slaughterhouses and together control a third of Brazilian beef exports .
Greenpeace says satellite images and trade records show that all three companies – part - owned by the Brazilian government– source cattle from farms that have carried out illegal deforestation in the Amazon .
It says exports from the south of the country near São Paolo are " polluted " with products from animals raised on deforested land .
Britain is the second largest importer of processed Brazilian beef after the US , taking 50,000 tonnes last year .
Greenpeace says Marfrig facilities export processed beef to Green Isle Foods , an Irish subsidiary of Northern Foods .
Product labels show Northern Foods supplies convenience foods that contain the Marfrig meat to Sainsbury 's , Asda and Morrisons , the report says .
It says Tesco and Marks and Spencer sell tinned Brazilian beef supplied separately by JBS .
Tesco and Marks and Spencer denied the meat came from the Amazon .
Marks and Spencer said : " We do not accept and have never used any beef from the Amazon region .
We have been working with our Brazilian beef supplier for over 20 years and through the traceability measures we have in place we can ensure that all the product supplied to us by them is from the exact location we specify . "
Sainsbury 's said it used " a small amount of Brazilian beef in our frozen and canned range " .
Morrisons said its suppliers provided documents to prove beef was not linked to Amazon deforestation .
Asda said it was confident its beef did not come from the Amazon .
It said : " If that is n't the case we 'd take that very seriously indeed . "
A Tesco spokesman said : " Our canned beef is sourced from São Paolo , which is about 3,000 km away from the Amazon .
I have also been informed that the cows cannot travel more than 300 km . "
The report says : " While the blue chip companies behind reputable global brands appear to believe that Amazon sources are excluded from their products , Greenpeace investigations expose for the first time how their blind consumption of raw materials fuels deforestation and climate change . "
Northern Foods said : " The only Brazilian beef we buy for our Green Isle business is cooked beef from a single site in São Paulo state , not in or near the Amazon basin , and not sourcing materials from sites in or near the Amazon basin .
The supplier we use , Marfrig , provides certificates to verify the farm source for this plant . "
Marfrig said it only bought cattle from farms not included on a Brazilian government prohibited list .
" We have not been informed of any such violations by Greenpeace so cannot comment . "
Nike and Adidas said they would be discussing the issue with Greenpeace .
Timberland said it used Bertin leather , but did not track the origin of all raw materials .
Clarks
Shoes said its UK operation was phasing out Bertin leather and seeking ways to guarantee source .
Bertin said it would investigate and act on any evidence of " supplier irregularity " .
Siddiqui maintained the charges against her were fabricated A US court has found a female Pakistani scientist guilty of attempting to murder US agents while she was detained for questioning in Afghanistan .
The prosecution said Aafia Siddiqui , a US - trained neuroscientist , picked up an army rifle and shot at the US agents .
None of the Americans was injured but Siddiqui , 37 , was shot .
She denied the charges , as well as claims she had links to the al - Qaeda leadership .
Rights groups say she has spent five years in secret US jails .
Siddiqui was arrested by Afghan police in July 2008 on suspicion of carrying chemicals and notes referring to " mass - casualty attacks " in New York .
The attempted murder was found not to have been premeditated .
Courtroom outbursts
The jury in Manhattan found her guilty of attempted murder , armed assault and using and carrying a firearm .
She faces a maximum term of life in prison .
Sentencing is due on 6 May .
After the verdict was delivered , Siddiqui shouted to the court : " This is a verdict coming from Israel , not America . "
She had argued that she would not get a fair trial if there were Jewish people on the jury .
Her two - week trial was marked by other outbursts from the defendant which got her expelled from the courtroom .
Prosecutors said she was carrying bomb - making instructions and a list of targets including New York 's Statue of Liberty when she was arrested .
She was not tried on terrorism charges , however .
FBI agents and US military personnel testified that as they prepared to question Siddiqui at an Afghan police station on 18 July 2008 , she picked up an unattended weapon and began shooting .
The Americans said she had shouted " Death to Americans " and " God is great " in Arabic .
The Americans returned fire , wounding her , and she was brought to the US to face charges of attempted murder once she had recovered .
' Secret prison ' Siddiqui said she had been shot after looking out from behind a curtain for an escape from the police station .
She maintained her innocence throughout the trial .
Her defence team claimed there was no forensic evidence the rifle alleged to have been used was ever fired .
Her lawyer , Linda Moreno , also said the government 's witnesses gave contradictory evidence about where Siddiqui was in the room during the altercation , the number of shots fired and how many people were present .
During her testimony , Siddiqui claimed to have been held in a " secret prison ... where children were tortured " , before her arrest in Afghanistan .
The comments relate to her mysterious disappearance between 2003 , after she had returned from the US to Pakistan , and her arrest in Afghanistan in 2008 .
She was divorced in 2002 and was said to have then married the nephew of alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , which her family deny .
US and Pakistani officials denied having anything to do with her disappearance .

The chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary committees vowed hearings Friday on a report into interrogation abuses during the Bush administration .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) said they would press forward with congressional inquiries after the Justice Department released a report Friday condemning those lawyers ' conclusions , but declining to pursue criminal charges .
The Justice Department report , which was sought by Attorney General Eric Holder , accuses top members of the Office of Legal Council ( OLC ) during the administration of President George W. Bush of " poor judgment " in providing legal backing to the harsh interrogation tactics of terror suspects .
In particular , the report harshly criticized two lawyers , John Yoo and Jay Bybee , for penning memos authorizing certain techniques .
ADVERTISEMENT
Leahy announced a hearing next Friday , Feb. 26 into the memos , and called on Bybee , who is now a federal judge , to resign that position .
" I have said before that if the Judiciary Committee , and the Senate , knew of Judge Bybee ’s role in creating these policies , he would have never been confirmed to a lifetime appointment to the federal bench , " Leahy said Friday evening in a statement .
" The right thing to do would be for him to resign from this lifetime appointment . "
Conyers condemned the actions of lawyers , who wrote memos authorizing waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation tactics .
" Today ’s report makes plain that those memos were legally flawed and fundamentally unsound , " Conyers said Friday evening in a statement .
" It is nothing short of a travesty that prisoners in U.S. custody were abused and mistreated based on legal work as shoddy as this . "
He also vowed to press ahead with hearings , for which he 's previously called , though he set no timeline for the inquiry .
" While the report concludes that the lawyers did not breach their minimum professional obligations , I certainly hold top lawyers at OLC to a higher standard that , as all Americans should , " Conyers said .
" As I have previously stated , the committee intends to hold a hearing on these matters shortly . "
The Dish was recently taken aback by a document emailed to us showing that the age of sexual consent in Vatican City was - wait for it - twelve years old .
We did n't believe it .
So we tried to nail down the precise facts .
Here 's the email we eventually got from the Italian embassy ( the Vatican embassy was n't , er , much help ) regarding age of consent laws :
Vatican State has its own criminal system based on the former Italian criminal code ( called “ Zanardelli Code ” , issued in 1889 ) .
Art 331 ( 1 ) of this code provides that the age of consent is set at 12 years old , but according to Art. 331 ( 2 ) when there is a relationship of dependence ( like teacher / student / etc. ) the age of consent is 15 years .
This law applies to criminal suspects arrested in Vatican City .
Whereas , if a sexual offence occurs in Vatican State but the suspect is arrested in Italy , he / she is tried under Italian criminal law , based on Italian Criminal code called “ Rocco Code ” , issued in 1930 .
According to article 609 quarter of this code , the age of consent is set at 14 years old or 16 years old if there is a relation of dependence .
There is an exception to this rule : having sexual intercourse with a partner aged 13 does n’t constitutes a sexual offence only if the age difference between the two individuals is not more than 3 years .

Gardaí have begun an investigation into a fire which broke out at a ’ head shop ’ in the centre of Dublin early this morning .
Nirvana , a store on Capel Street that sells so - called “ legal highs , ” was gutted in the blaze which led to the closure of the street to traffic for the day .
The street will be closed until Monday at least .
The fire started at approximately 6 am and quickly spread to two adjoining shops including the sex shop , Utopia 2 .
Five units of the Dublin Fire Brigade attended the fire including units from Tara Street , Phibsborough and North Strand stations .
Initally there were fears the fire might spread to other buildings but firefighters were able to bring the blaze under control at about 11 am
However , it was n’t fully extinguished until about 5 pm .
There are no reports of anyone being injured although a number of residents living in nearby flats were evacuated .
Throughout much of the day large plumes of smoke billowed out onto neighbouring streets and onto the quays .
Dublin Fire Brigade said the three shops would all have to be demolished .
One resident living in the building next to Utopia 2 , said they heard " a big bang " shortly after 6 am and fled their apartment .
" We have n't been told when or if we 'll be able to return home and I 'm worried because all my belongings are in there , " said the resident .
While the cause of the fire is not yet known , Nirvana 's owner Jim Bellamy claimed it may have been started deliberately following a widespread campaign against ’ head shops ’ .
Speaking on Newstalk FM he said : “ Somebody has taken the law into their own hands by the disgusting media coverage of the last month or so .
We have been tried by the media , found guilty . . . and this is the sentence ” .
Regulations which will outlaw a range of products sold as “ legal highs ” in head shops across the State are expected to be introduced later this year .

Newly released aerial photographs of the World Trade Center terror attack capture the towers ’ collapse , from just after the first fiery plane strike to the dust clouds that spread over Lower Manhattan and New York harbor .
The images were taken from a police helicopter carrying the only photographer allowed in the air space near the towers on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
They were obtained by ABC News after it filed a Freedom of Information Act request last year with the National Institute of Standards and Technology , which investigated the towers ’ collapse .
The still images are “ a phenomenal body of work ” that show a new , wide - angle look at the towers ’ collapse and the gray dust clouds that shrouded the city afterward , said Jan Seidler Ramirez , the chief curator of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum , which is compiling a digital archive of attack coverage .
The photos are “ absolutely core to understanding the visual phenomena of what was happening , ” Ms. Ramirez said .

We still do n’t know exactly how many people are sexually abused behind bars every year , but we do know that the number is much larger than 100,000 .
And we know that those responsible for this abuse are usually not other inmates , but members of the very corrections staff charged with protecting the people in their custody .
The BJS , which is part of the Department of Justice , found statistically significant variation in the incidence of sexual abuse at the hundreds of different facilities it surveyed .
Its study of adult prisons , for example , found that 4.5 percent of prisoners nationwide had been sexually abused at their current facilities in the preceding year ; but at seven prisons the rate was above 10 percent .
Texas ’s Estelle Unit had a rate of 15.7 percent , while in six prisons no inmates reported such abuse .
One of the most pernicious myths about prisoner rape is that it is an inevitable part of life behind bars .
This is simply wrong .
As the variance in the BJS findings shows , it can be prevented .
In well - run facilities across the country it is being prevented — and this should n’t be surprising .
After all , the government has extraordinary control over the lives of those it locks up .
Stopping sexual abuse in detention is a matter of using sound policies and practices , and passing laws that require them .
The Prison Rape Elimination
Act of 2003 ( PREA ) , which charged the BJS with undertaking its surveys , also created a body called the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission , whose mandate was to study the problem more qualitatively and devise national standards for its detection , prevention , and response .
Doing so proved to be a slow process .
The commissioners convened expert committees , made an exhaustive review of available research , held numerous site visits and public hearings , and submitted draft versions of the standards for public comment .
At every step they consulted corrections leaders , survivors of sexual assault in detention , researchers , advocates on behalf of prisoners , academics , legal experts , and health care providers .
Finally , on June 23 , 2009 , six years after the passage of PREA , the commission published its recommendations .
( Staff and board members from our organization , Just Detention International ( JDI ) , the only US NGO dedicated solely to ending sexual abuse in detention , served on all eight of the expert committees appointed by the commission . )
The commission wrote four distinct sets of standards : one for adult prisons and jails , with an immigration supplement ; one for juvenile facilities ; one for “ lockups , ” i.e. , temporary holding facilities for people recently arrested or being transferred ; and one for “ community corrections ” — for example , people who are living in post - release halfway houses or are on probation .
Its final report describes and explains them all .
Reading it , one is repeatedly struck by how straightforward and plainly sensible these recommendations are — and , therefore , by how astonishing it is , and how appalling , that such basic measures have n’t already been standard practice for decades .
In 2000 , in a Texas prison , a corrections officer was sexually harassing Garrett Cunningham , touching him inappropriately during pat searches and making crude comments .
Cunningham , as he told the commission , complained to prison authorities , but they told him that he was exaggerating , and that the officer was just doing his job .
Soon after , the officer handcuffed Cunningham , pushed his face into a pile of laundry , and raped him .
Cunningham weighed 145 pounds ; the officer more than twice that .
He said that if Cunningham ever tried to report the rape , he would have other officers write false charges against him , or else transfer him to a rougher unit where he would be raped by gang members “ all the time . ”
Then he told Cunningham that the officials he had complained to previously were friends of his who would always take his side .
2
The commission ’s first standard for all facilities stipulates that every corrections agency have “ a written policy mandating zero tolerance toward all forms of sexual abuse . ”
Staff and inmates must “ understand what constitutes sexual abuse , know penalties exist for perpetration by prisoners or staff , and believe management will treat all incidents seriously . ”
Staff must be trained to identify early warning signs that someone is at risk of sexual abuse , prevent abuse from occurring , and respond appropriately when it does occur .
Since “ the persistent silence surrounding incidents of sexual abuse in correctional facilities is a reality that both victims and professionals in the field acknowledge , ” all facility employees and volunteers must be required to report any suspicions of such abuse .
“ Mandatory reporting policies are powerful antidotes to the code of silence . ”
The standards also require that inmates be taught their rights , not only to be free from sexual abuse , but to be free from retaliation if they report it .
When Rodney Hulin was sixteen he set a dumpster on fire , causing about $ 500 worth of damage .
He was 5 ' 2 ″ , he weighed 125 pounds , and he was sentenced to eight years in adult prison .
Almost immediately after arriving he was raped by another inmate , as was confirmed by a medical examiner ’s finding that his rectum was torn .
His mother ’s testimony to the commission describes how he wrote to the authorities asking to be moved to a safer place , and how his request was denied .
The beatings and rapes continued .
He wrote another letter , saying he was afraid “ I might die at any minute .
Please sir , help me . ”
Officials told him that his case did not meet the “ emergency grievance criteria . ”
His mother called the warden , who told her that Rodney needed to “ grow up . ”
“ This happens every day , ” he said , “ learn to deal with it .
It ’s no big deal . ”
Less than three months after entering prison , Hulin hanged himself in his cell .
3
Every inmate when first arriving at a facility is put through a classification process , meant to assess the security risk he poses .
In most corrections facilities , inmates are not classified by their risk of being subject to sexual abuse .
But as we saw from the BJS studies discussed in our previous article , such risk can be objectively assessed according to a number of well - known factors — like Hulin ’s age and size , or the fact that he was entering prison for the first time , and that his crime was not violent .
One of the commission ’s most important standards requires that all inmates be screened in order “ to assess their risk of being sexually abused by other inmates or sexually abusive toward other inmates . ”
These screenings must rely on specific criteria that have been shown to be relevant to sexual violence .
The results must then be taken into account when deciding where inmates will be lodged .
“ Without this process , vulnerable individuals may be forced to live in close proximity or even in the same cell with sexual assailants . ”
It happens frequently .
4
Housing and surveillance become grave challenges when prisons are overcrowded , but as the report says :
Supervision is the core practice of any correctional agency , and it must be carried out in ways that protect individuals from sexual abuse .
The Commission believes it is possible to meet this standard in any facility , regardless of design , through appropriate deployment of staff .
Its standards on “ inmate supervision ” and “ assessment and use of monitoring technology ” explain in detail how to do so .
5
Marilyn Shirley was woken by a guard named Michael Miller at 3:30 one morning and summoned to the officers ’ station .
She was afraid something had happened to her twins , or to her husband , who had heart problems and diabetes .
But when she got to the station she heard Miller on the phone , asking another officer for a signal if the lieutenant should head their way .
When he hung up he began to grope her , demanding oral sex , and when she resisted he slammed her against a wall and raped her .
He whispered in her ear , “ Do you think you ’re the only one ?
Do n’t even think of telling , because it ’s your word against mine , and you will lose . ”
Remarkably , however , as the commission reported , Shirley was able to hide and preserve her semen - stained sweatpants until her release six months later , when she accused Miller .
He was convicted of rape and imprisoned — making Shirley ’s story a very rare one .
6
The commission ’s standards call for coordinated responses to sexual abuse from security staff , investigators , the head of the facility , and medical and mental health practitioners .
The immediate safety of the survivor must be the first priority — and since those raped in prison are so often abused repeatedly , often by multiple rapists , there is great urgency to this .
But survivors also face very serious longer - term health concerns , both physical and mental , 7 and the report proposes detailed standards on the care they should get .
Since few people in the immediate aftermath of rape in prison have Marilyn Shirley ’s combination of bravery , presence of mind , and good luck , the commission is equally concerned with the nature of the investigations that must follow every report of sexual abuse .
The stakes are high : failure to investigate allegations sends a message to staff and prisoners that speaking out may put the victim at risk but has no consequences for the abuser .
In such environments , silence prevails and abuse flourishes .
8
The standards insist that agencies collect and carefully consider data on sexual abuse from all their facilities , and that facilities conduct “ sexual abuse incident reviews ” :
These reviews reveal patterns , such as vulnerable locations , times of highest risk , and other conditions … .
[ They ] generate information administrators need to make efficient use of limited resources , deploy staff wisely , safely manage high - risk areas , and develop more effective policies and procedures .
When Laura Berry told the Arkansas corrections officer who had raped her that she thought she might be pregnant , he forced her , according to the commission ’s findings , to drink turpentine and quinine , hoping that would induce an abortion .
After Kenneth
Young was raped at knifepoint by a cellmate in Pennsylvania , he flooded the cell to attract the attention of officers , and as punishment was put in a “ dry cell ” for ninety - six hours , with no access to running water , a shower , or a toilet — forced “ to live in his own excrement , ” as a court later put it .
Alisha Brewer told our organization , JDI , that she was raped by three different corrections officers as a twenty - two - year - old prisoner in Kentucky ; she reported the last two incidents , and was punished with more than four months of punitive segregation and loss of sixty days of good time on her sentence .
9
Another prisoner who wrote to us , and who for obvious reasons prefers to remain anonymous , quoted the male officer who was abusing her : “ Remember if you tell anyone anything , you ’ll have to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life . ”
We get letters like this every day .
The commission ’s standards require
facilities to monitor prisoners and staff who report abuse for at least 90 days to ensure that they are not experiencing retaliation or threats .
If threats or actual retaliation do occur , the facility must take immediate action to stop the threatening behavior .
How much of a difference would the commission ’s standards make if adopted and enforced nationally ?
It ’s impossible to say with any precision .
But as Jason DeParle wrote in these pages three years ago , “ Since 1980 the murder rate inside prisons has fallen more than 90 percent , which should give pause to those inclined to think that prisons are impossible to reform .
” 10 While the dynamics of sexual violence are quite different from those of homicide , both problems shrink or grow behind bars depending on the effectiveness of a facility ’s management .
The BJS studies suggest that sexual abuse has been nearly eradicated in some facilities already , and the policies and practices through which those institutions have achieved such success , as codified in the standards , are basic , common - sense measures .
We believe that the incidence of prisoner rape would be cut dramatically if they were adopted everywhere — perhaps by as much as half over the next decade .
As the BJS studies show , that would mean tens of thousands of people every year — perhaps as many as 100,000 , or even more — who would be spared atrocious abuse .
Prisoner rape is one of the few issues on which there is no disagreement between Democrats and Republicans , or between the Christian right and liberals .
11 Nor is it simply an issue that pits corrections officers against the rest of the world .
Good and dedicated corrections staff know that sexual abuse in detention is a terrible problem not only for its immediate victims , but for them as well , and for the country as a whole .
These are people who take pride in their jobs and their profession , and nothing could be more contrary to their mission than allowing those in their care to be raped .
In facilities where rape is common and unchecked by authorities , where the rules seem to have no force and animosity between inmates and staff is fueled , their safety is at risk .
And they know that traumatized survivors and undeterred rapists may , on release , be more prone to recidivism themselves .
Indeed , corrections officials were deeply involved in developing the standards .
The JDI staff and board members on the commission ’s expert committees were in a small minority of non-corrections participants .
Many of the most important corrections leaders in the country served on the committees , including former presidents of the Association of State Correctional Administrators ( ASCA ) , current and former directors of state departments of corrections , as well as prison wardens , among others .
There were some points of contention between advocates of prisoner rights and corrections officials on issues such as whether officers should supervise inmates of the opposite sex , 12 whether they should be able to see and hear everyone in their custody at all times , and whether inmates should have the right to confidential counseling .
13
On all these issues , the corrections officials mostly prevailed .
Overall , however , advocates and corrections officials on the expert committees were willing collaborators in a joint venture .
The commission ’s recommended standards have been submitted to US Attorney General Eric Holder , who by law has until June 23 , 2010 , to review them and make any changes he deems necessary .
Then he must issue them formally , following which they will become nationally binding .
14 Now , however , he is being pressured to weaken the standards .
And the opposition to the commission ’s recommendations is led by corrections officials : in particular , by professional associations such as ASCA , which has accused the commission of being “ one - sided and myopic ” in its approach , and gone so far as to call it “ childlike .
”
15
These corrections officials seem to have a great deal of influence over the current Department of Justice .
The review it has undertaken since June 2009 resembles the commission ’s in many ways , but what had been an open and inclusive process under the commission is now largely closed .
We know which agencies are participating in the Justice Department ’s internal working group on the standards — including officials from the Bureau of Prisons , who are also opposed to important aspects of the commissions recommendations 16 — but we still do not have a list of the group ’s members .
Neither survivors of prisoner rape nor their advocates now have any formal role .
It appears certain that Holder will request an additional year , or perhaps even more , for his own review .
The main concern expressed by opponents of the commission ’s standards is that observing them will be too expensive .
One PREA provision barred the commission and the attorney general from establishing standards “ that would impose substantial additional costs compared to costs currently expended by Federal , State , and local prison authorities . ”
The commission was mindful of this throughout its work , however .
17 And PREA is not the only relevant law here .
Under the Eighth Amendment , which forbids cruel and unusual punishment , every corrections system is already obligated to protect its inmates from sexual abuse .
Rape is illegal everywhere , including detention facilities , and all fifty states have laws making sexual contact of staff with inmates a criminal offense ; so does applicable international law .18 Still , no one doubts that bringing corrections systems across the country into compliance with the standards will require money , and everyone acknowledges the importance of this consideration .
But opponents of the standards now seem to be trying to inflate estimates of their costs .
And again , their influence over the Department of Justice is disturbing .
In perhaps the most questionable aspect of the department ’s review process , it has commissioned a study of the costs of implementing the standards that appears biased from the outset .
The firm that was awarded the contract for this study , Booz Allen Hamilton , plans to rely on estimates of expenses from corrections administrators who volunteer to participate .
19 Officials who oppose the standards will have an obvious incentive to exaggerate their anticipated costs — and so will officials who support the standards , since they also want and need more funding than is usually appropriated for them .20
The Justice Department need n’t rely on estimates of future costs .
Instead , it could look to corrections systems that are already implementing the standards , to see what their actual costs are .
JDI is working with three such systems right now — the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , the Oregon Department of Corrections , and the Macomb County Sheriff ’s Department in Michigan — to help them achieve compliance with the standards even before they are legally obliged to do so .
California runs a large , troubled prison system , Oregon a smaller one , and Macomb County a medium - sized jail for men and women .
All three systems face budget crises , and are unable to provide significant additional funding .
Between them , they will give a good indication of what is possible at what cost nationally .
Max Williams , director of the Oregon Department of Corrections , estimates that his system has achieved compliance with 70 percent of the standards already .
As he told us , “ In Oregon , we have n’t had to hire any new staff as part of the effort to implement the standards .
Instead , we have retrained and repurposed existing staff .
We have made some hard dollar investments , in cameras , a database , etc. , but those are tools we can use for much more than handling the problem of sexual abuse . ” 21 None of these systems are currently included in the Booz Allen study , however .
In any case , it is a mistake to consider the costs of implementing the standards without also taking account of the benefits .
Even when the financial implications of prisoner rape are the only ones considered — and surely they are less important than the moral or simply human considerations involved here — the savings and tangible benefits of preventing rape are considerable .
As the result of litigation when corrections staff have engaged in or allowed sexual abuse in their facilities , corrections systems have had to pay many millions of dollars in damages over the last few years .
22
When survivors of prisoner rape require medical care , as they often do , corrections systems must bear most of the costs .
And people traumatized by sexual assault behind bars are often unable to resume economically productive lives after their release .
23
The Booz Allen study , as now conceived , is not a cost - benefit analysis .
This is especially baffling when we consider that the executive order governing the federal rule - making process requires a cost - benefit analysis before the attorney general can issue the standards .
Unless he is looking to rewrite them entirely , we can see no reason why he is n’t looking at their obvious benefits now .
Apart from costs , we believe that there is also another and perhaps more important reason why some corrections officials are opposed to the commission ’s recommendations : the prospect that their compliance with the standards would be closely monitored .
The commission wrote that “ the very nature of correctional environments demands that the government and the public have multiple ways to watch over ” prisons and jails .
The report quotes Michele Deitch , an expert on the oversight of corrections systems : “ Effective prison management demands both internal accountability measures and external scrutiny .
The two go hand - in - hand , and neither is a replacement for the other . ”
Accordingly , the commission proposed a standard requiring that independent audits of every detention facility be made at least every three years .
24 This standard also requires that data collected by these audits be made public .
And the commission strongly endorsed a resolution of the American Bar Association recommending that federal , state , and territorial governments adopt effective systems of external oversight .25
Although effective oversight is not by itself enough to stop sexual abuse in detention , it is an indispensable part of any solution , and few reforms would do more to improve prison conditions generally .
If the commission ’s standards and recommendations are approved and enforced , they will greatly strengthen our systems of oversight .
This , we believe , is what the opponents of reform truly fear .
Will Harrell , the former independent ombudsman of the Texas Youth Commission , who was appointed after pervasive sexual abuse of its juvenile detainees by staff was revealed in 2007 , told us in an e-mail :
Administrators whose perspective was formed under the tradition of public exclusion are deeply resistant to independent , external oversight .
They fear the loss of control over the flow of information .
They fear potential embarrassment or scandal .
But …the public must watch the watchmen .
Max Williams told us , “ Many officials are afraid that these audits are designed to be a ‘ gotcha , ’ a ‘ we ’re going to zing you . ’
That ’s what they are worried about . ”
To a certain extent , such fear is understandable .
Even good corrections officers feel embattled by dangerous inmates who badly outnumber them .
They also feel that they are underfunded and underpaid by the government , and ignored or reviled by the public .
A sort of bunker mentality often grows among them , in which the most unforgivable act is reporting on a fellow officer .
When that is the case , even in facilities where good people work , corruption spreads .
But no public institutions are more in need of transparency and accountability than prisons and jails .
Without external scrutiny , sadistic and autocratic people can turn their facilities into private hells — as happened in Texas just a few years ago , when hundreds of children were raped night after night by their guards , and there was no help for them .
Any decent system of oversight would have made that impossible .
Sexual abuse in detention is a human rights crisis in this country .
Reform is urgent , and the commission makes clear how to achieve it .
No one expects or wants Attorney General Holder simply to accept the commission ’s recommendations without question , but it is worth emphasizing that a bipartisan , government - appointed commission has already spent years developing standards to prevent prisoner rape .
Its proceedings were inclusive , responsible , and exhaustive , and the standards themselves products of compromise among experts , reflecting the best practices already in place at our best facilities .
If Holder needlessly delays in approving these standards , or ones very much like them — worse , if he strips them of their force because of pressure from corrections leaders — then tens or hundreds of thousands of men , women , and children will continue to be raped while in the government ’s care , when we could have prevented it .
— February 25 , 2010 ; this is the second of two articles .
Who'd have thought John Ashcroft would be the one to come out of the Bush administration with a shred of decency intact .
Of course , when you 're succeeded by Alberto Gonzales , that bar is n't set particularly high .
Nonetheless , Ashcroft is speaking out in sharp counterpoint to the increasingly shrill fearmongers in his party who insist that we 're only safe if we give up on the rule of law .
In an interview with the Huffington Post at the Conservative Political Action Conference , the former Bush administration official said that there are " a variety of tools that ought to be available to an administration " in its efforts to curb terrorism and bring terrorists to justice .
Asked specifically about holding civilian trials for terrorists , he said such a venue " has use and utility . "
When asked how to distinguish whether to use a military tribunal system or criminal courts for terrorist suspects , Ashcroft said : " It depends on the circumstances . "
" Our priority should be a priority of preventing further terrorist attacks and to automatically allocate people from one system to another without understanding what best achieves that priority would in my judgment be less than optimal , " he said .
He also defended Mirandizing terror suspects .
" When you have a person in the criminal justice system , you Mirandize them , " Ashcroft said flatly , when asked by HuffPost about the reading - of - rights that has conservatives outraged at the Obama administration .
Ashcroft will undoubtedly now be vilified by the " torture first , ask questions later " crowd for recognizing that our system of justice is perfectly capable of handling terror suspects .
Nonetheless , his sober assessment shows just how extreme the Cheney crowd is , and why Dems should not allow the Cheney crowd to dominate the debate .
Another data point on that : the American public has no problem with terror suspects being Mirandized .
Dems have to take the advantage back on these issues and realize that they can win the national security argument .
An early study suggests that vitamin B3 or niacin , a common water - soluble vitamin , may help improve neurological function after stroke , according to Henry Ford Hospital researchers .
When rats with ischemic stroke were given niacin , their brains showed growth of new blood vessels , and sprouting of nerve cells which greatly improved neurological outcome .
Now research is underway at Henry Ford to investigate the effects of an extended - release form of niacin on stroke patients .
Henry Ford is the only site nationally conducting such a study .
" If this proves to also work well in our human trials , we 'll then have the benefit of a low - cost , easily - tolerable treatment for one of the most neurologically devastating conditions , " Michael Chopp , Ph.D. , scientific director of the Henry Ford Neuroscience Institute .
Dr. Chopp will present results from the animal model study at the International Stroke Conference in San Antonio .
According to the National Stroke Association , stroke is the third - leading cause of death in America and a leading cause of disability .
Ischemic strokes occur as a result of an obstruction within a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain .
Ischemic stroke accounts for about 87 percent of all cases .
One underlying condition for this type of obstruction is the development of fatty cholesterol deposits lining the vessel walls .
Niacin is known to be the most effective medicine in current clinical use for increasing high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL - C ) , which helps those fatty deposits .
Dr. Chopp and his colleagues found that in animals niacin helps restore neurological function in the brain following stroke .
In 2009 , stroke physicians at Henry Ford Hospital published research which showed that HDL - C is abnormally low at the time stroke patients arrive at the hospital .
Dr. Chopp 's research found that in animals , niacin increased " good " cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , which increased blood vessels in the brain and axonal and dendritic growth leading to a substantial improvement in neurological function .
" Niacin essentially re-wires the brain which has very exciting potential for use in humans , " says Dr. Chopp .
" The results of this study may also open doors in other areas of neurological medicine , including brain injury . "
Andrew Russman , D.O. , is the principal investigator of the team at Henry Ford Hospital who will evaluate in clinical trials whether niacin improves recovery for human stroke patients .
" If we are able to prove that treating patients with niacin helps to restore neurological function after stroke , we 're opening a whole new avenue of treatment for the leading cause of serious long - term disability in adults , " says Dr. Russman .

The actor playing the Patchwork Girl is Pierre Couderc or The Marvelous Couderc .
Wikipedia says he was a French acrobat , actor , screenwriter and producer and that he also appeared in His Majesty The Scarecrow of Oz .
Mr. Couderc certainly deserves credit because he does a great job of bringing Scraps to life .
In the books , she is never still , always getting into trouble , but truly kind and helpful .
She 's all that in this movie too .
The Woozy is also very well done ; he looks exactly like John R. Neill 's illustrations .
Thank you for posting this movie .

Subject : Awful video compression artifacts
Whatever entertainment to be had from the film is demolished by the hugely artifacted video compression .
The size of the file is no indicator of the quality in this instance .
It looks horrible .
I downloaded the .ogv .
Concerning the previous reviewer 's comments about the music : I agree it 's inappropriate .
It consists of haphazardly - chosen NUTCRACKER excerpts for the most part , if memory serves .
However , I do n't think it 's a synthesized orchestra .
The audio compression is also bad , so that the squashing of the sound makes it flange / phase horribly , giving it an electronic edge .

# 432550 +( 1199 ) - [ X ] Rabidplaybunny87 : A Touching Story of Love and Marriage
Rabidplaybunny87 :
An elderly man lay dying in his bed .
In death 's agony , he suddenly
smelled the aroma of his favorite chocolate chip cookies wafting up
the stairs .
He gathered his remaining strength , and lifted himself from
the bed .
Leaning against the wall , he slowly made his way out of the
bedroom , and with even greater effort inched himself down the stairs ,
gripping the railing with both hands .
Rabidplaybunny87 : With labored breath , he leaned against the door frame , gazing into
the kitchen .
Were it not for death 's agony , he would have thought
himself already in heaven .
There , spread out upon newspapers on
the kitchen table , were literally hundreds of his favorite chocolate
chip cookies .
Rabidplaybunny87 : Was it heaven ?
Or was it one final act of heroic love from his devoted
wife , seeing to it that he left this world a happy man ?
Mustering one
great final effort , he moved himself toward the table .
His parched lips
parted ; the wondrous taste of the cookie was almost already in his mouth ;
seemingly bringing him back to life .
Rabidplaybunny87 :
The aged and withered hand , shakily made its way to a cookie at
the edge of the table , when it was suddenly smacked with a spatula
by his wife .
Rabidplaybunny87 : " Stay out of those , " she said , " they 're for the funeral . "
A Michigan man required hospital treatment when a rocket sled stunt went explosively wrong , ClickOnDetroit reports .

Witnesses explained that the drunken rocket man " strapped the device on his back , donned a makeshift helmet and got on a sled , asking someone to light a wick attached to the device " .
Unfortunately , the DIY rocket exploded part of the way down the hill , causing second - degree burns to the victim 's face and damaging one of his eyes .

This rambling , confusing pile of maps is the first significant cartographic revelation on the show .
Rousseau 's documents are muddled and all in French , peppered with song lyrics and weird references .
Her maps are notable for including smaller islands , one of which is presumably the Hydra island from much later in the series .
Also interesting about Rousseau 's map is the central area she has labeled " the most dangerous place ( the strange phenomena ) . "
It 's presumably the area where the temple is located , and where the smoke monster is most active .

This is the map that first opened up the world of Lost cartography to fans , and to me .
Within hours of the final moments of the season 2 premiere , a preliminary version of this map appeared online .
And it only improved as we saw more of this station .
It 's also very accurate , since it describes a specific set , instead of something as amorphous and large as the Island as represented by what we see on screen .
The Blast Door Map

Which brings us to the second important map on the show , and probably the most iconic : the eerie , fluorescent map hidden on the back of the blast doors inside of the Swan station .
The map was hand - made by Radzinsky before his untimely end and continued by Kelvin after it .
It shows a few important features on the Island , but its scale and accuracy is dubious at best .
More important , it reaches beyond the Swan hatch and shows us the hidden underbelly of the Island itself .
The fascinating details that the blast door map actually does provide are all hidden within rambling , multilingual notations .
There are references to " Cerberus vents , " presumably related to the smokey guardian we know and love .
And there are also numerous references to the Hanso group , the hostiles , and tons of math and science .
It 's as jumbled as , and more dense than , Rousseau 's maps .
It 's a masterwork of map - making .
A lot more details , including different versions and translations , available once again at Lostpedia .

Lost Island Map

Another of the trailblazing maps in the Lost cartography world , this project started back in 2006 .
It 's not been formally updated in quite some time , but the overview , tree - covered version of the Island shows where we might see some of the diverse geographic features we keep seeing on the show .
And an annotated version is available at the map 's home base , with carefully considered explanations for the locations represented .

This is apparently the most up - to - date of the comprehensive fan maps , including details from the most recent season .
It 's also notable for including some really keen observations about time - line on the Island .
For instance , there seems to be a relatively recent crater from a volcanic eruption that was unrepresented in Rousseau 's map .
Head over to the map 's site to check out the hard work the creator has done to place pretty much all of the events from the show 's history on his map .
The Lost Subway Map

The most recent Lost fan map to emerge is this subway - style take on the Island .
The creator wrote extensively about his process and how he arrived at the final design , and it's a really great read .
It 's a look into the huge undertaking every Lost map actually is , as well as a glimpse at the torture of trying to build a map of a place that is n't even real .
The show has offered contradictory information about some locations , so it 's no surprise that every map is different , sometimes hugely so .
And More !
These are n't all of the maps fans have made .
They are merely the most comprehensive and most interesting of the cartographic undertakings associated with Lost .
There is an entire Lostpedia article dedicated only to fan maps ( which was invaluable in creating this post ) , as well as articles about every map we 've ever seen on the show .
And there 's always Lost Risk and the crazy island poster as well .

Thanks to these maps , even after we 've found our way through the show 's final episodes , we 'll still be able to virtually wander our beloved Island for years to come !
A year ago , China Daily gushed with upbeat epithets about the co-operation between the US and China .
The relationship was already effective and smooth on trade , Taiwan and global warning .
With two firm multilateralists , Barack Obama and Joe Biden , now in power , it would be positively strengthened and constructive , the official mouthpiece opined .
How different the picture looks today – and how wounded the official tone .
China sent a deputy foreign minister to negotiate with Mr Obama in Copenhagen , scuppering the deal that not just the US but many other countries wanted .
Next came the cyber-attacks on Google .
Then the White House approved a decision to sell patriot missiles to Taiwan , announced that Mr Obama would meet the Dalai Lama and lectured China on its overvalued currency .
Forget the metaphor of resetting relations , which the US used recently with Russia .
Hardly a month goes by when the US and China can resist pushing each other 's buttons .
Is China 's assertiveness and Mr Obama 's hardened attitude all down to economics – to the former 's impressive performance during the global recession and the latter 's much weaker one ?
Economists reckon the Chinese currency , which has remained at the same value since July 2008 , is undervalued by 25 % to 40 % .
Even on the lower figure , the effect of a correction on the currencies of neighbours like Malaysia , ­Singapore , and Taiwan would be major and would collectively help cut the US deficit by $ 100bn and create 700,000 jobs .
­Reopening the battle with China over its currency is not a bad move , therefore , as Mr Obama faces difficult midterm elections in November .
Both the US and China are trying to power their way forward with export booms and each requires a low valuation of its currency to do that .
But politics matter too .
China 's foreign policy has become more assertive as nationalism becomes dominant .
For all the lip service to multilateralism , China is more hostile to sanctions on Iran than Russia .
A nationalist China is , however , more tied into the global economy than ever before .
Two - thirds of China 's $ 2.4 trillion currency reserves are held in dollars .
If it dumped the US treasury bonds and shares in which these dollars are invested , China could trigger a collapse of the dollar , and world markets , and another global recession .
To whom would China be able to export then ?
Certainly not to the US or the EU .
China 's key economic interest lies in continuing to fund US debt .
So there are limits to the current US - China jousting .
Each is repainting its red lines and stepping over the other's .
But at some point national interest says this must stop .
Neither of the tetchy twins can do without the other .
Neat idea .
And predictable , yet still fascinating results .
[ O ] n this chilly morning , as bus No. 92 rolls down a mountain highway just before dawn , high school students are quiet , typing on laptops .
Morning routines have been like this since the fall , when school officials mounted a mobile Internet router to bus No. 92 ’s sheet - metal frame , enabling students to surf the Web .
The students call it the Internet Bus , and what began as a high - tech experiment has had an old - fashioned — and unexpected — result .
Wi - Fi access has transformed what was often a boisterous bus ride into a rolling study hall , and behavioral problems have virtually disappeared .
“ It ’s made a big difference , ” said J. J. Johnson , the bus ’s driver .
“ Boys are n’t hitting each other , girls are busy , and there ’s not so much jumping around . ”
I do n’t know about you , but I can use all the help I can get cooking around the holidays .
If you ’re making a lot of the traditional dishes from scratch , every burner on your stove will be in use and you have a timetable for what goes in the oven when .

Here 's something that definitely wo n't require any sort of apology from John Mayer .
The embattled singer , who 's had a couple of self - created rough weeks lately , put a much less controversial side of himself on display during his concert in Philadelphia Sunday night .
While performing , John took notice of 11 - year - old Austin Christy holding up a sign that read " Can I play ' Belief ' with you ? " reports CourierPostOnline.com .
He graciously invited the sixth - grader up on stage , where the two jammed together for the crowd of roughly 25,000 fans , including Austin 's mom .
As if that were n't enough , John even gave the kid an autographed guitar as a parting gift .
Cleveland City Council unanimously voted on Nov. 30 , to approve a proposal protecting discrimination based on gender identity and expression in employment , housing and public accommodations .
According to Equality Ohio , other municipalities also voted on similar measures that day .
Akron , Ohio , now includes sexual orientation and gender identity for employment , housing and public accommodations , in a vote of 1o - 2 . Summit County , Ohio , passed an almost identical ordinance , voting 11 - 1 .
Ah , the lovely shelter offered by the passive voice .
There 's the classic , " Mistakes were made . "
( By whom ? )
You can never go wrong with , " It has been determined that workforce reductions are necessary . "
( Who determined ? )
And then , in the case of sports rumors , there is always the Brooks - ian " It is believed . "
As in :
It is believed that while the club would quarantine NHL emerging talents John Tavares and Josh Bailey , Snow would be willing to part with this year 's first - rounder in addition to presenting a " One from Column A / One from Column B menu ... "
To be fair , the only bit Larry Brooks has sourced ( albeit anonymously ) is that Garth Snow has " checked in " with the Thrashers about Ilya Kovalchuk , " leaving the message with Atlanta GM Don Waddell that the team intends to be in the mix . "
Which is to say : Garth
Snow is doing his job , quiet as ever .
If someone is shedding a distresed asset , you 're supposed to check on the market rate in case you can get a bargain .
But as I wrote earlier this week when we took Birdwatchers Anonymous ' RFP and had our fun :
The Islanders will not and cannot make a trade for Ilya Kovalchuk .
It 's simply not happening , and it probably should n't under any conditions conforming to the laws of physics ...
I was n't going to touch this again , with the exception of sending The Falconer at BWA a very watered down , no - chance offer based on our discussion .
But since Brooks gave it a bird leg to hobble on , we can go into the pros and cons before faxing a " Here lies David St. Hubbons ... and why - not ? " proposal :
Pro :
If the Islanders remained in the playoff picture , they'd be adding a scorer who instantly becomes the best forward on the team , and the best shooter in the league .
Also : Immediate powerplay upgrade .
Which is nice .
Con : Kovalchuk will not sign here .
He wo n't .
He wo n't pass up the comfort and connections built in Atlanta over so many years and enter unrestricted free agency only to " settle " for the Islanders , a franchise whose future is -- let 's face it -- in many ways no more clear than the Thrashers .
If he wants long - term security , he 'll take it in Atlanta if they can guarantee it .
If he wants long - term security and a franchise guaranteed to be as stable in 2020 as it is in 2010 ... he 's not signing with the Isles .
Pro :
He 'd be exciting , he 'd sell some jerseys , he might -- might -- even have a bigger on - ice impact than the Spring of Ryan Smyth .
Like maybe playoffs and winning two playoff games instead of one .
Con :
But then it would be over , he 'd sign with someone else ( or the KHL ? ) , and we'd be right back where ... wait , what was it the Isles are trying to build here again ?
When you look at the 29 other teams in the league , you quickly see that there are n't a lot of realistic bidders for Kovalchuk , at least not for the price a player of his caliber should fetch .
Which can lead you to think that maybe Waddell will have to accept a paltry return ... which can lead you to dream maybe
Snow can play ball here .
But all you need is two bidders and you 've got an auction .
An auction the Isles have no business being in , one they definitely should n't offer enough to win -- simply because the chances of it paying off in the long run ( i.e. Kovi sticking around past April ) are so incredibly remote .
However , for the sake of argument , we ( okay I -- no one suggested this exact offer ) will offer the folks at BWA the most that it makes sense to offer for 25 games of a UFA rental superstar who will not sign here and will not be part of the rebuild .
We 'll call it " the Smyth / Hossa Memorial Leftovers Platter " :
Sean Bergenheim
Jeff Tambellini
Aaron Ness
choice of some long - shot prospect whose inclusion makes Waddell 's bosses think he got another body
2011 1st - round pick ( conditional upon Kovalchuk re-signing with the Islanders , which he won't ) .
It 's unrealistic , cheap and ridiculous -- but so is the thought that Snow should pay market price to rent a UFA when this rebuild ( do n't say " rebuild ! " ) has only just begun .
It gives Atlanta a guy who can score some goals in the NHL now , a tenacious forechecker and penalty killer , an offensive blueline prospect , a throwaway prospect ( do Waddell 's bosses even pay attention ? ) and a pick ( the only part that can be conditional , unless you 're going to slap " future considerations " on the deal ) .
It 's not what Waddell wants .
But if I were boss of the Isles , I would n't go anywhere near what Waddell wants just to bail him out of his mess , while creating a mess of my own .
Matt “ Hoss_TBF ” Hawrilenko is known as one of the most skilled limit hold ’em players in the world .
Despite rarely traveling to tournaments other than the World Series of Poker , he ’s accrued more than $ 1.6 million in tournament winnings and won his first bracelet this summer in the $ 5,000 short - handed no - limit hold ’em event .
Hawrilenko spends most of his time playing high - stakes cash games online , and he caught up with Card Player to breaks down a limit hold ’em hand he recently played .
The Game :
Stakes : $ 500 - $ 1,000
Game : Limit hold ’em
Table : Mixed Game Heads up
The Lineup :
Seat 1 : Matt Hawrilenko ( $ 25,224.50 ) —
Big blind $ 500
Seat 2 : Villain ( $ 15,749 ) — Small blind $ 250
Review of the Hand
Preflop Action : Villain raises to $ 1,000 , and Matt Hawrilenko calls with 7 4 .
The pot is now $ 2,000 .
Matt Hawrilenko :
The first thing to note is this is a mixed - game table , which means my opponent might not be as familiar with heads - up limit hold ’em as a specialist , so I ’m on the lookout for situations where I think he ’s vulnerable to have imbalances in his distribution .
This particular circumstance is a common one , actually , for both the small blind and the big blind , which is why I think the hand is particularly interesting .
Flop Action :
The flop is 6 5 5 .
Hawrilenko checks and Villain bets $ 500 .
Hawrilenko raises to $ 1,000 , and Villain calls $ 500 .
The pot is now $ 4,000 .
MH : A flop like this presents players in my spot with the opportunity to make a lot of mistakes , because when they ’ve just called preflop and a pair flops , they are less likely to have a pair , so the value - check - raises should get a bit thinner , and the hand gets more interesting to play .
This is because most big blinds would have three - bet preflop with any pocket pair and lots of ace - highs , so when a pair flops , there are fewer hands they can have that have made a pair , whereas , on a 6 - 5 - 5 flop , there are a lot of straight draws , backdoor - straight and flush draws with overcard combinations , etc. , so if you ’re not careful , your distribution could start to weight too heavily toward draws .
Anyhow , in this particular hand , I flopped the open - ender and elected to check - raise my draw ; pretty standard .
Turn Action :
The turn is the 2 .
The board now reads 6 5 5 2 . Hawrilenko bets $ 1,000 , and Villain calls .
The pot is now $ 6,000 .
MH :
The turn brings a second spade , and a third card to a straight , which means a lot of opponents will be calling frequently with an overcard plus gutshot type hands ( hands like J - 4 , Q - 4 ) .
River Action :
The river is the J .
The board now reads 6 5 5 2 J . Hawrilenko bets $ 1,000 , and Villain raises to $ 2,000 .
Hawrilenko reraises to $ 3,000 , and Villain folds .
Hawrilenko wins the pot of $ 9,999.50 ( after rake ) .
MH :
On the river , I ’m at the very bottom of my distribution , so I bluff — pretty standard again — and my opponent raises .
For most opponents , the worst hand they ’ll raise for value in this spot is jacks , so the options are :
1 ) He could be value - raising a jack , probably either J - 4 or Q - J plus .
2 ) He could be slow - playing a 5 .
3 ) He could have a busted straight draw , busted flush draw , overcards that he convinced himself to call with on the turn , so he could bluff the river .
In scenario 1 , if I three - bet bluff , I should get called , but there are actually some players who are big into hand - reading and could n’t imagine me three - betting anything but a 5 here and could lay this type of hand down .
In general , this is unlikely enough that I wont even bother assessing a probability and adding it to my value calculations .
Really , the cackle of fiendish glee I get in the rare instances that an opponent folds and shows , or posts it later to a strategy forum is more than enough for me .
Scenario 2 is unlikely .
People with trips tend ( rightly ) to want to give you the opportunity to blow up with hands like 8 - 7 on the turn and go four bets , so they ’ll usually raise the turn with trips .
They also want to make sure they do n’t give you the opportunity to give up on any semi-bluffs on the river having not paid the maximum .
Given this , my opponents distribution is polarized between scenarios 1 and 3 and with the pot size , game theoretically , about 90 percent of his raises should be for value and 10 percent should be bluffs .
This means that if I ’m playing near - optimally , and his ratio is off , he ’s giving up money to me in the long run .
That said , in this particular situation , I ’m often going to veer away from optimal play to try to exploit him .
Even giving him a modestly more value - rich raising distribution than I ’d suspect he actually has , he probably only holds 50 or 60 value - raising combinations , and in this spot , I think he ’s bluffing with way more than five or six combinations of busted draws .
To exploit him , the non-value hands that I should be reraising are those that stand to gain the most EV [ expected value ] by bluffing , the hands at the bottom of my distribution , which are 7 - 3 , 7 - 4 , and 8 - 4 .
There ’s also a metagame consideration here .
Since it ’s a mixed - game table and my opponent may still be a little uncomfortable with heads up limit hold ’em , if I end up getting caught with a three - bet bluff on the river , it could have some good effects .
My opponent might start to value - raise turns and rivers much more lightly than he should on differently textured boards , much like the no-limit player who sees you three - bet light and misuse that information by overplaying his hand against your five - bet .
The fact is , just as five - betting an under - the - gun raiser in no-limit is a totally different situation than three - betting the button , a three - bet bluff on a specific river texture in limit hold ’em is an entirely different animal than a three - or four - bet on the turn , but people still often let information from one situation get them in a heap of trouble in other situations .

So now there 's going to be a bipartisan health care summit , eh? Woo -hoo .
Is that sorta like the jobs summit we just had , one full year into the reign of Obama , despite that all twelve of those months has been riddled with severe economic cancer ?
And has n't that summit just really produced a raft of good solutions to the unemployment crisis ?
Is the health care summit gonna be kinda like the stimulus bill , a full third of which was a sop to Republican tax - cutting religious dogma , which effort bought all of a single GOP vote in Congress ?
Does it bear any resemblance to the health care negotiations which have been going on for nearly a year now , that also involved protracted efforts to accommodate Republican interests , and that succeeding in reducing the level of GOP support from the prior vote on the stimulus bill down by a full one hundred percent ?
Or are we talking here about any of a whole slew of " Democratic " policies , from the Middle East to Afghanistan to civil liberties to military spending , in which the Obama administration never had to negotiate at all with Republicans , because they were already running the same policies as George W. Bush ?
And nevertheless still got slammed for it ?
I really have to confess that I do n't know why Barack Obama ever wanted the presidency .
He had a boatload of fame and fortune in his hands already , though admittedly it 's a whole other league to be in as a part of the exclusive club of US presidents .
On the other hand , you run some serious risks as president that really call into question whether it 's worth it , from a cost - benefit perspective .
Especially since you can only spend so much money in a lifetime , and Obama had already made tens of millions from his books , and had huge potential to keep on making more from lectures , lobbying and more books , without ever sitting in the White House .
Lincoln and Kennedy remind us of the most prominent of these risks .
But combine the always present possibility of presidential assassination with the fact that we have the first black president of a country still loaded with angry , armed racists , and you have a serious concern there .
Additionally , America is just absolutely in a bad mood these days .
We 're like a toddler having a temper tantrum , oscillating between wanting this or that , usually wanting both at the same time , and regularly throwing a shit - fit if we do n't get just exactly what we want when we want it .
If it were possible for an entire country to need its diapers changed , that 's just about where we are nowadays .
Put it all together and you get a recipe for disaster for a black president whose middle name is Hussein .
Especially one who allows himself to be labeled a socialist .
Maybe Michael Steele or Clarence Thomas could pull this off without agitating the survivalist crowd into taking a pop at him , but Obama 's got a whole army of nuts out there waiting to take him out .
Many of them are in these tea party fringe fanatic groups .
Hell , many of them are in the GOP .
Moreover , that 's not the only risk he took in running for the presidency .
You can also get elected and then fail miserably .
Is it really worth it to enter the pantheon of American politics , but in a titular sense only ?
Would n't it be better to lay low and get rich than to be a laughingstock failure who also happened to have once had an oval - shaped office ?
Would n't most people rather be Jeb Bush than George W.?
This is why I wonder why this guy ever sought the presidency .
Doing so clearly came with some serious risks , and not necessarily massive benefits relative to where he was already sitting .
Of course , if you were going to do something with the office , that would be something else entirely .
That would be worth taking big risks for .
I think most people want to be successful in life , and most people who are either self - confident ( or radically insecure ) enough to seek the American presidency would absolutely also like the legacy of being one of the great ones .
Obama just does n't seem to have that jones , though .
He 's the perfunctory president .
He seems to want to have a health care bill , any health care bill , so he can say he 's done that .
He seems to want to have a climate agreement , however eviscerated , just so he can tick off that box .
And he seems to want to be president just to be president .
Of course , the Democratic Party has become nearly as captive of corporate and Wall Street interests as the Republicans have , which may be a better explanation for the inaction of Congress and the president .
But the capacity to sustain that facade is now rapidly melting .
Perhaps Democrats even realize this .
The core ( sometimes theoretical ) principle at the root of representative democracy is the quid pro quo that is supposed to govern the relationship between the representative and the represented .
The member of parliament gets to serve in high office , provided that MP reflects the political sentiments of his or her constituents .
The problem with American politics today , of course , is that the real constituents of members of Congress are not the voters in their districts and states , but rather the special interests who fund their campaigns to fool the voters in their districts and states .
You do n't need to see Bulworth again to figure that one out .
And the problem for Democrats is that the country is now reaching the limits of viability for that game .
Voters can be fooled or lulled into political narcolepsy for a long time , provided conditions are relatively benign .
One reason , frankly , that voter turnout has been so low over the last half - century is that people have been basically satisfied with conditions in their lives , notwithstanding the usual grumbling about welfare queens or foreign aid or uppity blacks .
This also explains why we rarely see people marching in the streets in any serious way , and why we do n't see the rise of alternative political parties of any serious scale .
By and large , people have been pretty complacent about politics because their life conditions have been pretty decent , whether they know it or not .
All that is changing now .
Actually , it 's been changing for thirty years , but now it 's really crashing down hard .
During the middle part of the twentieth century a literal new deal was struck in American society , in which for the first time the masses would get a moderate share of the pie and the fantastically wealthy would be reduced in economic stature to being merely hugely wealthy .
But , after a while , the greediest amongst us decided they'd had enough of that tough bargain and , circa 1980 or so , the empire struck back .
The American plutocracy hired Ronald Reagan and his party to undo the provisions of trade , labor , tax and welfare state laws that propped up the newly created middle class , and the ground underneath most Americans ' feet has been eroding ever since .
It was actually much worse than what people thought all along , because much of the pain for the middle class was eased by sending wives to work earning a second income , and stealing from their children via budget deficits .
Now comes the triple whammy of the apocalypse , as the products from these policies come home to roost in a serious way .
First , deregulating everything in sight so that the rapist class could have its unfettered way with all of us has produced the inevitable reckoning with reality now screening in your neighborhood as " The Great Recession " .
Second , the unsustainable pattern of profligate borrowing has become - go figure - unsustainable , and we are now seeing the beginning of serious movements toward reeling back spending on popular government programs , just when they are needed most .
And third , the structural changes that have been promulgated over the last three decades leave most Americans poorly positioned to even hope for a path to economic recovery .
Roughly speaking then , the middle class have been tossed out of the plane , their primary parachute was defectively fabricated by a deregulated corporation trying to save money on production , and their emergency chute was stolen out of the pack and sold on the black market called Wall Street .
The problem for people like Obama or Pelosi or Reid or just about any Democrat in Congress today is that people increasingly know this .
They are feeling it acutely .
The decades of complacency have been replaced by the new era of fear and anxiety .
Thus we 're now seeing signs of a reanimated political sphere .
Turnout is up , anti-incumbency is way up , and street rallies and alternative political movements are increasingly challenging the pathetically limited options of the status quo .
We 've entered an epoch of political oscillation - mood swings would perhaps be the better description - in which the two dominant political parties do fantastically well in opposition , but horribly in government .
That 's because , in reality , neither of them is offering any actual solutions to the problems the shrinking American middle class is grappling with every day .
Republicans distract with an endless procession of bogeymen at home and abroad , and with tax cuts that only exacerbate the problem further .
Democrats , on the other hand , uh ...
Democrats , er ...
Well , I do n't know what Democrats actually do .
They just kinda sit there taking potshots .
Both parties do great in opposition because it 's so easy to show how useless the government is , especially if hypocrisy is not necessarily a problem for how you practice politics ( and for the GOP it is not only not a problem , it has become a high art form ) .
But it turns out that actually governing after you win in opposition is problematic if you do n't have any real solutions to offer .
Republicans have been hammered twice in the last two election cycles , once to kick them out of Congress and then again to kick them out of the White House .
Democrats will have precisely the same experience in 2010 and 2012 , and for precisely the same reasons .
And yet the public will be no more satisfied with the outcome than they are now , and likely less so .
It 's ludicrous to imagine that the party of Bush and Cheney - which has only gotten worse in their absence - will actually solve any national problems .
Meanwhile , time is running out for Washington to actually produce solutions .
Or at least to be seen as serious about producing solutions .
People understand that this is not necessarily easily done .
Franklin Roosevelt got elected president four times without ever genuinely slaying the Great Depression .
But people believed that he was trying , and they knew that the party of Hoover would do nothing .
Obama , on the other hand , has done just the opposite of FDR .
He has entirely blown the good will which attended his inauguration one year ago , such that even if he were to be serious about dealing with jobs now , it 's not clear that he would be trusted enough to be taken seriously , and it's not clear that he could even reap the political benefit from any success he might actually produce .
This was the stupidest imaginable of strategic decisions by this White House .
If they thought they could simply continue to win by being not Republicans , they were wrong even in the short term .
( Very short term , as it turns out .
They got clobbered right away in Virginia and New Jersey , and now also in Massachusetts . )
If they thought they could n't do anything legit to solve problems because they have to placate their real masters on Wall Street , they were wrong in the longer term .
Americans are unlikely to continue to countenance such treason from their government anymore , as they lose their jobs , houses , medical care and dignity .
Look , let 's be honest , American government was designed by its creators to fail , if by success one means the ability to govern in any real sense and the ability to be responsive to the preferences of voters .
It 's a pretty ingenious system really , at least for those who have a congenital fear of government , that particularly American paranoia .
The system basically requires so much consensus ( which is another way of saying that so many actors can block it from moving forward ) , that only on occasions like the day after Pearl Harbor can it move expeditiously at articulating and legislating national policy .
Otherwise , it requires a powerful figure who can light enough of a fire under the recalcitrant co-decisionmakers in the system for anything substantial to happen .
And that more or less can only be the president .
In the long nineteenth century of American government , that mostly just did n't happen , in large part because the prevailing view of the role of government was so limited .
Today , however , it is more or less expected .
It more or less defines whether a presidency is successful or not .
Roosevelt and Johnson and Reagan and Wee Bush got what they wanted , and thus had largely successful presidencies , as measured by that yardstick .
Of course , in some of those cases what they wanted were really disastrous things , and so those presidencies turned out to be not so successful in the larger sense , by virtue , ironically , of their successes in the narrow sense .
In any case , for folks like Bill Clinton or Big Daddy Bush or Barack Obama it 's all moot anyhow .
They do n't aspire to much of anything serious , and they therefore , of course , do n't get anywhere near achieving it .
This model for governmental failure created by the Founders has now become even more unruly , at least when Republicans are in the opposition .
They have decided to use the filibuster and nomination holds in the Senate to block literally everything the Democrats want to do , including even staffing up the president 's administration .
Democrats , of course , are just the opposite .
Even when they are in the minority by only the barest amount , they still allow the Republicans to do whatever they want , using whatever legislative bullying technique they choose .
Essentially what we have today is a situation in which Republicans make life for the vast majority of Americans worse when they are in government , and Democrats do nothing whatsoever when they are given control .
Nothing , that is , unless you count destroying the reputation of progressive politics while ironically not actually being progressive at all .
America is increasingly in need of some serious Constitutional shake - ups , and a parliamentary system of responsible government to replace the existing do - nothing model is perhaps at the top of the list .
That alternative surely at least has clarity going for it , hence the term ‘ responsible ' .
You know who governs at any given time , and you get to throw the bums out of office if they do n't do it the way you want them to .
It 's a higher gamble affair , though .
It essentially puts all the eggs in one basket , at least for the short term .
If we had had such a system in 2005 , for example , Social Security would have been effectively destroyed .
On the other hand , when people saw in 2008 what Wall Street did to the Social Security accounts they had been building over a lifetime , Republicans would have banished from the halls of government for eighty years .
The system is truly broken , but the truth is that all systems are broken , and all systems are also not broken .
It 's in the nature of people to switch systems , and to want to switch systems , as a cheap potential solution to their problems .
But , in reality , institutions and constitutions do n't make nearly as much difference in the quality of governance as does the character and commitments of the people at the helm , and that of those who choose them .
Good people with good intentions and a good helping of guts will produce good results , even when faced with daunting obstacles built into the system of governance .
Rip - off artists , on the other hand , will not be deterred by mere checks and balances .
And those who seek to do nothing while the country burns will be able to under any constitutional order , at least for the short - term .
Major aspects of the current crisis in American politics are deeply fundamental in nature , in the sense that a cavalier and self - interested ( often at best ) public has allowed the gravest crimes to be committed in its name , as long as it could still sit on the sofa unmolested , slurping beer , scarfing Tater Tots , and watching yet another episode of American Idol .
We truly do have the government we deserve .
And yet , to some extent , it ‘ twas ever thus , and still we 've managed to do better at times .
Moreover , it 's hard not to conclude that there has been a concerted effort to dumb down the American public on matters of politics and even their own welfare these last few decades .
And why not , eh ?
There was a helluva lot of money to be made .
But while the breakdown of the country 's political system has been near complete - ranging from government to opposition party to the media to the public - those who ask for our votes by promising serious change , and who invoke the rhetoric of Martin Luther King and the centuries - long tribulations of the enslaved in order to get elected , have a special responsibility to fulfill their commitment .
It requires a particular and spectacular brand of treasonous contempt to piss away the beliefs of an entire nation in one 's promise and one 's integrity , not to mention trashing the legions of people who carried you across the finish line for exactly that reason .
Even worse , to mangle the governance of a country at a time of crisis - knowing full well what sort of creatures to whom that throws open the doors of the government in the wake of your failure - is an egregious crime of historical proportions .
How many Weimar Republics or Neville Chamberlains do we need before we figure that one out ?
Obama 's weakness will make Sarah Palin president .
Some folks argue that change never comes from the top and it's a fool 's errand to expect Barack Obama or Harry Reid or Nancy Pelosi or any other leaders of American government to ever just do the right thing for the right reasons .
Maybe that 's all true , and I certainly rue the fact that the only people out on the streets these days are the know - nothings of the right .
There is a ton of work to be done right now building a progressive movement with the capacity to pressure the country 's national leaders into doing the right thing for the country .
But those leaders are part of the problem , too .
And it's also the case that some of the great transformative figures of this country or others - Franklin Roosevelt , Mikhail Gorbachev , Deng Xiaoping - were so much more than history forced them to be .
To me , that means both that we should continue to expect a serious contribution from those entrusted with governing the country , beyond what the street forces them to do , and that history vindicates such expectations as being legitimate .
In other words , we know from the historical record that it can happen that leaders actually lead , beyond where we folks down below push them to go .
It is , therefore , not unreasonable to expect that of the current crop , notwithstanding the crucial role also to be played by the public , the media , social movements , etc .
Few leaders in American history have been as blessed with the ironic opportunity of crisis as has been Barack Obama .
This last year could have been written into the history books with an entirely different script , and one which would have massively benefitted the country , the Democratic Party and Barack Obama .
Yet , because he is so very much not a man of his time , just the opposite occurred .
Clinton got away with being a nothingburger during fat times .
Obama is foolishly trying it during a moment of multiple simultaneous national and international crises , and he is failing miserably .
As he should be , with such a shamefully tepid agenda .
Barack Obama and his congressional co-conspirators in cowardice will soon be toast , the victims - both directly through their own inadequacies and indirectly through their unwillingness to counter attacks upon them by the most destructive elements of American politics - of their own failings of character .
But because of those failings , and because at the moment the bottom was falling out they would neither lead , follow nor get out of the way , they are not the only folks right now staring down the business end of the shotgun that is the future of America .
We are , too .
Indeed , far more than they .
Apple is projected to sell 36 million iPhones worldwide in 2010 , but Piper Jaffray concedes that total is likely conservative for international sales , and does n't include the possibility of expansion to other carriers in the U.S .
If Apple does sell 36 million iPhones in 2010 , it would be a 40 percent increase from 2009 estimates .
In a note to investors Wednesday morning , Gene Munster , senior research analyst with Piper Jaffray , noted that 2010 will mark the first full year of sales with two new carriers in France , Canada and the U.K. , and it will also include a full year of sales in China .
Sales will be driven by a new iPhone model expected to arrive mid-year .
" We estimated unit figures for the U.S. , U.K. , France and Germany , then divided the remaining units proportionally by sub count among the remaining carriers , " Munster said of his estimates .
" The results show that our international iPhone estimates may be a point of conservatism in our model .
" For example , we are modeling for three Russian carriers to sell 1.8 M units into a collective sub base of 160 M in ( calendar year ) 2010 vs. AT&T which we estimate will sell 15.8 M units to its sub base of 82.5M . "
Munster 's U.S. estimates do n't include projections for a possible Verizon expansion .
Currently , AT&T is the exclusive carrier of the iPhone in the U.S. Munster has previously predicted that the Verizon network will be the " next big feature " for the iPhone .
This week , another report speculated that Apple and Verizon are at odds over the pricing of a CDMA iPhone .
Recent reports have suggested that a Verizon - capable iPhone could arrive this year .
" We continue to believe that it is highly likely that Verizon will launch the iPhone by the end of 2010 , " Munster said .
" However , Verizon is not in our model and may be a source of significant upside for iPhone units in 2010 and beyond . "

Advertisement Dramatic footage has emerged of a lorry apparently pushing a car sideways along a motorway in Yorkshire .
The footage , which was posted on YouTube , shows the truck travelling along the A1 ( M ) near Wetherby with the Clio trapped in front .
The scene was filmed on a mobile phone by another motorist .
West Yorkshire Police confirmed it had attended the scene .
The lorry owner , Cheshire - based Arclid Transport , said it was investigating the incident .
At one point in the footage someone can be heard shouting : " He has n't seen it . "
A spokesman from Arclid Transport said : " There was an incident between a car and one of our vehicles in January .
In light of the new evidence that has come to light we are reinvestigating the collision
West Yorkshire Police spokesman " Since seeing the footage from YouTube we are investigating . "
He added that he believed the female driver of the Clio had not been injured in the incident .
The company said the lorry driver was sent home on Wednesday , when the video emerged on the internet .
He added that the accident happened on 13 January and police had investigated , but to date no action had been taken against the lorry driver .
West Yorkshire Police said officers attended the scene after receiving reports of a collision .
A spokesman said : " At the time of our attendance there were no injuries and both vehicles were on the hard shoulder of the motorway .
" As a result , at the time , the incident was treated as a damage only collision .
" However , in light of the new evidence that has come to light we are reinvestigating the collision and the matter has today been passed to our major collision inquiry team and inquiries are ongoing . "

After more than six years of exploring the Red Planet , the Mars rover Spirit will rove no more .
The robotic adventurer is mired in a sand bed , and NASA has officially given up on trying to extricate it .
While it will continue to operate as a " stationary research platform " for the time being , there 's no denying that the rover 's swashbuckling days are over .
No longer will Spirit spot an interesting landmark in the distance and gamely trek towards it , with the possibility of a fresh scientific discovery around every corner and under every rock .
This photo gallery is a well - deserved eulogy for Spirit , in which we 'll survey its travels and achievements .
In 2003 , NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory launched Spirit and its twin rover , Opportunity , on a three - month mission to investigate Martian terrain and atmosphere on opposite sides of the planet .
The solar - powered rovers surpassed NASA 's wildest dreams , extending their missions by nearly 25 times their anticipated lengths .
Since landing on Mars in January 2004 , Spirit has snapped more than 127,000 pictures .
The robot probed beneath the worn surface of Mars , analyzing the microstructure of rocks and soil with a sophisticated array of instruments : spectrometers , microscopic imagers , and other tools .
Spirit has also gathered strong evidence that water once flowed on the Martian surface , which could have created a hospitable environment for microbial life .
Spirit and its twin rover ( which is still traveling on ) will be replaced by more advanced machines that will roll onto the Martian soil in the coming decades .
But Spirit will be remembered long after its operating system flickers off for good .
Like a robotic Neil Armstrong , the rover has earned its place in the space explorers ' hall of heroes .

After a 302 - million - mile , 7 - month journey from Earth , Spirit reaches Mars .
Parachutes slow the landing craft as it falls through the atmosphere , and the 24 airbags that completely surround the craft cushion its landing .
Spirit successfully lands in a Connecticut - sized basin on Mars named Gusev Crater .
Scientists believe the crater was formed by a massive asteroid or comet collision long ago .
Spirit was given this landing site to investigate past and present environmental conditions there .
Later photos reveal that a long , deep valley once provided water to Gusev via a hole in the crater 's edge .
Once Spirit has safely set down , the airbags deflate and the landing craft opens up to allow the rover to wheel out on to the surface of the Red Planet .
In this image , captured by combining the camera 's green , blue and infrared filters , the rover looks back at the landing site before heading out to explore .
Spirit's twin , the Mars rover Opportunity , lands on the opposite side of the Red Planet on January 25 , 2004 .

Complete with a rock - identifying infrared sensor , Spirit is the first space - venturing robot to cut into stone , inspect the inside of a rock , and perform microscopic examinations of soil and rock on a planet other than Earth .
The rover uses its spectrometers and a rock abrasion tool to detect minerals and elements in rocks and soils .
Soil deposits are especially good markers of recent environmental conditions .
Planetary scientist Ray Arvidson , one of the rover researchers , describes the geology that Spirit investigates : " The caprock on the plains is volcanic basalt .
It has been broken up by impact cratering , and then wind - blown materials have accumulated into a mantle of soil . "
Spirit 's first target is Adirondack ( pictured ) , a football - sized rock that scientists deem a " time capsule , " since probing it has brought to light past geological conditions of the Martian surface .

Spirit snaps the first photograph of Earth ever taken from the surface of another planet .
This image is produced using an assortment of shots captured by Spirit 's panoramic and navigation cameras , including a wide view of the sky and four close - ups of Earth .
Technicians are able to magnify the contrast in the sky photograph in order to make the tiny dot of Earth appear visible in the picture .

Just over 2 miles into its mission , Spirit arrives at the Columbia Hills , a cluster of seven hills about 270 feet high .
Spirit examines slopes , rocks , and sand deposits in this spot for over a year to learn about the area 's geological history .
The rover 's spectrometers reveal that the rocks ' composition had been significantly transformed by water in ancient times .
Husband Hill 's peak is a wide plateau of rock outcrops and windblown drifts approximately 300 feet above than the neighboring plains of Gusev Crater .
While that hardly qualifies it as a towering peak , researchers still feel a sense of accomplishment when the rover slowly climbs the hill , and takes panoramic images from the summit in August 2005 .
Husband Hill was named after shuttle Columbia 's commander , Rick Husband .
The nearby McCool Hill and Ramon Hill commemorate other deceased astronauts of the space shuttle Columbia , which exploded while re-entering Earth 's atmosphere on February 1 , 2003 .

At the base of the Columbia Hills , Spirit discovers a softball - sized rock named Pot of Gold by researchers .
The oddly shaped rock has short stalk - like protrusions topped with knobby nodules .
Upon microscopic imaging , scientists conclude that the rock contains the mineral hematite , which is often formed in water ( although it can also be formed by volcanic processes ) .
While Spirit answers some questions about the mysterious rock , many more remain .
" This rock has a shape as if somebody took a potato and stuck toothpicks in it , then put jelly beans on the ends of the toothpicks , " says Steve Squyres , principal investigator for the rovers ' science instruments .
" How it got this crazy shape is anyone 's guess .
I have n't even heard a good theory yet . "

Mid-April 2005 Spirit tracks
Mars 's dusty winds hustling across a plain inside the Gusev Crater .
Clusters of images , which are captured every 20 seconds by the Spirit 's navigation camera , reveal the speed of the Martian dust devils , which scientists could only hypothesize about previously from static images .
" This is the best look we 've ever gotten of the wind effects on the Martian surface as they are happening , " says Mark Lemmon , a rover team member who studies Mars 's harried atmosphere .
The dust devils have also helped out the mission .
The winds have occasionally swept away the dust from Spirit 's solar panels , allowing the rover to draw more power from the sun and extending Spirit 's lifespan .

Using its panoramic camera mosaic , Spirit takes this breathtaking photograph of a Martian sunset , making us feel as if we ’re sky - gazing alongside the rover .
The strong scattering of sunlight by high - altitude dust in the atmosphere contributes to lengthy , two - hour twilight glows on Mars .
Scientists have used these images to examine the amount of dust and ice clouds in the Red Planet 's atmosphere , which will be the subject of a future Mars mission .
Similar extended twilights sometimes occur on Earth when dust particles spewed from erupting volcanoes spread light rays into the atmosphere .
In this photo , the sun is sinking just below the rim of Gusev Crater .
It appears about 2/ 3 the size of the sun as seen from Earth during sunset , since Mars is about 48 million miles farther away from the sun .

Spirit turns heads when its wheels churn up bright patches of Martian soil .
Upon examination , the soil is found to contain sulfate salts and a hint of water .
Similar salty , light - toned soil deposits are dispersed along the floors of the Columbia Hills region of the Gusev Crater .
Scientists say the minerals in these soils could indicate volcanic deposits from a wet period of the Red Planet 's ancient past .
" The soils have provided evidence in particular for the local action of hot water or steam , either from hydrothermal circulation or volcanic venting , " says Bruce Banerdt , a researcher with the rover project .
Researchers say that soils with high salt concentration often indicate the earlier presence of salty water , since the salt can become concentrated in the dirt as the water evaporates away .

Spring 2007 Back in 2005 , when Spirit gazed over the Martian landscape from the Husband Hill summit , the rover spotted a strange - looking portion of raised ground in the distance .
This , it was soon decided , would be its next destination : Home Plate , a low plateau that was probably formed by a long - ago volcanic explosion .
Spirit explores the 6 - foot –high plateau , which lies within the " inner basin " area of the Columbia Hills , in spring 2007 .
Spirit finds strong evidence of ancient volcanism when it comes across " bomb sags " ( pictured ) , where the neat layers of rock on the plateau 's lower slopes have been deformed .
Researchers think these sags are created when rocks ejected from exploding volcanoes fall back to the ground and hit soft sediment deposits , changing their shapes .
These and other findings were documented in a report published in the journal Science .

Spirit makes one of its best finds thanks to a faulty wheel .
The rover 's right front wheel stopped working in 2006 , causing Spirit to drive backwards dragging the busted wheel behind it .
That dragging motion leaves a deep track in the soil , and in March Spirit turns up dirt that has a high concentration of silica , considered " some of the best evidence " to date of the Red Planet 's watery past , according to Albert Yen , a NASA geochemist .
According to the Spirit 's very own C.V. , this discovery was its " biggest scientific achievement . "
The rover 's X - ray spectrometer finds that the soil is about 90 percent silica — the main ingredient in window glass .
The detected mineral , believed to have formed in hot springs or steam vents , suggests that the Red Planet once had warm water that could have harbored microbial life .
" You could hear people gasp in astonishment , " said Steve Squyres , principal investigator for the Mars rovers ' science instruments .
" This is a remarkable discovery . "

May 1 , 2009 Spirit is exploring
Troy , a site comprised of three or more layers of soil beneath a dark sand blanket , when trouble begins .
Troy is situated next to Home Plate , and the region is considered " one of the most interesting places Spirit has been " on Mars , according to Ray Arvidson , a scientist with the rover team .
But Spirit is having difficulties making progress through loose , fluffy soil , and on May 1 the team of rover 's drivers realize that Spirit is stuck .
With its wheels sunk halfway into the soft soil , Spirit sits and waits for orders .
It also conducts what experiments and observations it can from its stationary position .
Back on Earth , NASA engineers break out a replica rover and drive it into a sand box to allow them to test escape maneuvers .
But months of tryouts in the lab and driving attempts on Mars come to naught .

After more than six years of exploring the Martian landscape , NASA announces that the Spirit will no longer roam the hilly nooks and crannies of the Red Planet .
But the NASA team puts a upbeat spin on the news that the rover is now a stationary research platform : " Spirit is not dead , " says Doug McCuistion , director of the Mars Exploration Program .
" It has just entered another phase of its long life . "
Spirit can do a lot of science at its fixed position ( this panoramic image shows its final view ) .
NASA hopes that it will examine the sulfur - rich soil previously churned up by its wheels , and will study winds and the Martian atmosphere .
The rover can also inspect the planet 's rotational movement by precisely radio - tracking individual points on the planet 's surface ; tiny wobbles in the rotation may shed light on the composition of the Red Planet 's core .
" If the final scientific feather in Spirit 's cap is determining whether the core of Mars is liquid or solid , that would be wonderful , " says Spirit scientist Steve Squyres .
But before it can embark on any of those scientific projects , the rover has to make it through the dark , cold Martian winter .
The rover 's solar panels are not well positioned to catch the winter sunlight , so it will soon go into hibernation mode to conserve power .
If Spirit can survive the frigid temperatures , it will communicate with NASA as the Martian spring arrives , and should be able to resume scientific research next September .
Says Squyres : " The bottom line is , we 're not giving up on Spirit . "

There is NO SUCH THING as an incurable disease or undefeatable pathogenic organism ( or pathogenic ' entity ' such as prions ) , including every ' weapons grade ' bioengineered bug created by the satanic globalists and their minions .
Every substance in Nature and every organism in the universe possesses a resonant frequency ' signature ' .

Bear in mind that those of the Nazi mentality have historically and regularly employed a psychological tactic of intimidation in which they attempt to impress the public with an image of invincibility and unstoppable prowess .
If you 've seen the news reels from Nazi Germany of the 1930's , you know that Hitler used image promoters like Leni Rifenstahl , to project the notion that the Nazi ' storm ' troopers were impossible to resist .
The use of tactics and concepts like " Blitzkrieg " also was intended for psychological intimidation .
Remember Herr Rumsfeld 's ' shock and awe ' predictions prior to the Iraq invasion ?
It turned out to be much more hype than reality ( not that the murderous bombardment that did take place can be minimized for its Iraqi victims ) , but at the time , his statements projected an image of unstoppable and overwhelming power for those naive enough to believe him . .
Please remember that the current crop of American Nazis are just as defeatable - in every category of resistance - as their earlier incarnations of the 1930's .

The Case Of The Strange Cold Everybody Has Been Getting and Chemtrails - and the Black Arts Nation ....
Fall 2004
The Nazi Flu Interview With Dr. Leonard Horowitz
Redden : I 'd like to begin this interview by asking you about the flu .
Many of my friends are sick , and I 've read a number of news stories which say that people are sick around the world .
So many people are sick that hospital emergency rooms are swamped and doctors are postponing surgeries .
But at the same time , the mainstream media is not referring to this outbreak as an epidemic .
So let me ask you , is there a flu epidemic underway or not ?
Horowitz :
There has been for quite some time , but the authorities are suppressing the news about it .
It 's only been recently that the mainstream media has acknowledged that hospital emergency rooms are filled with patients with this bizarre upper respiratory infection that does n't quite seem to be a virus , a flu that the flu vaccines were ineffective against , that was a surprise and a complete mystery to the Centers for Disease Control authorities .
That 's all hogwash , bogus nonsense .
The fact of the matter is , we have seen this type of an epidemic since the end of 1998 and the beginning of 1999 .
People have been hacking and coughing with this bizarre illness that does not seem to follow any logical viral or bacterial onset and transition period .
It was something that did not cause a high fever .
If it was a bacterial or viral infection , it would have caused a fever in these people .
It did n't .
It was something that lasted weeks , if not months .
They had sinus congestion , sinus drainage , they had a cough , they had fatigue , general malaise , they felt they were not quite right .
Redden :
Then is it fair to call this the flu , or is it something else ?
Horowitz : I think it 's only fair to call it flu - like .
It is pathognomonic of , not a bacterial or viral infection , it is pathognomonic of a fungus or a fungus related to a flu .
And that 's exactly what has been developed and patented by the Armed Forces Research Institute of Pathology .
We 've reprinted the patent report in the new book , Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse .
We show you the report on the " pathogenic mycoplasma . "
That 's a quote , " pathogenic mycoplasma . "
And if you know anything about mycoplasmas , myco indicates fungal , but yet mycoplasma is not really a fungus , it 's not really a bacteria , it 's not really a virus .
It 's sort of like a pseudo all of them .
It has no cell wall , it goes deep into the cell nuclei thereby making it very difficult to mount an immune response against .
Redden :
And it 's man-made ...
Horowitz : It 's man-made .
It can be used as a biological weapon .
It was developed as an AIDS vaccine - related organism .
It was extracted from AIDS patients .
It is responsible for virtually all of the symptoms which AIDS patients suffer from .
The AIDS virus is at best a co-factor , and not even such a strong co-factor as to bring on all of the symptoms of AIDS .
This particular organism , the micoplasma , is associated with this upper respiratory flu - like illness .
And it's also associated in its pathogenic process with a whole variety of other symptoms that mimic AIDS .
Redden :
And that 's what you think is causing this epidemic ?
Horowitz :
That 's only one of the factors .
The patent report lays it out .
Like how you can use a factor like that to cause chronic upper respiratory infections just like what is going on .
I mean , virtually identical to what 's going on .
It 's patented by the Armed Forces Research Institute of Pathology .
Redden :
How did it get out of the lab and into the general population ?
Horowitz :
There 's only speculation and the most likely thesis that I 'm looking at is through contaminated vaccines , contaminated blood supplies .
I do n't know any other suitable mode of transmitting that kind of infectious agent .
Redden :
What about the current controversy over chemtrails - the theory that airplanes are spraying the population with some kind of chemical or biological weapon .
As I understand it , a number of researchers believe that many of the contrails in the skies these days are not the normal contrails formed by high - flying jets , but are actually trails of chemical or biological agents which spread out and then fall on the earth .
Could this mycoplasma be transmitted to the population through chemtrails ?
Horowitz : I do n't relate it to the chemtrails .
I do n't believe that this particular organism could be suitably spread that way .
But I believe the chemtrails are responsible for a chemical intoxication of the public , which would then cause a general immune suppression , low grade to high grade , depending on exposure .
An immune dysfunction , which would then allow people to become susceptible to opportunistic infections , such as this micoplasma and other opportunistic infections .
Redden :
So you believe that high - flying planes are , in fact , spraying something on the population that the theory is real ?
Horowitz :
There 's no question that it 's real .
There 's no doubt about that .
I first began to investigate chemtrails when some were sprayed over my home in Northern Idaho .
I took pictures of them , and then contacted the Environmental Protection Agency of the state .
When I contacted their directors , they were clueless and referred me to the Air Force .
They then got me in touch with Centers for Disease Control Toxicology , and after about a week I received a letter from one of their chief toxicologists saying , indeed there was some amount of ethylene dibromide in the jet fuel .
Now , ethylene dibromide is a known human chemical carcinogen that was removed from unleaded gasoline because of its cancer - causing effects .
Now suddenly it has appeared in the jet fuel that apparently high - altitude military aircraft are emitting .
Redden :
Why has ethylene dibromide been added to jet fuel ?
Horowitz :
When you examine who owns the fuel , who are the fuel company directors , suddenly you enter into the realm of the Rockefeller family and the royal families , Standard Oil and British Petroleum .
And what are their other agendas ?
Suddenly now you see their documents , showing that they have funded , historically , eugenics , racial hygiene , genocide , depopulation , family planning , maternal and child health where they make and deliver vaccines , and contaminated blood supplies .
These are the banksters , the same people who run the blood banking as well as the money banking industries .
In both Emerging Viruses and Healing Codes , I reference a great book by Dr. John Coleman , who worked as a British Secret Service agent at the highest levels .
And he articulated very clearly who was running those companies .
It all goes back , ultimately , to the highest level of the royal family .
The Bush family , Rothschild family , the Rockefeller money , and the entire Rockefeller establishment is based on Rothschild money and royal families .
So you begin to then , at least , put forward a possible theory , that if you can't explain it rationally and any other way , I think you 've got to begin to consider conspiracy theories .
And once you eliminate the negative label that you 've placed on conspiracy theories per se , because that 's been demonized , as has the terms holistic medicine , holistic health .
Redden : Naturopathic
Horowitz : Naturopathy .
I mean these labels get placed and as soon as they do , you know , it begins to wave red flags and people avoid those things .
But , you know , when you really just define a conspiracy as is defined in Websters , as two or more people getting together behind closed doors covertly and planning something unethical , immoral , illegal and then carrying it out , that 's a conspiracy .
So that 's now what you 're looking at , at the highest levels .
You 're looking at decision - makers who have , for whatever reasons , decided to put this toxic waste into jet fuels for human exposure , what ultimately 's going to be human exposure .
And it just so happens that these same people have put a lot of money into reducing world populations .
So now you ask yourself , when it comes to testing human subjects like American citizens unwittingly , unwillingly , who sprays toxins out of airplanes over San Francisco , kills people that way , who sprays biologicals on the Pennsylvania turnpike that induce death ?
Who has done that historically , as clearly articulated in the Frank Church congressional hearings of 1975 , has been Central Intelligence Agency biological weapons contracting firms , such as Litton Bionetics , such as the Army Corp of Engineers when they were developing and utilizing these various biologicals .
And this is all done under black operations , covert operations , where they get funding and congressional people are never informed really where this money is going .
It 's the black budget .
Redden :
As I understand it , this is not just an American epidemic , but it 's gone across Europe .
Horowitz : That 's right .
And so have the chemtrails .
I 've got colleagues over there , I 've got colleagues in the Bahamas , Bermuda , Toronto , British Columbia all reporting the same bizarre seeding of the atmosphere .
It 's horrible .
What is going on is just despicable .
Redden :
One reason I 'm interested in this subject is , I personally know three people who had the exact same thing happen to them .
First they came down with flu - like symptoms which did n't go away .
Then they went to the doctor , and the doctor said their flu had developed into a bacterial infection and we can give you antibiotics for that .
Then they were all given a brand new antibiotic they had never taken before , and they all had serious allergic reactions .
Horowitz : Right .
Is n't that fascinating ?
Redden :
What happened to them ?
Horowitz : OK , that 's a great question .
I 'm glad you asked that because I should have mentioned it before .
What you 're looking at with this upper respiratory infection is that it is a multi- factorial illness .
It 's associated with a variety of chemical and biological co-factors .
Just like with AIDS , it 's not the AIDS virus that ultimately kills , it 's co-factor microbes such as the Mycoplasma .
What you have could be described as an ideal Russian biological cocktail .
And I suppose it 's called Russia biological cocktail because the Americans likely invented it .
What they determined would be the best biological chemical warfare approach was a combination of chemicals and biologicals , so that it would be very difficult to diagnose and then treat the illnesses .
Moreover , it would be very difficult to trace where they came from .
If you 've got , say , ethylene dibromide coming out of the jet fuels that is causing immune suppression and weakening your immune system , and then you 've got a mycoplasma microbe or a fungus that causes an upper respiratory illness , suddenly you develop a secondary bacterial infection .
Now you get hit with antibiotics , and the antibiotics cause your body chemistry to go acidic , so now you get rashes and other things , your liver gets full of toxins and comes out through your skin in rashes and they get hyperallergenic reactions associated with the other chemicals .
So all of a sudden now , you realize that you 've got a human being who is completely out of balance and infected by two , three or four microbial co-factors as well as intoxicated by a variety of different chemicals .
Redden : A point of clarification .
Are
You saying that the fungus is working with the chemtrails and the antibiotic to make people sick ?
Horowitz : Exactly .
And you 've got somebody who 's going to be chronically ill .
And in the contemporary warfare arena , where experts in biological chemical warfare convene and discuss the ways that are ideal to conduct warfare today , to really take an enemy out , you do n't want to kill the people .
You want to produce people who are chronically ill and become dependent on the state and totally sap the resources of the country .
And then you can move in further with your military - medical - industrial complex , your international medical - pharmaceutical cartel .
And then you sell these beleaguered and defeated countries all of the pharmaceuticals and chemicals that they need to maintain any semblance of healthy function .
Redden :
So you 've got a work force that can work , but they 're too tired after they finish working to ...
Horowitz : That 's exactly it .
They 're completely depleted .
They can't put together a military ; you create a dependence and thereby you weaken the population , and weakened populations are easy to control .
So you 've got population control , and you make vast fortunes doing it , versus just blowing up a nuclear weapon and devastating the infrastructure that you own .
You and your colleagues own that infrastructure .
You want to get rid of the people .
You do n't want to get rid of infrastructure .
What I 'm relating to you now is not speculation .
If you were to read the top experts analysis of military warfare , such as what is articulated in The Report From Iron Mountain , which even the authorities , they say that this is a hoax , a satire , but , you know , there 's nothing funny about it .
The propaganda , the spin that they put on it is that the document is a satire .
But when you read it , there 's nothing funny about it .
Redden : You mentioned the Rockefellers .
You think the Rockefeller family is one of the major players in this conspiracy ?
Horowitz : Oh , absolutely .
One of the major players in world genocide , world population reduction .
That 's no mystery anymore .
I mean , you even have some mainstream publishing companies , such as St. Martin 's Press , writing the most horrific exposes of the Rockefeller family .
You have Oxford University Press , publishing , for example , Christopher Simpson 's work , called The Science of Coercion , where he proves that virtually the entire scientific and particularly health science agenda was laid out by the Rockefeller family .
In the 1920's , the federal government was giving very little money for public health .
Where the huge investment in public health in the United States came from was the Rockefeller financial coffers , you know .
They were behind it all .
And so , already by the 30's , the early 1930's , who was responsible for the primary viral research investments , public health looking at cancer , who created the cancer industry in the 1920's , was the Rockefellers , all the Rockefeller money .
And if you did n't go along with that particular money making population controlling agenda as a health scientist or health professional you were traditionally demoted , defunded , ostracized .
And then if you kept it up , you were persecuted and then jailed .
I know many , many people who have gone through
that .

The picture of the " radar rings " is the result of a test period for a Tesla Shield Generator .
The
correct question is " What type of government installation is located at the center of that image "
Hi
Similar images can be located on the
www.cyberspaceorbit.com
website ( it is frozen and still
available even though the creator has passed on ) I think they are filed under “ radar rings ” or
something similar .
The give away is the fact that it is a ring , with a clear area inside .
As a
former
Navy radar technician I am familiar with almost any type of radar return and what is displayed
is actually impossible unless you are familiar with Tom Beardens description of a “ fourier
transformed scalar wave ” and how it “ just appears ” at a certain point .
A “ slow ” scalar wave is
transmitted , then a “ faster ” scalar wave is transmitted .
When the faster wave overtakes the slower
wave , the two waves “ pair couple ” and create a standing wave at that point .
If you transmit this with
an omni-directional antenna , you have a “ bubble ” or “ shield ” around the transmitting station / area .
Hope this helps .
Its nice to see tax dollars at work doing something good for a change .
Sincerely
Michael Relfe

The Jindalee Operational Radar Network ( JORN ) consists of two OTHR ( over the horizon
radar ) , one near Longreach , Qld. and the other near Laverton , WA , jointly operated from
the JORN Coordination Centre ( JCC ) at RAAF Base Edinburgh , SA by No 1 Radar
Surveillance Unit .
The radars are an advanced development of the Australian designed Jindalee radar at
Alice Springs which is in operational use as well as being a research and development
facility used by DSTO for ongoing OTHR improvement .
JORN radars are capable of all weather detection of air and surface targets inside an arc
of up to 3,000 km range extending from Geraldton in the west around to Cairns in the
east .
JORN makes a crucial contribution to broad area surveillance of Australia's
strategically important northern approaches .

Then on the loop turn off the satellite option ( ticked box ) and
have a look at the two mentioned and in SE Qld around Bris , you will notice Straight ( as in ruler

Could not help seeing one comment re the unusual rings in the Kalgoorlie SW Oz area .
A few years ago , a guy named Harry Mason did some investigating of unusual aerial phenomena
in the Kalgoorlie area .
It also covered the use of a sheep station by the japanese sect ( aum
supreme ? ) that set off the tokyo underground gas attack and Mason implied they were using the
station to experiment with some tesla or scalar device .
I am sure I saw it in Nexus mag or hard evidence magazine ( aust publications ) .
Also the " over the

Sorry that ’s all I have .

If you want to get good and depressed , go the Web site of the Office of Management and Budget and spend some time browsing through the plethora of materials related to the 2011 federal budget .
That ’s what I ’ve being doing for the past couple of days , and , boy oh boy , it was n’t much fun .
Even if the economic recovery continues at a healthy clip , with annual GDP growth averaging about four per cent over the next five years , the budget deficit , currently running at about $ 1.55 trillion , will still be $ 700 billion in fiscal 2014 , and thereafter it will start climbing again , reaching $ 1 trillion in 2020 .
As a share of GDP , the Administration is projecting that the deficit will fall from 10.6 per cent this year to 3.9 per cent in 2014 , but by 2020 it will have risen back to 4.2 per cent .
To finance the deficit , the Treasury will have to issue more debt — trillions of dollars worth of it .
Between 2010 and 2020 , according to OMB ’s figures , the amount of federal debt outstanding will rise from fifty - three per cent of GDP to seventy - seven per cent , a level not seen since the aftermath of the Second World War .
The White House ’s numerical projections stop at 2020 , but , largely due to an explosive growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending , the fiscal outlook thereafter is even more bleak — something Tea Party sympathizers , devotees of Rubinomics , and progressives can agree upon .
“ If we continue current policies , the federal debt will skyrocket from 53 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal year 2009 to more than 300 percent of GDP in 2050 , ” the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities warned in a recent report .
“ That would be almost three times the existing record … and would threaten significant harm to the economy .
In addition , under current policies , the annual budget deficit is projected to exceed 20 percent of GDP by 2050 . ”
In the Financial Times earlier this week , the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff , the authors of an excellent book on the history of financial crises , pointed out that debt - to - GDP ratios of ninety per cent or higher are often associated with extended periods of economic stagnation .
Once the debt - to - GDP ratio approaches triple figures , the specter of sovereign defaults appears — witness the current problems of Greece and Iceland .
Got the message ?
In case you have n’t , Peter Orzag , the Administration ’s coltish budget director , said this in a blog post on Tuesday : “ Let ’s be clear : even with the substantial — and historic — deficit reduction proposed in this year ’s Budget , we will still face unsustainable medium - and long - term deficits .
And the Administration knows that more will need to be done to restore the nation to a fiscally sustainable path . ”
Now , you ( or I ) might question whether budgeting for an increase in annual spending of $ 944 billion , or twenty - five per cent , over five years — from $ 3,721 billion in 2011 to $ 4,665 billion in 2016 — amounts to “ historic ” deficit reduction .
( As recently as 1985 , the entire federal budget was $ 946 billion . )
But for now , let ’s put that aside and , just for fun , try to find some good news in the fiscal tea leaves .
Surely it should be possible to say something positive .
And , yes , if I try hard I can suggest at least four arguments that can be used to put some positive spin on these dreadful figures .
Two of these arguments are associated with famous political figures ; a well - known economic forecaster was responsible for another ; and one is n’t associated with anybody in particular , so I ’ll attribute it to myself .
I was right .
Dick Cheney was right .
Winston Churchill was right .
Victor Zarnowitz was right .
The Cassidy thesis :
In a post last week , I suggested that multi- year budget projections sometimes are n’t worth the paper they are printed on , citing as an example the infamous Clinton OMB budget projection from 2000 , which foresaw a decade of healthy surpluses .
That was an extreme example of how wrong forecasts can turn out to be , but it was far from atypical .
The problem is n’t that budget forecasters are incompetent , but , rather , that the task they set themselves is inherently very difficult .
This is partly because the deficit is n’t a thing in itself : it is the difference between two much larger figures that themselves vary considerably — total federal spending and total federal receipts .
Because of its residual nature , even relatively small movements in spending or receipts can have a drastic impact on the deficit .
In fiscal 2007 , for example , the federal government spent $ 2,729 billion and took in $ 2,568 billion , recording a deficit of $ 161 billion .
( These figures include Social Security payments . )
The following year , as the economy entered a recession , federal spending rose to $ 2,983 billion and receipts fell to $ 2,524 billion , producing a deficit of $ 459 billion .
Expressing these figures in another way , between 2007 and 2008 spending rose by roughly nine per cent and receipts fell by roughly two per cent , but the deficit increased by 185 percent !
To produce a deficit projection , you first have to forecast future spending , which involves making guesses about future policies and future GDP growth that are almost certainly going to be wrong .
Then you have to repeat the exercise for total receipts .
Given the nature of the exercise , the only reasonable question is n’t whether budget forecasters are going to be able predict deficits accurately three , five , or ten years ahead — they are n’t — but how far off their figures are going to be .
History shows the answer is a lot .
Since 1982 , the five - years - ahead deficit forecast has understated the actual outcome by an average of about $ 200 billion .
Most of the time , the projections were too low , but during the mid- to - late nineties they were too high .
In short , deficit forecasts should be treated with extreme caution — something the OMB acknowledges in an analytical annex to the budget report , where it provides not just a specific deficit forecast but also a range of possible outcomes that is highly likely to include the actual outcome .
Statisticians call such a range a “ confidence interval . ”
If a confidence interval is narrow , a specific forecast carries some credibility .
If a confidence interval is wide , the forecast is much less reliable .
Now let ’s look at the Administration ’s predictions for fiscal 2015 , five years hence .
The forecast for the deficit is 3.9 per cent of GDP , but the ninety per cent confidence interval — i.e. , the range of possible outcomes that has a 9 in 10 chance of including the actual outcome — goes from a surplus of 2.6 per cent of GDP to a deficit of 10.4 per cent of GDP .
This is not merely wide : it is a gaping chasm !
And what it means is that , based on past experience , pretty much anything could happen .
The Cheney thesis :
If the preceding argument is too nihilistic for your tastes , by all means ignore it and take the White House deficit projections seriously .
( After all , they are broadly in line with what most independent forecasters are saying . )
But do n’t forget the words that Vice - President Cheney reportedly uttered to then Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill in 2002 : “ Reagan proved deficits do n’t matter . ”
It 's pretty hideous .
The page has the " Do n't Tread On Me " flag that Tea party teabaggers like to use , and it has a wonderful Thomas Jefferson quote that domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh used .
A lot of the nastiest stuff got deleted the first time around .
Including a number of anti-Obama comments .
Since when , after all , is attempting to blow up a federal office as a protest against federal policies NOT an act of domestic terrorism ?
You know , Timothy McVeigh used a " dangerous instrument " to kill 168 people in Oklahoma City .
He too was angry at the federal government , and was converted to the belief that acts of violence was the only means possible to prevent the government from overwhelming our freedom and replacing it with tyranny .
He also believed that his act of exemplary violence would inspire others to take up similar acts to stave off the threat of tyranny .
And that 's exactly what Joseph Andrew Stack believed too :
I know I ’m hardly the first one to decide I have had all I can stand .
... I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt ; it will take nothing less .
I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard , knee - jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are .
Sadly , though I spent my entire life trying to believe it was n’t so , but violence not only is the answer , it is the only answer .
While members of Washington and Wall Street elites transfer the accumulated wealth of 200 years to themselves , the desperation in the rest of America becomes palpable .
And today it hangs in the air like the smoke billowing from the Echelon Building here in Austin , into which Joseph Andrew Stack crashed a Piper Cherokee PA - 28 .
Stack 's chief complaint was the American tax code , the right 's go - to instrument of class warfare in America since Ronald Reagan 's presidency .
This warfare accelerated during Bush 's tenure , as David Cay Johnston writes : " The effective income tax rate [ of the top 400 family earners ] fell to 16.62 % , down more than half a percentage point from 17.17 % in 2006 , the new data show .
That rate is lower than the typical effective income tax rate paid by Americans with incomes in the low six figures , which is what each taxpayer in the top group earned in the first three hours of 2007 . "
And now , instead of condemning the violence and loss of innocent life , as every citizen of the United States should do , many on the right are lionising Joseph Andrew Stack .
While Massachusetts ' newest Senator stopped short of praising Stack , he hardly condemned the violence .
The right wing is riding the populist tiger .
willing
" Every Americans has the right to disagree with the president of the United States and to express publicly that disagreement .
But the president of the United States has a right to communicate directly with the people who elected him , and the people of the country have the right to make up their own minds and form their own opinions about a presidential address without having the president 's words and thoughts characterized through the prejudices of hostile critics even before they can even be digested " by " this little group of men who not only enjoy a right of instant rebuttal to every presidential address , but more importantly wield a free hand in selecting , presenting and interpreting the great issues of our nation . "
They became , " in effect , the presiding judge in a national trial by jury .
" ... What do Americans know of the men who wield this power ?...
Little , other than that they reflect an urbane and assured presence , seemingly well - informed on every important matter ...
To a man , these commentators and producers live and work in the geographical and intellectual confines of Washington , D.C. , or New York City ...
Both communities bask in their own provincialism , their own parochialism ...
They talk constantly to one another , thereby providing artificial reinforcement to their shared viewpoint . "
That viewpoint , what was more , did " not represent the view of America .
That is why such a great gulf existed between how the nation received the president 's address -- and how the networks reviewed it .
" The American people would rightly not tolerate this kind of concentration of power in government .
Is it not fair and relevant to question its concentration in the hands of a tiny and closed fraternity of privileged men , elected by no one , and enjoying a monopoly sanctioned and licensed by government ? "
There are points being made by the Tea Party Movement that sound very attractive .
It even makes some naive and disappointed Democrats think there could be common ground with them .
And some of the Tea Partiers -- high school kids who are attracted to the stated ideals -- are all about the refreshing idealism .
But , as I 've said before , when you scratch beneath the surface of the actual teabaggers you find one of two strains : the virulent racists and Know Nothing xenophobes or the partisan Republicans with the same old anti-working family agenda .
I have no way of knowing if Joseph Stack ever went to a teababagger gathering or if he was a follower of Glenn Beck's , Rick Perry 's , Ayn Rand's , or Michael Savage's .
And no one at CPAC has been spotted wearing " Free Joseph Stack T - Shirts " ... yet ( not even Scott Brown , who dismissed the tragedy by saying that the people who voted for him feel the same way about paying taxes .
I bet they do ; most of them are thoroughly brainwashed by right - wing propagandists like Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , Sean Hannity , Ann Coulter and the rest of the anti-tax / anti - government choir singing nightly for their suppers for the 500 families who own most of America and do n't want to share it with anyone else .
John Aravosis did use a screenshot to capture a Facebook page by far right fanatics lionizing the latest in a string of domestic terrorists from the fringes of the Republican Party .
Teabaggery at its essence :
The mainstream media may have decided to not call flying a plane into a government office building " terrorism " since there were no Muslims involved , but as domestic terrorism / right - wing fanaticism expert Dave Neiwert explained at Crook and Liars yesterday , Joseph Stack was another violence - prone malcontent encouraged by right wing propaganda to act out Republican social nihilism that is just a few steps beyond standard operating procedures of your Mitch McConnells , Jim DeMints , Virginia Foxxes and Michele Bachmenn .
Digby summed it up nicely : " Nobody should be surprised that the right wing does n't see anything wrong with nice white , anti-government lunatics try to kill people , that 's for sure .
Their leaders certainly are n't .
And Sean Paul Kelley took on the task of explaining it to our friends in Engalnd with a column at the Guardian There 's a national mood -- an insanity that 's overtaken a third of the country -- brought about by Obama 's election .
The far right has gone loco and the teabagger " movement " is one manifestation of that .
Anti-social propagandists and nihilists made it clear from the very beginning that they areEAGER to see America fail rather than see Obama succeed .
And that trail of treachery leads from your Michael Savages , Glenn Becks , and Rush Limbaughs right up to partisan hacks and demented ideologues like Jim DeMint ( R- SC ) , Trent Franks ( R - AZ ) , Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) and Patrick McHenry ( R- NC ) .
Let me offer you something I 'm lifting out of Rick Perlstein 's marvelous most recent book .
While you 're reading it , try to imagine who it 's directed at and who spoke it -- and who wrote it for the speaker :
No , that was not Van Jones calling for an investigation of Clear Channel , Murdoch , Cheney , Limbaugh and O'Reilly .
It was Vice President Spiro Agnew before he resigned in disgrace after being caught pocketing bribes from wealthy interests , reading a speech written for him by President Richard Nixon before he resigned after being caught subverting American democracy , calling for populist censorship against ... Averell Harriman and David Brinkley .

j Query 1.4.2 Released
Posted on by
j Query 1.4.2 is now out !
This is the second minor release on top of jQuery 1.4 , fixing some outstanding bugs from the 1.4 release and landing some nice improvements .
I would like to thank the following people that provided patches for this release : Ben Alman , Justin Meyer , Neeraj Singh , and Noah Sloan .
Downloading
As usual , we provide two copies of jQuery , one minified ( we now use the Google Closure Compiler as the default minifier ) and one uncompressed ( for debugging or reading ) .
You can feel free to include the above URLs directly into your site and you will get the full performance benefits of a quickly - loading jQuery .
Additionally you can also load the URLs directly from either Google or Microsoft ’s CDNs :
New Features
A full list of the API changes can be found in the 1.4.2 category on the jQuery API site .
In this release we ’ve added two new methods : . delegate ( ) and .undelegate ( ) .
These methods serve as complements to the existing .live ( ) and .die ( ) methods in jQuery .
They simplify the process of watching for specific events from a certain root within the document .
For example :
$ ( " table " ) .delegate ( " td " , " hover " , function ( ) { $ ( this ).toggleClass ( " hover " ) ; } ) ;
This is equivalent to the following code written using .live ( ) :
$ ( " table " ) .each ( function ( ) { $ ( " td " , this ) .
live ( " hover " , function ( ) { $ ( this ).toggleClass ( " hover " ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
Additionally , .live ( ) is roughly equivalent to the following . delegate ( ) code .
$ ( document ) .delegate ( " td " , " hover " , function ( ) { $ ( this ).toggleClass ( " hover " ) ; } ) ;
What ’s Changed ?
There has been some large code rewrites within this release , both for performance and for fixing long - standing issues .
Performance Improvements
As is the case with virtually every release of jQuery :
We ’ve worked hard to continue to improve the performance of the code base , making sure that you ’re provided with the best performing JavaScript code possible .
According to the numbers presented by the Taskspeed benchmark we ’ve improved the performance of jQuery about 2 x compared to jQuery 1.4.1 and about 3 x compared to jQuery 1.3.2 .
Specifically we ’ve improved the performance of 4 areas within jQuery :
The performance of calling . bind ( ) and .unbind ( ) .
( Ticket )
The performance of .empty ( ) , .remove ( ) , and .html ( ) .
( Ticket )
The performance of inserting a single DOM node into a document .
( Ticket , Additional Commit )
The performace of calling $ ( " body " ) .
( Commit )
While comprehensive benchmarks like Taskspeed can be interesting if deconstructed into individual sub-tests for further study , as a project we tend to stay away from using them as an accurate measure of true , overall , library performance .
Considering how many aspects make up a library , not to mention the different techniques that they offer , cumulative results rarely reflect how an actual user may use a library .
For example , we saw significant overall performance speed - ups in Taskspeed simply by optimizing the $ ( " body " ) selector because it ’s called hundreds of times within the tests .
Additionally we saw large gains by optimizing . bind ( ) and .unbind ( ) by a fraction of a millisecond – an inconsequential amount – especially considering that any cases where you would bind hundreds of events you would likely want to use .live ( ) or . delegate ( ) instead .
We ’ve collected some results from the other major libraries as well but are less interested in those results and far more interested in the performance improvements that we ’ve made relative to older versions of jQuery itself .
We will continue to work on optimizing the jQuery code base – indefinitely .
It ’s always a major concern for us to try and provide the fastest JavaScript / DOM - development experience possible .
And yes , there will likely always be ways to gain additional performance – either through internal optimizations or by pushing critical functionality off into browser - land for standardization .
Event Rewrite
The largest internal changes have come through a much - needed structural rewrite of the events module .
Many quirky issues related to event binding have been resolved with these fixes .
Namely event handlers are no longer stored as object properties in jQuery ’s internal object store ( with metadata attached to the handlers ) .
Instead they ’re now stored within an internal array of objects .
If you ’ve ever had the opportunity to play around with .data ( " events " ) on a jQuery element you would find that it returns an object with all the event types currently bound , within it .
To enumerate some of the changes that have occurred during this rewrite :
It ’s now possible to bind identical handlers with different data , namespaces , and event types universally .
Execution of event handlers will continue after one handler removes itself ( or its sibling handlers ) .
We no longer attach data / namespace information directly to the event handlers ( only a unique tracking ID ) .
We no longer use proxy functions , internally , to try and encapsulate handlers .
Execution order of events is now guaranteed in all browsers .
Google Chrome had a long - standing error in their object - looping logic that has been routed around .
As a side - effect of these changes we had to change the newly - exposed special add / special remove APIs in order to accommodate the new event data objects .
Ben Alman is in the process of writing up a large tutorial on jQuery ’s special event system and we will be making additional announcements when that occurs .
Bug Fixes
There were a total of 40 tickets closed in this minor release .
Some relating to differences between jQuery 1.3.2 and jQuery 1.4.x , some fixing long - standing issues ( like in the case of the event module rewrite ) .

This is the raw data that we collected to generate the aforementioned charts .

Frequent contributor Michael Goodfellow responded to The Wal - Mart Model of Self - Destruction : Lowest Prices , Always ( January 24 , 2010 ) with this story on the future of small - scale manufacturing :
In the Next Industrial Revolution , Atoms Are the New Bits ( Wired.com ) .
His point was that to bemoan the loss of old large - scale manufacturing jobs was not productive compared to forward - looking models such as the " workbench " production and crowd - sourcing / out - sourcing described in the Wired article .
What I find radically appealing is not so much the technical aspects of desktop / workbench production of parts which were once out of financial reach of small entrepreneurs -- though that revolution is the enabling technology -- it is the possibility that entrepreneurs can own the means of production without resorting to vulture / bank investors / loans .
Anyone who has been involved in a tech startup knows the drill -- in years past , a tech startup required millions of dollars to develop a new product or the IP ( intellectual property ) .
To raise the capital required , the entrepreneurs had to sell their souls ( and company ) to venture capital ( vulture capital ) " investors " who simply took ORPM ( other rich people 's money ) and put it to work , taking much of the value of new promising companies in trade for their scarce and costly capital .
The only alternative were banks , who generally shunned " speculative investments " ( unless they were in the billions and related to derivatives , heh ) .
So entrepreneurs came up with the ideas and did all the hard work , and then vulture capital swooped in to rake off the profits , all the while crying bitter tears about the great risks they were taking with other rich people 's spare cash .
Now that these production tools are within reach of small entrepreneurs , the vulture capital machine will find less entrepreneural fodder to exploit .
The entrepreneurs themselves can own / rent the means of production .
That is a fine old Marxist phrase for the tools and plant which create value and wealth .
Own that and you create your own wealth .
In the post - industrial economies of the West and Asia , distribution channels acted as means of wealth creation as well : you want to make money selling books or music , for instance , well , you had to sell your product to the owners of the distribution channels : the record labels , film distributors , book publishers and retail cartels , all of whom sold product through reviews and adverts in the mainstream media ( another cartel ) .
The barriers to entry were incredibly high .
It took individuals of immense wealth ( Spielberg , et al. ) to create a new film studio from scratch ( DreamWorks ) a few years ago .
Now any artist can sell their music / books via the Web , completely bypassing the gatekeepers and distribution channels .
In a great irony , publishers and labels are now turning to the Web to sell their product .
If all they have is the Web , then what value can they add ?
I fully expect filmakers to go directly to the audience via the Web in coming years and bypass the entire film distribution cartel entirely .
Why go to Wal - Mart to buy a DVD when you can download hundreds of new films off the Web ?
Both the supply chain and distribution cartels are being blown apart by the Web .
Not only can entrepreneurs own / rent the means of production and arrange their own supply / assembly chains , they can also own their own distribution channels .
The large - scale factory / distribution model is simply no longer needed for many products .
As the barriers to owning the means of production and distribution fall , a Renaissance in small - scale production and wealth creation becomes not just possible but inevitable .
Of course some manufacturing entails large scale production : aircraft , bulldozers , semiconductors , etc .
Surprisingly , perhaps , some large - scale manufacturing is growing in the U.S. : Radical Shifts Take Hold in U.S. Manufacturing ( WSJ.com )
Here is a chart from the article :
Protecting intellectual property is a powerful reason to bring high - level manuafcturing back home .
It is simply fact that intellectual property is at risk overseas in countries with poor IP protection and rule of law .
So is it worth risking your crown jewels to expand overseas ?
That is at least one issue facing Google in China .
Anecdotally , it is known that the Japanese are careful to keep high - level manufacturing technology in Japan to protect it from theft or reverse engineering .
The chart reflects this : there is n't much IP in furniture , textiles or plastic products to reverse engineer / steal , so these industries will continue declining unless they move to a small , flexible , low - cost model as described in the Wired article .
Those industries which need to protect their IP or which cannot be made overseas ( electricity ) continue to expand .
Opportunities abound on both large and small scales .

Guitar Hero is a franchise that catapulted Red Octane and Harmonix directly into the money pit , but not everyone associated with the launch of the popular rhythm game came out of it crazy rich .

There was a reason the original Guitar Hero only launched on the Playstation 2 , and that reason was Mad Catz .
" Guitar Hero was a game that we were actually involved with early on and pulled out because of a lawsuit with Konami , " Mad Catz president and CEO Darren Richardson tells Kotaku .
" We were doing the Xbox SKU and that 's why there was only a Playstation 2 launch .
That 's why .
We were in there and we pulled out as a result of ( the lawsuit ) and ( Red Octane and Harmonix ) went forward and it turned out to be a success , a huge success . "

Richardson says they paid $ 300,000 to get out of their deal and cut themselves out of the Guitar Hero franchise .
" Everyone else made hundreds of millions and we paid money to not be a part of it , " Richardson said .
" It was brilliant .
I come up with these strokes of genius from time to time .
That was my best . "
Astronauts enjoy light duty , repair urine processor
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : February 10 , 2010
The Endeavour astronauts worked through a light day in orbit Wednesday , preparing for a spacewalk overnight Thursday , the first of three to attach and outfit a new habitation module , and looking forward to a bit of off - duty time .
Space station commander - turned - plumber Jeffrey Williams , meanwhile , spent his " morning " repairing the lab 's urine recycling equipment , installing a new distillation assembly centrifuge and pump module brought up aboard Endeavour , along with a new filter that engineers hope will restore the critical system to normal , or near - normal operation .
If all goes well , Williams will complete the repairs this evening and the equipment will begin processing stored urine to make sure the system works as expected .
" The top priority really will be replacing the distillation assembly , which is a centrifuge that 's a central component in the urine processor , " said lead Flight Director Kwatsi Alibaruho .
" That assembly will be replaced and if everything goes well , we 'll do the initial activation of that assembly and start a brief shakedown period . "
Engineers on the ground " will be looking at the performance of that system , making sure all the currents and the rotation rates and other parameters are as they expect , " he said .
" And then we 'll try to process some of the urine that 's been stored .
We 'll probably start that process early on flight day five ( overnight Thursday ) or a little bit later . "
The primary goal of Endeavour 's mission is to attach a new habitation module to the station that will house the U.S. toilet , oxygen generation system , carbon dioxide scrubber and water processing system , all of which are currently housed elsewhere in the lab .
But the equipment racks will not be moved until the urine processing system has had a chance to operate , generating pure water that will be returned to Earth aboard Endeavour for analysis .
Shuttle engineers at the Johnson Space Center are continuing their assessment of Endeavour 's heat shield to make sure the orbiter can safely descend to Earth a the end of the mission .
LeRoy Cain , chairman of NASA 's Mission Management Team , said engineers now have enough imagery to rule out any need for an additional , focused inspection .
Time set aside for such an inspection now will be put to use transferring equipment and supplies and doing other tasks .
Overall , Cain said , the shuttle 's thermal protection system appears to be " very clean " with only two " areas of interest " under discussion .
A photo survey carried out by the station crew during the shuttle 's approach Tuesday showed a ceramic insert around a fastener securing a carrier plate around one of the shuttle 's cockpit windows had loosened , protruding a bit above the surface of the window frame .

The fastener acts as a spacer of sorts and engineers are assessing what might happen if it worked loose during re-entry , whether it could strike the shuttle 's tail fin , speed brake or an aft orbital maneuvering system rocket pod .
" The vertical stabilizer , where we have the rudder and the speedbrake , is the area that would be of concern , possibly the OMS pod , " Cain said .
" The ceramic insert is a fairly dense material .
We 'll see what the debris transport shows us . "
It 's not yet known what sort of energy the insert could impart if it did work itself loose , or even whether that 's a possibility given that it did n't come all the way out during the vibrations of launch .
" There are a whole lot of questions that have to be answered before we would ever consider whether or not we need to do anything to mitigate it , " Cain said .
" We have more questions than answers at this point , so we 'll let the team go off and do the work . "
Another area of interest is a repaired tile on the upper surface of the crew module .
The repair appears to have failed and one corner of the tile has separated slightly from the rest .
Neither issue appears to be a serious threat and as of this writing , it appears unlikely any repairs would be attempted .
But Cain said nothing has been ruled out .
" Those are two areas we 'll take a closer look at from an analysis standpoint , we 'll do some debris transport assessment and we 'll talk some more about those two areas as we go through the mission , " he said .
" Initially , it does n't look like we 're going to be very concerned about them , but we want to be very vigilant and take a closer look . "
Overall , he said , " the vehicle is very , very clean from a thermal protection standpoint .
Endeavour looks really good . "

Fixing the urine processor is critical to long - term station operation .
With a crew of up to six full - time astronauts , generating fresh water is an on - going issue that will take on added significance when the shuttle is retired later this year .
Here is a bit more background from the CBS News STS - 130 mission preview :
The station 's urine processor has been shut down in recent weeks because of problems with the distillation assembly .
More recently , blockage in a line knocked out the part of the system that converts condensate into clean water .
" We brought home the other failed distillation assembly on the last shuttle flight , " station Program Manager Mike Suffredini said before launch .
" Through a failure investigation , we found calcium deposits inside the distillation assembly and we 're doing quite a bit of investigation to determine how to prevent that in the future .
" One way is to not process to as high a concentration of brine inside the system , meaning we empty the tank that carries the ultimate waste from the urine processor , we empty it a little more often .
So we want to run the processor with the new distillation assembly inside long enough to fill the tank up to the new level we plan to operate at , remove that tank and bring it home .
" That will take us almost the entire mission , from the time we 're able to install the spare until the time the crew has to depart , " Suffredini said .
" That 's what 's driving us not to do the rest of the rack moves until the urine processor can move . "
As for the presumed line blockage problem with the water processing system that is preventing conversion of condensate , engineers believe a filter carried up aboard Endeavour should resolve the issue .
" When the shuttle arrives we 'll install the filter and then we 'll activate the water processor along with the urine processor and recover our regenerative ( environmental control and life support ) system by the end of the mission , " Suffredini said .
The station has plenty of stockpiled water for extended operations while work to fix the current problems is carried out .
Station Flight Director Bob Dempsey described the repairs as " an extensive amount of work . "
" Once they complete that work , we 'll activate from the ground and begin processing the urine and we 'll watch that very closely , " he said .
" We 'll process as much as we can through the mission so the filter / tank assembly gets to be used as much as we can and verify that the system is working in its new configuration and then we 'll bring it back on the last day . "
As it now stands , the oxygen generation system , the U.S. toilet and the water processing system racks bound for Tranquility will not be moved into the new module during the normal shuttle timeline .
If the flight is extended one day as managers hope , the Endeavour astronauts should be able to get some , if not all , of the equipment transferred .

Facebook is now the top source of traffic for major news and entertainment portals such as Yahoo and MSN , according to traffic analysis firm Compete , and is “ among the leaders ” for other sites as well .
Although far from conclusive , this is just another sign of how the “ social web ” is becoming an increasingly dominant force in terms of driving traffic flows on the Internet — and that in turn makes it a growing threat for major web players such as Google ( s goog ) , MSN ( s msft ) and Yahoo ( s yhoo ) .
If your core business depends on controlling and / or getting a piece of the web ’s traffic flow , as it does for all of those companies , the social web is something you ignore at your peril ( which helps explain the launch of new services like Google Buzz ) .
Compete ’s director of online media and search told the San Francisco Chronicle that a snapshot of web traffic from December showed 13 percent of the traffic to major web portals like Yahoo , MSN and AOL came from Facebook .
Traffic from Google generated just 7 percent , which Compete said actually put it third in traffic sources behind eBay ( s ebay ) , which accounted for 7.6 percent .
It ’s important to note that Compete ’s analysis is just another data point , and probably should n’t be taken as definitive .
The jockeying for top spot as the web ’s No. 1 traffic source has been going on for some time , and every measurement firm has its own numbers , which often conflict with each other because of differences in their methods .
But there ’s no question about the overall trend : Facebook has been growing strongly in terms of overall traffic to the site and the traffic that it drives to other sites .
Steve Rubel of Edelman Digital says that he sees Facebook becoming an increasingly powerful competitor to Google .
“ I see Facebook starting to look more like Google while Google tries and stumbles at becoming more social , ” he writes .
“ Social networking is here to stay .
It ’s where attention spirals are flowing and no one looms larger than Facebook .
And while Facebook has plenty of critics and they run into the occasional privacy concerns , I believe that they will dominate the landscape the next few years . ”
Billionaire entrepreneur and sports team owner Mark Cuban noted a similar phenomenon in a blog post last year , saying the traffic coming to his blog from Facebook and Twitter was increasing while the traffic flow from Google was “ declining significantly . ”
He called this phenomenon “ huge , because of the behavior implications for users , and because of the business implications for Twitter , Facebook and Google . ”
It ’s worth pointing out that while Facebook may be driving more traffic to portal sites and to blogs — particularly those like Perez Hilton , which gets far more referrals from the social network than it does from Google , according to Hitwise — that does n’t mean it ’s going to replace Google any time soon .
And Google , along with Microsoft and Yahoo , is doing its best to integrate social web content from Twitter and Facebook into search results , through indexing arrangements with those sites .
But the balance of power is definitely shifting .

Saving money is trendy again
I recently read a magazine article talking about how the recession has brought saving money back into style as people found themselves short on disposable income and easy credit .
The article went on to explain that part of the “ new ” saving trend was buying more expensive clothes that do n’t wear out quickly , and I agree in principle , but would steer clear of “ name brands ” found in many magazines advertising sport watches in excess of $ 300 .
While the article had some great info , it felt like they were mostly trying to sell overpriced goods and convince customers they deserved a pat on the back for “ saving money . ”
What really captured my attention was the article ’s focus on how this saving trend was “ new ” , “ fresh ” , “ exciting ” , and not “ cheap ” like saving money has been viewed in the past .
Apparently people believe that for any idea to be good , it has to be new .
Saving money has never meant “ cheap , ” and there is nothing wrong with saving … however one may view it .
Saving money is virtuous and logical
Saving is a synonym of the word frugal which comes from the Latin root frugalis and is closely related to the words for both fruit and enjoyment .
Nothing cheap about those terms !
Saving money was actually one of the old Roman Virtues , and in times past was also an American virtue .
Somehow , over time , the modern American virtue regarding money has been closer to irresponsible spending than saving .
For many years in America it seemed anyone who paused to think before spending was quickly characterized as a penny - pinching cheapskate .
Thankfully , that trend has reversed again due mostly to the recent financial crisis .
While not buying stuff you cannot afford is part of of what it means to be a saver , it is only half the meaning .
Webster tells us that saving money is about economy and the use of one ’s resources .
A mindset of saving will often lead you to avoid spending even if you have the money saved , perhaps because you are saving for something else or you just feel the purchase would not be worth your life energy .
The essence of saving is simply spending less than is necessary to get what you want , which is hard to do if we are unaware of exactly what we want .
As strange as that may sound , most people never set savings goals for themselves .
Have you set savings goals for yourself ?
What are they ?
Saving money for specific goals helps you avoid pitfalls
What do you really want in exchange for your life energy ?
I ’m not referring to the general stuff like food , a roof , some wheels , and a few vacations …
I ’m more interested in the specifics .
Where exactly do you want to live and in what type of home ?
What toys do you want most ?
What is most important to you in a vehicle ?
Where do you want to go on vacation and when ?
Do you want to retire and at what standard of living ?
No one can have everything , so we all must decide which things we want most .
If you never ask yourself such questions , there are a couple of financial pitfalls we tend to run into .
First , without focus on what we really want we tend to buy whatever we see… simply because buying new stuff is fun .
We might even buy good stuff , but if it is not what we really wanted , it runs the risk of sitting unused and the life energy we spent to attain the stuff gets wasted .
Without specific savings goals our resources may get unnecessarily consumed , and we eventually miss out on something we would have enjoyed more .
That is not very wise , but most of us have done it more than once … myself included ! 🙂
Another common pitfall … not saving as much as we could have had we set specific savings goals .
Without specific financial goals we become comfortable with the status quo .
If our bills are paid and we have some savings … we may never think to save more .
Absent any definitive goals ( and the sacrifice necessary to reach them ) it is much easier for careless spending to rob us of the things we actually wanted the most but never took the time to define .
The difference between deprivation and sacrifice has been described as the presence of the goal which a sacrifice is made to attain .
Visualizing the purpose of your sacrifice will give you the strength to see it through , to save for it , and is likely to make others wonder how you are able to accomplish so much with the amount of money you earn .
I ’m bringing saving back
Finance writer Joe Dominguez looked forward to a time when we would speak of savers with awe and respect ( hey , he was writing in the 70’s . )
I think now is the perfect time to bring back the saving trend , but without the $ 300 watches the magazines are pushing !
🙂
People focused on saving money are typically willing to make sacrifices to meet specific goals .
I set a high goal to save $ 22,000 towards a house this year .
For me it is attainable , but requires having to say no to some of the fun things we like to do .
My wife and I stick with it knowing that every penny we save brings us that much closer to the house we both want .
Are you bringing saving back ?
Have you made a list of which things you want most , and thought about what things might be getting in the way ?
Where could you save more and what sacrifices could you make for the things that matter most to you and the things that will help you meet your savings goals without feeling deprived ?
We would love to hear about any goals you have set for yourself , or that you have recently achieved .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Electricity provider Oncor said Friday a record - breaking snow storm over the past 24 hours left more than 180,000 homes and businesses without power in the Dallas / Fort Worth area .
Some customers may have to wait until the weekend to see the lights back on , the company said in a release , adding it called for additional workers from inside and outside the state to help restore service .
“ Restoring power in these conditions is difficult and time consuming .
That ’s why we have additional help on the way , ” Jim Greer , senior vice president asset management and engineering for Oncor , said in the release .
“ Trees , heavy with snow , are contacting power lines , causing power outages .
As the slow thaw begins today , the limbs will snap back into position , hitting power lines , ” Greer added .
Oncor , which serves more 3 million customers in Texas , said it had about 2,500 Oncor personnel and contractors restoring power and expected another 1,500 contractors and personnel from other utilities to arrive throughout the day to help .
The weather should help make it easier to restore power over the next few days .
Temperatures were forecast to reach the low 40s Fahrenheit on Friday and the mid 50s on Saturday and Sunday , according to AccuWeather.com .
The US killed a key al Qaeda military leader based in Pakistan ’s Taliban - controlled tribal agency of North Waziristan during an airstrike on Feb. 17 .
Sheikh Mansoor was killed in a Predator attack that targeted a Taliban compound in the village of Tapi near Miramshah , the main town in North Waziristan .
Two other “ militants ” were initially reported killed in the airstrike ; it is not currently known if there were any other senior al Qaeda or Taliban operatives killed .
Dawn
News reported that the airstrike “ left number of other important militants killed . ”
Both Geo News and Dawn reported that a funeral was held for Mansoor , and that Mohammed Haqqani , a mid-level Haqqani Network military commander and brother of the group ’s top military commander Siraj Haqqani , was killed by another drone strike while preparing to attend Mansoor ’s burial on Feb. 18 .
US intelligence officials contacted by The Long War Journal said they believe Sheikh Mansoor was killed in the attack on Feb. 17 .
“ We ’re pretty sure that Mohammed Haqqani was killed while going to Sheikh Mansoor ’s burial , ” an intelligence official said .
“ We were gunning for Siraj but got his little brother instead .
It is still a good kill ; the Haqqanis are dangerous and Mohammed was involved in the family business . ”
Sheikh Mansoor was a commander in al Qaeda ’s Lashkar al Zil , or the Shadow Army , US officials said .
He was based in North Waziristan but carried out attacks against US and Afghan forces across the border in Afghanistan .
Mansoor ’s family has a pedigree in jihad .
His father was Ahmed Said Al Khadr , an al Qaeda operative who was killed in October 2003 , Geo Newsreported .
Khadr , who is also known as Abdul Rehman Khadr al Kanadi , was born in Cairo , Egypt , but was a Canadian national .
Khadr was a close confidant of Osama bin Laden , who invited Kanadi to join the Shura Majlis , the top leadership council , after the US invasion of Afghanistan .
Khadr was tasked with helping al Qaeda families escape into Pakistan .
He was also close to South Waziristan Taliban leader Mullah Nazir , who shelters al Qaeda leaders in the Wazir tribal areas .
Khadr was wanted by the US for his suspected ties to the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks on the US .
He was also on the United Nations ’ 1267 Committee list of designated terrorists .
Pakistani security forces killed Kanadi and several other al Qaeda fighters during a raid in October 2003 .
Mansoor ’s two other brothers , Omar and Abdurahman , have both spent time at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba after being detained while fighting US forces in Afghanistan in 2001 .
Omar , the youngest detainee ( he is thought to have been 15 when he was captured ) , is still in custody .
Abdurahman was released in 2003 .
Background on the recent strikes in Pakistan
US intelligence believes that al Qaeda has reconstituted its external operations network in Pakistan ’s lawless , Taliban - controlled tribal areas .
This network is tasked with hitting targets in the West , India , and elsewhere .
The US has struck at these external cells using unmanned Predator aircraft and other means in an effort to disrupt al Qaeda ’s external network and decapitate the leadership .
The US also has targeted al Qaeda - linked Taliban fighters operating in Afghanistan , particularly the notorious Haqqani Network .
As of the summer of 2008 , al Qaeda and the Taliban operated 157 known training camps in the tribal areas and the Northwest Frontier Province .
Al Qaeda has been training terrorists holding Western passports to conduct attacks , US intelligence officials have told The Long War Journal .
Some of the camps are devoted to training the Taliban ’s military arm ; some train suicide bombers for attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan ; some focus on training the various Kashmiri terror groups ; some train al Qaeda operatives for attacks in the West ; some train the Lashkar al Zil , al Qaeda ’s Shadow Army ; and one serves as a training ground for the Black Guard , the elite bodyguard unit for Osama bin Laden , Ayman al Zawahiri , and other senior al Qaeda leaders .
The air campaign has had success over the past three months .
Since Dec. 8 , 2009 , the air campaign in Pakistan has killed three senior al Qaeda leaders , a senior Taliban commander , a senior Haqqani Network commander , two senior al Qaeda operatives , and a wanted Palestinian terrorist who was allied with al Qaeda .
The status of Pakistani Taliban leader Hakeemullah Mehsud is still unknown .
Already this year , the US has killed Mansur al Shami , an al Qaeda ideologue and aide to al Qaeda ’s leader in Afghanistan , Mustafa Abu Yazid ; Sheikh Mansoor , a Shadow Army commander based in North Waziristan ; Mohammed Haqqani , a military commander in the Haqqani Network ; and Haji Omar Khan , a senior Taliban leader in North Waziristan .
Jamal Saeed Abdul Rahim , the Abu Nidal Organization operative who participated in killing 22 hostages during the 1986 hijacking of Pan Am flight 73 , is thought to have been killed in the Jan. 9 airstrike .
And Abdul Basit Usman , an Abu Sayyaf operative with a $ 1 million US bounty for information leading to his capture , is rumored to have been killed in a strike on Jan. 14 , although a Philippine military spokesman said Usman is likely still alive and in the Philippines .
In December 2009 , the US killed Abdullah Said al Libi , the top commander of the Shadow Army ; Zuhaib al Zahib , a senior commander in the Shadow Army ; and Saleh al Somali , the leader of al Qaeda ’s external network [ see LWJ report , “ Senior al Qaeda and Taliban leaders killed in US airstrikes in Pakistan , 2004 – 2010 ” for the full list ] .

On the heels of a move into the social networking sphere , Google on Wednesday announced that they are ready to tackle another role  Internet service provider .
On the heels of a , Google on Wednesday announced that they are ready to tackle another role  Internet service provider .
Google plans to build and test ultra high - speed broadband networks in a small number of trial locations across the U.S. , and is promising speeds up to 1 gigabit per second .
These will be fiber - to - the - home ( FTTH ) connections that are " 100 times faster than what most Americans have access to today , " according to Google .
" Our goal is to experiment with new ways to help make Internet access better and faster for everyone , " Minnie Ingersoll and James Kelly , Google product managers , wrote in a blog post .
Speeds up to 1G / bit per second are important to handle emerging technologies , Google said , and it urged participants to " think big with a gig . "
That type of speed " will enable new consumer applications , as well as medical , educational , and other services that can benefit communities , " the company said .
" If the Internet has taught us anything , it 's that the most important innovations are often those we least expect . "
Google has not yet selected the communities where it will build these networks , and is instead asking for city and state officials to tell the search engine giant where it should go .
" Today we 're putting out a request for information ( RFI ) to help identify interested communities .
We welcome responses from local government , as well as members of the public , " Ingersoll and Kelly wrote .
Google stressed that its networks will be open access , " meaning we 'll share our network with other service providers , giving users more choice , " Kelly said in a video message .
What type of communities does Google want ?
" Above all , we 're interested in deploying our network efficiently and quickly , and are hoping to identify interested communities that will work with us to achieve this goal , " Google wrote in its FAQ .
" We also want to want to work with a community where we can bring significant benefits to residents and develop useful proofs - of - concept that can have a broader impact . "
Google said it wants to be able to accelerate broadband deployment in regions other than its test communities , so factors will include " level of community support , local resources , weather conditions , approved construction methods and local regulatory issues [ as well as ] broadband availability and speeds that are already offered to users within a community . "
Comments and suggestions are due by March 26 , and Google hopes to select its target community or communities this year .
Pricing has not yet been determined , nor has a roll - out date been set , but Google said it will " offer service at a competitive price . "
" We expect that we will provide this service to a minimum of 50,000 people and up to as many as 500,000 people , most likely in multiple communities , " Google said .
In addition to providing Internet service , Google said it hopes the project will also open the door to next - generation apps , new deployment techniques , and openness and choice .
" Like our WiFi network in Mountain View , the purpose of this project is to experiment and learn .
Network providers are making real progress to expand and improve high - speed Internet access , but there 's still more to be done , " Ingersoll and Kelly wrote .
" We do n't think we have all the answers  but through our trial , we hope to make a meaningful contribution to the shared goal of delivering faster and better Internet for everyone . "
Julius Genachowski , chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , praised Google 's announcement .
" Big broadband creates big opportunities .
This significant trial will provide an American testbed for the next generation of innovative , high - speed Internet apps , devices , and services , " Genachowski said in a statement .
" The FCC 's National Broadband Plan will build upon such private - sector initiatives and will include recommendations for facilitating and accelerating greater investment in broadband , creating jobs and increasing America 's global competitiveness . "
The FCC must deliver a national broadband plan to Congress by March 17 .
" Google 's proposed experiment with building ultra-fast , open broadband pipelines in a handful of communities follows a trail already blazed by Verizon 's FiOS network , which has fiber optic cables capable of speeds comparable to what Google proposes , " Ben Scott , policy director for Free Press , said in a statement .
" The FCC should use these examples to set forward - looking goals for the future of broadband throughout the United States . "

World champion Jenson Button has now officially clocked on for duty at McLaren - with the Woking - based outfit showing him off in his new team gear for the first time .
Button 's contractual terms with former team Brawn GP meant he could not properly begin work for McLaren until 2009 had finished .
But the start of the New Year means Button is now an official McLaren driver - and the team has released the first image of him in McLaren team kit .
The team 's twitter feed has a picture of Button ( reproduced on the right courtesy of McLaren ) in the race bays at Woking - with the team also releasing a New Year 's video message from the reigning champion .
Button tells fans : " Hi everyone , and Happy New Year .
It is a real pleasure to be part of the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team and I am looking forward to working with you all in 2010 . "
Button is currently on holiday in Hawaii and is scheduled to make his first public appearance of 2010 at the AUTOSPORT International Show later this month .
A federal class action lawsuit charges that a suburban Philadelphia school district has been spying on students and families via remotely activated webcams in laptops the schools issued to students , Courthouse News reports .
The Associated Press reports that the lawsuit alleges that the cameras captured images of Harriton High School students and their families as they undressed and in other compromising situations .
Courthouse News quotes extensively from the suit , which claims the plaintiffs found out about the cameras when an assistant principal allegedly told a student that authorities believed the student was engaged in improper behavior at home " and cited as evidence a photograph from the webcam embedded in the laptop . "
The Lower Merion School District issued the laptops , outfitted with webcams , to each of its approximately 1,800 high school students , the suit says .
The suit alleges that the student verified through the assistant principal that the school district " in fact has the ability to remotely activate the webcam contained in a student 's personal laptop computer issued by the school district at any time it chose and to view and capture whatever images were in front of the webcam , all without the knowledge , permission or authorization of any persons then and there using the laptop computer . "
Superintendent Christopher McGinley did not immediately return a message asking for comment , the Associated Press reports .

Despite their Web savvy , young adults are slow to spot identity theft online , according to the Javelin Strategy & Research identity fraud survey released Wednesday .
In the annual Identity Fraud Survey Report , now in its seventh year , Javelin found that identity theft involving young adults typically go undetected for longer than fraud targeting older consumers .
The survey showed that compared to other age groups , so - called millennials — consumers age 18 to 24 — take nearly twice as many days to detect fraud , leaving young adults fraud victims for longer periods .
Identity theft experts say the data highlights an unusual paradox about young adults .
“ It ’s sort of counterintuitive .
They are online all the time .
What they ’re not online doing is monitoring their credit cards and bank accounts , ” says Anne Wallace , president of the nonprofit Identity Theft Assistance Corporation ( ITAC ) , which co-sponsored the survey .
“ That seems to be part of why they ’re not discovering [ ID theft ] as fast as other age groups . ”
Wallace says that although millennials do n’t tend to victimized by fraudsters as often as other age groups , they still have ample reason to take the survey ’s findings to heart .
Invincible ?
No , vulnerable
While they may be wise about the World Wide Web , experts say that young people still have a lot to learn about the world ’s wicked ways .
That lack of experience keeps them from taking the precautions necessary to frustrate fraudsters .
“ I ’d speculate that it ’s a feeling of not being vulnerable — that they ’re still relatively innocent about the risks ” of identity theft , says Wallace .
She adds that millennials may believe that since they do n’t have a lot of money in the bank they are n’t likely to be victimized .
“ But if somebody withdraws $ 100 from your savings account , that can have a devastating impact , ” she says .
MILLENNIALS SLOW TO FIND ID THEFT
Those 18 to 24 years old , despite their Web savvy , are slower to discover ID theft — and pay for it , a Javelin Strategy & Research study finds .
Millenial ID theft victims
All ID theft victims
Time to detect fraud 132 days 59 days Cost of fraud $ 1,156 $ 234
That same group of young people is also most likely to be online .
Akamai ’s State of the Internet report for the third quarter of 2009 shows that people between the ages of 18 and 29 use the Internet the most , with 93 percent of that age group going online .
That makes it a group that is comfortable on the Internet — maybe too comfortable .
“ Younger people have a bigger comfort zone with regards to personal information , and that leads them to sometimes being unwise about the types of info on their Facebook pages , ” Wallace says .
ID theft tips for millennials
Rather than waiting the years it takes to develop a more world - wise attitude , millennials can take action to better guard their data :
Adjust your privacy settings .
Facebook and other online sites offer privacy settings to restrict who gets to see personal information .
Wallace says that young people need to familiarize themselves with these settings and use them to filter their data .
She recommends that people ask themselves a key question : “ Is this information I want everybody to know — or only a much smaller group of people ? ”
Guard your data .
Because young people often live in dorms or shared housing , they have to be vigilant about keeping their data ( including Social Security and PIN numbers ) out of the hands of less - than - trustworthy housemates or acquaintances .
“ It may seem like an obvious point , but do n’t give your roommate your PIN number , ” Wallace says .
Visit your bank ’s Web site .
With banks and credit card issuers offering free account access online , young people have no reason not to surf over to check on their accounts .
“ When you monitor electronically , you will find the theft faster , ” says Wallace .
“ Faster detection translates directly into lower costs and less anxiety . ”
Protect your gadgets .
In many cases , fraudsters are pretty Web - savvy themselves .
And while young people may not fall victim to phishing and other more basic online scams , they still need to guard their computers and other gadgets .
Installing firewalls and software to protect a computer against spyware and viruses can also help to safeguard personal information .
Experts say it ’s a constant battle to keep data safe from increasingly sophisticated networks of identity thieves , but it ’s one that young people need to participate in .
“ We have to acknowledge and adjust our perception of reality to accommodate that there are people looking to steal from you , ” Wallace says .
Other findings
Javelin also found :
The number of U.S. identity fraud victims rose 12 percent to 11.1 million adults last year , the highest level since the survey began in 2003 .
The average fraud resolution time dropped 30 percent to 21 hours .
Nearly half of fraud victims now file police reports , resulting in double the reported arrests , triple the prosecutions and double the percentage of convictions in 2009 .
Poll methodology
Javelin ’s poll was conducted via random digit dialing to 5,000 Americans , including 703 identity theft victims .
Findings for the identity theft victims are considered accurate at a 95 percent confidence level , with a 3.7 percent margin of error .

5 Reasons Why Gmail Buzz Privacy Is n’t All That Bad
Google released Buzz for Gmail and there are issues if you ’re not careful with your settings as well as possibly unwanted group overlaps ( I would n’t be too surprised if in the future , a less tech savvy family member posts a meant - to - be- private reply to a public buzz message of yours , because after all Google did integrate something very public into a product that was formerly rather private ) .
However , Rome is n’t burning and Sergey Brin is n’t playing the fiddle , and yesterday I saw some people who apparently think that Google now simply reveals all your Gmail contacts , which is n’t true .
Here are some things on the other hand which I understand to be true ( please correct me if I ’m wrong ) :
Again , Google wo n’t just reveal your Gmail address book to the world .
Only if you opt-in to follow certain people who are suggested to you in Buzz do they have a chance to show up on your public Google profile as people you follow .
If you ’re e.g. a journalist who ’s in contact with sources who like to remain anonymous , make sure you handle Buzz with care .
Note others may follow you and thus show up on your profile , though .
Even if someone is shown to follow you in Buzz , it does not mean they ’re your contact , or that you email frequently with them , or that you even know them .
By default anyone who finds you in Buzz can follow you .
If your competing company ’s boss is showing up on your profile it ’s not proof you ’re looking to switch offices – the other party may simply be interested in what you have to say , similar perhaps to how they might follow your RSS feed if you write a blog .
You can decide to only write private group messages in Buzz , or if you do n’t want to use it at all , you can turn off Buzz in your Gmail .
For the latter , click on “ turn off buzz ” at the bottom of Gmail .
Note though what Sam writes in the forum : “ If you turn off buzz in your Gmail account it does n’t change anything .
All your posts stay on your profile and you can still comment on things via the profile ...
It ’s literally only turning it off within Gmail . ”
( Does anyone know more about this point ? )
You can turn off having contacts be shown on your profile .
Just go to your profile settings and check off “ Display the list of people I ’m following and people following me ” .
( Note when I tried yesterday , this setting did n’t show in every account , I ’m not sure why . )
Google is already rolling out changes due to feedback , making certain privacy related issues more visible in the interface .
Per their blog post , now or soon , in the “ How do you want to appear to others ” dialog , there ’s supposed to be a checkbox reading “ Show the list of people I ’m following and the list of people following me on my public profile ” .
( Does anyone know if this is checked by default ? )
Google might have rolled out this thing too aggressively – no test phase to wait for feedback first , and already “ tens of millions of people have checked Buzz out ” , according to Google – but the speed in which they react to this is good .
In the end , since Buzz arrived you might need to be a bit more careful now when using Gmail .
Google may be aware of this trade - off but it looks like they ’re really eager to get this social network / messaging console out to casual users – remember , tons of less all - encompassing features start their life as opt -in Gmail Labs experiments where only early adopters might use them , but this one did n’t .
I think it ’ll be worth to continue closely watch privacy issues Buzz might raise .
[ Thanks MBegin and Sam ! ]

How does Sachin Tendulkar do it ?
How does a 36 - year - old cricketer stay at the top of the game for 20 years ?
How does he retain this insatiable hunger for achievement after scoring more than 30,000 runs in the long ( Test ) and shorter ( 50 over ) versions of the game ?
Cricket fans are asking these questions again after Tendulkar created history by firing the first double century in one - day internationals .
It was an unbelievable innings of brutal finesse - he smacked 25 fours and three sixes and batted just 147 balls to score 200 .
He simply toyed with South Africa 's formidable bowlers .
" Take a bow master ! " , " You little champion ! " , gasped the commentators as Tendulkar walked back to the pavilion and the crowds went delirious .
" If anybody is deserving of this feat , it is Tendulkar and nobody else , " gushed another commentator , and then ran out of words .
You are indeed lost for words trying to explain the genius , elegance and sheer power of one of the greatest cricketers ever born , but more so after his breathtaking display at Gwalior on Wednesday .
I think the best tribute to Tendulkar 's genius came from former cricketer and present day guru of cricket writing Peter Roebuck .
" Viv Richards could terrorise an attack with pitiless brutality , Lara could dissect bowlers with surgical and magical strokes , Tendulkar can take an attack apart with towering simplicity .
From the start he had an uncanny way of executing his strokes perfectly .
Tendulkar was born to bat , " he once wrote .
Tendulkar is India 's biggest icon and proudest possession - I remember the rising crescendo of noise when he walked up to receive an award in a stadium filled to the brim in Mumbai two years ago .
There were other cricket and Bollywood stars being feted that evening .
Nobody could match the reception that Tendulkar got .
If you want to know how difficult it has been for Tendulkar to become the greatest cricketer India has ever had , listen to Roebuck again :
" The runs , the majesty , the thrills , do not capture his achievement .
Reflect upon his circumstances and then marvel at his feat .
Here is a man obliged to put on disguises so that he can move around the streets , a fellow able to drive his cars only in the dead of night for fear of creating a commotion , a father forced to take his family to Iceland on holiday , a person whose entire adult life has been lived in the eye of a storm . "
It has been an incredible journey for this magician of cricket .
And he is still pulling off new tricks and hitting fresh milestones .
How does he do it ?
The best health care for the most powerful people in the world
There 's a difference between the statements " America has the best health - care system in the world " and " With enough money , you can purchase the best health care in the world in America . "
But that difference gets run over in political conversations .
Sen . John Barrasso , for instance , just mentioned that a Canadian premier recently got heart surgery in Miami .
Best health care in the world , baby !
America has about 50 million uninsured people within its borders .
Canada has exactly 13 premiers .
People should ask themselves a very simple question :
Do they think they are likelier to lose their job and fall into the health - care situation of the uninsured or become an influential politician and enjoy the health - care options available to the most powerful people in the world ?
If you 're a United States senator , America may have the best health - care in the world .
But if you 're an ordinary person with the same vulnerability to bad luck that we all have , you 're better off being in Canada , or France , or Japan , or somewhere that does n't take your insurance away when Wall Street causes the economy to crash .
Update : Sorry , I 'd written prime minister when I meant premier .
Text corrected .

CHILDREN with ADHD who use prescription drugs to manage their condition were 10 times more likely to perform poorly at school than ADHD kids who avoided medication , a new report revealed .
The Australian reports the study also found stimulant drugs such as Ritalin and dexamphetamine made no significant difference to the level of depression , self - perception and social functioning of a 14 - year - old with ADHD .
Those consistently using medication had significantly higher blood pressure at age 14 than children who had never taken drugs , a side - effect that could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke even into adulthood .
The report 's co-author , Lou Landau , said the world - first study into the long - term effects of stimulant medication on children with ADHD , to be published today , showed " drugs over the long term do n't have an impact on improving performance " .
" They do n't improve outcomes for those with ADHD , they make no difference to levels of depression , social functioning and self - perception , and for those on medication it is 10 times as likely that classroom performance will be below average , " he said .
Professor Landau , principal medical adviser to the West Australian Department of Health , which funded the research , said that was not to say drugs should never be used to treat ADHD .
" There may be some children for whom the need to manage the condition in the short term will outweigh the long - term effects . "
The report used data from the Raine Study , which has tracked the progress of more than 2800 families for two decades .
Parents of the 131 children diagnosed with ADHD under the study have provided information since the children were born .
The outcomes were measured when the children were 14 years old .

' Several of this cursed brood , getting hold of the branches behind , leaped up into the tree , whence they began to discharge their excrements on my head . "
Thus Gulliver describes his first encounter with the Yahoos .
Something similar seems to have happened to democracy .
In April , Shi Tao , a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper , was sentenced to 10 years in prison for " providing state secrets to foreign entities " .
He had passed details of a censorship order to the Asia Democracy Forum and the website Democracy News .
The pressure group Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) was mystified by the ease with which Mr Tao had been caught .
He had sent the message through an anonymous Yahoo ! account .
But the police had gone straight to his offices and picked him up .
How did they know who he was ?
Last week RSF obtained a translation of the verdict , and there they found the answer .
Mr Tao 's account information was " furnished by Yahoo Holdings " .
Yahoo ! , the document says , gave the government his telephone number and the address of his office .
So much for the promise that the internet would liberate the oppressed .
This theory was most clearly formulated in 1999 by the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman .
In his book The Lexus and the Olive Tree , Friedman argues that two great democratising forces - global communications and global finance - will sweep away any regime which is not open , transparent and democratic .
" Thanks to satellite dishes , the internet and television , " he asserts , " we can now see through , hear through and look through almost every conceivable wall .
... no one owns the internet , it is totally decentralised , no one can turn it off ...
China 's going to have a free press ...
Oh , China 's leaders do n't know it yet , but they are being pushed straight in that direction . "
The same thing , he claims , is happening all over the world .
In Iran he saw people ogling Baywatch on illegal satellite dishes .
As a result , he claims , " within a few years , every citizen of the world will be able to comparison shop between his own ... government and the one next door " .
He is partly right .
The internet at least has helped to promote revolutions of varying degrees of authenticity in Serbia , Ukraine , Georgia , Kyrgyzstan , Lebanon , Argentina and Bolivia .
But the flaw in Friedman 's theory is that he forgets the intermediaries .
The technology which runs the internet did not sprout from the ground .
It is provided by people with a commercial interest in its development .
Their interest will favour freedom in some places and control in others .
And they can and do turn it off .
In 2002 Yahoo ! signed the Chinese government 's pledge of " self - regulation " : it promised not to allow " pernicious information that may jeopardise state security " to be posted .
Last year Google published a statement admitting that it would not be showing links to material banned by the authorities on computers stationed in China .
If Chinese users of Microsoft 's internet service MSN try to send a message containing the words " democracy " , " liberty " or " human rights " , they are warned that " This message includes forbidden language .
Please delete the prohibited expression . "
A study earlier this year by a group of scholars called the OpenNet Initiative revealed what no one had thought possible : that the Chinese government is succeeding in censoring the net .
Its most powerful tool is its control of the routers - the devices through which data is moved from one place to another .
With the right filtering systems , these routers can block messages containing forbidden words .
Human - rights groups allege that western corporations - in particular Cisco Systems - have provided the technology and the expertise .
Cisco is repeatedly cited by Thomas Friedman as one of the facilitators of his global revolution .
" We had the dream that the internet would free the world , that all the dictatorships would collapse , " says Julien Pain of Reporters Without Borders .
" We see it was just a dream . "
Friedman was not the first person to promote these dreams .
In 1993 Rupert Murdoch boasted that satellite television was " an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere " .
The Economist had already made the same claim on its cover : " Dictators beware ! "
The Chinese went berserk , and Murdoch , in response , ensured that the threat did not materialise .
In 1994 he dropped BBC world news from his Star satellite feeds after it broadcast an unflattering portrait of Mao Zedong .
In 1997 he ordered his publishing house HarperCollins to drop a book by Chris Patten , the former governor of Hong Kong .
He slagged off the Dalai Lama and his son James attacked the dissident cult Falun Gong .
His grovelling paid off , and in 2002 he was able to start broadcasting into Guangdong .
" We wo n't do programmes that are offensive in China , " Murdoch 's spokesman Wang Yukui admitted .
" If you call this self - censorship then of course we 're doing a kind of self - censorship . "
I think , if they were as honest as Mr Wang , everyone who works for Rupert Murdoch , or for the corporate media anywhere in the world , would recognise these restraints .
To own a national newspaper or a television or radio station you need to be a multimillionaire .
What multimillionaires want is what everybody wants : a better world for people like themselves .
The job of their journalists is to make it happen .
As Piers Morgan , the former editor of the Mirror , confessed , " I 've made it a strict rule in life to ingratiate myself with billionaires . "
They will stay in their jobs for as long as they continue to interpret the interests of the proprietorial class correctly .
What the owners do n't enforce , the advertisers do .
Over the past few months , AdAge.com reveals , both Morgan Stanley and BP have instructed newspapers and magazines that they must remove their adverts from any edition containing " objectionable editorial coverage " .
Car , airline and tobacco companies have been doing the same thing .
Most publications can't afford to lose these accounts ; they lose the offending articles instead .
Why are the papers full of glowing profiles of the advertising boss Martin Sorrell ?
Because they 're terrified of him .
So instead of democracy we get Baywatch .
They are not the same thing .
Aspirational TV might stimulate an appetite for more money or more plastic surgery , and this in turn might encourage people to look , for better or worse , to the political systems that deliver them , but it is just as likely to be counter - democratic .
As a result of pressure from both ratings and advertisers , for example , between 1993 and 2003 environmental programmes were cleared from the schedules on BBC TV , ITV and Channel 4 .
Though three or four documentaries have slipped out since then , the ban has not yet been wholly lifted .
To those of us who have been banging our heads against this wall , it feels like censorship .
Indispensable as the internet has become , political debate is still dominated by the mainstream media : a story on the net changes nothing until it finds its way into the newspapers or on to TV .
What this means is that while the better networking Friedman celebrates can assist a democratic transition , the democracy it leaves us with is filtered and controlled .
Someone else owns the routers .
