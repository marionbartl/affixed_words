Funny , Hilarious , Stupid , Lame , Outrageous ... whatever gives me a laugh , I post it !
My most embarassing moment as a mathematician .
I 'm telling you this story not just for your entertainment but to show you that you should n't be afraid to embarass yourself ... your teacher has been much more thorough at this than you ever will be .
We get a fair number of calls from the public on mathematical issues .
Years ago I passed by the office and the secretary asked if I could answer such a question .
I said sure , and we had this conversation :
Caller : Yes ,
Hi , this is Joe of Radio XYZ .
We are on the air and we have this math contest , and there 's a question we can't answer .
Can you help us ?
Me : I 'll try .
Joe :
There 's this ladder , and it's 5 feet long , and it 's leaning against the wall and it 's bottom is 3 feet away from the wall .
At what height does it touch the wall ?
Me : Oh , that 's easy , you just use the Pythagorean Theorem .
Joe :
That 's what we thought , but just how does it work ?
Me : Well , you square 5 , that 's 25 , and you square 3 , that 's 9 , 25+9=34 , and you take the square root .
I do n't know the square root of 34 , but it 's just under 6 .
Joe :
So the ladder touches the wall at a heigh of about 6 feet ?
Me : Yes !
Joe :
That 's awfully high !
Me : Yes , but it 's just the Pythagorean Theorem .
Joe :
What 's your name ?
Me : Peter Alfeld .
Joe : Pete !
Pete , can we quote you ?
Can we say that Pete of the University of Utah Math Department says the ladder touches the wall at a height of 6 feet ?
Me : Sure !
So I hang up and realize that I just invented a five foot ladder that can reach a height of six feet .
The savings in aluminum alone ...
But I do n't remember the name of the station , so I can't call back .
Presumably my folly was broadcast over the entire Salt Lake Valley !
I avoided the streets of Salt Lake City for a few months , and to this day I make sure to mention in every course I teach that the greatest obstacle to progress in mathematics is the human inability to distinguish reliably between a plus and a minus sign .
You may have heard me pronounce that in your class !

So often , people fall into this trap .
Like the frog they get complacent : “ Benefits are good ( water is getting lukewarm ) , the company is doing well ( wow !
the water is getting warmer and comfortable ; let me take another lap ) , my bonus targets are good ( let me take more leisurely laps ) , and I will retire here and live happily there after ( internal system is almost paralyzed but I do n’t notice it ) . ”
While enjoying such perks , they fail to see that the competition ( inside and outside ) is getting intense ; and just like the poor frog , they get boiled without even noticing it .

We hear a rumor that while house hunting in Oakville , Ontario , Tori 's new husband Dean slipped and broke his neck .
Apparently they were at Oakville Trafalgar Memorial Hospital .
Bad luck for these two this month .
First her dad passes , then she gets shafted with the will and now they will have major medical bills .
If you want to help Tori , she is selling a ton of her clothes on eBay .
E ! True Hollywood Story part 2 here she comes ....
Here are pictures of Tori hard at work on the set for her thriller movie House Sitter .

Via TPM Muckraker :
What 83 year - old William Sidwell of Queen City , Missouri found in his mailbox last week scared him .
It was a letter from the Republican National Committee , but it seemed to bear grave news : " Our records show that you registered as a member of our Party in Schuyler County , MO , " the letter said .
"
But a recent audit of your Party affiliation turned up some irregularities . "
Audit ?
Irregularities ?
Was he in trouble ?
Were they threatening him ?
Sidwell went immediately to his ask his son , Dennis , a licensed public accountant , for advice .
You can see the letter , and the accompanying " Voter Registration Verification and Audit Form , " right here .
Particularly puzzling to the both of them , Dennis told me , is that his father is a life - long Democrat .
The letter , it turns out , is just a misleading pitch for a contribution to the RNC -- one of the " irregularities " cited in the letter is that " I cannot find a record of you taking a single action in support of the Republican Party -- not locally , not nationally ! " A contribution , the letter suggests , would help set the record straight .
The letter is signed by Bill Steiner , the director of the RNC's Office of Strategic Information , a title Steiner assumed at the end of July .
His responsibilities " include managing the RNC ’s national voter file and Voter Vault , the committee ’s highly touted micro-targeting operation , " Roll Call reported last month .
And indeed , the voter " audit " requests detailed information about the voter 's voting history and current opinions on the 2008 presidential race .

Fallows interviewed sixty experts ranging from the military and intelligence communities , as well as academics , members of think tanks and businesspeople , both American and foreign .
They all told him basically the same thing .
In his overview , Fallows quotes David Kilcullen , an Australian military officer who commanded the counterinsurgency efforts in East Timor , and is now a senior counter terrorism advisor at the State Department .
Kilcullen says that al - Qaeda today is actually a lot like
European anarchists in the nineteenth century .
" If you add up everyone they personally killed , it came to maybe 2,000 people , which is not an existential threat . "
But one of their number assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife .
The act itself took the lives of two people .
The unthinking response of European governments in effect started World War I .
" So because of the reaction they provoked , they were able to kill millions of people and destroy a civilization .
" It is not the people al - Qaeda might kill that is the threat , " he concluded .
" Our reaction is what can cause the damage .
It 's al - Qaeda plus our response that creates the existential danger . "
Since 9/11 , this equation has worked in al - Qaeda 's favor .
That can be reversed .
The experts , both here and abroad , agree that al - Qaeda has essentially been neutered .
" Their command structure is gone , their Afghan sanctuary is gone , their ability to move around and hold meetings is gone , their financial and communications networks have been hit hard , " says Seth Stodder , a former official in the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) .
Kilcullen says , " The al - Qaeda that existed in 2001 simply no longer exists .
In 2001 it was a relatively centralized organization , with a planning hub , a propaganda hub , a leadership team , all within a narrow geographic area .
All that is gone , because we destroyed it . "
My own take on this :
Yes we did that by going into Afganistan , a move that vritually everyone thought was the right move , including the first anti-war candidate , Howard Dean .
The problem is that we left before the job was done to focus on Iraq .
Many of Fallows experts say the same thing .
Back to Fallows .
Although bin Laden has apparently been elevated to " Che Guevara - like symbolic status , " he has become " a philosophy rather than an organization " , according to Caleb Carr , author of the The Lessons of Terror .
" It 's like the difference between Marxism and Leninism , and they 're back to just being Marx . "
This is demonstrated by the shift to " self - starter groups , " such as the ones responsible for the bombings in Madrid , Bali , London , and probably the latest group arrested in Britain .
Many of the experts that Fallows interviewed said that
the shift to these successor groups has made it significantly harder for terrorists of any provenance to achieve what all of them would like : a " second 9/11 , " a large - scale attack on the U.S. mainland that would kill hundreds or thousands of people and terrorize hundreds of millions .
So we are all still in danger from these groups , but they are closer to Tim McVeigh than to bin Laden 's al - Qaeda .
How much of this can the Department of Homeland Security take credit for .
Not much as it turns out .
According to Fallows ,
The DHS now spends $ 42 billion a year on its vast range of activities , which include FEMA and other disaster - relief efforts , the Coast Guard , immigration , and border and customs operations .
Of this , about $ 5 billion goes toward screening passengers at airports .
The widely held view among security experts is that this airport spending is largely for show .
Strengthened cockpit doors and a flying public that knows what happened on 9/11 mean that commercial airliners are highly unlikely to be used again as targeted flying bombs .
" The inspection process is mostly security theater , to make people feel safe about flying , " says John Mueller , a political scientist at Ohio State and the author of a forthcoming book about the security - industrial complex .
In order for continuing terrorism to be effective , each attack must be bigger and more terrifying than the last .
Otherwise the public will become desensitized .
But nothing short of a nuclear attack will top 9/11 .
Obviously , then we would all be much safer if the major thrust of our efforts was on countering and controlling nuclear threats .
One of the biggest mistakes , however , that Islamic terrorists have been making is thinking like terrorists , strange as this seems .
What they have done is to follow the terrorist 's logic of steadily escalating the degree of carnage and violence -- which has meant violating the guerrilla warrior 's logic of bringing the civilian population to your side .
This trade - off has not been so visible to Americans , because most of the carnage is in Iraq .
There , insurgents have slaughtered civilians daily , before and after the death this spring of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the leader of al - Qaeda in Iraq .
But since American troops are also assumed to be killing civilians , the anti-insurgent backlash is muddied .
My thoughts again : A damn good reason to bring our troops home as soon as we can .
Fallows gives examples of this principle in action .
The bombing in Jordan of three hotels killed sixty civilians -- Muslims , including 38 at a wedding .
The result was to turn the Jordanian population and government against al - Qaeda and al - Zarqawi .
Polls in Muslim countries show that while the majority are anti-American , there is little support for " al - Qaeda 's advocacy of a puritanical Islamic state . "
The greatest threat from terrorists now is the damage that they can cause us to inflict upon ourselves .
Fallows says
most people I spoke with said that three kinds of American reaction -- the war in Iraq , the economic consequences of willy - nilly spending on security , and the erosion of America 's moral authority -- were responsible for such strength as al - Qaeda now maintained .
Me again .
In other words , the ongoing " War on Terror " is far more damaging to the United States than al - Qaeda could ever be .
Our military is bogged down in an unending / unendable war .
Vast amounts of money have been squandered , wasted , and outright stolen by companies with no -bid contracts to rebuild Iraq ( which they have n't done ) , as well as by the Dept. of Homeland Security which is incapable of doing anything in an emergency ( Katrina ) except hold press conferences .
In fact Fallows says that , " nearly all ( experts ) emphasized the haphazard , wasteful , and sometimes self - defeating nature of the DHS 's approach . "
But the worst is that we have lost our moral authority in the world .
The United States is so powerful militarily that by its very nature it represents a threat to every other nation on earth .
The only country that could theoretically destroy every single other country is the United States .
The only way we can say that the U.S. is not a threat is by looking at intent , and that depends on moral authority .
If you 're not sure the United States is going to do the right thing , you can't trust it with that power , so you begin thinking , How can I balance it off and find other alliances to protect myself ?
Every time we overreact , we strengthen the terrorists .
Although the article was written before the latest arrests in Britain , our government 's reaction is exactly what bin Laden hopes for .
Mindless and meaningless increases in airport security costing more money and further undermining our ability to move freely and easily .
Four analysts -- Mueller , of Ohio State ; Lustick , of the University of Pennsylvania ; plus Veronique de Rugy , of the American Enterprise Institute ; and Benjamin Friedman , of MIT -- have written extensively about the mindlessness and perverse effects of much homeland - security spending .
In most cases , they argue , money dabbed out for a security fence here and a screening machine there would be far better spent on robust emergency - response systems .
No matter how much they spend , state and federal authorities cannot possibly protect every place from every threat .
But they could come close to ensuring that if things were to go wrong , relief and repair would be there fast .
Fallows talks about the effects of the perpetuation of a constant state of war to create a constant level of fear .
Mueller writes that " the creation of insecurity , fear , anxiety , hysteria , and overreaction is central for terrorists . "
We will probably always be the target of attacks , attacks on the scale of Oklahoma City , the Unabomer , the Tylenol poisonings , the D.C. area snipers , the anthrax mailing , school shootings , and so on .
But we need to stop looking at attacks by Islamic al - Qaeda wannabes as part of a " global war " and start dealing with them like we dealt with the above .
When we link every attack or attempted attack or plotted attack as stemming from al - Qaeda , we only strengthen bin Laden 's reputation .
Every parent knows that sometimes the best way to deal with misbehavior is to ignore it .
Fallows suggests something similar .
Not that we should ignore the al - Qaeda wannabes , but neither should we overreact .
Overreacting just gives the terrorists what they want .
Instead we should declare victory in the War on Terror , and start implementing strategies that will actually make us all safer .
Such as focusing on the threat of loose nukes .
Such as resuming our search for bin Laden .
Such as focusing more resources on securing Afghanistan .
Such as doing what we can to improve our image in the Muslim world .
After American troops brought ships , cargo planes , and helicopters loaded with supplies for tsunami victims , the overall Indonesian attitude toward the United States was still negative , but some 79 percent of Indonesians said that their opinion of America had improved because of the relief effort .
There was a similar turnaround in Pakistan after U.S. troops helped feed and rescue villagers affected by a major earthquake .
But in most of the Muslim world , the image of American troops is that of soldiers or marines manning counterinsurgency patrols , not delivering food and water .
" The diplomatic component of the war on terror has been neglected so long , it 's practically vestigial , " a Marine officer told me .
" It needs to be regrown . "
Mostly , however , Fallows believes that we need a leader who will " keep the dangers in perspective . "
Unlike the ones we have now , who use every incident really or manufactured , as an excuse to spend more money , increase the level of fear , and undermine our basic rights and freedoms .
And my final thoughts :
Of course they use every incident to try to increase the level of fear , since that is how they hope to stay in power .
We must find a simple way to explain all this and to make it clear that Bush 's " War on Terror " is not only being used as political manipulation , but it is actually increasing our danger from terrorists .
Or so it seems to me .
Earlier ice melt could disrupt the area 's ecosystems , the study says
Ice in north - east Greenland is melting an average of 14.6 days earlier than in the mid-1990s , bringing forward the date plants flower and birds lay eggs .
The team warned that the observed changes could disrupt the region 's ecosystems and food chain , affecting the long - term survival of some species .
The findings have been published in the journal Current Biology .
The scientists assessed how a range of species ' behaviour was affected by the changing climate in Zackenberg , north - east Greenland , between 1996 and 2005 .
Observation of 21 species - six plants , 12 arthropods and three birds - revealed that the organisms had brought forward their flowering , emergence or egg - laying in line with the earlier ice melt .
" We were particularly surprised to see the trends were so strong when considering that the entire summer is very short in the High Arctic - just three or four months from snowmelt to freeze - up , " said co-author Toke Hoye , from the University of Aarhus .
" The real deciding factor is that each individual time series has a very close correlation , so it is not just that the average trend is very similar but each species is closely coupled ( to the ice melt ) . "
Winner and losers
Dr Hoye suggested that the warming in the region , which was occurring at twice the rate of the global average , could affect the future stability of the region 's ecosystem .
" At first , this could be regarded as a positive result because it is extending the summer season , which is probably a factor in terms of organisms getting through their development .
" Over the long term , it is most likely to be the case that species from southern latitudes will be able to establish themselves ( in the region ) and increase competition for food . "
Dr Hoye acknowledged that the 10 - year period could be considered by some people as not long enough to reach these conclusions .
But he added the changes in behaviour had been observed in a large number of species , and that the findings were considered by independent reviewers who were satisfied by the consistency of the results .
" They had hoped for a longer time period , and we did too , " he told BBC News .
" But until we have managed to gather another 10 years of data , it is relevant to make this point now . "
He added that the findings , described as the first of their kind for the High Arctic , extended the global picture of changing behaviour among organisms .
In August , scientists from 17 nations examined 125,000 studies involving 561 species across Europe .
The researchers found a shift in the continent 's seasons , with spring arriving an average of six to eight days earlier than it did 30 years ago .
Sunnyvale , CA - Fred Munk yesterday lost his job for excessive perl programming .
Munk was hired for categorization and review of links to pornographic websites for Yahoo's Erotica department .
He allegedly spent more time programming perl - scripts than looking for porn .
" He was fired for gross laziness " reports Diane Vice , Yahoo's Director of Consumer Porn .
" I mean , it 's okay to use company resources for fun stuff for fifteen minutes after lunch , to stimulate digestion by whipping up some nifty regular expression or obfuscating the break - condition in a for - loop , but this Munk - guy has a serious productivity problem .
I told him get some professional help , but Fred did n't listen and continued to churn out code during work hours -- compulsively , obsessively , just sick ! "
Munk responded , " I 'd be pounding out some hot code and then the boss would come by and I 'd have to quickly switch to Jenna Jameson taking it from behind .
I needed quick fingers , but I was n't quick enough .
She kept catching me with Emacs open . "
Munk contends that his programming was for the good of Yahoo , and that surfing porn was a " snoozefest .
The first hacker 's rule is :
Do n't waste your time with boring stuff .
And what 's more depressing and pathetic than browsing through tits , legs , twats and kink all day ?
Nothing gets me more excited than shooting out lines of code . "
Vice suggested Munk spend less time coding back ends and more time looking at them several times during his tenure .
" He would n't listen .
Finally , I had security check his hard drive and there were megs upon megs of perl code - search functions , text parsers , it was sickening .
That was the last straw , we do n't need perl divers in the Erotica category we need muff divers .
Adios Mr. Munk . "

It 's such a tremendously bad idea that it 's almost bound to succeed .
Microsoft has filed another patent , this one for an " advertising framework " that uses " context data " from your hard drive to show you advertisements and " apportion and credit advertising revenue " to ad suppliers in real time .
Yes , Redmond wants to own the patent on the mother of all adware .
The application , filed in 2006 , describes a multi-faceted , robust ad - delivering system that lives on a " user computer , whether it 's part of the OS , an application or integrated within applications . "
" Applications , tools , or utilities may use an application program interface to report context data tags such as key words or other information that may be used to target advertisements , " says the filing .
" The advertising framework may host several components for receiving and processing the context data , refining the data , requesting advertisements from an advertising supplier , for receiving and forwarding advertisements to a display client for presentation , and for providing data back to the advertising supplier . "
The adware framework would leave almost no data untouched in its quest to sell you stuff .
It would inspect " user document files , user e-mail files , user music files , downloaded podcasts , computer settings , computer status messages ( e.g. , a low memory status or low printer ink ) , " and more .
How could we have been so blind as to not see the marketing value in computer status messages ?
The software would also free advertising from its traditional browser yoke .
" A word processor may display a banner ad along the top of a window , similar to a toolbar , while a graphical ad may be displayed in a frame associated with the application .
A digital editor for photos or movies may support video - based advertisements , " the patent application says .
The patent application , first unearthed by InformationWeek , gives the impression that your software would have more control over the advertising than you would .
" An e-mail client may specify that ads from competitors must be excluded , that its own display client must be used ... ( that ) no more than 4 ads per hour are allowed , and that only text or graphical ... advertisements are supported . "
The patent makes no mention of any method by which an actual user might exert control , nor does it mention very real privacy or security concerns .
That 's okay .
It 's still a good thing .
It says so right in the application : " The ability to derive and process context data from local sources rather than monitor interactions with a remote entity , such as a server , benefits both consumers and advertisers by delivering more tightly targeted advertisements .
The benefit to the user is the perception that the ads are more relevant , and therefore , less of an interruption .
The benefit to the advertiser is better focus and a higher chance of conversion to a sale . "
The patent is a fascinating exercise in advertising delivery systems .
But surely that 's all it is — an exercise .
No way anyone would ever actually make a thing like this .

In the emergency room at Martin Luther King Jr. - Harbor Hospital , Edith Isabel Rodriguez was seen as a complainer .
“ Thanks a lot , officers , ” an emergency room nurse told Los Angeles County police who brought in Rodriguez early May 9 after finding her in front of the Willowbrook hospital yelling for help .
“ This is her third time here . ”
The 43 - year - old mother of three had been released from the emergency room hours earlier , her third visit in three days for abdominal pain .
She ’d been given prescription medication and a doctor ’s appointment .
Turning to Rodriguez , the nurse said , “ You have already been seen , and there is nothing we can do , ” according to a report by the county office of public safety , which provides security at the hospital .

Parked in the emergency room lobby in a wheelchair after police left , she fell to the floor .
She lay on the linoleum , writhing in pain , for 45 minutes , as staffers worked at their desks and numerous patients looked on .
Aside from one patient who briefly checked on her condition , no one helped her .
A janitor cleaned the floor around her as if she were a piece of furniture .
A closed - circuit camera captured everyone ’s apparent indifference .
Arriving to find Rodriguez on the floor , her boyfriend unsuccessfully tried to enlist help from the medical staff and county police -- even a 911 dispatcher , who balked at sending rescuers to a hospital .
Alerted to the “ disturbance ” in the lobby , police stepped in -- by running Rodriguez ’s record .
They found an outstanding warrant and prepared to take her to jail .
She died before she could be put into a squad car .

How Rodriguez came to die at a public hospital , without help from the many people around her , is now the subject of much public hand - wringing .
The county chief administrative office has launched an investigation , as has the Sheriff ’s Department homicide division and state and federal health regulators .
The triage nurse involved has resigned , and the emergency room supervisor has been reassigned .
Additional disciplinary actions could come this week .
The incident has brought renewed attention to King - Harbor , a long - troubled hospital formerly known as King / Drew .
The Times reconstructed the last 90 minutes of Rodriguez ’s life based on accounts by three people who have seen the confidential videotape , a detailed police report , interviews with relatives and an account of the boyfriend ’s 911 call .

“ I am completely dumbfounded , ” said county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky , who has seen the video recording .
“ It ’s an indictment of everybody , ” he said .
“ If this woman was in pain , which she appears to be , if she was writhing in pain , which she appears to be , why did nobody bother ... to take the most minimal interest in her , in her welfare ?
It ’s just shocking .
It really is . ”
The story of Rodriguez ’s demise began at 12:34 a.m. when two county police officers received a radio call of a “ female down ” and yelling for help near the front entrance of King - Harbor , according to the police report .
When they approached Rodriguez to ask what was wrong , she responded in a “ loud and belligerent voice that her stomach was hurting , ” the report states .
She said she had 10 gallstones and that one of them had burst .

A staff member summoned by the police arrived with a wheelchair and rolled her into the emergency room .
Among her belongings , one officer found her latest discharge slip from the hospital , which instructed her to “ return to ER if nausea , vomit , more pain or any worse . ”
When the officers talked to the emergency room nurse , she “ did not show any concern ” for Rodriguez , the police report said .
The report identifies the nurse as Linda Witland , but county officials confirmed that her name is Linda Ruttlen , who began working for the county in July 1992 .
Ruttlen could not be reached for comment .
During that initial discussion with Ruttlen , Rodriguez slipped off her wheelchair onto the floor and curled into a fetal position , screaming in pain , the report said .

Ruttlen told her to “ get off the floor and onto a chair , ” the police report said .
Two officers and a different nurse helped her back to the wheelchair and brought her close to the reception counter , where a staff member asked her to remain seated .
The officers left and Rodriguez again pitched forward onto the floor , apparently unable to get up , according to people who saw the videotape and spoke on the condition of anonymity .
Because the tape does not have sound , it is not possible to determine whether Rodriguez was screaming or what she was saying , the viewers said .
Because of the camera ’s angle , in most scenes , she is but a grainy blob , sometimes obstructed , moving around on the floor .
When Rodriguez ’s boyfriend , Jose Prado , returned to the hospital after an errand and saw her on the floor , he alerted nurses and then called 911 .

According to Sheriff ’s Capt .
Ray
Peavy , the dispatcher said , “ Look , sir , it indicates you ’re already in a hospital setting .
We cannot send emergency equipment out there to take you to a hospital you ’re already at . ”
Prado then knocked on the door of the county police , near the emergency room , and said , “ My girlfriend needs help and they do n’t want to help her , ” according to the police report .
A sergeant told him to consult the medical staff , the report said .
Minutes later , Prado came back to the sergeant and said , “ They do n’t want to help her . ”
Again , he was told to see the medical staff .
Within minutes , police began taking Rodriguez into custody .
When they told Prado that there was a warrant for Rodriguez ’s arrest , he asked if she would get medical care wherever she was taken .
They assured him that she would .
He then kissed her and left , the police report said .
She was wheeled to the patrol vehicle and the door was opened so that she could get into the back .
When officers asked her to get up , she did not respond .
An officer tried to revive her with an ammonia inhalant , then checked for a pulse and found none .
She died in the emergency room after resuscitation efforts failed .

According to preliminary coroner ’s findings , the cause was a perforated large bowel , which caused an infection .
Experts say the condition can bring about death fairly suddenly .
Hours after her death , county Department of Health Services spokesman Michael Wilson sent a note informing county supervisors ’ offices about the incident but saying that that police had been called because Rodriguez ’s boyfriend became disruptive .
Health services Director Dr. Bruce Chernof said Friday that subsequent information showed Prado was not , in fact , disruptive .
Chernof otherwise refused to comment , citing the open investigation , patient privacy and “ other issues . ”
Peavy , who supervises the sheriff ’s homicide unit , said that although his investigation is not complete , “ the county police did absolutely , absolutely nothing wrong as far as we ’re concerned . ”

The coroner ’s office may relay its final findings to the district attorney ’s office for consideration of criminal charges against hospital staff members , Peavy said .
“ I ca n’t speak for the coroner and I ca n’t speak for the D.A. , but that is certainly a possibility , ” he added .
Marcela Sanchez , Rodriguez ’s sister , said she has been making tamales and selling them to raise money for her sister ’s funeral and burial .
Her family has been called by attorneys seeking to represent them , but they do not know whom to trust .
She said the latest revelations , which she learned from The Times , are very troubling .
Advertisement
“ Wow , ” she said .
“ If she was on the floor for that long , how in the heck did nobody help her then ?
“ Where was their heart ?
Where was their humanity ?
...
When Jose came in , everybody was just sitting , looking .
Where were they ? ”
Sanchez said her sister was a giving person who always took an interest in people in need , unlike those who watched her suffer .
“ She would have taken her shoes to give to somebody with no shoes , ” she said .
Rodriguez , a California native , performed odd jobs and lived alternately with different relatives .
David Janssen , the county ’s chief administrative officer , said the incident is being taken very seriously .
In a rare move , his office took over control of the inquiry from the county health department and the office of public safety .
Advertisement
“ There ’s no excuse -- and I do n’t think anybody believes that there is , ” Janssen said .
Over the last 3 1/2 years , King - Harbor has reeled from crisis to crisis .
Based on serious patient - care lapses , it has lost its national accreditation and federal funding .
Hundreds of staff members have been disciplined and services cut .
Janssen said he was concerned that the incident would divert attention from preparing the hospital for a crucial review in six weeks that is to determine whether it can regain federal funding .
Advertisement
If the hospital fails , it could be forced to close .
“ It certainly is n’t going to help , ” Janssen said .
At the same time , he said , the preliminary investigation suggests that the fault primarily rests with the nurse who resigned .
“ I think it ’s a tragic , tragic incident , but it ’s not a systemic one . ”
Supervisor Gloria Molina , who had n’t seen the videotape , said she was n’t sure the hospital had reformed .
Advertisement
“ What ’s so discouraging and disappointing for me is that it seems that this hospital at this point in time has n’t really transformed itself -- and I ’m worried about it , ” she said .
Supervisor Mike Antonovich said he believed care had improved at the hospital overall , but added , “ It ’s unconscionable that anyone would ignore a patient in obvious distress . ”
Rodriguez ’s son , Edmundo , 25 , said he still could n’t understand why his mother died .
“ It ’s more than negligence .
I ca n’t even think of the word . ”
His 24 - year - old sister , Christina , said , “ It just makes it so much harder to grieve .
It ’s so painful . ”

With their peculiar and unwieldy antennae , the first TV detector vans were the stuff of science - fiction B movies .
And the myths that sprung up surrounding their supposed powers were also worthy of Hollywood .
But the latest weapon in the battle against licence - fee dodgers is a green torch - like device weighing less than 1lb – and it really does work , with frightening efficiency .

The hand - held detector linked to a set of headphones beeps if an operating TV is inside a radius of 29ft .
It means licensing officers can now target places previously inaccessible by cumbersome vans , such as homes in very remote areas and individual flats in blocks .

Kate Fisher , of TV Licensing , said that the new detectors will work alongside existing vans ' to enhance an already effective enforcement operation ' .
She added : ' The message is clear .
We have the technology to ensure that anyone watching TV without a valid licence can and should expect a visit , wherever they live .
' The vans these days are designed to be discreet , whereas in the old days they were more obvious .
There is much more focus on being covert and the hand - held device is a logical extension of that trend .
' We tend to work undercover more than in the past .
Any van in the street could be a TV detector van these days .
We are definitely catching evaders off their guard . '

More than 25 million of Britain 's total of 28 million homes do have a licence .
But around 1,000 evaders were caught each day last year and 214,000 have already been nabbed in 2007 .
And it is estimated that 1.4 million viewers are still getting away with not paying the £ 135.50 colour licence – prompting authorities to develop their new weapon .
It is only within the past 15 years that vans have worked with real effectiveness , helped by on - board computers that can check licence details in seconds .
And while older vans had only one way of picking up a signal , modern models have multiple methods .
Unsurprisingly , London had the most cheats last year with 55,287 , followed by Glasgow ( 20,390 ) , Birmingham ( 10,743 ) , Manchester ( 9,130 ) and Liverpool ( 7,634 ) .
Britain 's first detector van hit the streets in 1926 to catch radio listeners without a compulsory ten shilling licence – beginning the culture of a bogeyman figure with all - seeing powers .

A quarter of a century later television viewers became a target for the first time when the radio and TV licences were merged in 1952 .
By 1955 , fleets of new Hillman vans with twirling antennae were on the roads – stepping up the game of cat and mouse with viewers who refused to pay up .
The Commer van , Britain 's longest - serving TV detector vehicle , went into service in 1968 and heralded the age of putting downright fear into the public .
A classic public information film in 1970 summed up the approach .
A bespectacled man in a tweed suit twiddles controls in his van as it crawls along a suburban street .
Suddenly , he exclaims triumphantly : ' Yes , there 's a TV set on at No 5 .
It 's in the front room – and they are watching Columbo . '
The excitement is palpable .
The Commer survived until 1983 and TV Licensing now uses more low - key Volkswagen Transporters .
Excuses officers report hearing on doorsteps have included : ' I do n't watch it .
It 's on for my dog .
He watches it , but I 'm not paying for him ' , and , ' That 's not a TV you can hear in the background .
It 's a tape of adverts I play to entertain the children . '

That 's funny .
I 've lived here all my life and I do n't even consider a jacket unless it 's below 60 and windy .
I 'll go down to a high in the low 50s without one if it 's supposed to be calm and sunny .
Bigger coat at low 40s .
Hat at freezing .
Gloves in the 20s .

Neil Peart and Terry Bozzio were / are the only drummers who ever truly compelled me to pay attention .
I can take or leave the Kansas City Chiefs , but I love having a front - row seat for Patrick Mahomes ' career .

Is the Nation 's Marijuana Policy Misguided ?
Critics Contend the Government Is Fighting Pot at the Expense of Battling Meth
Since the Marijuana Tax Act — the first anti-marijuana federal law — was signed by President Roosevelt 70 years ago Thursday , the debate over the drug 's effects , dangers and criminalization has raged unabated .
The Bush administration has made marijuana its prime target in the war on drugs , spending billions of dollars on education campaigns and law enforcement activities .
Critics , however , contend that the war on pot has allowed for the proliferation of other more dangerous drugs like methamphetamine and crack cocaine .
Unsurprisingly , much of the criticism of federal law comes from pro-marijuana lobbying groups that believe the drug should , in some instances , be decriminalized .
More surprisingly , however , is criticism from politicians and law enforcement officers , in areas ravaged by meth use , who say the government 's war on marijuana is being fought at the expense of the battle to rid the country of methamphetamine .
As security at the nation 's borders tightens , more marijuana busts are related to domestic growing operations — illicit businesses that are increasingly hidden in suburban homes , called " grow houses . "
A spate of large - scale busts in recent months from South Carolina to California has allowed John Walters , director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , to reiterate the government 's position that marijuana is extremely dangerous and a gateway to more deadly drugs .
There were 322,438 kilos of marijuana seized in federal operations in 2006 , up from 283,344 the previous year .
" Marijuana is the only illegal drug where we have to try and explain to people that what we 've found , and what the statistics [ show ] and what the consequences are , are worse than they think , " Walters told ABC News .
" Nobody thinks [ methamphetamine ] is a soft drug .
Nobody talks about heroin or cocaine as ' OK , we can just tolerate it . ' "
" We understand the disease of addiction in a way nobody understood it in the 1970s , the 1960s , even the early 1980s , " Walters said .
" Science , investments in brain imaging , and millions and millions of dollars of study have helped us understand what happens here . "
It is just those sorts of statements that rile marijuana advocates .
The effects of marijuana pale in comparison to the dangers of other drugs and federal policy , they say , should reflect those dangers .
" The folks running drug policy in the Bush White House are pretty clearly obsessed with marijuana , " Bruce Mirken , director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project , told ABC News .
" Officials from ONDCP [ Office of National Drug Control Policy ] have more than once said it is the most dangerous substance .
It is , however , vastly less dangerous than drugs like methamphetamine . "
" Marijuana is mildly toxic compared to most recreational and pharmaceutical drugs , and yet there has been this all out demonization , " Mirken said .
Senator and Police Want Action on Meth
Perhaps the most surprising critic of the Bush administration 's marijuana policy is Sen.
Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa .
Grassley is chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control .
In 2005 , he sent a letter to the White House , urging the Bush administration to spend resources to combat meth rather than marijuana .
" While we agree that any drug use is harmful to users and those around them , the problems associated with marijuana are not comparable to methamphetamine in terms of cost to society , " Grassley wrote to Walters .
" We know that different drugs have different rates of use .
Marijuana is a much more popular drug in terms of the number of people who use it , " Grassley wrote .
" However , methamphetamine causes much more destruction in a much shorter period of time than marijuana . "
" We believe that reducing drug use is not just about reducing the number of users of a drug , but reducing the overall harm to society caused by the drug . "
Iowa has been one of the states hardest hit by methamphetamine .
Local police say more money and manpower is needed to fight meth and not marijuana .
" Marijuana is old news , " said Bob Doran , a spokesman for the Iowa Association of Chiefs of Police and Peace Officers .
Doran dismissed the ONDCP claim that marijuana is a gateway drug that leads people to harder , more deadly drugs .
" The longtime argument has been that marijuana is the first step into drug use , but I think that argument has gone by the wayside , " Doran said .
" We 're finding many kids skipping the pot and going straight to meth . "
Doran added that meth was particularly dangerous , not only because of the effects on the user , but from the dangers created in its production .
" With marijuana , we 're concerned with sale and use , not the manufacture .
The toxic effects are nowhere near those of meth production . "
The federal government , for its part , maintains that fighting meth and fighting marijuana are two separate battles .
The money and resources used to combat marijuana is different from those used to fight meth .
" All the criticism of policy winds up being a grab bag of ideas and conspiracies , " said Tom Riley , an ONDCP spokesman .
" It is an interesting public policy discussion , but what does that discussion have to do with local law enforcement ? " asked Riley .
" The money used to go after heroin in Afghanistan is n't the same money used to go after marijuana , and the money for marijuana is n't the same money needed to go after meth . "
Is Pot Really a Gateway Drug ?
The ONDCP , which sets the nation 's drug policies , is literally an office in the White House .
Some experts have raised questions about the impartiality of an office so linked to the politics of the executive branch .
" The ONDCP is not a neutral office that rationally evaluates the drug war , " said Matthew Robinson , a criminal justice professor at Appalachian State University , and co-author of " Lies , Damned Lies , and Drug War Statistics : A Critical Analysis of Claims Made by the Office of National Drug Control Policy . "
After examining the office 's annual national drug control policy report for seven years , Robinson said he " found a consistent effort to manipulate data to make marijuana seem more dangerous than it really is . "
Robinson added that when crunching ONDCP 's numbers , he found inconsistencies , claims that did not jibe with the office 's data , manipulation of statistics , reliance on anecdotal evidence and a failure to recognize other independent research .
" What they say simply does n't match reality , " Robinson said .
" They claim it 's a gateway drug . —
They say we have to stop people from using marijuana . —
But the vast majority of marijuana users do n't go on to use harder drugs .
The typical drug user uses marijuana for a few months and then gets over it . "
" People who go on to other drugs start with alcohol and tobacco , not marijuana .
They can't say that , because then people would question why they 're going after marijuana . "
The ONDCP says it expects people to come after it , challenge its research and accuse it of playing politics for one simple reason : People like to get high .
" There are lots of people who are not enthusiastic about drug policy , " said Riley .
" There are 15 [ million ] to 20 million marijuana users in the U.S. , and they do n't like the idea that their drug is illegal . "
" Everyone knows meth is really bad and coke is really bad , " said Riley , " but marijuana is a more serious drug than most people realize .
But , there is n't an activist group that is pro meth or pro heroine . "
Books emit gases , including acids , when they decompose
Books emit a complex mixture of organic compounds , including volatile acids , when they start to decompose .
Researchers in the university library will test the same gases to see which of its millions of volumes are at risk .
The aim is to improve the way the books are stored and develop a system to alert librarians when decaying books begin to produce destructive acids .
By sampling the air in different parts of the library , researchers hope to identify areas with a high acid content .
Air tested
The books can then be treated before further decay sets in .
The theory is that even a modern text will degrade faster if it is stored in an area with older , " smellier " books .
During the first stage of the project , researchers are comparing copies of the same texts in different libraries , to see how the various ways they have been stored might have affected their condition .
Then , samples of the air in different parts of the libraries will be tested to measure the quantity of acid that is being produced .
The results of the study are due to be published in 2009 .
Ways of reducing acid in storage , including specific filters in the air conditioning which could remove organic materials in the atmosphere , may be considered .
This could also prove controversial for those who prefer the smell of the old library .
When they are European Military exercises .
The European Council has announced its second military exercise “ MILEX07 ” which will run from June 7 - 15 .
The key point to note , “ No troops will be deployed ” .
It appears that there is big trouble in Alisia .
Friction between the Transitional Government of Alisia and a rebel group ( National Freedom Movement ) has caused aid to be blocked from refugee camps in the North West of Alisia .
The UN , though on the ground is incapable of saving the day .
So what would any sensible person do ?
Ask for the EU ’s Integrated Police Unit – “ a synthesis of military attitude and police capability , ” based on the Italian Caribinieri , but with Hungary , Austria , Slovenia , Romania , Dutch and Turkish troops .
( Hold on did I read that right Turkish military ? )
Only they do n’t , because they do n’t ( yet ) have the capacity .
According to the press release , “ The exercise will be conducted in Brussels ( EU OpsCentre ) and in Enköping ( EU FHQ ) .
Some 200 " players " and supporting personnel are expected to take part ” .
So despite the trouble in Alisia , rather than deploy the “ force up to 2000 personnel including an Integrated Police Unit ( IPU ) , temporarily placed under military responsibility ” .
A crowd of people in Brussels and Sweden will talk about the situation under the control of Lt Gen David Leakey .
Interestingly Alisia seems to bear a striking resemblance to Darfur , which as EU Referendum pointed out , according to a Reuters report , “ France is asking its European Union partners to consider sending a force of up to 12,000 troops to Chad to provide aid for people fleeing the Darfur conflict in Sudan ” .
And so it goes on .
If you have n't yet read the first two installments ( 1 , 2 ) of the Washington Post 's four part series on Dick Cheney 's role in the Bush administration , go read them now .
They 're incredible .
Barton Gellman and Jo Becker do an excellent job telling the behind - the - scenes story of how the Bush administration 's various terrorism - related policies came into being .
The articles confirm much of what has been suspected about Cheney 's role and fill in many of the gaps .
It 's riveting stuff , and deeply disturbing .
There 's enough stuff in the first two installments alone to fill 100 blog posts , easily .
But since I do n't have that kind of time , I want to focus on a few meta - observations .
(1) Conspicuously absent from nearly every important scene described in these articles is the President himself .
Time and again we see the Vice President making decisions , attending meetings , and handling situations that really should be handled by the President personally .
We also see the Vice President continually limiting or otherwise manipulating the information and advice that reaches the President 's ear .
We see him secretly intercepting memos intended for other cabinet officials , keeping key officials out of the loop on important decisions , and using other officials to disguise the provenance of advice originating from his office .
The portrait that emerges is of a man with utter disdain for process and an almost messianic certainty in his beliefs , a man who has used his immense knowledge of the workings of the executive bureaucracy and his close relationship with a pliant , inexperienced president to effectively control national policy on all issues related to the " war on terror " for the last six years .
Cheney really is the man behind the curtain .
(2) If you read between the lines in part two of the series , it seems pretty clear that Dick Cheney himself bears enormous responsibility for what happened at Abu Ghraib :
Shortly after the first accused terrorists reached the U.S. naval prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , on Jan. 11 , 2002 , a delegation from CIA headquarters arrived in the Situation Room .
The agency presented a delicate problem to White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales , a man with next to no experience on the subject .
Vice President Cheney 's lawyer , who had a great deal of experience , sat nearby .
The meeting marked " the first time that the issue of interrogations comes up " among top- ranking White House officials , recalled John C. Yoo , who represented the Justice Department .
" The CIA guys said , ' We 're going to have some real difficulties getting actionable intelligence from detainees ' " if interrogators confined themselves to humane techniques allowed by the Geneva Conventions .
From that moment , well before previous accounts have suggested , Cheney turned his attention to the practical business of crushing a captive 's will to resist .
The vice president 's office played a central role in shattering limits on coercion in U.S. custody , commissioning and defending legal opinions that the Bush administration has since portrayed as the initiatives , months later , of lower - ranking officials .
Cheney and his allies , according to more than two dozen current and former officials , pioneered a novel distinction between forbidden " torture " and permitted use of " cruel , inhuman or degrading " methods of questioning .
Later in the piece they write :
The vice president 's counsel proposed that President Bush issue a carefully ambiguous directive .
Detainees would be treated " humanely and , to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity , in a manner consistent with the principles of " the Geneva Conventions .
When Bush issued his public decision two weeks later , on Feb. 7 , 2002 , he adopted Addington 's formula -- with all its room for maneuver -- verbatim .
In a radio interview last fall , Cheney said , " We do n't torture . "
What he did not acknowledge , according to Alberto J. Mora , who served then as the Bush - appointed Navy general counsel , was that the new legal framework was designed specifically to leave room for cruelty .
In international law , Mora said , cruelty is defined as " the imposition of severe physical or mental pain or suffering . "
He added : " Torture is an extreme version of cruelty . "
The piece then describes how David Addington , Cheney 's lawyer , worked with John Yoo to draft a pair of secret memos on the use of torture .
The first " narrowed the definition of ' torture ' to mean only suffering ' equivalent in intensity ' to the pain of ' organ failure ..... or even death . ' "
The second memo approved a laundry list of " enhanced techniques " including waterboarding .
According to Gellman and Becker , neither Condoleezza Rice nor Colin Powell knew that such memos existed until it was reported by the Washington Post in 2004 , an event which prompted an intense confrontation between Rice and Alberto Gonzales .
But here 's where the link to Abu Ghraib comes in .
According the article :
[ John ]
Yoo said for the first time in an interview that he verbally warned lawyers for the president , Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld that it would be dangerous as a matter of policy to permit military interrogators to use the harshest techniques , because the armed services , vastly larger than the CIA , could overuse the tools or exceed the limits .
" I always thought that only the CIA should do this , but people at the White House and at DOD felt differently , " Yoo said .
The migration of those techniques from the CIA to the military , and from Guantanamo Bay to Abu Ghraib , aroused worldwide condemnation when abuse by U.S. troops was exposed .
In other words , the people who were championing the use of these new ( illegal ) interrogation techniques were specifically warned that if military interrogators were permitted to use them , it would be difficult to contain the spread of such practices and abuse was likely .
In the best case , these warnings were disregarded , the techniques migrated , and the result was Abu Ghraib .
In the worst case ( which I suspect is more likely ) , the use of these enhanced techniques was affirmatively encouraged in all military theatres , not just Guantanamo , and the result was Abu Ghraib .
Either way , the Office of the Vice President is directly responsible for stripping away the clear rules that had previously existed regarding the treatment of military detainees , a move that set the stage for what would later happen at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere .
(3) Another meta - theme that emerges from the articles is how utterly self - destructive Cheney 's legal crusades have been .
Time and again you see smart lawyers within the administration ( often ones who agree with Cheney substantively ) warning him that the courts are n't going to accept certain arguments , and time and again you see Cheney ignoring this advice and insisting that the administration plow ahead .
In every case , the courts ended up rejecting Cheney 's views , and in the exact way the administration 's own lawyers had predicted .
As Bruce Fein , who is quoted in the piece , says :
" The irony with the Cheney crowd pushing the envelope on presidential power is that the president has now ended up with lesser powers than he would have had if they had made less extravagant , monarchical claims . "
That 's unquestionably true .
The legal positions that Cheney demanded the administration take were so audacious and unsupportable that they essentially forced the courts to step in and rebuke the administration , thereby creating important legal precedents in areas where none previously existed .
Had the administration adopted positions that were aggressive but not insane , the courts would likely have been more deferential .
That 's all I 've got for now , but like I said , there 's a lot of stuff in these articles that is worth examining in more depth , and I hope to do so as time permits .
DIGG THIS
If you fancy losing an argument , try shooting down my contention that Mikhail Gorbachev is the leading historical figure of our time .
Not one to miss a shooting opportunity , Dick Cheney tried .
To my surprise , he won .
Westerners fondly remember Gorbachev for finishing off an ailing Soviet empire left bleeding from its Afghan travails .
Defusing half a century of nuclear tension can leave a mark on impressionable minds .
On Cheney ’s — not so much .
The former Defense Secretary had a tender spot for the Cold War and never forgave Gorbachev for ending it with not even a kind word for defense contractors .
Cheney is the quintessential warrior , with plenty of dead quails and birdshot - peppered lawyers to prove it .
He is the gallant hussar — one day greenlighting " Shock and Awe " to give Guernica a second chance ; the next day apprising US Senator Pat Leahy of his favorite sexual technique : " F**k yourself ! " ( 1 ) Quite the martial wag , the man Maureen Dowd calls Big - Time Dick saluted the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 by persuading his boss to invade Panama ( for reasons no one seems able to remember ) .
And today it is anybody ’s guess which Caribbean island the United States will invade to celebrate its victory in Iraq .
Dick Cheney is a man of war , and a man on a mission : a crusader who wo n’t rest until the name Bush Jr is etched in the history books — not lost in the microscopic print of the endnotes section , mind you , as is destined to be Senior ’s fate , but glowing in the radiant typeface of a chapter heading .
That mission , for once , is all but accomplished .
In January of 2001 , George W. Bush took — er , grabbed — the reins of an American Empire at its zenith .
He will soon hand back a smoldering wreckage of broken lives , enduring hatred , and vanished influence .
Michael Ignatieff has called Pax Americana Empire Lite .
(2) A better phrase would be Empire Short - Lived , or , if you ’re William F. Buckley Jr and the vernacular ruffles your literary feathers , Imperium Brevissimum .
At a recent ceremony for his son Jeb , George H. W. Bush was caught on national television sobbing uncontrollably .
Pity the man who stands one short letter away from the worst president in US history .
The letter is H , as in H for hubris .
" We ’re winning ! " exulted Bush last October .
(3) Well … actually , " We ’re not winning , " he clarified a few weeks later , but " We ’re not losing " either .
(4) So " We ’re wosing , " quipped the Guardian ’s cartoonist Steve Bell .
Indeed , we are ; and for you , Mr President , I shall count the wosing ways .
" You smug - faced crowds with kindling eye Who cheer when soldier lads march by , Sneak home and pray you ’ll never know The hell where youth and laughter go . " — Siegfried Sassoon
Somewhere , deep in the cold , worm - infested soil that a mother will keep watered by tears , lies one of 3,000 young Americans .
(5) Dispersed across the land , thousands more will forever carry the scars of war in their battered bodies and hollowed souls , mutants battling hellish shadows and silent phantoms .
And the Iraqis , yes those , Mr President , see them spiral into Dante ’s lower rings of hell , as they join the fastest - growing sect in the land : the dead — hundreds of thousands strong .
(6) Watch the White Man ’s Burden devolve into an orgy of torture and mayhem .
( Has it ever devolved into anything else ? )
The words Abu Ghraib , Guantánamo , detainee bill , and extraordinary rendition are seared in the world ’s consciousness as the badges of shame of a democracy gone mad .
According to Pew ’s most recent " Global Opinion " survey , " anti-Americanism is deeper and broader now than at any time in modern history . "
( 7 ) The war effort ’s claim on the US treasury will soon exceed $ 600 billion : more than Vietnam ; ( 4 ) more than all the money ever spent on cancer research ; ( 8 ) more than enough to " race for the cure " all the way to Alpha Centauri .
We ’re wosing big , Mr President .
Historians will ponder how one gangly caveman and nineteen scrawny associates turned America into the land of the kind - of - free ( 53rd freest press in the world , tied with Botswana ( 9 ) ) and the home of the petrified .
The sons and daughters of the nation that stood up to Hitler and Tojo now file through airport security barefoot , much as they would walk , shoeless , into a mosque — a mosque , they pray , empty of Muslims .
Cravenness is bigotry ’s favorite nourishment , and cynics might expect the political class to gorge on it by blaming our imperial agony on the natives .
In America , today , cynics rarely go wrong ; and the air , indeed , is thick with talk of fainthearted hordes of Mesopotamian ingrates , who quail at the latest bombing and wail at the moon in exotic garb .
Not long ago , the achingly earnest Nicholas D. Kristof , a New York Times columnist whose only sin is to be more virtuous than you — and keep you informed of this in each and every one of his bromidic columns — reassured his readers that the trouble is not with the Muslims but with the Arabs .
They are too violent and they give Islam a bad name .
( 10 ) Well , that settles that .
Funny , though , that in the last twenty years Americans have outkilled Arabs in a ratio in excess of one hundred to one .
But there I go again , nitpicking , while Saint Kristof is back in Cambodia , rescuing teenage prostitutes one Pulitzer prize at a time .
Not to be undone , The Times ’ resident flat - earther , Thomas L. Friedman , never tires of recycling Golda Meir ’s racist rant about hateful Arabs .
He writes :
“ We ca n’t keep asking Americans to sacrifice their children for people who hate each other more than they love their own children . ” ( 11 )
The hate - lovers never asked for anybody ’s sacrifice , Mr Friedman .
To steal a thought from the heroic Robert Fisk , all they ever craved was the one freedom you ’ve always refused to grant them : freedom from you !
The Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen , a man who ’s never met a heap of moral compost he did not want to climb , wrote recently that “ the prudent use of violence [ against Muslims ] could be therapeutic . ”
( 12 ) Being a kind soul , I ’ll assume that Cohen is unaware of the ideological pedigree of that phrase and that he does n’t read what he writes — apparently , a skill highly prized in American punditry .
“ Your new - caught , sullen peoples , Half - devil and half - child . ” — Rudyard Kipling
To talk the neocolonial talk from the plush comfort of the imperial capital is easy .
To walk the walk is not .
US military expenditures exceed those of all nations on earth combined .
And yet battling a ragtag band of lightly armed insurgents was more than the world ’s mightiest army could take .
It is “ about broken , ” laments Colin Powell — and , by the way , “ We are losing . ” ( 13 ) A recent Marine Corps memo concedes that Coalition Forces “ are no longer capable of militarily defeating the insurgency in al - Anbar . ” ( 14 ) Last summer ’s stabilization push in Baghdad , Operation Together Forward II , proved a dismal failure : the violence actually rose by 43 percent !
( 15 )
The US military has been fighting in Iraq longer than it did in World War II .
What does it have to show for it ?
Not much .
Unlike Vietnam , Iraq is a country - wide killing field , one giant Sniper Alley where sporting the Stars and Stripes can get you killed any time , anywhere .
Not a square inch of Iraqi soil is safe for the Americans outside the high walls of their fortresses .
To borrow from Cheney ’s vast repertoire of bons mots , the US counterinsurgency is in its last throes ; hence the " surge " and kindred shows of desperation .
Israel ’s finest military historian , Martin van Creveld , does not mince words : “ The American military have proved totally incompetent . ” ( 16 ) In Iraq , the world ’s sole superpower has been the world ’s serial superbungler .
( I ’ve always wondered if the trope of the “ sole superpower ” serves any purpose other than teaching us how thin the line is between the sublime and the farcical . )
Whose fault ?
( The wrong question for a moral perspective — starting the war was the sin , not losing it — but the right one here . )
Breathtaking as they were , the majestic vistas of Rumsfeld ’s ineptitude were little more than a convenient excuse for war advocates with egg on their faces .
The grand whining parade has already begun , and mealy - mouthed apologists are being wheeled in on bloated floats to proffer lame excuses about inadequate troop levels , insufficient 4GW training , political fecklessness , etc .
Eventually , the chest beating will die down as it always does , with the blame for the debacle pinned on the dirty antiwar hippies .
But hippies do n’t fight wars .
The Pentagon does .
It did , and it lost .
One reason — not even the most important — is the military ’s endemic inability to win hearts and minds .
Early in the war , the Guardian sounded the alarm :
“ Senior British military officers on the ground are making it clear they are dismayed by the failure of US troops to try to fight the battle for hearts and minds .
They also made plain they are appalled by reports over the weekend that US marines killed Iraqi civilians , including women and children , as they seized bridges outside Nassiriya in southern Iraq . ” ( 17 )
The emphasis on force protection is a far cry from past imperial practices .
The Romans , Spaniards , British , French , and conquerors of yore seldom agonized over their own casualties .
To their credit , Americans do .
But this comes at a moral cost : US soldiers are brave but the casualty - averse military doctrine of their commanders is cowardly .
That , in essence , is what Susan Sontag , Arundhati Roy , and Bill Maher said — right before the lynching began . ( 18 –20 ) In a similar show of disgust diplomatically stripped of the C- word , this British officer echoed the sentiment :
“ US troops have the attitude of shoot first and ask questions later .
They simply wo n’t take any risk …
Unfortunately , when we explained our rules of engagement which are based around the principle of minimum force , the US troops just laughed . ” ( 21 )
Lebanon and Somalia notwithstanding , the United States rarely cuts and runs .
It did not in Vietnam .
It fought to the death — of the other guy — and then cut and walked when victory proved elusive .
Iraq is too central to US hegemonic fantasies to allow a speedy retreat : it ’ll be done cut - and - crawl style , with enough pit stops to admire the fireworks over Iran .
Bush ’s playbook : ( 1 ) run out the clock ; ( 2 ) anoint successor as “ the dope who snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory and handed Iran the victor ’s crown ” ; ( 3 ) let the etching in the history books begin .
Could the invasion have succeeded ?
Not a chance .
All the grousing about incompetent planning is the age - old excuse - making prattle of losers .
Leave aside the not - so - trifling fact that the United States never had the proper DNA for empire ( lite or otherwise ) .
It is the incontrovertible reality of the 21st century that the time for the White Man ’s Burden has passed .
Not only is the era of empire gone , but the days of the so - called liberal hegemonic order are numbered .
Even before 9/11 , the cumulative impact of European integration , the rise of Asian powers , and the resurgence of Muslim identity sounded the death knell for American hegemony .
To hasten the burial will be one of Bush ’s legacies .
Alas , incalculable misery in the Middle East , enduring anti-American hatred , and future terrorist attacks in London , Paris , and Seattle will be another one .
The same Madeleine Albright who called the United States " the indispensable nation " — presumably to avoid confusion with the dispensable ones — taunted Colin Powell with the wickedest double - entendre since Mae West : " What ’s the point of having this superb military you ’re always talking about if we ca n’t use it ? " ( 22 ) To paraphrase an old line , it is better for a big country to keep its superb army idle and let the world think it ’s not much of a superpower than to use it and remove all doubt .
Bush ’s neoconservative doctrine seeks to apply Straussian philosophy to the unfettered pursuit of US energy interests .
Its unspoken motto : " perpetual war for perpetual peace . "
The rough idea — and the idea is , indeed , rough — is to play this century ’s Great Game ( first prize : control of Mideast oil supply ) under the banner of national security .
Until we whacked them on the head , Iraqis had never expressed much desire to attack us .
To the lesser minds , therefore , the idea of fighting them there so we would n’t have to fight them here always teetered on the edge of insanity .
To the neocons ’ delight , 9/11 came to cleanse the public discourse of the yelpings of lesser minds .
And so , today , we gather to honor the superior minds , all of these men ( they are mostly men ) who so decisively turned out the lights on the American empire .
Heading the roll call is none other than the Decider himself .
If you ’re among the wise who chose to sit out the Bush years at the bottom of a well , you need to know only two things about the man : the first is that he is President of the United States ; the second is that he said :
" One of the hardest parts of my job is to connect Iraq to the war on terror . " ( 23 )
To connect it to the war for terror would indeed be easier .
A self - declared uniter , Bush is beginning to unite the country around the belief that he is the worst president in US history .
( 24 ) Whether his reelection , ipso facto , makes the electorate the dumbest ever is a logical inference that a political culture drunk with self - admiration will have trouble getting its woozy head around .
To call Team Bush a thundering herd of galloping loons is to be unnecessarily kind .
For rarely has daftness been elevated to such a lofty plane of power and influence .
The early days of the Iraq adventure set the tone .
A year after Defense strategist Ken Adelman infamously called the coming liberation of Iraq a " cakewalk , " Paul Wolfowitz , then Rumsfeld ’s deputy , used the occasion of an interview with NPR ’s Melissa Block to stamp the prediction with the Pentagon ’s gold seal .
" We ’re seeing today how much the people of Poland and Central and Eastern Europe appreciate what the United States did to help liberate them from the tyranny of the Soviet Union .
I think you ’re going to see even more of that sentiment in Iraq .
There ’s not going to be the hostility that you described Saturday .
There simply wo n’t be . " ( 25 )
Hostility ?
What an idea !
On the eve of the war , in a vice presidential reprise of Tom Cruise ’s couch - hopping antics , Cheney stepped on the set of NBC ’s " Meet The Press " to share the love : " We will , in fact , be greeted as liberators . " ( 26 ) For a mere $ 44 billion a year , ( 27 ) all we got from US intelligence was a silly update of an old movie script :
Renault :
And what in Heaven ’s name brought you to Baghdad ?
Bush :
The sweets and the flowers .
I came to Baghdad for love .
Renault : Love !
What love ?
We ’re in the Middle East .
Bush : I was misinformed .
Christmas 2003 came early in Iraq and WMD - stuffed stockings were spotted everywhere by late March .
Or so Rumsfeld told ABC News ’ George Stephanopoulos : " We know where they are .
They ’re in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east , west , south and north somewhat . " ( 28 ) East , west , south and nowhere somewhat .
In September of that year , the part - time AEI scholar , full - time slimeball Richard Perle got all his neurons firing at once to produce this marvel of crystal gazing :
" And a year from now , I ’ll be very surprised if there is not some grand square in Baghdad that is named after President Bush . " ( 29 )
Or perhaps some grand morgue ?
Which naturally leads us to the 600 - billion dollar question : where did they find these people ?
The answer : in that dank rodent house known as the American Enterprise Institute .
Often found gnawing on the chicken wire , the rabid ferret Michael Ledeen needs no cage rattling to work himself into a froth of hysteria :
" Every ten years or so , the United States needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall , just to show the world we mean business . " ( 30 )
In their knockoff of Mein Kampf , retitled An End to Evil , Richard Perle and former Bush speechwriter David Frum give voice to their full - blown dementia by recommending all - out attacks on anybody ever so slightly Muslim .
Why ?
Because " There is no middle way for Americans :
It is victory or holocaust . " ( 31 ) Salon ’s Gary Kamiya calls the Perle - Frum worldview " a strange combination of Hobbes and Popeye . " ( 32 ) Harsh on Popeye .
Me , I have no patience for moral midgets who ’ve seen their Napoleonic hour arrive .
Like Alexander in Gordium , I head straight for the deliciously obvious : to end evil , end Perle and Frum .
The American Enterprise Institute serves to mitigate the most glaring defects of our democracy .
Take the current escalation in Iraq , for example .
President Bush alone grasps the full cosmic immensity of its wisdom , even calling the idea a " surge " to convey its irresistibility .
Alas , the Forces of Darkness , aka the Pentagon , the Congress , and the American public , will have none of it .
Enter the AEI and its paunchy , double - chinned warmonger , Frederick W. Kagan .
Faster than a chickenhawk can flap its wings , Kagan demothballs his fave retired general , Jack Keane , and whips up The Surge .
Voilà .
Rasputin would be proud .
It would be unfair to let Team Bush steal all the credit for the imperial collapse without a tip of the hat to the White House Dictation Office , also known as the mainstream media ( MSM ) .
Skipping right over the miniskirted hyena Ann Coulter ( a risky stunt but I ’ve got my spiked pogo shoes on ) , the oafish junkie Rush Limbaugh , and the assortment of one - trick performing fleas hopping mad on the AM dial , I shall ascend Mount Olympus to gaze at the brainy stars of the MSM .
Few shine more brightly than Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol , the supernova of the Murdoch empire — unless red dwarf is a tighter cosmic fit for someone known to his friends and pet hamster as " Dan Quayle ’s brain . "
The day after the 9/11 attacks , the surrogate brain seized the moment and began pounding the war drums : " There ’s a fair amount of evidence that Iraq had very close associations with Osama bin Laden in the past . " ( 33 ) There was not a shred of evidence .
A year later , Kristol nuzzled up to The New Republic ’s Lawrence F. Kaplan to break into a cakewalk jig on the National Review dance floor : " Having defeated and then occupied Iraq , democratizing the country should not be too tall an order for the world ’s sole superpower . " ( 34 ) Brilliance of this magnitude is Kristol ’s trademark .
Time magazine took longer than most to realize that and only this month got around to adding Kristol to its roster of columnists .
Two influential Canadians with a nasty case of empire envy , Mark Steyn and Michael Ignatieff pulpiteered the good news — one from his stool at the Chicago Sun -Times , the other from his booster seat at the Harvard Kennedy School .
From Steyn we learned that " Imperialism is the answer " ( 35 ) and from Ignatieff that " The case for empire is that it has become , in a place like Iraq , the last hope for democracy and stability alike . "
( 2 ) ( I do n’t know about you , but the dazzling acumen of the expert never fails to give me goosebumps ! )
Former TNR editor Andrew Sullivan , another heavy smoker of the imperialist ’s hookah pipe , found his knees wobbly after 9/11 and his left flank badly exposed : " The decadent Left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead — and may well mount what amounts to a fifth column . " ( 36 )
Of course , no account of MSM malfeasance would be fitting without at least a passing glance at the yapping chihuahuas .
Newsweek ’s Howard Fineman woofed a few choice words of his own : " We had controversial wars that divided the country .
This war united the country and brought the military back . " ( 37 ) Well said , Howard .
His colleague Chris Matthews yaks at such vertiginous speeds that his brain emits exotic particles of synchrotronic quirkiness .
One month into the war , he blurted out , " We ’re all neocons now . "
A few weeks later , Matthews highlighted a side of war that too often gets short shrift : what great , clean fun it is !
" Check it out .
The women like this war !
I think we like having a hero as our president . " ( 37 ) Must a TV show be pornographic just because it ’s called " Hardball " ?
The war has given the American mainstream media a brilliant opportunity to prove its essential worthlessness .
It has shown itself to be little more than a circus of entertainers and cheerleaders for whom every season is the silly season .
Tragically , the media has failed in its sacred duty to keep a vigilant , skeptical , critical eye on the centers of power .
Who is the American Robert Fisk , Gideon Levy , or Amira Hass ?
Whoever they are ( and Sy Hersh proves they exist ) , why are their writings not filling the op - ed pages of the great American newspapers ?
How can the nation that produces the bulk of Nobel prize winners be stuck with such a sullen bunch of journalistic mediocrities ?
The sycophantic enablers of the Fourth Estate have blood on their hands .
The unfolding catastrophe in Iraq had a single cause : the reassertion of US hegemony after 9/11 .
Its trigger was a rare astral alignment .
Big Oil , the neocons , the Christian fundamentalists , the liberal hawks , AIPAC , the MSM , and 9/11 all formed cosmic dots in the sky that only one power could — and did — successfully align : the president of the United States .
No American leader has so much owned a war .
And none has so little owned up to it .
Victors are never war criminals .
That ’s because they get to write the history books .
Bush wo n’t have that chance .
The die has been cast and the hour is too late for him or anyone to alter the unforgiving judgment of posterity .
Therein , paradoxically , lies our quandary .
For , if freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose , then Bush is a free man — free to pursue the most malignant policies , heedless of the consequences to his unworsenable presidential standing .
Beware the desperation of a cornered man .
The apostle of imperial dominance , Bush slew the " last empire . "
The towering figure of our time , he is a piteously small man .
The self - anointed emissary of a " higher father , " he is servant to no power but himself .
The captain of the sinking ship has laid his command upon his fellow Americans : " Ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for me . "
No sacrifice of life shall be too great , no damage to civil liberties too high , no expenses too vast for a vainglorious man deluded by fantastic dreams of redemption by force .
But who besides the bereaved will mourn ?
Who besides the orphan will whimper ?
Who besides the humiliated will stare back ?
Who besides the thugs and the craven will lead ?
Patriotism is a lovely thing .
In its name , some go dying by the side of an Iraqi road in twitching agony ; others go shopping in oversized automobiles festooned with yellow ribbons .
We all play our part — and nobody else’s .
Yeats bemoaned an era when the best lacked all conviction , while the worst were full of passionate intensity .
Today , Kristol blusters and hectors , Cheney scolds and forebodes , Bush struts and smirks .
Meanwhile , the giant , timid chorus listens politely to the deafening silence of the outraged — and the mad march of war goes on .

Lord of the Rings
Cameron Duncan surprised the people around him .
As just a young teen he started making films .
And people were impressed , very impressed .
His films were short and autobiographical , but he compressed more meaning into a few minutes of film than most directors do in feature length blockbusters .
As hard as it is to believe , he was the inspiration for the theme song to .
Song writer Fran Walsh , and her husband , producer Peter Jackson , had become friends of the boy .
Cameron produced films about the life he knew .
And the life he knew as a teen was facing death .
Duncan was diagnosed with cancer .
He would be 21 now , had he lived .
Cameron died at the age of 17 .
But not even the dead rest in peace when the tax man is around .
The problems started in 2002 .
The family received an tax assessment for $ 500,000 .
Sharon Duncan , Cameron ’s mother , handled the family finances .
She was sure this had to be a mistake .
But in the mad rush to try to treat Cameron ’s illness she simply put it aside .
The family sought out medical care apparently not available in from the New Zealand government - run system .
Altogether they say that it cost over $ 1 million ( US $ 750,000 ) in order to seek care outside of New Zealand , including the costs of travel and lodging .
And some of that money went toward Cameron ’s passion : his films .
Donors across the country gave them the bulk of the money and the rest they received by mortgaging their house .
Cameron ’s father , Rhys , says that all the money they received went into Cameron ’s battle to live .
In the end they faced bankruptcy and Cameron was gone .
The $ 500,000 bill was a mistake .
But then they got hit with another tax bill which they could n’t pay .
It was just $ 9,000 but with penalties it had gone up to $ 108,000 .
The Inland Revenue Department froze their bank account so they could n’t make payments .
And to make things worse , every year , without fail , the family was penalized because Cameron was failing to file his tax forms .
And every year Inland Revenue were told he had died only to penalize them again the next year .
Sharon Duncan said the tax authorities “ were hammering me right through Cameron ’s illness , right through his death and right into bankruptcy .
” One of the short film ’s Cameron produced before his death is above .
Take the time to watch it .

Powell tried to push Iran talks in 2003 and was rebuffed , former official says Brian Beutler
Published : Wednesday February 14 , 2007 Print This Email This Former Bush National Security Council official also says
Rice likely lied about not seeing document Former Bush National Security Council official Flynt Leverett , speaking on Wednesday at a forum held by the New America Foundation , told a crowd in a Senate office building that in 2003 then - Secretary of State Colin Powell received a grand bargain offer from Iran and was rebuffed by the White House , RAW STORY can reveal .
 I know as a fact from multiple sources this went all the way up to Secretary Powell ,  Leverett said , citing multiple sources at the State Department and the NSC .
 In [ Secretary Powells ] words , he couldnt sell it at the White House . Leverett said the letter was also delivered to the National Security Council .
Rice told Congress last week that she 'd never seen it .
 The document went over to the NSC  and it is unthinkable  that it wouldnt have gone to then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , Leverett asserted .
 She owes Congress an apology for saying she had not seen the document . 
" The statements she is making before Congress are not true , " Leverett added , noting that Rice almost certainly " knows " they are n't true .
Leverett , who served as the senior director for Middle East affairs on the National Security Council from March 2002 to March 2003 , added that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was probably lying when she said she had not seen the offer Iran made , which was channeled through Tim Guldimann , the Swiss ambassador to Iran .
The Washington Post printed a pdf of the offer in today 's online edition of the paper .
Guldimann told U.S. officials in 2003 that an Iranian proposal for comprehensive talks had been approved by Iran 's supreme religious leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , then - President Mohammad Khatami , and then - Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi , according to a copy of the cover letter to the Iranian document obtained by the Post .
Yesterday , the State Department played down the significance of Iran 's offer .
 This document did not come through official channels but rather was a creative exercise on the part of the Swiss ambassador ,  State Department spokesman Tom Casey told the Post .
 The last 30 years are filled with examples of individuals claiming to represent Iranian views .
We have offered to Iran a chance to sit across the table from us and discuss their nuclear issue and anything else they would like , should they simply , verifiably suspend their uranium - enrichment activities .
But Leverett disagreed with that interpretation .
" It was a serious proposal , " Leverett said , " It was not vague .
"
He went on to defend the Swiss ambassador , saying that Guldimann " was not some flake off the street , " but rather , " a serious official " who was doing his job .
More background on Iran 's 2003 offer is available at the Post .
The story was printed on page A14 of the paper .
Correction :
The document was passed on to the National Security Council , not the UN Security Council .
Today is the day that I take off my gloves and say what I have wanted to say for a long time , but havenâ€™t because of some silly notion that I didnâ€™t want to sink to the depths that other people have .
I donâ€™t care anymore .
If you have delicate sensibilities , donâ€™t read past this point .
You might see something that will bother you , and I just wanted to say I warned you .
First of all , I have no respect for any of these politicians that say they believe that God created Adam and Eve and he created this world in seven days .
If you are a politician that believes in the creationist theory , than you are either stupid , too stupid to hold office , or you are a liar , and you are lying to get stupid Christians that believe that to vote for you .
In both cases , you are not qualified to hold political office .
You should resign .
Anyone that believe that we are fighting them there so we wonâ€™t fight them here should also either go back to school and pay attention this time , or stop and think of what you are saying .
Fighting them there had absolutely nothing to do with fighting them here .
That entire line of reasoning is flawed .
If they want to attack us here they can whether or not we fight them there .
In fact , many people that want to attack us arenâ€™t even â€œthereâ€ , they are somewhere else .
That is one of the stupidest things I have ever heard anyone say .
If you believe that , then you are stupid too .
Sorry , but someone has to give you the message .
Bush and Cheney donâ€™t give a goddamn shit about this country or anyone in it except the people that pay them .
Iâ€™m not talking about the lousy salary they get for being in office .
Iâ€™m talking about all the money that is given to them under the table from Halliburton , Blackwater and the Oil Companies and all the others making a fortune off the death and destruction going on in Iraq .
I guarantee that Bush and Cheney have never cared about bringing freedom to the Iraqi people .
If you believe that , you should get a check - up from the neck - up .
I believe that anyone that is blocking the impeachment of the President and the Vice - President should be charged for obstruction of justice .
When it gets to the point when political interests outweigh moral interests , then these people should no longer be holding public office .
There shouldnâ€™t even be an argument about holding impeachment proceedings against these people .
I am going to put my money where my mouth is , stay tuned .
Meanwhile I will now paste an excerpt from a commenter ( Sabresong ) from my blog liberalpro :
sabresong said ...
â€ œanonymous said ...
What I 'd like someone to do is to verify , establish point blank , what crimes have been committed .â€ 
â€ œAn excellent request .
It 's taken me some time to separate the proven crimes from the conspiracy theories , and I 'm still working on it .
I 'll post it on my own blog at www.eledanthe.com/news once it 's finished .
until then , the following list is taken directly from the proposed articles of impeachment , calling for the impeachment of G.W. Bush and Dick Cheney :
1 ) Seizing power to wage wars of aggression in defiance of the U.S. Constitution , the U.N. Charter and the rule of law ; carrying out a massive assault on and occupation of Iraq , a country that was not threatening the United States , resulting in the death and maiming of over one hundred thousand Iraqis , and thousands of U.S. G.I.s .
2 ) Lying to the people of the U.S. , to Congress , and to the U.N. , providing false and deceptive rationales for war .
3 ) Authorizing , ordering and condoning direct attacks on civilians , civilian facilities and locations where civilian casualties were unavoidable .
4 ) Instituting a secret and illegal wiretapping and spying operation against the people of the United States through the National Security Agency .
5 ) Threatening the independence and sovereignty of Iraq by belligerently changing its government by force and assaulting Iraq in a war of aggression .
6 ) Authorizing , ordering and condoning assassinations , summary executions , kidnappings , secret and other illegal detentions of individuals , torture and physical and psychological coercion of prisoners to obtain false statements concerning acts and intentions of governments and individuals and violating within the United States , and by authorizing U.S. forces and agents elsewhere , the rights of individuals under the First , Fourth , Fifth , Sixth and Eighth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
7 ) Making , ordering and condoning false statements and propaganda about the conduct of foreign governments and individuals and acts by U.S. government personnel ; manipulating the media and foreign governments with false information ; concealing information vital to public discussion and informed judgment concerning acts , intentions and possession , or efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction in order to falsely create a climate of fear and destroy opposition to U.S. wars of aggression and first strike attacks .
8 ) Violations and subversions of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , both a part of the " Supreme Law of the land " under Article VI , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution , in an attempt to commit with impunity crimes against peace and humanity and war crimes in wars and threats of aggression against Afghanistan , Iraq and others and usurping powers of the United Nations and the peoples of its nations by bribery , coercion and other corrupt acts and by rejecting treaties , committing treaty violations , and frustrating compliance with treaties in order to destroy any means by which international law and institutions can prevent , affect , or adjudicate the exercise of U.S. military and economic power against the international community .
9 ) Acting to strip United States citizens of their constitutional and human rights , ordering indefinite detention of citizens , without access to counsel , without charge , and without opportunity to appear before a civil judicial officer to challenge the detention , based solely on the discretionary designation by the Executive of a citizen as an " enemy combatant . "
10 ) Ordering indefinite detention of non-citizens in the United States and elsewhere , and without charge , at the discretionary designation of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Defense .
11 ) Ordering and authorizing the Attorney General to override judicial orders of release of detainees under INS jurisdiction , even where the judicial officer after full hearing determines a detainee is wrongfully held by the government .
12 ) Authorizing secret military tribunals and summary execution of persons who are not citizens who are designated solely at the discretion of the Executive who acts as indicting official , prosecutor and as the only avenue of appellate relief .
13 ) Refusing to provide public disclosure of the identities and locations of persons who have been arrested , detained and imprisoned by the U.S. government in the United States , including in response to Congressional inquiry .
14 ) Use of secret arrests of persons within the United States and elsewhere and denial of the right to public trials .
15 ) Authorizing the monitoring of confidential attorney - client privileged communications by the government , even in the absence of a court order and even where an incarcerated person has not been charged with a crime .
16 ) Ordering and authorizing the seizure of assets of persons in the United States , prior to hearing or trial , for lawful or innocent association with any entity that at the discretionary designation of the Executive has been deemed " terrorist . "
17 ) Engaging in criminal neglect in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , depriving thousands of people in Louisiana , Mississippi and other Gulf States of urgently needed support , causing mass suffering and unnecessary loss of life .
18 ) Institutionalization of racial and religious profiling and authorization of domestic spying by federal law enforcement on persons based on their engagement in noncriminal religious and political activity .
19 ) Refusal to provide information and records necessary and appropriate for the constitutional right of legislative oversight of executive functions .
20 ) Rejecting treaties protective of peace and human rights and abrogation of the obligations of the United States under , and withdrawal from , international treaties and obligations without consent of the legislative branch , and including termination of the ABM treaty between the United States and Russia , and rescission of the authorizing signature from the Treaty of Rome which served as the basis for the International Criminal Court.â€ 
If you cannot understand the above charges , have someone explain them to you .
I am tired of people from â€œprogressiveâ€ sites that I write for , taking one sentence from my articles and making a federal case about it .
Sometimes when I write , I say things that are necessary to keep the article flowing .
A case in point is the article I wrote on Total War .
Because I explained what the doctrine of Total War was , does not mean that I condone any type of war .
Before you comment on something of mine in the future , try to take what I have said in the context of what Iâ€™m writing about .
People on the left seem to fight more with each other than anyone else .
If some people would take this â€œboundless energyâ€ that they have and point it towards the enemies of our Republic , namely the right wingnuts , we would all be better off .
Sometimes I find myself writing an article and Iâ€™m so busy thinking of how to phrase something so I wonâ€™t be attacked , that I water down what it was I am trying to say so I wonâ€™t offend anyone .
Forget about it .
Next week I am going to tell you about something that will make history ( if everything works out OK ) watch for it .
Iâ€™m tired of just writing about these criminals holding office , Republican AND Democrats .
There is no reason on Earth why Congress doesnâ€™t support Dennis Kucinich on his quest to impeach VP Cheney .
Cheney is not fit to hold office .
Leaving the scene of an accident after he shot his friend in the face was a criminal act , although minor compared to the things he has done since becoming VP .
Unless we DEMAND that this administration step down , we could lose our Republic , and replace it with a dictatorship .
Just remember this , the German people got what they deserved by supporting Hitler .
If you are not with us , than you are against us .
This is no time for people to be sitting on the fence .
I donâ€™t make this stuff up .

SAN DIEGO ( MarketWatch ) --
You will have to pardon Paul Kasriel , chief of economic research at Northern Trust in Chicago , if he has n't been the life of the party over the past seven or eight years .
The 60 - year - old economist , tapped in 2006 as the top economic forecaster by Arizona State University 's W.P. Carey School of Business , has spent a good deal of that time trying to warn anybody who would listen about such things as excessive household debt while taking a jab or two ( or three ) at then - Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan .
" Illusory " is how , in October 2004 , Kasriel described the wealth created by Greenspan 's interest - rate cuts in one of his edgy and somewhat irregular reports dubbed , " The Econtrarian , " which are available on Northern Trust 's Web site .
A few months later , as household spending continued to sizzle , he wrote , " Today 's ' partying ' in terms of a disproportionate share of national output being ' consumed ' by the household sector is a recipe for a ' hangover ' tomorrow . "
And in case you are wondering whether Kasriel has any regrets about having provided less - than - rosy outlooks that challenged conventional wisdom while others were celebrating record home sales and soaring stock prices he does n't .
" I look at the numbers and I have a sense of history , " he says , as the sound of wind causes his voice to fade in and out during a telephone interview while he was on a sailboat on Lake Michigan , where he spent this past week .
Sailing on that lake , known for its unpredictable conditions , is an appropriate hobby for an economist like Kasriel .
He believes sailing makes him a better forecaster .
And as a forecaster , he is concerned more than ever about the economy , which he believes could be headed toward a " painful " recession .
His analysis confirms the anecdotal evidence presented earlier this year in my column and blog items that suggested Americans are living well beyond their means .
" I do n't make up the numbers , " Kasriel says .
" And since the late 1990s , I 've been seeing trends that are very disturbing . "
He is particularly alarmed at the relationship between personal disposable income and personal consumption expenditures and residential investment expenditures .
That is eco-babble for the amount of money people take home after taxes minus the amount they are spending on everyday goods and services and what they spend on buying and fixing up their homes .
According to that calculation , Americans have been running deficits in six of the past seven years .
Prior to the recent , unprecedented string of deficits , Kasriel says there have been only seven other years American households have been so upside - down in their finances since 1929 .
Two of those were during the Great Depression .
Three more were just after the end of World War II .
Another was in 1955 , then again in 1999 .
That leads to an obvious question :
If they can't afford it , how are people continuing to spend as Thursday 's report of retail sales suggested they are continuing to do as if all is well ?
The answer , which has become all too obvious in recent weeks and months , Kasriel says :
They appear , in large part , to be borrowing against their homes , which will become less available as a piggy bank going forward .
" Households are going into debt like never before , " he says .
They also have been net sellers of stocks .
All of this means , Kasriel says , that there will be less cash for things we like to buy .
As an economist , however , he is well aware that others might not agree with his interpretation of the numbers .
" There are people who deny man walked on the moon , and there are people who will deny this , too , " he says .
" But the data are overwhelming that households are spending more than their income . "
And , besides , he says , " If everybody else thinks the way I do , I get nervous . "
Needless to say , he is n't , which means maybe you should be .
I do n’t tell this story often , because no one believes it .
It was 1979 , my senior year at Hartwick College , in Oneonta NY .
One early morning I woke up from a dead sleep and had what could best be described as a vision of my future .
In this vision , I would move to San Francisco , and create something that would make me famous .
And I saw myself standing on stage in front of a huge audience .
At the time , I knew no one who lived in San Francisco .
I did n’t even know anyone who had visited .
It seemed entirely random .
I was majoring in economics so I could become a banker in New York City , not a stage performer in San Francisco .
After graduating , I traded my beat - up Datsun 510 to my sister for a one - way ticket to Los Angeles , where my brother had moved a few years earlier .
I slept in a sleeping bag on his couch and applied for banking jobs .
I had two offers , and was planning to pick one of them .
Meanwhile , sometime after my so - called vision , an ex girlfriend dropped out of college and moved to San Francisco .
While I was in LA , she invited me up for the weekend .
I went .
She convinced me that San Francisco was a much nicer place than LA , and I should move there .
I said I ’d stay if I could find a job on Monday .
I was almost out of money .
Otherwise , I would return to LA and accept one of the offers there .
On Monday morning , I walked into a branch of Crocker National Bank in San Francisco , asked for a job , and got one , as a teller .
I ’ve lived in the San Francisco area ever since .
This is where I created Dilbert .
And I have stood on stage in front of huge audiences a few hundred times , just as I saw it in the vision .
I ’ve had several of these so - called visions .
Most of them happened just the way I saw them .
A few have n’t happened yet , but could .
So how do I explain it ?
The obvious explanation is that I remember the alleged visions that come true and forget the ones that do n’t .
I ca n’t rule that out .
Another possibility is that I have some weird psychic ability .
That seems unlikely .
If people had that sort of ability it would have been measured in a lab by now .
Perhaps my subconscious makes all my decisions , and creates all of my so - called visions .
Then it does its best to make me do the things that would make the visions come true .
That seems like a perfectly good theory .
But my favorite theory is that I ’m nothing but a hologram in a computer program built by my ancient self , before the planet was destroyed by some disaster .
The reason I can glimpse my future is that I have all of the qualities of the real me who wrote my program .
In other words , I can accurately imagine my future because it is playing out much like I would have authored it myself .
The great thing about this theory is that I can find all sorts of clues to validate it .
For example , when I come up with a “ new ” idea only to discover that others have had the same thought , this fits my theory too .
The reason other people have my same thoughts is because they were programmed by my ancient self , who only had a finite number of thoughts to build into the program .
This reality is bound to have repeats .
Then there is all the science I do n’t understand .
One explanation is that it ’s over my head .
But I prefer the explanation that it is nothing but gibberish programmed into the system .
The reason I do n’t understand string theory , for example , is that there are no real scientists , only holograms programmed by my ancient self .
And since my ancient self did n’t know string theory , he concealed that fact by making it seem as though it is just too complicated to understand .
That ’s how I would have programmed it .

Transcript :
James Harris :
Here again on Truthdig this is James Harris with Josh Scheer .
On the phone is Matthew Rothschild , the editor of The Progressive and the author of the new book “ You Have No Rights . ”
I feel like I have some rights left , and so do other Americans .
So why did you choose this title for your book ?
Matthew Rothschild : I took the title of the book from a couple of brothers , Yasser and Hany Ibrahim , who were Egyptians living in the United States after 9/11 and they had the police come knock on their door , come in and drag them away and hold them in a pen for 24 hours where they were n’t allowed even to go to the bathroom .
And then they dragged them through the Metropolitan Detention Center , banging their heads against the walls , especially on the wall that had an American flag on it .
And then these guards played a little sadistic game , stepping on the chain between their legs , and then they ’d fall down , and then the guards would say “ Get up ! ” and then they ’d step on the chain and then they ’d say “ Get up ! ” again .
Ultimately , one of the brothers said to the guards , “ Look , do n’t we have any rights here ? ”
And the response came back , “ You have no rights . ”
What rights do we have , actually , if the president can say , even of U.S. citizens , that you ’re enemy combatants and throw you in jail as he did , into solitary confinement , of two American citizens : Yaser Hamdi and Jose Padilla .
And the Military Commissions
Act allows them to identify any of us as an enemy combatant , and if you ’re not a U.S. citizen , you can be thrown into jail and never have a right to talk to a lawyer or see a courtroom again for the rest of your lives .
Josh Scheer :
Or they can outsource you for torture .
Rothschild :
They can disappear you .
I mean , Bush and Cheney — they act like we ’re an Argentinean junta and they ’re disappearing people here , or sending them overseas to secret CIA prisons .
Harris : Now , something — .
Rothschild : Now , just let me go on for a second .
Harris : OK .
Rothschild : What Fourth Amendment rights to privacy do we have if the NSA , the National Security Agency , can spy on us without a warrant when the law says they need to have a warrant to spy on us ?
What First Amendment rights do we have to protest if we ca n’t protest in front of the president or the vice president , but if we have to go to some free - speech zone a half - mile or a mile or a mile and a half away where they can’t even see us ?
Harris :
You ’ve been called a madman .
and I ’m sure you ’ve been called anti-American .
I do n’t know if you know , but an executive order was issued by the president , I believe on the 17th of July , and it said , basically , that if you protest or threaten what he calls “ stabilization efforts in Iraq , ” your property can be seized and you can be detained .
Were you aware of that ?
Rothschild : I have the order in my hand .
I was just writing something on the computer to update our website with something on that .
Yeah .
If you are — in the mind of the secretary of the Treasury — posing a significant risk of committing an act of violence — you do n’t have to have committed an act of violence .
If he thinks you are at risk of committing an act of violence in order to protest the policies of the Iraqi government or the Bush administration ’s policies to promote what it calls “ economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq , ” then the secretary of the Treasury can put a freeze on all your assets .
This is unbelievable .
What Bush is trying to achieve here , by executive order , are things that he ca n’t achieve legislatively .
Someone ’s got to put a stop to this .
Congress has got to put a stop to it because he is seizing all sorts of authoritarian powers right now by executive decree .
Harris : But Matthew , let ’s be real for a second .
Here we are , year four of this war .
Given what you ’ve seen so far from Congress , can they really make a change in this war ?
Can they really change the mind of George Bush ?
Rothschild :
They ’re going to have to step up to the plate sometime , or we can kiss our Constitution goodbye , because Bush is trampling all over it .
Cheney ’s trampling all over it .
What needs to happen , in my mind , is impeachment proceedings of the House Judiciary Committee against Bush and against Cheney , to make them know that they are going to be held accountable or at least there ’s going to be a process to try to hold them accountable , that they ca n’t get away scot - free with all this stuff , and to tell the next president or the one after that that they ca n’t get away with this stuff .
Scheer : People talk about — you know , Bush has talked about this so many times —
“ They hate us for our freedom . ”
That was a line used long ago .
People talk about , “ Visit the free country , the free country , the free country . ”
Why do n’t people realize that when you take away the Constitution , even the parts you dislike , you ’re really hurting the freedom ?
Or is that just a word that ’s being bantered around , like any kind of spin ?
Rothschild : I wish more people in this country would really revere the First Amendment , the Fourth Amendment , the Fifth Amendment , the Sixth Amendment and the Eighth Amendment .
But Cheney and Bush themselves are intolerant of the freedoms that are enshrined in our Bill of Rights .
In my book , “ You Have No Rights , ” I tell the story of a guy named Steve Howards who was walking through Beaver Creek , Colo. , an open - air mall there and , of all people , Dick Cheney is there , shaking hands .
And Steve Howards goes up to the vice president , about three feet away , and says , “ Mr. Vice President , I think your policy in Iraq is reprehensible . ” …
And then he walked away .
But the Secret Service approached him 10 minutes later and said , “ Did you assault the vice president of the United States ? ” And Steve Howards said , “ No , I was just expressing my First Amendment rights . ”
And they responded , “ No , you assaulted the vice president of the United States .
You ’re under arrest . ”
Harris :
They arrested him ?
Rothschild :
They arrested him .
Scheer :
Do you think Cheney was the one who said , “ He was the one who assaulted me ” ?
Rothschild : I do n’t know .
But the Secret Service has a policy now , not only of protecting the president and the vice president from assassination , but protecting the president and the vice president from dissent , and that ’s not their job .
Scheer : … Every time [ Bush ] speaks , he does n’t seem to have an idea of what ’s going on in the world and he does n’t really care .
Do you think that ’s because he ’s not hearing negatives when he goes out in his limos and with the Secret Service ?
Rothschild :
He ’s almost completely shielded from protest right now .
He ’s like a medieval king who sends out his vassals to clear , you know , any scruffy peasants from the carriage route .
There ’s actually a White House manual that came out as a consequence of a couple of the people I profile in this book suing the White House and suing the Secret Service .
The White House manual from the advance team of the White House tells people at the White House , when the president and the vice president go out somewhere , that they should be shielded from protests , that the advance team should do everything possible to keep the protesters out of earshot and eyesight of the president and vice president .
If that does n’t succeed , the advance team should get together a rally squad — what I would call a goon squad — to stand in front of anyone who has an anti-Bush or anti-Cheney protest sign .
And if the protesters are making any noise , this rally squad , this goon squad , should shout down the protesters with chants of “ USA , USA , USA ! ”
And then the manual advises the White House advance team to recruit people for these rally squads from Young Republican associations , from athletic teams , and from fraternities and sororities .
It ’s really an incredible document .
Scheer :
It sounds like Noriega ’s youth squads from back in the day .
Rothschild :
Or a brownshirt .
That ’s what it is ; it ’s just squads of intimidators .
Harris :
How many people do you think are aware of these kinds of nuances ?
Rothschild :
The problem with the mainstream media is that it has not been reporting these cases in any kind of a systematic way .
To the extent that they cover the stories , they cover it one at a time as if it ’s just a crazy , isolated incident that has nothing to do with any other related incidents and nothing to do with this edifice of repression that Bush has constructed .
Some people may remember the story , vaguely , of the guy with the T - shirt in New York , at a New York mall , who was a lawyer named Stephen Downs , and I profile here .
All he did was , he went into the mall and he put on a T - shirt that said , “ Give peace a chance ” on one side and “ Peace on Earth ” on the other , and he was arrested in the shopping mall for putting on that shirt .
So people may vaguely have remembered that , but they do n’t connect it with all these other petty - to - really - scary acts of repression that have happened along the way , and so they do n’t really see the picture .
And then they forget .
Scheer :
There was a book — we actually did an interview with the guy a few days ago and his book comes up behind yours on Amazon .
It ’s the same kind of thing about losing our democracy .
He talks about some similar issues .
I think you go more into the details with individual cases .
Harris :
It ’s “ The Last Days of Democracy ” is the title , but , yeah .
Scheer :
He talks about how we ’re becoming more like Nazis or fascists .
Do you feel that way with the government ?
Do you think we ’re going that path to fascism ?
Rothschild : I ’ve been very careful not to use the f-word here for about 27 years in public because I do n’t think we ’re a fascist state right now .
Otherwise , you and I would not be having this conversation and I would n’t be able to publish this book , I would n’t be able to publish The Progressive magazine or go out and speak in public .
But I do think there are clouds of neofascism in the sky and they ’re not on the horizon ; they ’re getting closer to being overhead .
And the problem is , if we do n’t fight for our rights now , by the time a kind of neofascist government fully took over , it would be too late .
And let ’s be clear here :
There are plans for martial law in this country .
Tommy Franks , who led the invasion of Iraq , said that if we ’re attacked again by terrorists with weapons of mass destruction this time , we will have to set aside the Constitution .
Then a guy who just died two days ago , Wayne Downing , who was Condoleezza Rice ’s deputy at the National Security Council , he said the exact same thing , essentially :
If we ’re attacked again by terrorists with weapons of mass destruction , we ’re going to have to impose martial law .
That was a quote he had in the Washington Post .
And so we need to be alert to that .
I mean , just last week Barbara Boxer said to Ed Schultz on the Ed Schultz radio program that this is as close as this country has ever come to a dictatorship .
Dictatorship was her word .
A senator , Barbara Boxer .
Scheer : Strong words .
Harris :
Very strong words .
How much of this , Matthew , do you believe is the result of that initial seed of fear that Bush planted ?
And he reinforced it the other day in his news conference at the White House , saying simply , again and again , “ If we leave Iraq , they ’ll come to get us here . ”
This idea that something is looming , that if we do n’t follow his path — .
Rothschild :
It ’s totally fear .
That ’s all he does .
He ’s a giant fear - monger , and that ’s why he repeats al - Qaida ’s name constantly .
That ’s why he resuscitated the name of Osama bin Laden , a name that did n’t want to slip past his lips for about three years there when it was so embarrassing to him that he had n’t caught Osama bin Laden yet .
But now it ’s useful for him because he inculcates fear , and if people are so fearful , they will surrender their rights to him .
He also loves this image that he uses constantly — and he used it last week again — that before 9/11 we were protected by the oceans , almost womb - like I think he wants us to think .
Protected by the oceans .
Well , we were n’t protected by the oceans in the War of 1812 .
We were n’t protected by the oceans on Pearl Harbor Day .
We were n’t protected by the oceans on any single day of the Cold War when the Russians could launch an ICBM with nuclear weapons on top of them to destroy this country .
So this is just a fake idea that we were safe before 9/11 and now we are imperiled in a way we ’ve never been imperiled before .
The Russians , the Soviets , could have incinerated this entire country .
They still could .
Al - Qaida ca n’t incinerate this country .
Al - Qaida can attack and inflict some serious damage here , but they cannot destroy this country .
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney can destroy our democracy , and they are in the process of destroying our democracy right now .
Scheer : Another guest we had on this show was Robert Higgs .
I do n’t know if you ’ve heard of him , with The Independent Institute .
And he takes a radical view about government and he thinks that with crisis times , people run to government — in terms of 9/11 , or the New Deal with the Depression .
His point is trying to get rid of government altogether .
Do you think that would be a good way to go ?
Do you think the government right now is just so power - hungry that they ’ll grab at anything , they ’ll cause fear , they ’ll spend money wherever they like to spend money and the Senate and the House wo n’t do anything ?
Do you think it ’s time we changed the government a little bit ?
Rothschild : I believe in government as having a necessary role , both to protect people and also to buffer people from the forces , the cruel forces of the market — in this day and age , the cruel forces of huge corporations .
Now , what Republicans and even some libertarians think is that government is there only to protect us , and what the Bush administration thinks it ’s there for is to give the Pentagon a $ 700 - billion annual allowance and to hand out $ 200 - billion checks in corporate welfare every year .
Now , that ’s not my idea of a positive role for government .
Harris :
It ’s almost — at this point , in this war and at this stage in our history — cliché to say we have to stand up , because when I step back and look , I see fewer and fewer people standing up .
So what are we left with ?
Rothschild :
We absolutely have got to stand up for our rights , right now , before it ’s too late .
Several of the people I profiled in this book , “ You Have No Rights , ” stood up for their rights after their rights were violated .
They sued the government or they sued the city police or the Secret Service or the FBI .
And they won .
They won lawsuits and settlements .
And so , that ’s the way to go .
Otherwise Bush is going to keep taking and taking and taking until we ’ve got nothing left .
We ca n’t be afraid that they ’re going to spy on us or that they ’re going to arrest us and therefore not exercise our rights out of fear , because if we do that , we ’ve already surrendered our rights to them .
They ’ve already taken the rights away .
The Bill of Rights [ is ] already shredded .
We ’ve got to make sure that they do n’t continue to shred our rights .
We ’ve got to tell congresspeople , “ Look , get these irresponsible , runaway president and vice president — get them to regard the law as something that they need to follow , and impeach them for not following it .
Scheer :
And not just the vice president and president , but anyone — whether they are Democrat , Republican , libertarian , Green — .
Rothschild :
And it ’s not about payback against Bush and Cheney or anything .
This is about whether we ’re a democracy or not .
We ca n’t have on the books all these oppressive and repressive bits of executive orders or precedents that these people have established already .
Scheer :
The people you talked to , the people you interviewed — are they still happy to be American citizens ?
How angry are they ?
Did they leave the country ?
Rothschild : I talked to a guy named Zakariya Muhammad Reed , whose given name was Edward Eugene Jr. , Edward Eugene Reed Jr. He lived in Toledo , Ohio , for 20 years .
He was in the National Guard .
For 11 years he ’s been a firefighter there in Toledo .
He converted to Islam .
He married a woman from Lebanon whose family went to Toronto .
Five times in the last eight months he ’s been stopped coming back from Canada by Immigration .
He said it would ’ve been OK to stop him once and see who he was .
He understands the risks we face in this country .
But to stop him and harass him five times — and this was harassment .
One of the guards told him , “ We should do with these guys what we do with them in Iraq .
We should put hoods over their heads and zip - tie their hands . ”
And then another person who was asking him questions , interrogating him , said , “ What about this letter to the editor you wrote to the Toledo Blade . ”
And the letter he had written to the Toledo Blade that the guy had in front of him was criticizing the Bush administration , saying , “ If you want to know why the United States has a bad reputation overseas , why do n’t you look at the Bush administration ’s war against Iraq and the Bush Administration ’s support for Israel ’s war against Lebanon and its oppression of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza ? ”
And so the guy , the interrogator , says , “ So , you like to write letters to the editor ? ”
Well , you ca n’t write a letter to the editor in this country ?
What ’s that about ?
And the fifth time he was stopped — I wrote about him after he was stopped four times .
And then the fifth time he was stopped he was asked about that article on Progressive.org that Rothschild wrote .
The guys are watching every word the guy is saying .
[ Chuckling . ]
Scheer :
Is this guy still happy ?
Rothschild : No , he is not happy .
Scheer : OK .
Rothschild :
He is outraged about what ’s happened to his country .
He said this is not the country he believed in .
This is not the country he served in the National Guard for .
“ What has become of our country ? ” he asks .
And that ’s a tough question to answer .
Scheer :
It seems like we are creating even more enemies .
You know , we talk about stupid things like little threats , sleeper cells , or whatever .
We ’re creating terrorism in this country by making these people feel like fifth - class citizens .
Rothschild :
We ’re really infuriating people in this country who are Muslim - American or Arab - American and are harassed repeatedly when they are crossing the borders .
The ACLU has filed a lawsuit , a class - action suit , with many of these people who just can’t believe the way they ’re being treated .
Harris :
What has been the most consequential change , either in loss of freedom or just change in American citizenry in general ?
Rothschild : Two of the most flagrant things that George W. Bush has done , impeachable offenses , are the NSA spying , the spying by the National Security Agency , and then these signing statements .
The spying by the National Security Agency :
They ’re not supposed to spy on American citizens here at home unless the exclusive means by which they are supposed to spy on us according to the law is by first getting a warrant at the FISA court .
And Bush signed a document every 45 days that said that he did n’t need to follow that law .
He was going to have the National Security Agency spy on U.S. citizens anyway .
I mean , that is as flagrant a violation of the law as you can imagine .
And the other thing is these signing statements , so - called .
More than 750 times Bush has signed the law but rather than see that that law is faithfully executed , he puts a little asterisk underneath his signature and says , “ I ’m going to enforce this law only to the extent that it does n’t interfere with my powers as commander in chief as I interpret them or as I interpret the Constitution in other ways . ”
Harris :
There must have been an asterisk for Scooter Libby as well .
Rothschild : There ’s that whole Scooter Libby commutation .
There ’s the U.S. prosecutors .
I mean , he ’s using the U.S. Attorney ’s Office to file bogus charges against Democrats so that he can change the outcome of elections .
This guy has no respect whatsoever for democracy .
Scheer : … [ W ] ith 9/11 happening , not many people stood up and said maybe these — like the Patriot Act — maybe these things were n’t right .
And the ones who did , some of them have left office .
[ Former U.S. Sen . ]
Max Cleland .
And there ’s [ former Rep . ]
Helen Chenoweth , who has now passed away , but she fought the strip searches on airplanes , and things like that .
These rights have been going away for a long , long time .
It ’s not just the four years in Iraq .
Especially after 9/11 , with the Muslims who could n’t sue because of their jobs being lost .
“ Look , 9/11 has just happened .
There ’s nothing we ’re going to do . ”
I would like more people to stand up , in Congress .
Rothschild : I ’m happy to have Russ Feingold — most of the time — as my senator .
He ’s the only senator to oppose the Patriot Act , at 98 to 1 .
I ’m a little upset right now because he just came out with a statement that he ’s not for impeachment , even though he admits that Bush and Cheney probably have committed impeachable offenses .
He does n’t want to go forward because he says we ’ve got more important things to do .
In my mind , restoring our democracy is the most important thing we need to do .
Scheer : Is David Obey your congressman ?
Rothschild : No , David Obey is north of here .
Scheer : OK .
Rothschild : I ’m happy with my congressman , too , Tammy Baldwin …
Scheer : Oh , OK .
Rothschild : … who ’s the first out lesbian to be elected to the House of Representatives and a wonderful person and a big defender of civil liberty .
She originally signed onto the John Conyers bill that he put forward when he was in the minority and the Democrats did n’t have the House , a bill to explore grounds of impeachment .
But I do n’t know that she ’s on the impeachment bandwagon just yet .
There ’s a huge groundswell of support at the grass roots for impeachment .
The latest poll I saw said that 45 percent of the American public wanted the impeachment of Bush and 54 percent were in favor of impeaching Cheney .
And this is before any leading Democrat has come out for impeachment .
Dennis Kucinich , of course , has filed a bill to impeach Dick Cheney , but Nancy Pelosi says it ’s off the table , Harry Reid wo n’t talk about it , the other presidential leading candidates wo n’t talk about it .
But the people want it , and that is a hopeful sign , because the people know what abuses — at least they have an idea of the kinds of abuses that Bush and Cheney have committed .
So if 45 percent want to impeach Bush and 54 percent want to impeach Cheney without any leadership whatsoever from the Democratic Party muckety - mucks , you can imagine — .
Once we turn over a few more stones and see some more of the ugly little squirmy things that these guys have done , I think there ’s going to be even louder noises clamoring for impeachment .
Scheer :
It ’s funny because with the Democrats not taking leadership , they obviously do n’t learn , or they ca n’t figure it out because this is how the Contract With America , Newt Gingrich , came about , and this is probably going to end up the same way .
Harris : Standing up is becoming an overlooked exercise , and as much as we sit here and talk about the need for the American public to stand up and stand together and speak out for your rights , it is becoming a difficult task , because we ’re seeing that those people that stand up are often ignored and overlooked .
But perhaps if the American public were more vocal in the days after 9/11 , if we call to task those congressmen and women that were so willing to give George Bush the ability to start a war in Iraq , we would n’t be in this situation that we ’re in today .
So we ca n’t forget about the power of standing up and speaking out .
It is so important .
Rothschild : Right .
And where were the Democrats when the Military Commissions
Act was passed just last fall .
They could ’ve filibustered that bill .
That bill passed only by a couple of votes , three votes .
They decided not to , and that is a hugely reactionary piece of legislation that gives the president the right to call anybody in this country an enemy combatant , and if you ’re not a U.S. citizen , you ’re thrown into jail and you never get to see a lawyer or a judge again .
You can languish there forever .
And that really is not our system of government .
We need to get back to a democratic system of government .
We ’re getting increasingly close to a monarchical form of government where we have a king and the king does whatever he wants .
Scheer : I just want to say something about impeachment , though , to go against that .
Because the term is ending very soon we should also make very sure that the candidate that you are electing , that our vote ’s going to , that they ’re not for taking away our rights .
Because we know with Hillary Clinton , her stands on war .
She ’s playing the tough card , and people like that .
That we should focus our energy and find out what these people really stand for and make sure those questions are asked .
And hopefully some journalist out there will ask them .
Rothschild : Yeah .
I would hope in some of these debates that these huge civil liberties issues that are right staring us in the eye would get some attention from the people who would be president , who are running for president .
Harris : Matthew Rothschild , author of the new book “ You Have No Rights . ”
Matthew , I told you you were going to get us fired up tonight .
Rothschild :
Well , it did n’t take much to get me going .
I really appreciate the opportunity to talk with you on this really crucial issue , though .
Harris :
Thank you for joining us and good luck with your book .
Rothschild :

Mag : Many Republicans no longer interested in Rove 's theories Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday May 29 , 2007 Print This Email
This Conservatives are despondent with President Bush and his top political adviser , Karl Rove , accusing them of abandoning the Republican party 's principles , as they look toward possible defeat in 2008 , according to a new article in The New Yorker .
A former Oklahoma congressman , Mickey Edwards , told the magazine that the Bush administration " has shown itself to be completely incompetent " in expanding its power and mismanaging the war in Iraq .
" This administration is beyond the pale in terms of arrogance and incompetence , " Edwards , who left Congress in 1993 , told The New Yorker .
" This guy thinks he 's a monarch , and that 's scary as hell . "
Newt Gingrich , who is mulling a run for the White House , says the " maniacally dumb " strategy pursued by White House adviser Karl Rove in the last presidential race cost President Bush all of his political capital and has left the Republican party in a shambles , Jeffrey Goldberg reports for the magazine .
Gingrich said President Bush was unable to positively build on his last election victory because Rove was running a campaign that focused primarily on attacking John Kerry , rather than promoting the president 's conservative ideology .
" All he proved was that the anti-Kerry vote was bigger than the anti-Bush vote , " Gingrich said .
Former Majority Leader Tom DeLay , who resigned under indictment on campaign finance - related charges in Texas , also has grown dissatisfied with the president 's stewardship of the conservative movement .
DeLay told Goldberg that in coming years , when he is not fighting the Texas indictment , he plans to build a conservative grass - roots movement to rival MoveOn.org , insisting that divine inspiration brought him to that quest .
" God has spoken to me , " DeLay said .
" I listen to God , and what I 've heard is that I 'm supposed to devote myself to rebuilding the conservative base of the Republican party , and I think we should n't be underestimated . "
EXCERPTS FROM THE NEW YORKER : # Conservative leaders have always entertained suspicions about George W. Bushs conservative credentials in part because his father raised taxes while President , and in part because  compassionate conservatism ,  which was a mantra of Bushs 2000 campaign , sounded to some dangerously like big - government conservatism .
DeLays willingness to spend tax money in order to keep his party in power came as a surprise to those who believed that he was a doctrinaire , limited - government conservative .
 Bush was never a conservative , but Tom DeLay was one of us and he betrayed us ,  Richard Viguerie , a founder of the modern conservative movement , says .
 Hes like a lot of these guys .
They campaign against the cesspool .
 Ill clean up the cesspool of government ,  but after a while they all say ,  I made a mistake it wasnt a cesspool , it was a hot tub . 
That s what they called him , you know , Hot Tub Tom . 
Viguerie , whose new book is called  Conservatives Betrayed : How George W. Bush and Other Big Government Republicans Hijacked the Conservative Cause ,  told me how the conservative movement has been undermined :  It s not any one thing , but , when you add everything up , what you have is a massive overreach of executive powers , and massive overspending by people who claim they re conservatives .
Every President , with hardly any exceptions , will take as much power as he gets .
That s what Presidents do .
Bush has tried more than most .
And it was supposed to be the Republicans in Congress who would do oversight of the President , so that he wouldnt get away with too much abuse of power .
But they abdicated that role .
It was all about the maintenance of power , and now look where they are .
He continued ,  This President has strengths and weaknesses , but he has a major character flaw , and thats that he will brook no criticism and his people wont , either .
And the whole Party gave in to him on that .

If you ’re hiking through Italy ’s Northern mountains over the next 20 years , do n’t be surprised if you run across this 200 foot tall pink bunny :
An art group from Vienna designed this massive toy , claiming it was “ knitted by dozens of grannies out of pink wool ” .
Sounded like complete you - know - what until I saw the bunny for myself via satellite .
I ’m sure Italy ’s taxpayers are proud .
The intent of the project was to make climbers smile and provide them somewhere to lay back and relax :
Interested in climbing on this bunny ?
First consider :
Who wants to lay on a plush doll that ’s been in the rain for 20 years ?
How fun is a dead bunny that is a casualty of a skydiving accident ?
They designed it to look like it had fallen from the sky … complete with an open mouth and organs strewn to the side
I ’ll stick to taking pictures from the side .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@dcaclu.org
WASHINGTON - The American Civil Liberties Union today applauded the Senate Appropriations Committee ’s decision to cut funding for the Community Based Abstinence Education ( CBAE ) program and raise funding for the family planning program Title X .
In a markup Tuesday , subcommittee members voted to decrease CBAE by $ 28 million and increase Title X by $ 16 million , a move the full committee ratified today .
" Over the years , Congress has allocated well over half a billion dollars for programs that focus exclusively on abstinence and censor vital information that can help young people make responsible decisions about sexual activity , " said Caroline Fredrickson , director the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" While the discussion of abstinence is an important component of any educational program about human sexuality , federally funded programs that focus exclusively on abstinence have been shown not to work , and raise civil liberties concerns .
Given the current fiscal environment and the lack of evidence to support such programs , we believe it would be irresponsible for Congress to allocate new tax dollars towards abstinence - only programs . "
On the other hand , Title X , the national family planning program , is a public health success story .
Clinics funded by Title X have long been an important part of our nation ’s public health system , providing not only family planning services but also basic and preventive health care to low - income individuals .
Title X services prevent unintended pregnancies , promote pre- and post-natal health , lower rates of sexually transmitted diseases , and improve women ’s health .
For every public dollar invested in family planning , three dollars are saved in Medicaid costs for pregnancy and newborn care alone .
The ACLU urges Congressional leadership to continue efforts to eliminate funding for CBAE and instead invest in programs , such as Title X , that protect and promote public health .

LOLPython
Combining the cuteness of LOLCODE and the cuddliness of Python I bring you ....
LOLPython !
WHATZ LOLPython ?
Example code to generate all Fibonacci numbers less than a given value of N . Max value is 100 if N is not given on the command line .
Idea derives from original lolcode implementation by Kieran O'Niell .

% python lolpython.py loltests.lol UNIT TESTS R LEET !
READYSETGO !!! ...........
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 11 tests in 0.001s OK
and in action ( you must first install the most excellent PLY package ) :
It works by coverting the LOLPython code into Python .
The converted Fibonacci in Python is : Like all modern software should , LOLPython has unit tests
Import , classes , iterators , generators , exceptions , comparison , operators .. most of Python is supported by LOLPython .
Not everything , so free free to add the rest .
It 's in the public domain so you can do whatever you want .
Just do n't complain if / when it does n't work .
I am a consultant so if you want to pay me to maintain it , let me know :) .
Using LOLPython on the command line Run a program from stdin % echo " VISIBLE ' HAI WORLD !' " | python lolpython .py HAI WORLD ! %
Translate a program from stdin into Python on stdout % echo " COMPLAIN ' HAI WORLD !' " | python lolpython .py -- convert # LOLPython to Python converter version 1.0 # Written by Andrew Dalke , who should have been working on better things .

get ( C , 0 ) + 1 LETTERZ [ C ] =
N for C in sorted ( LETTERZ ) : print repr ( C ) , LETTERZ [ C ] #
The end .
Implementation
I started with the GardenSnake parser I wrote last year , because it could handle Python 's indentation grammar .
Pulled out the parser component so there 's only a lexer .
The converter is quite simple .
It reads the LOLPython tokens and converts each one to Python code .
The only hard part is that " ! " or " OK " act as close " ) " , " } " or " ] " to match whichever was the most recent opening form .
Indeed , you could say that LOLPython is a Python macro .
But then the Lisp people might get mad at me .
I take it back .
The hard part was figuring out the LOLPython grammar so it would be reasonably cute and cover most of Python .
Future
Ha !
Ha - ha - ha - ha !
I 've had enough with this project .
But if you want to make changes , go ahead .
Some thoughts : improved error reporting , preserve original indentation , finish support for all of Python , add an import hook for " .lol " files , add missing unit tests , improve the grammar , fix predecence bugs ( like " AINT GOOD " -> " assert not " where the " not " does n't have the right strength ) , and write a converter from Python to LOLPython .

Economy Health Care is not a Commodity By Ryan McGreal
Published July 16 , 2007
With the release of Michael Moore 's new documentary , Sicko , the on- again , off - again debate in the US over public vs. private health care has flared up again .
It behooves Canadians to pay attention to this debate , because the same people who , in the US , stand to lose the most if that country adopts universal health care also stand to gain the most if Canada abandons it .
As usual , there is far more heat than light in the debate ; and most arguments come down to dogma .
The dogma of private health care is that whatever the government can do , the market can do better .
Among those people who trumpet the dogma of market efficiency , mere facts can rarely penetrate their certainty ( and in any case , it 's not hard to throw so much sand that no one knows what the facts really are anyway ) .
In any case , even if we accept the dogma of market efficiency on its face , a strong argument can be made that delivering health care is simply a poor candidate for market forces because health care itself is a poor candidate as a commodity .
The principal economic incentive for an insurer is to collect premiums but not pay out benefits .
This manifests in co-pays , user fees , risk selection , and service denial for pre-existing conditions - i.e. conditions that are most likely to require medical intervention .
Right off the bat , treating health care as a commodity tends to mis-allocate spending away from where it is most needed .
Single payer health care is better at prevention and early detection .
For - profit drug and surgery providers want to maximize treatment , not prevention , and then insurers respond by finding ways to disallow coverage .
The result is an ineffective mishmash of heroic , costly last - minute interventions for those with top - tier coverage and either inconsistent , haphazard service or actual denial of service for lower tiers .
Single payer health care rations spending based on medical need , not based on ability to pay .
Therefore , limited health care resources are allocated more efficiently to where they are needed most .
Single payer health care has much less bureaucratic waste [ PDF ] .
Because companies do n't have to worry about who 's going to pay , whole business units are eliminated or severely scaled back , and administrative costs drop dramatically .
Single payer health care does n't waste money on profit .
Profit is money that goes into the health care system but does not provide health care .
It 's pure waste , especially since other aspects of for - profit health care add far more inefficiency than market forces can reduce .
Because medicine is so complex , it 's hard for patients to make informed decisions on purchasing care .
To function efficiently , markets require informed , rational agents to negotiate contracts , but the information ratio between patients and providers will always be unbalanced .
Doctors and patients should have the final say on medical treatment , not accountants and auditors .
American doctors frequently complain that insurers second - guess or overrule their decisions , but the doctors are the experts .
Health care is intrinsically labour - intensive .
It requires people to deliver and administer , so market - imposed efficiencies cannot significantly improve labour productivity .
It is impossible to shop around for a health care provider during a medical emergency .
If you suddenly discover that the procedure you need is not covered , or that your insurer does n't operate in the jurisdiction where you are having your emergency , you are out of luck .
Markets do some things very well ; they do other things well when properly regulated ; some things they can not do at all .
An overwhelming majority of Americans supports single payer health care and has done so for a very long time , despite the near - absence of any media reports supporting or endorsing it .
If markets always gave people what they wanted , then the US would have a market - based universal health care system .
The fact is that market forces by themselves cannot produce universal health care , since the market by definition will not allocate resources where they do no return a profit .
That means sick and poor people are inexorably far less likely to receive health coverage than healthy and rich people .

The following apology was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday July 12 2007
After numerous invasive tests , three rounds of IVF , and a complicated and difficult pregnancy , my husband and I are expecting our first baby in a few weeks ' time .
It will be a long - anticipated arrival for us and a first grandchild for my husband 's parents .
Despite this , the birth will also bring with it a storm of family controversy , my first act as a mother being to fly in the face of centuries of tradition and ( according to various members of our families ) deprive the baby of its birthright , emasculate my husband , cheat on my marriage vows and risk raising a man-hating , hairy - legged radical .
What could possibly cause such consternation ?
Well , if the baby is a girl , I intend to give her my surname .
When I started going out with the man who is now my husband , it was immediately clear that , however compatible our personalities , our names were never going to work together .
I am Appleby , he is Appleyard .
" That rules out the double - barrelled option , should it come to that , " commented a friend .
Two years later , we decided to get married .
Despite us both having a healthy tolerance of public ridicule , Appleby - Appleyard was never considered a viable surname option .
Combining the names gave us Applebeard , which was marginally worse .
I immediately discarded the conventional solution - that I should change my name to that of my husband .
From the time my peers started getting married after university , I have been amazed that intelligent , educated women of my generation still change their surnames to that of their husband .
Some I know did so with a half - hearted apology - " I never liked my name " ; " His name is more distinctive " ; " It does n't matter to me . "
Surprisingly , though , the men never seemed to prefer the names of the women they were marrying and it always mattered to them .
The women who did keep their own names often cited professional recognition as a reason .
For me , it was more fundamental than that .
A name is part of your identity , and , after 32 years as an Appleby , I saw no reason to change part of who I was to fit in with a conventional naming system based on a woman being part of her husband 's estate .
The reasons people cited to persuade me to change my name were less than compelling : " People might think you are n't married " ( Why should I care ? ) ; " It will cause confusion when booking holidays " ( I give both our names - how is this confusing ? ) ; " People might address Nick as Mr Appleby . "
The concept that I should permanently take on my husband 's surname to negate the horrific possibility that he might occasionally be addressed by mine was indicative of the level of equality in debate on the matter .
In general , people accepted the Appleby / Appleyard alliance , but , five years on , when two blue lines marked the start of our new life as parents , the incompatibility of our names again became an issue .
Initially , my husband took the conventional stance .
" But all children are named after their fathers , " he said .
Luckily he did n't expect the " tradition " argument to hold much sway with me .
If we never moved on from the way things have been done , we would still attend public hangings , burn witches and my marriage pledge would have included a promise to obey .
The issue remained unresolved as the minuscule bundle of cells grew a tail , lost a tail , developed a liver , kidneys and eyes , and began to move its tiny limbs .
The solution arrived unexpectedly one evening , as I tried to throw out a potted tree , which had resembled a scorched stick for the last two seasons .
My husband has an endearing sentimentality for dead plants , and can nurture them lovingly long after most people would have tossed them in the compost sack .
In fact , I suspect he prefers plants dead , as the water and plant food often start being administered only after the souls of the plants have long since departed to the great green forest in the sky .
" It 'll bounce back to life in the spring , " he said , wresting it away from my murderous gardening gloves .
" Do you want to bet ? " I said , looking disbelievingly at the withered leaves and desiccated stem .
" I bet you the surname of our children . "
And there it was .
A wonderful suggestion .
A solution that was gender - neutral , fair , equal , the result easily determined .
And , most importantly , a bet I had already resoundingly won .
The tree was as dead as a doornail .
Through the winter , as our zygote blossomed into a foetus , opened its eyes , grew legs and learned to use them to kick me painfully in the bladder , the Surname Tree sat leafless and shootless .
Spring arrived , my bump expanded and swelled , other trees sprouted buds , then leaves , but the Surname Tree remained bare and frozen , lost in a permanent winter .
Eventually my husband conceded that the bet was lost , and the tree was dead .
In turn I conceded Appleyard to any future son , but if our child was female I stood my ground .
Our daughter would take my surname .
Given that I am the only woman in either of our families who kept her own name on marriage , I did n't expect a groundswell of understanding and support from our nearest and dearest on the announcement that our baby would be an Appleby if a girl .
Even so , I was impressed by the level of prejudice this engendered .
My sister - in - law , for instance , who for years insisted on addressing me as Mrs Appleyard , could be relied on for a good , balanced , Daily Mail opinion .
" You wo n't really let her emasculate you to that extent ? " she said to my husband .
I 'm not sure if I was more bemused by her assumption that a man is emasculated by his daughter taking her mother 's name , or by her implication that this was the final straw in a long process of emasculation to which my husband had been subjected .
Even my normally balanced brother gave a sharp intake of breath .
" Do you really think you 'll go through with it ? " he asked , as though I was planning an unassisted ascent of K2 .
My father - in - law took the whole thing more seriously , possibly as , lacking any daughters , he naively thought he might be able to influence events to his own satisfaction .
" What was the point of you getting married ? " he growled , obviously regretting his contribution to the reception drinks .
" You might as well have just been living together . "
I had obviously completely misinterpreted the function of marriage .
Dazzled by the romantic ideal of staying loyal and looking after each other for life , I missed the small print about naming any baby after its father .
My mother , with perhaps a greater understanding of my stubborn streak , was resigned but pragmatic .
She offered her gardening services to the Surname Tree , hoping that a bit of careful pruning might restore the plant to life .
If my husband won the bet , the child could get its father 's name and the world could be restored to its natural order without anyone losing face .
Despite the unanimous opinion that our daughter should take her father 's name , none of my family believes that his name - Appleyard - should be anything but a temporary solution .
She should be called Appleyard only until she marries , when she would take on the name of her new husband , whatever that might turn out to be .
To me , this is n't to grant her a name , but a temporary label , and she deserves better than that .
I am not someone who enjoys a fight .
I like the easy life .
I 'm desperately disappointed that previous generations of women have n't sorted out an equal and generally accepted solution to the issue of names to save me the trouble .
They fought battles over other sexist labels .
We 've gone beyond the days when it was acceptable for a man to address a woman as " love " or " dear " .
Ms was coined to prevent women having to disclose their marital status to every double - glazing or insurance salesman who takes down her details , but it would take a brave bigot to deny that our system for naming children is still fundamentally unjust .
To pass this injustice on to my daughter for the sake of an easy life would be to fail in my first breath as a mother .
My daughter might not care whether she carries her mother 's or father 's name .
Many years from now , if she gets married , she might decide to take her husband 's name .
On the other hand , she might be proud to be one of the only women of her generation able to boast a name of her own , one inherited from her mother , intended for her for life , and one she might one day pass on to her daughters .
I truly hope so .

Daylight saving does n't save energy ABC Science Online
Ryan Kellogg and Hendrik Wolff , two PhD candidates from the
In other studies , mostly based on simulations , researchers have estimated that extending daylight saving could cut electricity demand from 0.6 % to 3.5 % , the authors say .
Given this , environmental concerns and the high cost of fuel are pushing countries to consider starting daylight saving earlier .
The US , for example , started daylight saving this week , three weeks earlier than normal , to cut energy consumption by 1 % .
But Kellogg and Wolff challenge whether such moves save energy by studying Australia 's experience around the time of the 2000 Olympics .
For their experiment , they compared energy use in the states of Victoria and South Australia around the time that Sydney , New South Wales , was hosting the Games .
Normally , those three states switch to Daylight Saving Time in late October , but that year Victoria and New South Wales started in late August to facilitate the Olympics .
Facing rural opposition , however , neighbouring South Australia kept its start date in October .
Kellogg and Wolff looked at detailed data on half - hourly electricity consumption , prices , and weather conditions in Victoria and South Australia during September and October .
For each state , they compared energy use during that time with energy use in the previous year , ignoring the two weeks of the Olympics .
" Our results show that the extension failed to conserve electricity , " they write in a working paper for the university 's
" The point estimates suggest that energy consumption increased rather than decreased , and that the within - day usage pattern changed substantially , leading to a high morning peak load . "
These findings match the expected effects of daylight saving on people 's behaviour , the US scientists write .
" Less lighting and heating are required in the evening ; however , demand increases in the morning - particularly from 07:00 to 08:00 - driven by reduced sunlight and lower temperatures . "
Overall , these two effects cancel each other out , they say .
Saying ' yes ' , then ' no ' , then ' yes ' again
Daylight saving has had a turbulent history in Australia .
It was introduced across the country in 1917 as a wartime fuel saving measure , but public opposition saw it abandoned the same year .
It was introduced again in 1942 and 1943 - 44 , but there was no Daylight Saving Time after World War II until Tasmania introduced it in 1967 .
New South Wales , Victoria , Queensland , South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory adopted Daylight Saving Time in 1971 .
But Queensland abandoned it in 1972 , reintroduced it in 1989 , only to abandon it again after a referendum in 1992 .
Starting daylight saving a couple of months early does n't seem to cut energy consumption , as many of its supporters claim .
Ryan Kellogg and Hendrik Wolff , two PhD candidates from the University of California , Berkeley , wanted to test the popular idea that lengthening the period when clocks are put forward will reduce electricity use by delivering an extra hour of evening daylight .
In other studies , mostly based on simulations , researchers have estimated that extending daylight saving could cut electricity demand from 0.6 % to 3.5 % , the authors say .
Given this , environmental concerns and the high cost of fuel are pushing countries to consider starting daylight saving earlier .
The US , for example , started daylight saving this week , three weeks earlier than normal , to cut energy consumption by 1 % .

Normally , those three states switch to Daylight Saving Time in late October , but that year Victoria and New South Wales started in late August to facilitate the Olympics .
Facing rural opposition , however , neighbouring South Australia kept its start date in October .
Kellogg and Wolff looked at detailed data on half - hourly electricity consumption , prices , and weather conditions in Victoria and South Australia during September and October .
For each state , they compared energy use during that time with energy use in the previous year , ignoring the two weeks of the Olympics .
" Our results show that the extension failed to conserve electricity , " they write in a working paper for the university 's Energy Institute " The point estimates suggest that energy consumption increased rather than decreased , and that the within - day usage pattern changed substantially , leading to a high morning peak load .
" These findings match the expected effects of daylight saving on people 's behaviour , the US scientists write .
" Less lighting and heating are required in the evening ; however , demand increases in the morning - particularly from 07:00 to 08:00 - driven by reduced sunlight and lower temperatures .
" Overall , these two effects cancel each other out , they say .
Daylight saving has had a turbulent history in Australia .
It was introduced across the country in 1917 as a wartime fuel saving measure , but public opposition saw it abandoned the same year .
It was introduced again in 1942 and 1943 - 44 , but there was no Daylight Saving Time after World War II until Tasmania introduced it in 1967 .
New South Wales , Victoria , Queensland , South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory adopted Daylight Saving Time in 1971 .
But Queensland abandoned it in 1972 , reintroduced it in 1989 , only to abandon it again after a referendum in 1992 .

You ’ve spent hours setting up your blog on your favorite blog platform just right .
Good for you !
So how do you maintain your blog so that it remains at the top of its game ?
It turns out , there are a large number of free web utilities useful for improving your blog ’s effectiveness outside of your blog engine .
Everytime I come across one of these useful utilities , I bookmark it to my Blog Utilities folder .
This folder is my blogger utility belt , full of tools to meet every need when composing blog posts or optimizing my site for bandwidth and speed .
I ’ve chosen to focus on web utilities as they are quick and easy to use — no installation required .
This is not a comprehensive list by far , as I am sure there are many others out there .
Let me know what I missed in the comments .
Optimization
The first three tools in this category are all website speed testers , but each offers something different , so I ’ve listed them all .
Web Page Analyzer
This tool is fairly comprehensive and may be the only one you really need for website speed analysis .
Includes stats on every file and object downloaded and provides approximate download times for different connection rates .
OctaGate Site Timer
I did n’t find this one to be as accurate as the first one because it attempted to download images referenced in my CSS files that were commented out .
However , it provides a nicer graphical output that marks when the request was started , when it connected , and the time when the first and last bytes were received .
It also highlights 404 errors in red , which is handy for finding missing files or bad URLs .
HttpZip Compression Checker
Use this to check whether files from your website are being served with HTTP Compression on or off .
Thanks to Jeff Atwood for pointing me to this one ( among others ) .
Dynamic Drive Online Image Optimizer if you ’re hardcore about your image compression , you should check out Ken Silverman ’s Utility Page .
But if you ’re like me and just want a quick and easy web based utility for compressing images , this is your site .
It can convert gif , jpg , and png files up to 300 kb .
It will also do conversions to other image types and display multiple results at various color levels and compression rates so you can pick the best one for your needs .
Javascript Minimizer
This is an extremely simple tool .
Paste in your javascript and click the button and reduce the size of your javascripts .
CSS Minimizer Just like the Javascript minimizer , but for Cascading Style Sheets .
Statistics and Search Engine Optimization
Get a handle on your web traffic with these sites .
Website Grader Gives your website a score in an attempt measure its effectiveness .
Shows your PageRank , meta info , domain info , technoratic stats , etc …
It generates a really neat report card for your blog .
Google Webmaster Central
An absolute essential tool for those who care about users finding their site via Google .
Especially pay attention to the Webmaster tools which include Sitemap support .
Google Analytics
A free and full featured analytics package for your blog or website .
Add some javascript to your page template and you ’re in information overload land , but done up with nice charts and graphs .
103 bees Search traffic analysis
Unlike other stats packages , this one is focused purely on natural search engine traffic analytics .
What are users searching for when they land on your site ?
This is a nice complement to Google Analytics .
And it ’s free !
One caveat is that the script can be slow sometimes , which can play havoc with CSS based designs .
Technorati
It ’s so obvious , I almost forgot to list it .
Register , claim your blog , and find out who is linking to you .
You can add a little script to your blog that displays how many other posts link to yours .
Alexa.com
The beauty of this site is that you can easily compare your website ’s reach with several other websites on a single graph , thus starting a huge pissing contest .
Spicing Up Your Posts With Images
Wikipedia Public Domain Image Resources Images can bring a blog post to life .
But rather than worrying about receiving a cease and desist letter for misusing copyrighted material , why not use images that are part of the Public Domain ?
This page is chock full of links to resources for free images .
* PicFindr Despite it ’s “ Oh so Web 2.0 ” name ( must everything end in a consonant plus “ r ” these days ?
At least it does n’t have * BETA anywhere ) , this tool is really great .
It will search a set of free photo sites such as Stock.xchng , for free photographs .
Flickr Creative Commons
Still have n’t found that picture that just hits the point you ’re trying to make ?
Try the Flickr Creative Commons search engine .
Remember , these photos are not public domain .
You do need to abide by the license .
But for the most part , the licenses are pretty lenient for you to reuse the photos in your own blog .
Open Clip Art Library - Maybe you want your image to be iconic rather than photographic .
Check out this free Public Domain clip art library to find an icon for every occasion .
UPDATE 2019 - 12 - 12 :
This site seems to be permanently down .
Try Free Clip Safari instead WP Clipart Another Public Domain clip art library , though the quality tends to be less than the Open Clip Art Library .
Create and Improve Your Content
Cliche Finder
Try to avoid using too many tired old cliches by running your post through this web based utility .
HallwayTesting.com
This is a fantastic site for basic hallway usability testing .
Just submit your URL and real people will post comments with criticisms and praise for your site .
The more specific you are about what you want testers to focus on , the better quality the feedback .
Try it out .
Syndication
FeedBurner -
This one gets special mention because it fits in so many categories .
It ’ll help optimize your bandwidth by serving your RSS feeds for you .
Also , it includes a basic free stats package as well as a premium stats package that can replace Google Analytics .
FeedBurner can also provide features your blogging platform might not , such as subscribing to RSS Feeds via email .
Special Mention
As I mentioned before , this post is focusing on web utilities .
However , these two utilities are so essential , I just had to break my own rule and list them .
Firebug Firefox Add -on
Ok , this breaks my rule as it is n’t technically a website , but it is a FireFox browser plugin so it might as well be a website , right ?
Well in any case , this tool is too important not to mention .
It has it all .
It can be used to time your websites download speeds , view the underlying HTTP information , measure the size of each file .
Add to that a great Javascript debugger and CSS and DOM explorer .
This is a must have tool .
Windows Live Writer I broke my rule again .
This tool wo n’t help you write better content , but it ’ll help you have fun doing it .
Also , all the plugins available make it easy to add a little extra oomph to your blog posts by including Flickr images , formatted code , etc …
Again , I ’m sure I missed someone ’s favorite tool hear , so please let me know what I missed in the comments .
And if you do , let me know which tool you ’d remove from this list in order to add yours .
I ’ll try following up at a later time with an improved list .
But the Koran also orders Muslims to resist oppression , as verses 190 and 191 of Chapter 2 ( The Cow ) instruct : “ Fight in the cause of Allah with those who fight with you , but do not transgress limits ; for Allah loveth not transgressors .
And slay them wherever ye catch them , and turn them out from where they have turned you out , for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter .

In the typical car bombing , some Islamists say , God will identify those who deserve to die — for example , anyone helping the enemy — and send them to hell .
The other victims will go to paradise .
“ The innocent who is hurt , he wo n’t suffer , ” Dr. Massari says .
“ He becomes a martyr himself . ”
There is one gray area .
If you are a Muslim who has sinned , getting killed by a suicide bomber will clean some of your slate for Judgment Day , but precisely where God draws the line between those who go to heaven or hell is not spelled out .
Rule No. 2 : You can kill children , too , without needing to feel distress .
True , Islamic texts say it is unlawful to kill children , women , the old and the infirm .
In the Sahih Bukhari , a respected collection of sermons and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad , verse 4:52:257 refers to Ghazawat , a battle in which Muhammad took part .
“ Narrated Abdullah : During some of the Ghazawat of the Prophet a woman was found killed .
Allah ’s Apostle disapproved the killing of women and children . ”
But militant Islamists including extremists in Jordan who embrace Al Qaeda ’s ideology teach recruits that children receive special consideration in death .
They are not held accountable for any sins until puberty , and if they are killed in a jihad operation they will go straight to heaven .
There , they will instantly age to their late 20s , and enjoy the same access to virgins and other benefits as martyrs receive .
Islamic militants are hardly alone in seeking to rationalize innocent deaths , says John O. Voll , a professor of Islamic history at Georgetown University .
“ Whether you are talking about leftist radicals here in the 1960s , or the apologies for civilian collateral damage in Iraq that you get from the Pentagon , the argument is that if the action is just , the collateral damage is justifiable , ” he says .
Rule No. 3 : Sometimes , you can single out civilians for killing ; bankers are an example .
In principle , nonfighters cannot be targeted in a militant operation , Islamist scholars say .
But the list of exceptions is long and growing .
Activists are urging Home Depot , which recently unveiled an environmentally conscious marketing program , to withdraw advertising from Fox News , whose hosts and commentators dismiss global warming as liberal hysteria .
But Home Depot is unswayed , and the environmentalists appear to be doing something they generally discourage : wasting energy .
A short video by Robert Greenwald , “ Fox Attacks : The Environment , ” has been viewed more than 380,000 times since it was posted on YouTube on July 9 .
Like his feature - length “ Outfoxed : Rupert Murdoch ’s War on Journalism , ” the video highlights Fox News clips , in this case experts claiming that global warming caused by pollution is , among other things , a “ hoax . ”
In April , Home Depot introduced an Eco Options label for thousands of products that it deemed environmentally friendly .
“ You ca n’t say we ’re green and give money to an organization that day after day , week after week and month after month says that global warming is something that is made up by a few kooky scientists , ” Mr. Greenwald said .
The problem is the growing appetite for sushi and sashimi outside Japan , not only in the United States but also in countries with new wealth , like Russia , South Korea and China .
And the problem will not go away .
Fishing experts say that the shortages and rising prices will only become more severe as the population of bluefin tuna — the big , slow - maturing type most favored in sushi — fails to keep up with worldwide demand .
Last year , dozens of nations responded by agreeing to reduce annual tuna catches in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean oceans by 20 percent in an effort to stabilize populations .
But the decision only seemed to crystallize growing fears in Japan about tuna shortages , helping to push up prices of the three species of bluefin — northern , Pacific and southern — that are considered the best tuna to eat raw .
Since the start of last year , the average price of imported frozen northern and Pacific bluefin has risen more than a third , to $ 13 a pound , according to Japan ’s Fisheries Agency .
Wholesalers say that competition from foreign fishing fleets and buyers has made the top- quality tuna increasingly hard to come by here .
Tadashi Oono , who sells big red slabs of tuna from a stall in the sprawling Tsukiji fish market of Tokyo , said that three years ago , he routinely sold two or three top - grade bluefin every day .
This year , he said , he sometimes finds only two or three tuna of that quality to sell in a month .

“ THE Russian government , ” David Miliband , Britain 's new , young foreign secretary , told Parliament on Monday July 16th , “ has failed to register either how seriously we treat this case or the seriousness of the issues involved , despite lobbying at the highest level . ”
The case is the murder of Alexander Litvinenko , an ex-KGB agent who was murdered by radioactive poisoning in London last November .
Russia 's failure to treat it with due seriousness , said Mr Miliband , would result in the expulsion of four Russian diplomats from London , the first such evictions since 1996 — prompting widespread if hasty talk of a “ new cold war ” .
In May , British prosecutors announced their intention to prosecute Andrei Lugovoi , another ex-KGB agent , for Litvinenko 's murder .
Mr Lugovoi met Litvinenko in London on November 1st , the day he fell ill ; traces of polonium , the poison that led to his “ horrifying and lingering death ” , as Mr Miliband described it , were found at hotels in which Mr Lugovoi stayed and in aircraft on which he travelled .
But Britain 's request that he be extradited has been denied by the Russians , who cite a ban set out in their constitution on handing over Russian citizens to other countries .
That ban , Vladimir Putin , Russia 's president , has said , makes the extradition request “ foolish ” .
The British case is that , if the Russians really wanted to co-operate — and to be seen to take seriously the obligations that come with freedom of movement for Russians — they would find a way around the constitutional problem , as indeed they have done in some previous cases .
But more generally , the British are cross with Russia 's general failure to co-operate .
The Russians say that , in theory , Mr Lugovoi could be tried in Moscow , but have shown little appetite for that possibility , which in any case would be unsatisfactory , say the British , because of the corrupt and compromised state of the Russian courts .
Still , there is little chance that the diplomatic expulsions , and the other measures announced by Mr Miliband ( including as - yet vague visa restrictions for Russian officials ) will lead to a change of heart in the Kremlin over the extradition .
The motive for them is rather to express the extent of Britain 's anger over the murder of a British subject ( as Mr Litvinenko had become ) , perpetrated in a way that jeopardised the health of hundreds of other people too — anger partly stoked by the possibility that a Russian state agency was involved .
Mr Lugovoi continues to protest his innocence , as he has done since he was first incriminated .
In doing so , and in attempting to finger Britain 's security services for the crime , along with Russian exiles in London such as Boris Berezovsky , he seems to have been doing the bidding of the Russian government .
That , plus the exotic rarity of the poison , has confirmed the suspicion in some quarters that Russia 's Federal Security Service , if not Mr Putin himself , had a hand in the murder .
For all that , the notion of a new cold war is overblown : Russia is no longer exporting a rival ideology , as the Soviet Union did , nor fighting proxy wars with America around the globe .
Yet tensions in the Anglo - Russian relationship , and in Russia 's relations with the West in general , could worsen because of the Litvinenko affair .
Relations with Britain have been strained by Britain 's granting of asylum to Mr Berezovsky and others : last year there was a scandal involving alleged British spying in Moscow ; Britain 's ambassador there had been harassed , allegedly because of his attendance at an opposition conference .
The Russian response to the expulsions — expected on July 17th — may yet escalate matters .
Spokesmen have given warning of “ serious consequences ” and described the British position as “ immoral . ”
If so , that could diminish further the prospects of Russian co-operation over international problems such as the status of Kosovo and Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
Mr Putin this week pulled Russia out of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty , a post - Soviet agreement designed to regulate the conventional military hardware stationed on the continent .
It could also have consequences for British investors in Russia , some of whom — such as BP — have already suffered from the Kremlin 's bullying , extra-legal methods .
Mr Miliband and Gordon Brown , the new prime minister , evidently decided that those risks were outweighed by the danger of doing nothing .

Extra charge for delivery insurance
There are few who would call postal delivery exciting .
The reasons for this attitude are difficult to pin down , but it seems there is something inherent about the meticulous sorting and distribution of various pieces of paper that fails to capture the imagination .
Nevertheless , over the last century there have been those who have wanted to change that : visionaries who looked beyond the truck and mailbag and imagined a means of delivering credit card bills and erotic magazines that would defy the heavens and shake the very Earth itself .
Rarely has history seen a concept so grand , and so impractical , as Rocket Mail .
The promise of rocket mail was an ultra-fast , unmanned mail transport solution that could neatly circumvent obstacles such as forests and bodies of water .
The precise method proposed varied among advocates , but the basic concept was simple and universal .
A rocket , anywhere from a foot in length to the size of an automobile , would be packed with mail and launched towards a target .
Upon reaching its destination , it would be designed to do one of two things : either deploy a parachute and float gently to the delivery site , or , for a much better show , crash and burrow its nose into the ground , ideally with its payload intact .
Assuming it could be perfected , rocket mail would be vastly superior to conventional forms of mail transport .
Experimentation with rocket cargo delivery was a favorite pastime for many tinkerers early in the 20th century , and the practice gradually became refined enough to be taken seriously .
In 1931 , Friedrich Schmiedl started a rocket mail service in Austria after a successful launch of one hundred pieces of mail between two Austrian villages .
Enthused by this exciting new method of delivery , other countries scrambled to follow suit .
Zucker 's 1934 demonstration
But as flashy as it was , the inherent problems with rocket mail rapidly became apparent .
Perhaps most significant was the unfortunate tendency of the rockets to blow up , an issue which could arise at almost any point during the launch , flight , or landing .
A series of highly - publicized failures in the 1930 ’s served to greatly diminish worldwide interest in rocket mail .
One man responsible for more than his share of these was Gerhard Zucker , a German businessman who was determined to bring rocket mail to the world .
Something of a showman and a charlatan , Zucker sold tickets to public launches for which he used large , impressive - looking hulls stuffed with small powder rockets .
His launches were more circus attractions than serious proposals , but they nonetheless attracted some international attention ; in 1934 , he was invited to give a demonstration for officials of the British Royal Mail .
On July 31 of that year , before a distinguished crowd on a beach in Scotland , Zucker lit the fuse that was certain to define his career .
Zucker claimed his rockets could cruise 250 miles at speeds of 2,200 miles per hour⁠ ⁠ — but while the 1200 letters packed into the fuselage that day did indeed travel at a high speed , they did so in many directions at once , and for a rather short distance .
Having failed to impress the British officials with his mail - incinerating rocket , Zucker was deported for “ mail fraud ” back to Germany , where he narrowly escaped commitment to an asylum and was forbidden from further experimenting with rockets .
Assuming a rocket made it off the ground in one piece , it still faced the equally daunting task of accurately finding its target .
A typical approach to this problem was taken by Indian Postal Service employee Stephen Smith , who from 1934 - 44 experimented with launching letters aboard six - foot - long souped - up fireworks .
Smith ’s navigation system , which consisted of pointing the rocket in the general direction of its target , lighting a fuse , and running for cover , was perhaps not up to the demands of a sophisticated postal delivery network .
Still , his launches found some measure of success , and soon he had moved up to tests with parcels , food , and live poultry ( some of the earliest rocketeers ) flown across short distances .
Smith died before taking his ideas much further , but in recognition of his achievements the Indian government issued a stamp in his honor in 1992 , calling him “ the originator of rocket mail in India . ”
Curiously enough , no modern fleet of mail rockets was available to carry the new postage .
These early rockets were certainly innovative , but in terms of their practical abilities they were little more than toys .
To be delivered accurately and reliably over long distances , mail rockets would require a much more advanced hull design and a sophisticated navigation system⁠⁠ — in short , they would need to transform into something more like a cruise missile than a conventional rocket .
And so when the US government got involved in the rocket mail fad several decades later , that was exactly what they did : for a 1959 collaborative experiment between the Department of Defense and the US Post Office Department , an SSM - N - 8 Regulus cruise missile capable of delivering a two megaton thermonuclear warhead over a range of 600 miles was chosen as the letter carrier .
The missile , with its nuclear payload prudently removed beforehand , was loaded with two official mail containers holding 3000 pieces of mail .
From a location off the coast of Virginia , the missile was launched by the USS Barbaro , a Navy submarine .
It touched down twenty - two minutes later at a Naval Auxiliary Air Station in Mayport , Florida , where its intact cargo ( commemorative postal covers addressed to various government officials ) was recovered and sorted at a nearby post office .
Summerfield retrieves the first letter from the Regulus
This success was met with great excitement .
While naysayers quibbled over such details as the wisdom of launching intercontinental cruise missiles to deliver postcards during the height of the Cold War , others were already mapping out a bright future for rocket mail .
“ Before man reaches the moon , ” predicted U.S. Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield , “ mail will be delivered within hours from New York to California , to Britain , to India , or Australia by guided missiles .
We stand on the threshold of rocket mail . ”
It was no accident that the heavily publicized launch also broadcast a bold message about the accuracy of America ’s long - range missile systems .
But as far as the officially stated purpose of the demonstration was concerned , the launch was less successful .
In the end , the Regulus missile experiment only served to underscore the problems with rocket mail .
Using cruise missiles neatly solved most of the issues with navigation and reliability , but at a cost that was somewhat difficult to justify ⁠⁠— computers of the day were primitive , but our modern calculators have shown that the four - cent postage utilized for the test likely did not cover the cost of the million - dollar missile and its launch .
While the contents of the mail rocket went on to become popular collector ’s items , the 1959 experiment was the last stop for official rocket mail in the United States .
In the years since then , enthusiasm for rocket - powered mail has cooled considerably .
Most recently , the arrival of email and the internet seemed to sound the last death knell for this overpowered mode of delivery .
And yet , while the practicalities of rocket mail as it was originally envisioned are dubious , the promises it made for delivery speed and versatility were undeniably intriguing and have yet to be achieved by any other method .
So perhaps it is not surprising that rocket mail still has its advocates .
Rockets have been proposed as a means of delivering essential supplies to remote areas such as Antarctica , for instance .
Meanwhile , Russia , looking for a use for its surplus missiles , has continued to experiment with rocket mail delivery since the end of the Cold War .
While still not very practical , presumably this is a more productive use for the missiles than alternatives such as big game hunting or rocket golf .
And rocket mail may yet see its day as a full - blown regular delivery service , even faster and more extravagant than imagined by its early proponents .
Concept of the X - 33 , a scrapped single - stage - to - orbit spaceplane
If a fully reusable , single - stage - to - orbit vehicle is ever developed , it will open the door to package delivery via orbital rocket .
Such a system would still be very expensive , but might be justified as an ultra-elite business courier service⁠⁠ — one that could promise delivery anywhere in the world in under an hour .
Some private aerospace companies are already looking into this possibility .
For most of its bumpy history , rocket mail was never much more than a glamorous publicity stunt .
But as we move into the future , this old idea may at last become more than an object of veiled ridicule by snarky web journalists and achieve its true potential : parcel delivery at a speed worthy of the information age .
Thanks for the link , but ...
This site has been online since around 2005 , so although I try to support legacy pages , sometimes a few vanish into thin air .
This is one of them .
Go visit the blog homepage to find more about my most recent crazy online projects .
This is part two of our writeup and perspective on IDNs , especially double byte Japanese domain names .
See Part One ( where we went into some detail of explaining the history of the technology surrounding IDNs ) before reading on .
Without going into too much more history or spurting out much more technical jargon , lets explore some day to day aspects of double byte domains , how they are ( or rather are n’t ) used , and why they just are n’t the glowing future of Japanese internet real estate that initially they may seem to be .
As explained in part one , IDNs rely completely on your PC ’s local Internet browser software to convert that Japanese domain name into a real single byte domain name .
If you do n’t understand what that means , it means アニメ.com ( anime.com ) is not actually アニメ.com at all , it is xn--cck5dwc.com .
Yes , that ’s right , it gets converted into our beloved combination of 37 Latin characters , even before it leaves your computer !
If you are not using the latest internet browser software , then sorry , you are left at the front gate , because only the latest versions translate アニメ.com properly for you … that is , unless you are the lucky autistic one among us who is more comfortable with remembering xn--1sqt31d.com as a homepage address !
( Take a look at the site 価格.jp , strangely , they display their domain name in Japanese , AND the real domain name – www.xn--1sqt31d.jp – in the title of their page ! )
On the other side of the “ internet tubes ” , at the destination of your command ( or message ) , it is servers that form the foundations of internet infrastructure .
We are all working on servers whether we realise it or not .
70 % of servers on the internet run unix .
You are using unix now when you read this homepage , and likely to be when you check your email , or stream some ( raunchy ? ) video down through bittorrent .
For those who have ever dabbled in setting up their own unix internet server ( or Windows server for that matter ! ) , you know that one of the first things that you have to input when doing initial setup is the server ’s domain name .
A computer has to know who it is , before others can talk to it , and before it can send out information to you .
Servers will not accept a double byte characters as their own name .
They also will only accept the hallowed combinations of 37 characters and numbers .
There is a detailed , but cumbersome JPRS guide to setting up a 日本語.jp domain name on your web server here ( PDF ) .
So , let ’s get this straight – your computer does n’t actually look for internet servers using double byte domain names , it converts them to single byte first , ( if you are lucky – this person commenting on the part one found one example where the conversion does n’t go quite as expected ) , and servers wont recognize their “ internationalized nickname ” except for in its garbled 37 character state .
But , Japanese people like using their own language on computers right ?
Well , it seems not so , at least when it comes to typing domain names .
The point being missed here is that Japanese people , simply do n’t use kanji domain names .
Internationalized Domain Names , or “ IDNs ” have now been around for just over 4 years .
Kakaku.com ( huge electronics price comparison site ) was one of the first to stake their claim by snapping up 価格.com ( actually xn--1sqt31d.com ) in the fear that someone would take it from them .
But the vast majority of Japanese computer users kept using the “ romaji ” – kakaku.com .
Why ?
Well , in Japan , apart from the dying breed of post baby boomers with their yokomoji allergies , young people ( the majority of computer users ) here are actually extremely comfortable with typing in domain names in romaji – as opposed to the Chinese , who feel that using their own double - byte language as easier .
An interesting article on whether or not Japanese people actually want kanji IDNs found at Japaninc notes :
… Japanese who do n’t use the Internet do n’t do so because they are not familiar with computers , not because they are unfamiliar with English .
The Internet itself is already Japanese capable — software menus and commands have long since been localized , and a universe of online information is already available in Japanese .
You do n’t really have to know English to use the Internet , you just need to know how to type .
In fact , entering words in Japanese is often more complicated than entering them in English …
Although the article itself is not so new , the point remains .
People in Japan who are not net savvy , generally the elderly , and young kids , are that way because they do not understand the concept of the Internet , and computers in general , and not because they can not tackle 26 characters of the alphabet .
For many Japanese who do consider themselves Internet capable , the factor that holds them back from IDNs is the henkan , or conversion factor .
To actually get to 価格.com using its IDN , you have to type the following key strokes into your browser ’s address bar :
1. “ kakaku ”
2. SPACE ( to convert “ kakaku ” into 価格 )
3. ENTER ( to tell the computer that 価格 is actually the correct kanji out of several possibilities .
Thank god 価格 was the first choice . )
4. HANKAKU / ZENKAKU key ( to convert input method back into romaji to enter the single byte TLD , the .com part )
5. and then finally the “ .com ” on the end .
You end up tapping the keyboard that many more times to get to the exactly the same site , not to mention that your computer then has to translate what you typed back to a convoluted single byte web address !.
Less tapping is better and surely more user friendly – romaji here is clearly the better choice .
The above example using 価格.com is an easy one though .
Imagine if you owned 孝治.com ( 孝治 is read koji , a common name in Japan ) .
Step 2 . above took thirteen taps of the space bar for me to find the correct kanji character .
There are tens of thousands of Japanese words with same reading , but different characters .
What about non-Japanese people , living outside of Japan ?
In Western countries the hurdle is not just having to tap the keyboard excessively , or a browser compatibility issue .
It is a Japanese language input issue .
Without the ability to choose to input double - byte characters ( IME ) which needs to be installed ( it is not automatically included with English windows ) .
Even when you do have IDN support in IE6 ( yes IE6 also sketchily supports kanji domain names in my tests ) , IE7 , or maybe Firefox , if you are unable to TYPE Japanese , which is the case most English windows machines , then you cant type double byte characters and therefore you are blocked from accessing IDN websites …
If you are a domain owner , it really does n’t seem to be the brightest thing to do for your international users .
This is probably a no - brainer anyway as most smart companies would make sure they have the romaji version of the site ( kakaku.com ) registered before they embarked on trying to woo the yokomoji-phobic generation with its double byte cousin ( 価格.com ) or there would be no point right ?
Who in their right mind would try to build a business with 会社.com without also owning kaisha.com , and risking loosing a large percent of their business to Japanese users who are going to enter it in romaji first anyway .
Japanese domain name URLs are displayed intact by some large search engines Japanese domain name URLs are displayed intact by some large search engines
There is only one point that should be considered here .
That is , that owning 会社.com along with kaisha.com would likely increase the SEO value of your content in search engine eyes , as the big names like google.com and baidu.com do appear to be indexing the IDNs as double byte words .
Google search results in the picture to the left , clearly show Japanese domain name URLs in Japanese script .
Whether this is beneficial for SEO ( Search Engine Optimisation ) remains a mystery however , with a Google search for 新宿駅 “ shinjuku station ” showing 7 romaji domain names above 新宿駅.com in my browser .
Tim Romero , a Tokyo - based serial entrepreneur , however has the final say on this topic .
He wrote this piece about the dirtier side of these so called Internationalized Domain Names way back in Feb 2001 , only months after double byte domain names were widely available for general registration .
In hindsight , how very right he was .
The bottom line – which is something that can not be ignored – is that Internationalized Domain Names are another means for the huge domain registries like ICANN ( that sell domain names to companies which in turn sell them to you and I ) to play on the fear of companies and individuals in order to line their own pockets with cash .
They charge what the market can bear , and will sell you anything they can .
. jp domain names for example , cost around 10 times more than .com ones , for no particular reason .
Internationalized Domain Names are superficial eye candy , patched on top of a solid Internet foundation to lure short sighted consumers , with the proverbial corporate noose around their necks .
I will leave you with Tim ’s full article .
Despite being old , it really is a great read considering how right his predictions turned out to be :
Last December domain registrars the world over began accepting registrations for double - byte domain names .
Until now , domain names have been restricted to standard ASCII characters , but the new domains allow names in Japanese , Korean , and Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters as well .
Proponents claim that double - byte domain names will help break down language barriers , increase the amount of multilingual content on the Internet , and make it easier for non-English speakers to use the Net .
I admit that I am rather cynical by nature , but as far as I can tell , these new domains serve only to line the pockets of the domain registrars and provide no substantive benefit to the Internet community .
Contrary to the claims of some proponents , restricting domain names to ASCII letters , numbers and a few punctuation marks is not a linguistic or cultural issue .
It is simply a way of ensuring interoperability .
Just about every international standard in existence , from ISO country designations to airport call letters , restricts itself to similar characters .
The characters in question can be entered using almost any computer system on the planet and , as such , they represent a least common denominator .
The characters do , of course , come from English alphabet , but you would be hard pressed to convince any Japanese that “ Mitsubishi ” is not a Japanese word , or that entering www.mitsubishi.com into a browser is anything but trivial .
In fact , to enter Mitsubishi ’s double - byte domain requires that it first be entered in ASCII letters and then converted to Japanese characters .
The new domains are actually harder to use in that sense .
The winners here are not non-English - speaking Internet users , but the domain name registrars .
Companies who held ASCII domains are now forced to register multiple double - byte variants to protect their brands .
As a result , the registration of these new domains has proceeded with all the clam and order of a gold rush .
Over a million domains were registered in the first month at prices ranging from $ 35 to $ 100 / year .
Keep in mind that these figures are not a one - time charge .
The domain holders will have to pay a like amount each and every year to maintain the rights to those domains .
And , if that were not enough guaranteed annual revenue , Network Solutions has announced that it will soon be accepting domain registrations in Portuguese , Spanish and Arabic .
More languages will follow whenever they feel the need to add a few hundred million dollars in recurring revenue to their bottom line .
It ’s rather tempting to shrug this whole thing off as one big corporation squeezing other big corporations for relatively paltry sums .
However , there is a bigger issue here .
We might be seeing the beginning of the Balkanization of the Internet .
Removing the least common denominator requirement effectively partitions off portions of the Internet .
I ca n’t even give examples of the new domain names because most of my readers ’ will be unable to display them , let alone visit them .
Sites using a double - byte domain will be effectively unreachable by the majority of Internet users .
It can be argued that this is not a problem since a web site with a Japanese domain name will be in Japanese , but current trends speak against that claim .
More and more sites are multilingual .
I suppose a different domain could be used for each language supported , but I fail to see any advantage in such a scheme .
The Internet , however , is more than the Web , and it certainly seems likely that employees of a Japanese company with a double - byte domain name will need to communicate with a someone whose computer does not support Japanese .
Likewise , there will be those outside Japan who will want to download a file from a Japanese FTP server .
Double - byte domains will make this difficult .
Fortunately , for the moment , the new domain names do not work with email or FTP .
The most amazing aspect of the Internet , that from which all else springs is ease and freedom of communication :
The ability for a person in Minsk to communicate with someone in Osaka , Dallas , Seoul or Johannesburg .
Double - byte domain names hinder this ability since they can only be entered by computers running a specific language .
Extensive use of these new domains will effectively prevent communication between individuals who find themselves behind the walls of their national domain name schemes .
Hardly the World - Wide Web we have come to know .
Any questions or comments are welcome below .
I am especially looking forward to people in the other side of the Japanese IDN fence to tell me why they think I am wrong .
Apart from the potential SEO value of IDNs ( mentioned in the article ) , what else do Japanese Kanji domain names have going for them ?
Can they be used in email addresses yet ?
I could n’t test this , as my email client ( Thunderbird ) told me that the address I entered as invalid when I tried to send a mail to [ email protected ] ヒルズ族.com to get some pricing information .. 🙂

Dearborn , MI - Ford Motor Company has announced that they have completed the first ever commercially available , coffee - powered motor vehicle .
Instead of gasoline , the car 's engine will process coffee , extracting the caffeine to produce energy to move the vehicle .
The motor was first designed by Rick Hammerson , a member of the Ford ResearchTeam , and was later improved by his co-workers .
Alan Drumming , another member of the R&D Team , stated , " It actually started as a joke among the team .
We were joking about making a car that would run on over - caffeinated hamsters , but Rick took it seriously and one day just showed up at work with the design .
We were flabbergasted . "
Hammerson said , " I can't get into the details of design , but I can tell you that coffee is a more efficient fuel than gasoline ever was .
The car will run like normal , except the muffler will now be filled with coffee filters . "
The first models will be a coffee - powered SUV named the “ Espresso . ”
Starbucks has begun to replace most of its corner coffee shops with coffee stations , where drivers will be able to pump their cars full of regular or espresso .
So , unlike hydrogen vehicles , the fueling structure is nearly already in place .

" We are also working on a hybrid car , which will run on electricity and decaf , " added Hammerson .
Some environmentalists are claiming that this could end up doing more harm than gas emissions , as the expected output would be slightly caffeinated steam .
The thought of birds sucking in copious amounts of this exahaust brings heightened concerns for aviation safety , especially among hummingbirds .
In unrelated news , the Bush administration has announced they believe that Colombia and Costa Rica have weapons of mass destruction .

Fisking the “ War on Terror ”
Once upon a time , a dangerous radical gained control of the US Republican Party .
Reagan increased the budget for support of the radical Muslim Mujahidin conducting terrorism against the Afghanistan government to half a billion dollars a year .
One fifth of the money , which the CIA mostly turned over to Pakistani military intelligence to distribute , went to Gulbuddin Hikmatyar , a violent extremist who as a youth used to throw acid on the faces of unveiled girls in Afghanistan .
Not content with creating a vast terrorist network to harass the Soviets , Reagan then pressured the late King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to match US contributions .
He had earlier imposed on Fahd to give money to the Contras in Nicaragua , some of which was used to create rightwing death squads .
( Reagan liked to sidestep Congress in creating private terrorist organizations for his foreign policy purposes , which he branded “ freedom fighters , ” giving terrorists the idea that it was all right to inflict vast damage on civilians in order to achieve their goals ) .
Fahd was a timid man and resisted Reagan ’s instructions briefly , but finally gave in to enormous US pressure .
Fahd not only put Saudi government money into the Afghan Mujahideen networks , which trained them in bomb making and guerrilla tactics , but he also instructed the Minister of Intelligence , Turki al - Faisal , to try to raise money from private sources .
Turki al - Faisal checked around and discovered that a young member of the fabulously wealthy Bin Laden construction dynasty , Usama , was committed to Islamic causes .
Turki thus gave Usama the task of raising money from Gulf millionaires for the Afghan struggle .
This whole effort was undertaken , remember , on Reagan Administration instructions .
Bin Laden not only raised millions for the effort , but helped encourage Arab volunteers to go fight for Reagan against the Soviets and the Afghan communists .
The Arab volunteers included people like Ayman al - Zawahiri , a young physician who had been jailed for having been involved in the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar El - Sadat .
Bin Laden kept a database of these volunteers .
In Arabic the word for base is al - Qaeda .
In the US , the Christian Right adopted the Mujahideen as their favorite project .
They even sent around a “ biblical checklist ” for grading US congressman as to how close they were to the “ Christian ” political line .
If a congressman did n’t support the radical Muslim Muj , he or she was downgraded by the evangelicals and fundamentalists .
Reagan wanted to give more and more sophisticated weapons to the Mujahideen ( “ freedom fighters ” ) .
The Pakistani generals were forming an alliance with the fundamentalist Jamaat - i Islam and begining to support madrasahs or hardline seminaries that would teach Islamic extremism .
But even they balked at giving the ragtag Muj really advanced weaponry .
Pakistan had a close alliance with China , and took advice from Beijing .
In 1985 Reagan sent Senator Orrin Hatch , Undersecretary of Defense Fred Iklé and others to Beijing to ask China to put pressure on Pakistan to allow the US to give the Muslim radicals , such as Hikmatyar , more sophisticated weapons .
Hatch succeeded in this mission .
By giving the Muj weaponry like the stinger shoulderheld missile , which could destroy advanced Soviet arms like their helicopter gunships , Reagan demonstrated to the radical Muslims that they could defeat a super power .
Reagan also decided to build up Saddam Hussein in Iraq as a counterweight to Khomeinist Iran , authorizing US and Western companies to send him precursors for chemical and biological weaponry .
At one point Donald Rumsfeld was sent to Iraq to assure Saddam that it was all right if he used chemical weapons against the Iranians .
Reagan had no taste in friends .
On becoming president , George H. W. Bush made a deal with the Soviets that he would cut the Mujahideen off if the Soviets would leave Afghanistan .
The last Soviet troops departed in early 1989 .
The US then turned its back on Afghanistan and allowed it to fall into civil war , as the radical Muslim factions fostered by Washington and Riyadh turned against one another and used their extensive weaponry on each other and on civilians .
In the meantime , Saddam , whom the US had built up as a major military power , invaded Kuwait .
The Bush senior administration now had to take on its former protege , and put hundreds of thousands of US troops into the Gulf and Saudi Arabia .
The radical Muslim extremists with whom Reagan and Bush had allied in Afghanistan now turned on the US , objecting strenuously to a permanent US military presence in the Muslim holy land .
From 1994 Afghanistan was increasingly dominated by a faction of Mujahideen known as Taliban or seminary students ( who were backed by Pakistani military intelligence , which learned the trick from Reagan and which were flush from all those billions the Reagan administration had funneled into the region ) .
In 1996 Bin Laden came back and reestablished himself there , becoming the leader of 5,000 radical Arab volunteers that Reagan had urged Fahd to help come to Afghanistan back in the 1980s .
In the meantime , the US had steadfastly supported Israeli encroachments on the Palestinian Occupied Territories and the gradual complete annexation of Jerusalem , the third holiest city to Muslims .
Since the outbreak of the first intifada , Israeli troops had riposted with brutality .
Even after the Oslo accords were signed , the size of Israeli colonies in the Palestinian West Bank and around Jerusalem doubled .
A steady drumbeat of violence against Palestinians by Israelis , who were stealing their land and clearly intended to monopolize their sacred space , enraged the Muslim radicals that had been built up and coddled by Reagan .
In 1998 , al - Qaeda and al - Jihad al - Islami , two small terrorist groups established in Afghanistan as a result of the Reagan jihad , declared war on the United States and Israel ( the “ Zionists and Crusaders ” ) .
After attacks by al - Qaeda cells on US embassies in East Africa and on the USS Cole , nineteen of them ultimately used jet planes to attack the Twin Towers and the Pentagon .
The Bush administration responded to these attacks by the former proteges of Ronald Reagan by putting the old Mujahideen warlords back in charge of Afghanistan ’s provinces , allowing Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri to escape , declaring that Americans no longer needed a Bill of Rights , and suddenly invading another old Reagan protege , Saddam ’s Iraq , which had had nothing to do with 9/11 and posed no threat to the US .
The name given this bizarre set of actions by Bush was “ the War on Terror . ”
In Iraq , the US committed many atrocities , including bombing campaigns on civilian quarters of cities it had already occupied , and a ferocious assault on Fallujah , and tortured Iraqi prisoners .
In the meantime , the Bush administration put virtually no money or effort into actually combatting terrorist cells in places like Morocco , as opposed to putting $ 200 billion into the Iraq war and aftermath .
As a result , a string of terrorist attacks were allowed to strike at Madrid , London and elsewhere .
Fred Ikle , who had been part of the Reaganist / Chinese Communist effort to convince Muslim fundamentalist generals in Pakistan–against their better judgment– to allow the US to give the radical Muslim extremists even more sophisticated weapons , wrote an op -ed for the Wall Street Journal urging the nuking of Mecca .
Then in July , 2005 , General Richard Myers , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , announced that there was not actually any “ War on Terror : ” ‘ General Richard Myers , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told the National Press Club on Monday that he had “ objected to the use of the term ‘ war on terrorism ’ before , because if you call it a war , then you think of people in uniform as being the solution . ” ‘ ( Question : Does this mean we can have the Bill of Rights back , now ? )
The American Right , having created the Mujahideen and having mightily contributed to the creation of al - Qaeda , abruptly announced that there was something deeply wrong with Islam , that it kept producing terrorists .

Settling a longstanding scientific debate , Los Alamos scientists have demonstrated conclusively how electromagnetic waves accelerate ordinary electrons in the belts of radiation outside Earth 's atmosphere to a state where they become " killer electrons , " particles that are hazardous to satellites , spacecraft , and astronauts .
Using data from several satellites , including NASA 's Polar spacecraft , Los Alamos scientists published in the July issue of Nature Physics a paper showing how interactions between electromagnetic waves and electrons are responsible for accelerating radiation - belt particles in the Van Allen radiation belts to the point they become " killers . "
The Van Allen radiation belts are doughnut - shaped regions encircling Earth that contain high - energy electrons and ions trapped in Earth 's magnetic field .
The paper , " The Energization of Relativistic Electrons in the Outer Van Allen Radiation Belt , " was written by Yue Chen , Geoffrey D. Reeves , and Reiner H.W. Friedel of the Laboratory 's Space Science and Applications group .
" We 're not the first people to look at these space - based density gradients , but the essential achievement was coming up with the definitive test , " said Reeves .
Competing models had proposed various effects involving diffusion , each roughly analogous to the ways piles of sand will spread out on a board that 's shaken .
The Los Alamos team 's paper provides the first analysis that internal wave - particle acceleration is the only mechanism consistent with observations for the majority of radiation belt enhancement events ( a surge of electrons up to 1,000 times more dense than they are in storm - free conditions ) .
" Debates on the source of the acceleration have lasted for at least a decade , and this paper finally settles the argument based on observations .
The result should be very useful for further radiation - belt research work , " Chen said .
The Los Alamos model involved measuring fluxes of electrons , counting how many per second hit a satellite - borne detector , and converting the physical measurements to magnetic coordinates .
The results showed localized peaks in intensity that could only be caused by acceleration of those electrons by electromagnetic waves .
" We know it 's some kind of interaction between the electromagnetic waves and the particles , but not the exact mechanism .
So it 's a big step , but certainly not the only one in understanding radiation belts , " said Reeves .
The Los Alamos teams obtained differential electron flux data from the Los Alamos energetic particle sensor ( a burst - detector dosimeter ) aboard a Global Positioning System satellite , the Los Alamos Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyzer ( SOPA ) aboard a geosynchronous orbit satellite , and the Comprehensive Energetic Particle and Pitch Angle Distribution experiment aboard NASA 's Polar satellite .
The next big step in this field will be the planned 2012 launch of NASA 's two Radiation Belt Storm probes , part of the agency 's " Living With a Star " program to quantify the physical processes that generate the radiation belts and cause them to decay .
Observations from the two spacecraft will enable the development of empirical and physics - based models for the radiation belts .
The empirical models will be used by engineers to design radiation - hardened spacecraft , while the physics - based models will be used by forecasters to predict geomagnetic storms and alert both astronauts and spacecraft operators to potential hazards .
The paper is available at www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v … t/full/nphys655.html online .

Leahy says Bush 's executive privilege assertion worse than Nixon 's Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday July 11 , 2007 Print This Email This Senator :
It 's time for Karl Rove to testify Enjoy this story ?
Get breaking politics headlines with RSS .
Senator Patrick Leahy said the Bush White House was more reckless in its exercise of executive power than President Richard Nixon Wednesday morning .
The statement came as the Senate Judiciary Committee held a tempestuous hearing on the firing of 8 US Attorneys , with Sara Taylor , a former top aide to Karl Rove , as its witness .
" The White House lawyers have resorted to an unprecedented blanket assertion of executive privilege , " Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , the committee 's chairman , said in his opening statement .
" I did n't even hear it during President Nixon 's term . "
He then asked , " What is the White House trying to hide ? "
Another Senator criticized the White House for allowing young staffers like Taylor to pay the price for decisions made at more senior levels .
" Karl Rove should be sitting at this table , not you , " said Senator Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) .
Taylor was subpoenaed to appear before the committee in June .
On Saturday , her attorney , W. Neil Eggleston , made clear that she would abide by President George W. Bush 's invocation of executive privilege over her testimony , and asked that she not be subjected to an " unseemly tug of war . "
Her appearance before the Judiciary Committee was an effort to balance Bush 's move with a Congressional subpoena .
A failure to comply with the subpoena could result in the Senate holding her in criminal contempt .
Leahy in his opening statement called for Taylor 's " honest testimony " and gave her a clear warning .
" The White House is contemptuous of the Congress ... I urge Ms. Taylor not to follow that contemptuous position and the White House down that path , " the Senator said , appearing to raise the specter of a criminal contempt charge .
But Senator Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , the committee 's ranking minority member , argued against any such threat being acted upon .
" It is my hope that we will not proceed on the criminal contempt citation , " he said .
" If it goes to court , it will take two years ... I urge my colleagues to take as much as we can right now , and come back later . "
Ex -Rove aide cites Bush letter as blocking her testimony
In her opening statement , Taylor called herself " a willing and cooperative private citizen , " but said that she must abide by the President 's assertion of executive privilege in a letter that was sent to her by White House Counsel Fred Fielding .
" Disclosure of this information [ related to the firing of the US Attorneys ] would interfere with the operation of the executive branch , " she said .
" The current disputes between the executive and legislative branches of our government are much bigger than me . "
In questioning with Senator Leahy , Taylor insisted that the US Attorneys controversy played no role in her decision to leave the Bush White House after more than 6 years of service .
" I informed Mr. Rove of my decision in December , " she said .
Leahy also quizzed Taylor on her use of a Republican National Committee e-mail account .
She acknowledged using it " regularly . "
" The system ... was set up early in the administration to make sure that presidential appointees who on occasion had to address political matters never violated the Hatch Act , " she said .
" I had two computers , two blackberries , and as somebody who generally tried to be efficient with time , I 'd sometimes just use the wrong computer . "
Leahy was not satisfied with Taylor 's responses to a series of questions that the former White House political aide received regarding the RNC e-mail accounts .
" I feel like we 're doing a test run for testimony from the Attorney General , " he quipped .
Senator Specter turned to a discussion of Tim Griffin , the former interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas who formerly worked under Taylor in the White House .
When Specter asked Taylor if Karl Rove and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers sought to have Griffin installed , she curiously did not assert Bush 's executive privilege in answering the question .
" I do n't specifically know , " she said , after Specter asked if she could not answer the question because of executive privilege .
She also agreed to Senator Specter 's statement that Griffin was a ' logical ' replacement who was well regarded in the White House .
Senator Dianne Feinstein then asked a series of questions to which Taylor cited executive privilege in response .
But when Feinstein asked if she had added or removed names from the list of Attorneys to be fired , she said she was not involved .
Senators dispute reach of ' executive privilege '
In subsequent questioning , Senators contested the reach of the President 's assertion of executive privilege .
Senator Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) pointed out that Taylor 's answers to some questions and refusal to respond to others demonstrated the tenuous nature of Bush 's position .
" In fact you have answered some questions about views in the White House , " he said .
" Senator Specter asked you for instance about how Tim Griffin was viewed in the White House , those are deliberations of someone in the White House . "
He then added , " I think it shows two things .
It shows how this broad claim of privilege just does n't show up .
And I think it shows that it 's a weak claim , and your testifying to some of these things and not others because of your genuine desire to answer questions that you can . "
Schumer then asked Taylor if she had received calls from Republican political agents around the country regarding the performance of any particular US Attorneys .
After Taylor attempted to assert executive privilege on these questions , Schumer questioned the move , stating that the ' external communication ' in this case came from individuals outside of the executive branch .
After a series of deliberations with her attorney off the microphone , Taylor acknowledged that she could answer the question .
She then said she did not recall receiving any communications from external political agents about any US Attorneys .
In questioning with Senator Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) , Taylor later acknowledged that she had perhaps gone over the line into certain areas of executive privilege .
" Perhaps you 're correct and that did not fall under the President 's executive privilege and I should have said nothing , " she said .
Durbin : ' Karl Rove should be sitting at this table ' Senator Durbin also criticized the White House for creating the situation where Taylor was forced to site before the committee .
He argued that younger staff have had to pay the price for decisions made at a senior level .
" Karl Rove should be sitting at this table , not you , " he said to Taylor .
She also slammed Democrats who have accused Tim Griffin of implementing vote caging schemes that disproportionately disenfranchised African - American voters .
" I think it is horrible what is being said about Tim Griffin , and I do n't believe he would ever do anything like that , " she said .
In questioning with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) , Taylor also questioned the idea that Griffin was a poor candidate for a US Attorney because of his role as a top Republican opposition researcher .
" I would say to the contrary , I think the fact that this person ran a large research operation and has an incredible set of skills with respect to research would serve him incredibly well as a prosecutor , " Taylor asserted .
Background : Taylor identified in earlier hearings , e-mails Taylor 's role in the US Attorneys firing has been made clear in earlier testimony from Justice Department officials .
Former Justice Department White House Liaison Monica Goodling suggested Taylor had been a key decision - maker in the Attorneys firings in June .
" There was an e-mail that Mr. Sampson forwarded to me , I think , on December 4 , if I 'm remembering correctly , that said that it had been circulated to different offices within the White House and that they had all signed off , " Goodling told Rep. Sheila Jackson - Lee when she appeared before the House Judiciary Committee .
" I think it said that White House political had signed off .
Political is actually headed by Sara Taylor but does report to Mr. Rove , so I do n't know for sure . "
Senator Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) also asked Alberto Gonzales 's former chief of staff D. Kyle Sampson in a March Senate Judiciary Committee hearing why he believed the appointment of Tim Griffin as interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas was important to Karl Rove .
" That e-mail was based on an assumption , " Sampson answered of an e-mail he wrote .
" I knew that Sara Taylor and Scott Jennings had expressed interest in promoting Mr. Griffin for appointment to be U.S. attorney , and I assumed , because they reported to Karl Rove , that he was interested in that . "
E-mails turned over to Congressional investigators also showed Taylor 's deep involvement in the installation of Griffin , who was also a top aide to Rove .
A Feb. 16 e-mail showed that a White House official , Sara Taylor , was upset with the Justice Department for their installation of Griffin , who like Taylor was a former White House aide to Karl Rove .
" Tim was put in a horrible position ; hung out to dry w/ no heads up .
You forced him to do what he did ; this is not good for his long term career , " she wrote to Sampson .
She also complained that Paul McNulty , Deputy Attorney General , was unwilling to call Bud Cummins , the US Attorney Griffin replaced , " lazy - which is why we got rid of him in the first place . "
As Cummins began to talk to the media about his removal from office , Taylor also showed herself to be ready to go on the offensive politically .
" I normally do n't like attacking friends , but since Bud Cummins is talking to everyone - why do n't we tell the deal on him ? " she asked Sampson in a Feb. 7 e-mail .
Notably , Taylor used a gwb43.com e-mail address , one of the domain names managed by the Republican National Committee , and not archived under standard White House document preservation procedures .
Taylor also objected to an earlier letter that the Justice Department planned to send to Senator Mark Pryor ( D - AR ) about Griffin 's installation .
" I 'm concerned we imply that we 'll pull down Griffin 's nomination should Pryor object , " she wrote on Jan. 25 to Sampson and William Kelley in the office of White House Counsel Harriet Miers .

Cameron Stuart Bishop recalls that he once served his country as a soldier .
He also recalls the time a Vancouver cop pointed a gun at him while another officer handcuffed him as he was pinned facedown on the ground .
Several emotions tore through his mind .
But there was one thought that stood out , noted the 45 - year - old man who describes himself as a former " specialist " with the Princess Patricia 's Canadian Light Infantry .
" I felt betrayed , " Bishop told the Georgia Straight at the site where the supposed incident happened in early May .
It was on the sidewalk along West Broadway near Laurel Street , which he also , incidentally , calls home .
It 's also where he makes a living by asking for change from passersby .
Bishop recounted that he was handcuffed after the cops found a knife underneath the backpack he uses as a pillow when they roused him from sleep .
He said he told them he had a weapon because he was recently knifed in the leg by two men at that same location .
Later , he said , he was told by the cops to pack his stuff and take a walk .
Bishop said he'd been living on the streets since 1997 without any problems from the police .
But starting last summer , he said , cops began making life more difficult for him .
From his bag , he pulled out a handful of tickets citing him for city - bylaw violations like " loitering " and " solicitation " .

Those tickets were just a few of those issued him , he said .
One night last winter , he used a bunch to make a little fire for himself .
It 's a long way from the warm home he used to have back east when he worked as a deep - sea fisherman after leaving the military , Bishop said .
When the Newfoundland fishery collapsed in the early 1990s , his family started to unravel and he found himself in Vancouver in 1994 .
Three years later , he said , he was on the streets .
Bishop said he believes that a " war " has been declared by the city against poor people like him .
" Why can't they just leave us alone ? " he asked .
Chris Shaw , spokesperson for the 2010 Games Watchdog Committee , told the Straight that the harassment of homeless people is hardly surprising in an Olympic city .
" In the run-up for and during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta , some 9,000 people were swept off the streets , " Shaw said .
" It 's economic cleansing . "
Shaw said he expects police to " red-zone " Vancouver 's homeless by designating places where they can't go and be seen by the outside world .
On May 7 , the Impact of the Olympics on Community Coalition released a report urging the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games ( VANOC ) and its partners –the City of Vancouver and the British Columbia provincial government –to live up to their so - called Inner - City Inclusivity commitments .
These include commitments to housing , environment , civil liberties , and transparency .
" Continued harassment by private and public police , in the forms of the Vancouver Police Department , municipal By - law inspectors , and private security firms , will result in the functional denial of access to public spaces for homeless and under - housed residents , " the report noted .
" The authors wish to point out that the failure of the Parties to build sufficient social housing and to fund social welfare programs like drug detox , treatment and transition housing , along with mental health supports in the community , has resulted in the visible street disorder in Vancouver . "
The report took note of tactics to stifle anti-Olympic dissent , like the use of civil injunctions and criminal contempt - of - court charges , as well as " illegal restrictions on public space and the mobility and assembly rights " of protesters .
And the statement also reminded the parties of their commitment to " establish a table to discuss civil liberties and Games security concerns " .
" The purpose of the table is to bring together members of all levels of government , the community and interested nonprofits and businesses to discuss how VANOC might best implement their ICI civil liberties Commitments before formal Games security policy is put in place , " it stated .
" To date this table has not been established . "
Jason Gratl , president of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association , noted that this advisory committee would assist the event organizers in " balancing civil - liberties interests with other important public interests such as security and transportation , and enhancing the perception that sports are not necessarily antithetical to democratic participation " .
" The time is ripe , " Gratl told the Straight .
" The security plans are not yet finalized but they are approaching maturity .
What we want to make sure in the complex organization of the Olympics is the existence of an institutionalized structure that will safeguard civil liberties . "
-非テニュアトラック教員が増えつづけるアメリカ大学
最近、ドクターをとっても常勤ポジションがなく漂流するポスドク問題や、大学における非常勤講師の雇用・労働条件の問題に関するニュースが日本でよくニュースになっているようだ。関西圏や首都圏の大学非常勤講師組合などが取り組んだという、大学非常勤講師実態調査アンケートの報告書『大学非常勤講師の実態と声2007』というレポートも出たらしい。
アメリカにおいても、非常勤講師の待遇は大きな問題だ。大学というものの性質がビジネスと化し、経営や金儲け的な方向性が優先される昨今、テニュアトラックの教員数は減らされ、安い労働力とみなされるフルタイムやパートタイムの、テニュアトラック以外の教員( Contingent Faculty ) の数は増え続けている。AAUPのレポートによれば、1998年から2001年までの間に、テニュアトラック以外の教員の数は35.5％増えたという。反面、テニュアトラック常勤教員のポジションの割合は減るばかりだ。そして、1969年にはテニュアトラック以外の教員は3.3％にすぎなかったものが、現在はアメリカ大学や短大全教員の65％を占めるという。ブッシュ政権下で教育予算がカットされている中、大学は安い人件費を求め、常勤より非常勤を雇う傾向がますます強まっているといえるだろう。
アメリカの大規模リサーチ大学は、テニュアトラックの常勤教員、非テニュアトラックのフルタイム教員、パートや短期の非常勤教員と大学院生講師によって成り立っており（AFTサイト掲載のUS
Department of Educationによる統計参照。）、コミュニティカレッジも同じく、少数の常勤と大多数の非常勤によって成り立ち、ピラミッド構造になっているのが通常だ。そして、大学の講座の半分以上は、非常勤や院生による担当だ。すなわち、大学は非常勤や院生の労働がないと成り立たなくなっているといえる。また、私はこの３年間ポスドクだったのだが、文系のポスドクの場合、教えることが契約の一部にはいっている場合もよくある。私自身の場合もそうだった。ポスドクは期限付きであることから、実質上は非常勤労働と同じようなものだといえるだろう。
常勤は、グラントなどとってきた場合、一学期、一年間などのまとまった期間、大学から離れて研究をする場合もあるので、その時の代わりの人材として、短期雇用の非常勤が雇われることもある。私のアメリカでの大学院生活をふりかえっても、テニュアを取得ずみの常勤教員はかなり頻繁にリーブをとる場合が多く、教えない学期もかなり多かった。
また、昨今のインターネットを使った遠隔教育の普及により、大学によっては、オンラインコース担当の教員が必要になっている。データはもっていないが、私が見聞きする限りでは、オンラインコース教員の大部分はテニュアトラックではない、非常勤の教員でまかなわれていると思われる。オンライン担当は自宅でできるため、一見楽そうだが、実はパソコンの前にはりついていなくてはならず、時間をとられてかなりたいへんと聞く。
私企業による運営のもと、オンライン講座を中心に、仕事に直結するスキルや学位をとるための教育を行う、For profit university（営利大学ーフェニックス大学など）では、普通の大学のようにひとりの教員が講座プランから、授業、テスト、成績付けと全部行う方法ではなく、日本の予備校のような分業方式（授業企画要員、授業要員、テスト要員、、と分かれている）になっているらしい。そして、大部分の教員（90％以上らしい）は非常勤だ。
-院生講師（ティーチングアシスタント）の非常勤への置き換え
院生労働 者( Graduate Employee ) の組合で私が大学院に在籍していた頃によく問題になっていたのが、大学院生より非常勤のほうが安く雇える（授業料免除などが不必要）ため、常勤から非常勤のみならず、大学院生講師から非常勤への置き換えの流れも起きていることだった。私がいたミシガン大学では、院生講師組合はあったが、非常勤の組合は当時はできておらず、大学がより搾取しやすかったことも理由のひとつだろう。（2002-2003年に、LEO-Lecturers ' Employee Organization - として作られた。）大学院生（とくにリサーチアシスタントをして生計がまかなえるだけの給与を得ることが難しい文系の院生）にとって、教える機会は将来のキャリア準備であるのみならず、収入の貴重な機会でもある。とくに外国人院生にとっては、奨学金とリサーチアシスタント以外、まとまった収入を得られる唯一の機会といってもいい。これがないとなると大学院をやめざるをえない状況にもなりうる。そして、そのかわりに安い労働力として、不安定な立場の非常勤講師が雇われるという動きがあった。
また、大学院生を労働協約の定め たGraduate Student Instructor （1996 年以前に はTeaching Assistantと呼ばれていた）以外のカテゴリー（例えばgrader）などで雇うことで、賃金を安くおさえ、かつ保険などを与えないということも大学はよくやっていた。厳密にいえば、これはミシガン大学では労働協約違反のケースがほとんどだった。（成績づけだけを担当する場合でも、成績づけに主観的な要素が関係する場合ーマークシートや、答えが定まっていて、単に機械的にあっているかだけを採点すればいいテストや宿題以外ーは、grader ではなくgraduate student instructorというカテゴリーに該当するはずだった。）だが、今はどうだかわからないが、当時は大学による違反は日常茶飯事だった。とくに「英語力」を理由に使われがちな外国人学生は、このgraderカテゴリーによる搾取をよく受けていた。ビザの関係上、大学の外で働けない外国人学生は、とくに弱い立場にある、という状況を利用した、差別的な扱いであるといえる。
-最近の動向：フルタイムの非テニュアトラック教員の増加
AAUP の学問分野別の動向レポートによれば、最近の動向として、フルタイムの非テニュアトラックの教員の数が増え、パートタイムが減りつつあるらしい。だが、フルタイムだからといって安定しているわけではない。安く不安定に、多い時間数働くポジションが増えたということだ。
そういう背景もあり、アメリカの非常勤は、日本の都市部のように複数の学校で一こまずつ、というより、少ない数の学校で、フルタイム分、もしくはパートにしても複数コマこなす、というパターンが多いと思う。もちろん、都市部のように大学やコミュニティカレッジが複数校、近距離に固まってある場合は、もっと多くの学校で教えていたり、講師以外の仕事もしてなんとか食べている人たちもいるのだろうと思う。
教えるコマ数も、常勤より多い場合がほとんどだろう。アメリカは２学期制と３学期制の学校があるが、一学期あたり、４〜５種類の授業を受け持ったりする。アメリカの場合、１クラスあたり週に約３時間は授業があるのが通例なので、これだけの数を担当するのはかなり大変だ。
また、非常勤が入門レベルの講座を担当することが多いのも特色だろう。自分の専門に近い内容の講座ではなく、履修人数が多く、準備も大変な入門講座を担当することになるのだ。この結果、常勤の教員が入門講座を教えなくなる、というマイナスもでてくる。
コマ数の多さに加え、専門から離れたことも扱うためにかなりの準備が必要な、履修人数が多い入門講座を複数担当しなければならないとなると、研究にあてる時間もなくなる。そして、常勤と違って大学からの研究費などもほとんど出ないし、グラントに応募しても得られる可能性も常勤より低いだろう。これでは、常勤職に応募したくても、研究成果があがらないために、通らない、という悪循環になってしまう。日本と似た状況だと思う。
そして、テニュアトラック常勤以上に教えているにもかかわらず、給与は圧倒的に安く、保険などがつかない場合もある。そして、いつ契約が更新されず、解雇になるかわからない、という不安を抱えている人は多いだろう。
テニュアトラック教員に比べて、ノンテニュアトラックのフルタイム教員、パートタイム、短期雇用教員のほうに女性の割合が多いというデータもAAUPによって報告されている。
そして、ノンテニュアトラック教員が圧倒的に多い、外国語担当教員の多くは、女性であり、マイノリティである。
-大学院生・非常勤組合運動
この現状のため、非常勤労働者、大学院生労働者の組織化が行われ、組合を通して待遇改善を要求する運動は各地で起きている。
例えば私が住むシカゴには 、Chicago Coalition of Contingent Academic Laborという団体がある。
この団体サイトのリンクをたどると、他の地域の同様な団体などへのリンクがある。
The Coalition of Graduate Employee Unions ( CGEU ) は、大学院生労働者組合の連絡会的組織。加盟大学の組合へのリンクなどあり。
私が大学院時代を過ごしたミシガン大学（州立）は院生組合があり、後に非常勤組合ができた。逆に、今ポスドクをしているシカゴ大学（私立）には、組合がない。院生組合がある大学とない大学では、大学院生としての経験が相当違うものになるのではないだろうか。給与、保険、労働条件などがまず大きく異なる。ミシガンでは給与は勤務時間数に応じて、院生講師全員に共通する基準のもとに計算される。健康保険は常勤教員と同等のものを選べ、図書館へのアクセスなども常勤と同様の特典（借りた本の返却期限がないなど）が与えられる。そして、定められた時間数より多く働いた場合に、働いた分の給与を要求したり、その他労働協約に大学が違反したと思われる事項が発生した際には、グリーバンスの手続きを踏むことができる。教えることのトレーニングは組合が大学に要求して導入され、しかもトレーニング期間にも給与が支払われることになっている。
だが、シカゴでは、まず給与設定が適当で、そしてひどく安い。ミシガン一ヶ月あたりの給与が、シカゴの一学期分といってもいいくらいだ。健康保険はないので、学生は自腹で入らねばならない。図書館のアクセスなども、院生のステータスのままだ。そもそも、労働時間が契約にはっきり組み込まれておらず、働き過ぎかどうかを決める基準もない。トレーニングもいちおうないわけではないようだが、ミシガンに比べて圧倒的に充実しておらず、大学院生たちは初めて教えるときにも、トレーニングが皆無に近い状況で教え始めなければならない。
そして、シカゴでは、大学院生以外の人間が、院生講師と同様の仕事をするというケースがあった。例えば、私自身は、シカゴで入門レベルの講座のアシスタントを、ほかの院生たちといっしょに担当したことがあった。私の給与は、ポスドクなので、すでに前もって年収いくらと設定されており、この講座を教えることがポスドクの契約にはいってしまっているので、担当しないというチョイスはないし、教えることで収入が増えるわけでもない。だが、私がはいって教えることで、実質上、院生の貴重な就労機会を奪っているともいえる。しかも、シカゴ大学の院生は教える機会が大規模州立大学などに比べて少ないため、将来の就職準備としても貴重な機会なのだ。大学にとっては、私を雇ったほうが、もうひとり院生を雇って給与を払わなくてすむので、安いのだろう。
このような展開は、ミシガンではありえないと思う。院生組合との労働協約上、院生講師の仕事をほかのカテゴリーの人間（例えば私のようなポスドク）がかわりに入って行うことはできないだろう。
こういった具体的な事柄が組合があるとなしとで大きく違うのに加え、院生組合があったことで、学部内の院生たちと自分たちの課題についていっしょに話し合い、解決していくとか、ほかの学部の院生たちといっしょに同じテーマについて話し、運動をする機会ができ、院生のコミュニティが作られている感覚があったと思う。そして、組合として動くことで、院生や講師のみならず、ほかの労働者ー大学の建物の工事をしている人とか、配送物の配達の人たちとかーとの連帯を（まだまだ足りてはいないのだが）意識することにもなっていった。こういった経験が、今のシカゴ大学ではできないのだ。今後変わっていくといいのだが、、院生の組合活動の長い歴史をもつ州立大学に比べ、私立大学の組合活動には、2004年のNLRBの、大学院生労働者の団結権を否定する決定が大きく影響し、厳しい状況にある。
( この件に関するAFTによるプレスリリースはhttp://www.aft.org/presscenter/releases/2004/071504_nlrb.htm）
-日本のフシギ？
ところで、日本では常勤の教員が、他の大学で非常勤で教えるという形態もよくあるようだが、不思議に思う。以前はともかくとして、いまや、非常勤のポジションもなかなかとれず苦労している学者や院生もたくさんいるのではないだろうか。なのに、常勤職にある人間が他の大学の非常勤の仕事までとってしまったら、、？このことは、日本では問題にならないのだろうか？雇う大学側にとったら、常勤職の名の知れた人間を雇った方が大学の宣伝効果的にもいいし、なにより安定した仕事をすでにもっている人間だから、労働条件について苦情を言ったり闘ったりする可能性も低く、安全なのかもしれないが、、常勤の人が他の大学で非常勤をする場合、常勤職にない人たちの「仕事の機会を奪っている」という感覚にはならないものなのだろうかな？

Chapter One
Making Of Plans
Master Sun said :
War ,
War never changes
It is a place
Of life and death ,
A road
To survival and extinction ,
A matter
To be pondered carefully .
When deciding whether to go to war
Or remain in peace
Flip a coin
If one flip decides upon peace
Try for the best three out of five
Chapter Two
Waging War
Master Sun said :
When your weapons are dulled ,
Your ardor damped ,
Your strength exhausted and your treasure spent ,
Other chieftains will spring up
To take advantage of your extremity
At this time you should
Ask the enemy for a time out
So that your men can rest
And their weapons can be sharpened
Chapter Three
Attack By Strategem
Master Sun said :
Ultimate excellence lies
Not in winning
Every battle ,
But in defeating the enemy
Without even fighting .
So try to concentrate hard enough
To make the enemy 's heads explode ;
Perhaps by training on watermelon first
And working your way up to humans
Chapter Four
Tactical Dispositions
Master Sun said :
Position is key
To success in battle .
When planning your angle of attack ,
Make sure you are directly facing the harsh rays of the sun ;
This will make it easier for your men
To tell what time it is ,
Giving you a distinct advantage
Chapter Five
Weak Points And Strong
Master Sun said :
You can be sure of succeeding
In your attacks if you only attack
Places which are undefended ;
Therefore you must not attack
Until the enemy is at their most vulnerable ;
Like when their entire army
Removes their armor
Wanders from the safety of their camps
To drop deuces in a ditch
Then they all fall asleep in that ditch
At exactly the same time
Attack at this moment
And only this moment
And you will be victorious
Chapter Six
Maneuvering
Master Sun said :
If your men hear a strange sound
In the middle of the night
The best tactical maneuver available
Is to have everyone split up
And wander aimlessly in the woods
By themselves
While yelling " Hello ? "
Chapter Seven
The Use Of Spies
Master Sun said :
All warfare is based
On deception ;
Have your army dress themselves
In the enemy 's clothing
And sneak into their camp before dawn ;
Then , when they least expect it ,
Have your men disembowel themselves
Your enemy will think a large number
Of their own men have died
Score one for
Team awesome
Chapter Eight
Terrain
Master Sun said :
An army with higher ground
Is at a distinct advantage ;
If you find yourself on a level battlefield
Have your men drop their weapons
And stand on one another 's backs
Forming a giant pyramid
With the man at the very top wielding a sword
This height advantage should make him
More powerful than an entire army
Chapter Nine
The Attack By Fire
Master Sun said :
There are six ways of attacking with fire
The first is to burn soldiers in their camp ;
The second is to burn stores ;
The third is to burn baggage trains ;
The fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines ;
The fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy ;
The sixth is to set all of your provisions on fire
And hope your enemy steps on them by mistake
Epilogue
Master Sun said :
Take these tactics which have proven
Disastrous on the battlefield
And bind them into a volume ;
Then make sure it falls
Into the hands of my enemies
Who will be eager to use
My strategies against me
But do n't write this part
You 're not writing this
Are you
Okay good

February 22 , 2007 , 4:25 pm
This post actually takes me back to the roots of this blog , roots that most new readers probably have not seen much of .
I originally started this blog as place to share my lessons learned in starting , running , and growing a small business .
I still do some of that , but not nearly as much as I would like .
My company has about 25 line managers who each run the operations for one recreation area ( these are spread over 13 states ) .
I give these managers nearly complete P&L authority .
I set base labor rates and most fee levels , and we have a very clear management process everyone follows .
However , line managers have the responsibility to do all the hiring for their area , as well as most purchasing .
One issue that comes up a lot for us as we grow is how much we should centralize some of these functions for efficiency , most significantly HR and purchasing .
In general , I have resisted efforts to centralize .
Here is why .
Human Resources
Several of my competitors , even ones smaller than I am , have centralized their hiring functions .
They have one person ( or more ) at central HQ who does all the hiring for the company 's operations .
My managers often come to me and say " would n't it be more efficient to do this hiring in one place ? "
I say no .
The reason is one of accountability .
I want my managers fully accountable for their operations , and poor - performance excuse # 1 is always " well , we 're struggling because you saddled us with some bad employees . "
No one uses this excuse in my company .
If you have an employee that sucks , you hired him / her and you have to deal with it .
What I did instead was centralize the Human Resource support for our managers , making their lives easier without relieving them of accountability .
So I invested in some new web sites that capture potential workers and drive them to an application database that collects 10 resumes a day ( I am results 1,3 , 4 &8 on Google for camp host jobs and results 5 , 6 , & 7 for campground jobs ) .
Then I built a system where all my managers can access these resumes .
I also centralized the HR record keeping and payroll processing .
Purchasing
Centralized purchasing has been a harder impulse to resist , but I still do so .
We order a lot of the same supplies in our various locations , and with more and more stores , many of the same goods for resale .
But I still have my local managers buy most of that stuff for themselves .
Am I crazy ?
Well , I would have thought so when I was in business school .
After all , its fairly easy to demonstrate that vendors will give better rates for larger orders , and surely it 's inefficient from a labor standpoint to disperse purchasing and to duplicate efforts .
First and foremost , though , I am still a stickler for accountability .
Much of my thinking was shaped by Chuck Knight at Emerson Electric , who was nearly always willing to trade centralized cost savings for accountability .
I would much rather my managers have no excuses than save a few pennies on toilet paper purchases .
However , there are a few things we can do .
We are starting to build a shared supplier database , where managers can share particularly good supplier deals with their peers .
We also have centralized purchasing of uniforms and forms , but even here we have been burned .
In the past , we assigned this task to a central person , who eventually built up a huge warehouse of crap it has taken us years to clean out .
Though we do n't get quite as good of a deal , we now have printing and uniform contracts with negotiated corporate rates based on our combined corporate usage , but where managers place their own orders and shipping is directly to the field ( rather to a central location for reshipment ) .
Net , we saved thousands in labor , shipping , and inventory getting out of the central break - bulk business .
For our resale items , I get a lot of presure from individual store managers to let them do purchasing of so - and - so product for the whole company in order to get quantity discounts .
I have allowed this in a few cases , but it may cause more problems than it is worth .
I immediately started getting complaints from manager A that manager B was buying all the wrong stuff , or whatever .
Soon , the folks doing the central purchasing started demanding that they needed more and better information , and started asking for written inventory reports from various store managers each month .
Eek !
I think instead that I am going to mostly stick with the approach of negotiating corporate deals , and having local managers continue to do their own ordering using these deals .
I also work hard to make sure managers understand that in most cases the corporate negotiated products are optional , and that they may buy other products if they think those are better for their locations ( I can guarantee that visitors in Northern California , Nogales Arizona , and Central Florida want different things ) .

A Florida County has said it does n’t want to be the beneficiary of a $ 10 million government grant for a low - priority road project :
WASHINGTON , Aug. 17 — It is not often that a local government tries to turn down $ 10 million in federal construction money .
But then it is not every day that an Alaska congressman surprises a Florida community with the gift of a highway interchange that just happens to abut the property of a major political fund - raiser .
The money for the interchange was the work of Representative Don Young , the Alaska Republican who was chairman of the transportation committee before the last election .
Officials of Lee County considered the project a low priority , environmental groups opposed it and the Republican congressman from the district never asked for it .
Why , you may ask , is a Congressman in Alaska giving your money , and mine , to a county way down in Florida ?
Well , that ’s where the story becomes very interesting :
[ T ]he interchange , on Interstate 75 at a place called Coconut Road , would be a boon to Daniel J. Aronoff , a Michigan real estate developer with adjacent property who helped raise $ 40,000 in donations to Mr. Young at a fund - raiser in the region shortly before Mr. Young inserted an earmark for the project in a transportation bill .
(…)
Adding to the intrigue , a researcher commissioned by Ms. Johnston said Mr. Young had added the earmark for the interchange to a transportation bill after both chambers of Congress had approved it , at a time Congressional aides were cleaning up the bill for President Bush ’s signature .
None of this should be surprising , though .
This is the same Congressman Don Young who , only a few weeks ago , said the following :

­ Although gasoline engines have improved a lot , they are still not very efficient at turning chemical energy into mechanical power .
Most of the energy in the gasoline ( perhaps 7­0 % ) is converted into heat , and it is the job of the cooling system to take care of that heat .
In fact , the cooling system on a car driving down the freeway dissipates enough heat to heat two average - sized houses !
The primary job of the cooling system is to keep the engine from overheating by transferring this heat to the air , but the cooling system also has several other important jobs .
The engine in your car runs best at a fairly high temperature .
When the engine is cold , components wear out faster , and the engine is less efficient and emits more pollution .
So another important job of the cooling system is to allow the engine to heat up as quickly as possible , and then to keep the engine at a constant temperature .

In this article , we 'll learn about the parts of a car cooling system and how they work .
First , let 's look at some basics .
Haskell is an amazing language .
One can easily embed a DSL ( domain specific language ) using monad .
Let 's take an concrete example to illustrate the power of DSL and Monads in Haskell .
I was always fascinated by a very useful , and nifty program , called remind .
It is a very sophisticated calendering program that allows one to set reminders .
For example , " REM 4 July MSG It 's Independence Day ! " , will trigger an reminder on every July 4th .
However , this kind of simple reminders can be set using any calendering application .
' Remind ' provides a very flexible date specification for setting reminders .
The date spec consists of ' day month year weekday ' .
If you omit the date spec , the reminder occurs every day .
If you specify only the day part , then the reminder is triggered on the specified day of every month .
If only month is specified , then the reminder is triggered every day of the specified month .
And so on ...
You can take a look at the man page of the remind for more details about the date spec rules .
Remembering the above rules can be tricky .
Instead , let 's see if Haskell can help us here .
I used an idea proposed by Ketil Malde on Haskell - Cafe mailing list on how to handle calendar dates in Haskell .
Here is the basic idea :
data Year = Y Int
data MonthEnum = January | February | March | April | May | June | July | August
| September | October | November | December deriving ( Show , Eq , Enum , Bounded , Ord )
data DayEnum = Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday deriving ( Show , Eq , Enum , Bounded )
data Month = M MonthEnum Year
data Day = Dm Int Month
Haskell uses lazy evaluation by default .
This makes it easier to represent an infinite stream of years starting from 2007 as :
years = [ Y y | y <- [ 2007 .. ] ]
Using similar list comprehension notation , list of months in a given year and list of days in a given months can be represented as ,
months ( Y y ) = [ M m ( Y y ) | m <- [ January .. December ] ] days ( M m yy@ (Y y ) )
| m `elem` [ January , March , May , July , August , October , December ] =
[ Dm d ( M m yy ) | d <- [ 1..31 ] ]
| m == February =
[ Dm d ( M m yy ) | d <- [ 1.. if y `mod` 4 == 0 then 29 else 28 ] ]
| otherwise = [ Dm d ( M m yy ) | d <- [ 1..30 ] ]
Notice how leap years are handled in producing days in a given month and year .
The above code was taken from the Ketil Malde 's message at Haskell - Cafe and converted to add Enums .
I added some boilerplate code to display the months properly by implementing an instance of the type class , Show :
instance Show Month where
show ( M m t ) = show m ++ " " ++ show t instance Show Year where
show ( Y y ) = " " ++ show y instance Show Day where
show ( Dm d t ) = " " ++ show d ++ " " ++ show t
With the above addition , and using the fact that List in Haskell is a monad , we can easily represent the following ,
-- all days of all months of all years ( only the first 3 items are shown )
* DateStream > take 3 ( years >>= months >>= days )
[ 1 January 2007 , 2 January 2007 , 3 January 2007 ]
-- first day of every month of every year
* DateStream > take 3 ( years >>= months >>= return . ( Dm 1 ) )
[ 1 January 2007 , 1 February 2007 , 1 March 2007 ] -- all days of january of every year
* DateStream > take 3 ( years >>= return . ( M January ) >>= days )
[ 1 January 2007 , 2 January 2007 , 3 January 2007 ]
Notice , how easy it is to express the list of days that you are interested in .
You can even filter the days by using the ' filter ' function provided in Haskell for lists :
-- all mondays in June of any year starting from 2007
* DateStream > take 6 ( filter ( isDayOfWeek Monday ) ( years >>= return . ( M June ) >>=
days ) )
[ 4 June 2007 , 11 June 2007 , 18 June 2007 , 25 June 2007 , 2 June 2008 , 9 Jun
e 2008 ]
'isDayOfWeek ' function requires calculating the ' day of week ' .
All this functionality in just 43 lines of code ( including comments ) .
This already implements all combinations of Remind 's date spec that does not involve day of week .
It should n't be hard to implement the same for day of week .
Most importantly , the user only needs to use simple keywords , such as , years , months , days , january and combine them using the monadic bind operator , '>>='.
There , you have a small DSL for calendar apps .
You can browse the file here .
Feedback , corrections and suggestions are most welcome .
Update :
As some readers pointed out the leap year calculation were wrong .
Thanks for the feedback .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A preliminary analysis of air samples from North Korea shows " radioactive debris consistent with a North Korea nuclear test , " according to a statement from the office of the top U.S. intelligence official .
The statement , from the office of Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte , was sent to Capitol Hill but not released publicly .
CNN obtained it from a congressional source .
If confirmed , the nuclear weapons test that North Korea claimed it conducted on Monday would be the first of its kind since Pakistan 's underground blast in 1998 .
( Watch information on first evidence of radioactivity -- 1:23 )
Pyongyang 's claim has renewed fears of a regional arms race and that North Korea might aid terrorists with nuclear materials or technology .
( Full story )
The national intelligence office statement said the air samples were collected Wednesday , and analysis found debris that would be consistent with a nuclear test " in the vicinity of Punggye " on Monday .
" Additional analysis is ongoing and will be completed in a few days , " the statement said .
The South Korean Defense Ministry told CNN that the United States has informed it that radioactivity has been detected .
The report is in contrast to information provided to CNN earlier Friday from two U.S. government officials with access to classified information .
Those officials said that an initial air sampling over North Korea showed no indication of radioactive debris .
The White House said it had no confirmation that the North Koreans conducted a nuclear test .
" We 've seen the various press reports , " said National Security Council spokesman Fred Jones .
" We still have no definitive statement on the event .
The intelligence community continues to analyze the data . "
The U.S. Air Force flew a WC - 135 Constant Phoenix atmospheric collection aircraft on Tuesday to collect air samples from the region .
The intelligence community and the military will also continue to collect air samples in the region and use satellite information to try to collect radiological data that would confirm a nuclear test , officials said .
But as time goes on , it will be increasingly difficult to achieve confirmation .
Officials emphasized earlier Friday that the data collected are preliminary and provide no conclusive evidence about the North Korean event .
It is possible there was no radiological data .
That could be the case if : the North Koreans successfully sealed the site ; it was such a small detonation and so deep underground there was no escape of nuclear debris ; or the test was actually conventional explosives .
The U.N. Security Council has agreed to vote Saturday on whether to impose sanctions on North Korea over the purported nuclear test , according to John Bolton , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations .

Does Jesus make you fat ?
Apparently so .
Here is an obesity map of the United States from the Centers for Disease Control .
The darker the read the higher the percentage of obese residents in that state .
When I first saw the map it immediately struck me that the fat states are the Bible - belt states .
Bible - believing Christians like to argue that the body is the temple of God .
And they loveso I guess it follows that they loveas well .
Of course the red states in the fat map are also the “ red states ” on the political map since America has divided itself political on religious grounds with the Republicans being dominated by an American version of the Taliban and the Democrats being secularists for the most part .
Libertarians were once proudly secular but these days one has to wonder .
Compare the fat map to theUSA map that was circulated after the last presidential election .
There is lots of overlap .
Certainly the Bible - belt states tend to be the fat states .
This is no surprise actually .
The Bible - belt states tend to be dysfunctional is dozens of ways .
They are more crime prone , less educated , have more poverty , more venereal disease , higher teen pregnancy rates , higher divorce rates , more homicides , shorter life spans , etc .
See here , previously identified the most fundamentalist states in America as Alabama , Arkansas , Georgia , Kentucky , Louisiana , Missouri , Mississippi , North Carolina , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Tennessee and Texas .
Every one of these states have obesity levels exceeding 25 % of the state ’s population .
At the same time I identified the US states that were the least religious .
Those were California , Massachusetts , Maine , Montana , New Hampshire , New Jersey , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont , Washington and Wyoming .
Everyone of these “ secular ” states had obesity rates below 20 % .
Religiosity and obesity seem to go together .
I do n’t purport to prove that religion causes people to be fat .
I actually do n’t believe that .
Nor do I think that religion causes them to have higher divorce rates , higher VD rates , higher crime rates , etc. , even if all those connections are there .
In reality I suspect that religion , and other forms of dysfunctional behaviors and attitudes , come from a common root : a lack of intelligence .
There is a clear correlation between crime rates and intelligence .
The less intelligent people are more likely to commit crimes .
But lower intelligence is positively correlated with all sorts of dysfunctional attitudes and actions .
The reality is that people’t stupid because they are fundamentalists -- they tend to be fundamentalists because they are stupid .
And this level of , as Steve Allen would describe it , is responsible for lots of other social problems .
Dumb people tend to be fatter , more criminally prone , more likely to contract VD , more likely to have children out of marriage , more likely to be drug addicts , alcoholics or exhibit a myriad of social problems .
FED ATTEMPTS TO BAIL OUT BANKRUPT WALL STREET SPECULATORS ; CHENEY DEMANDS STAGED TERROR ATTACKS , WAR WITH IRAN Washington DC ­ August 12 , 2007 ­ By deciding to ante up $ 38 billion for a hopeless bailout of predatory Wall Street hedge funds and the banks that stand behind them , Federal Reserve Chairman Helicopter Ben Bernanke has placed the bankrupt US dollar on a direct course towards the precipice of hyperinflation .
In so doing , he has given new momentum to the backers and controllers of Dick Cheney , who favor an insane flight forward into general war with Iran , deluding themselves that they can thus escape from both military defeat in Iraq and Afghanistan , and from the death agony of the dollar .
On August 9 - 10 , the European Central Bank , the Bank of Japan , the Federal Reserve , plus the central banks of Australia , Norway , Switzerland , and other countries " injected " the equivalent about a third of a trillion dollars ( $ 325 billion ) into the money systems of the world .
The Bank of Japan handed out a dramatic ¥ 1 trillion , about $ 8.5 billion .
The European Central Bank showed signs of panic , or of realism , by spewing out about ¤ 160 billion over two days .
Their goal was to stave off a spreading panic at bond trading desks and in the capital markets of the world about junk bonds , collateralized debt obligations ( CDOS ) , mortgage backed securities , and other paper debt instruments .
At about 9 AM on Friday August 10 , the Chicago futures markets suggested that the Dow Jones Industrial average would open down about 190 points .
That meant the potential for spreading stock market panic , with the DJIA closing down 1,000 to 2,000 points or more by the end of the day , quite possibly pitching more banks and hedge funds into bankruptcy .
Such an event would also tend to awaken the US middle class to the fact that their 401 ( K ) and IRA pension plans were being liquidated .
This would make the financial crisis a political crisis as well , and perhaps stoke the fires of impeachment .
Helicopter
Ben therefore followed his predecessor , Bubbles Greenspan , on the path of bailout , although on a larger scale than what Greenspan had ever attempted in public .
Bernanke and the New York Fed bought up $ 38 billion of toxic mortgage - backed securities from the principal hyenas of Wall Street -- led , we can be sure , by Goldman Sachs , Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , J.P. Morgan Chase , Merrill Lynch , and Citibank .
For bailout purposes , the banks were given a sweetheart interest rate , just 4 % , less than the 5.25 % target Fed funds rate used for interbank lending , and much less than the 6.25 % the Fed requires from banks coming to its own discount window under normal circumstances .
The $ 38 billion , injected in three doses during the course of the day , in addition to other Fed measures , was almost enough to prop the market up for eight hours ­ the Dow closed with a loss of 31 points .
So the central banks will need to provide more fixes , sooner rather than later .
As Alan Greenspan instructed Bill Clinton when the latter took office , the bond market , also referred to as the capital or credit market , is much more important than the stock market in the current US - UK financial system .
Right now not just dubious junk bonds and mortgage - backed securities , but even the classic triple A investment grade corporate bonds , are in great distress .
Indeed , the bond market has partially shut down in response to the crisis .
This is far more serious than a mere stock market crash , such as the one of October 1987 .
The Bank of England has said nothing about injections , and is poised to raise its interest rates once again , putting additional pressure on the dollar by tempting hot money to flee out of Wall Street to London .
The British may well figure that when the battered US greenback goes under , the British pound sterling will remain afloat , and benefit from the US shipwreck .
London has in any case already replaced New York as the real financial capital of the world ; this has been a strategic priority for Gordon Brown for some years .
WALL STREET DERIVATIVES MONSTERS ­ TOO BIG TO BAIL OUT
It would take more than $ 38 billion to bail out Goldman , Bear , Merrill , and the rest .
The bonds of the firms just mentioned are already rated as high - risk junk .
The Wall Street banks and investment banks represent a black hole into which literally trillions of dollars could disappear without a trace ­ it is enough to cite the derivatives holdings of JP Morgan Chase and Citibank , who are listed in the spring 2007 report of the Controller of the Currency as having $ 105 trillion in derivatives between them , and the reality is a multiple of that .
In addition , there is fear of the unknown .
This past week traders from Rick Santelli in Chicago to London stock touts have reported that a large financial entity ­ something probably bigger than Goldman Sachs ­ has been selling off a portfolio of some $ 10 to $ 15 billion in value .
No one has said publicly what this entity is , or what this " unprecedented event " might represent .
A few days ago , oil hit an all - time high of $ 78 per barrel .
It then fell back 10 % , because so much of the price of oil ­ at least $ 30 at present levels ­ is pure hedge fund speculation .
And these hedge funds , as they near bankruptcy , massively sell off oil futures .
Gold has taken some nasty dips for the same reason .
DOW 36,000 IN SIGHT ­ THANKS TO HYPERINFLATION
In 1998 , neocon economic commentator James Glassman got some attention by predicting a steady rise to Dow 36,000 .
Now , Glassman mat get his wish ­ THANKS TO hyperinflation .
If the central banks continue to " inject " tens of billions of dollars every day , while secretly buying masses of worthless kited paper from banks and investment banks , we may soon experience a fool 's paradise interlude which to some will look like recovery ­ after all , the stock market may appear to be rising .
But watch the prices for milk , other food items , gasoline , and other staples .
If they begin to levitate upward , we will know that the fan and bellows of hyperinflation are indeed at work .
Helicopter
Ben earned his name some years ago by giving a speech in which he said that he could stop a panic from becoming a depression by dumping bales of dollars out of helicopters to provide stimulus .
He has thus always had a hyperinflationary overtone .
On Tuesday , August 7 , Bernanke presided over a Fed meeting that refused to cut interest rates , and also failed to offer the bankrupt speculators words of assurance that they would be assisted .
This was followed two days later by a panicked selloff , with the DJIA down 387 points .
DEATH AGONY OF THE US DOLLAR
These events represent a new phase of the death agony of the US dollar , which has been in decline since about the start of the Iraq war , and has gone from 80 cents to buy a euro to almost $ 1.40 .
Knowing that the dollar is a wasting asset , and also because of widespread hatred for Bush , everyone in the world has been attempting to dump the dollar in any way possible .
Russia has set up a ruble - based trading system where oil , gold , and grain can be bought ; they do n't take American Express .
Iran tried to set up a euro - denominated oil market , but has been prevented from starting it because of US - ordered UN sanctions and related economic warfare .
But Iran has asked Japan to pay for its oil with yen , not with dollars .
Brazil and Argentina have eliminated the dollar in their bilateral trade .
Many European oil companies have eliminated the dollar from their international operations .
Every time the dollar is cut out of a lucrative commodity flow , Wall Street and the London Eurodollar market lose the ability to skim 5 % to 10 % off the top of these transactions in the form of financing , banking services , and fees .
NO MORE ZERO INTEREST LOANS FROM TOKYO
For the past five years , the dollar has enjoyed massive support from the Bank of Japan 's zero interest rate policy .
This allowed hedge funds to load up with free money in Tokyo and transform those yen into dollars to use in speculating in US markets .
This created a constant demand for dollars , and also tempted hot money away from Tokyo into high - risk , high - yield investments elsewhere , a practice known as the yen carry trade .
But this so - called yen carry trade is ending : the Bank of Japan has now raised its rate to 0.5 % , and is set to hike it again this month .
This has played havoc with so - called emerging markets for more than a year .
The main advocate for the weak yen , my college classmate Hiroshi Watanabe , was ousted from the Bank of Japan some weeks ago .
As the yen gets stronger , meaning as it goes from 118 to 117 to 115 to 110 on the television screen , the huge mass of kited loans becomes harder and harder for the US borrowers to pay back , since the yen has become more expensive .
Therefore any fall in the dollar in relation to the yen will result in chain reaction bankruptcies among the US firms which went overboard with yen carry trade loans .
This danger is very real .
The dollar has been very weak against the yen lately .
In fact , the dollar has been very weak in general , falling to an all - time low of almost $ 1.40 to a euro , and a 26 - year low of about $ 2.05 to a British pound .
There has also been a long - term low against the Canadian dollar .
Given that the US trade deficit is approaching $ 1 trillion , this cannot come as a surprise .
All of this represented the background to Helicopter Ben 's dilemma of the past two weeks .
If he kept interest rates and money supply at their current levels , the subprime mortgage crisis would spread to all non-Treasury bonds and paper , blowing out the bond market .
If he lowers interest rates , the dollar will fall like a stone , and the yen carry trade hangover will sink the Wall Street banks .
If he raises interest rates to save the dollar , the banks go bankrupt anyway because of the contagion from the collapsing mortgage bubble .
For a time it seemed as if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , quasi - governmental institutions which deal in mortgage - backed securities , would be used to bail out bankrupt mortgage - backed paper by buying it up , with the taxpayer ultimately left holding the bag .
( Fannie and Freddie participate to some extent in the " full faith and credit " guarantee that covers Treasury bonds . )
But Fannie and Freddie are already deeply troubled institutions , as the early stages of the bubble collapse have already revealed .
Using them for a bailout is being blocked by the Bush White House .
That leaves Helicopter Ben with the option of directly monetizing debt ­ taking in Wall Street 's bankrupt mortgage paper and paying out dollar bills in return .
He took the first step towards doing just that this past Friday morning .
PANIC DUMPING OF DOLLAR AND HYPERINFLATION LOOM
The Fed measures taken so far have sharply increased the money supply , making the dollar even weaker .
Wall Street is clamoring for an emergency rate cut of one half percent or even one full percent as early as next week .
If this is done , the dollar will surely take a spectacular dive .
Fed boss Paul Volcker was always haunted by the fear of a sickening slide of the dollar which , once begun , would be impossible to stop .
Depending on what Bernanke does , we may now be near such a point .
In the present situation , a dollar panic is always latent .
Scenarios have long circulated about a young MBA manager in Kuala Lumpur or Taipei who comes into the office one morning and decides that his central bank is holding just a few too many dollars .
He orders that a hundred million or so be sold .
This generates a rumor that the dollar is being dumped by the country in question .
A panicked rush for the exits begins .
Central banks join the stampede .
Country after country begins dumping its dollars and its US Treasury securities .
By the time the wave reaches the US , the dollar is down to 30 % of its value the previous day , and the Treasury market is in chaos .
Volcker may yet live to see his nightmare become reality , in a time - lapse sequence .
As I show in Surviving the Cataclysm , the German hyperinflation of 1923 peaked at a rate of 4.2 trillion paper marks to a US dollar .
The main cause of this hyperinflation was the British and French policy of driving down the mark to create economic chaos and prevent Walter Rathenau 's German - Russian Rapallo alliance .
But the main point for our present purposes is that the mark was ruined first and foremost by its international exchange rate .
We too may be headed into an era when shoppers take their dollars to the supermarket in a shopping cart , and bring their purchases home in their pockets .
This is especially so since today everything in the US except for certain food items is imported from low wage sweatshops abroad .
If the dollar collapses , hyperinflation will result all the more readily , since such a large part of the consumer 's market basket is composed of imports .
If Bernanke had been intelligent , he would have silently bailed out the two Bear Stearns hedge funds back in June , effectively suppressing the issue , and steering clear of a much larger crisis .
He is reviled in Wall Street for not doing this .
Given this track record of weakness and incompetence , Bernanke now appears likely to try to quiet the clamor of Wall Street for easy money .
His nickname will truly be an omen of hyperinflation .
Another wrinkle in the scenario is that Bush and the Democratic Congress are already on a collision course over spending , with Bush demanding draconian spending cuts which never occurred to him while the GOP ruled Capitol Hill ; the goal is to weaken the Democrats with their own key constituencies , who are demanding some largesse from the new majority .
Senator Schumer has signaled that he wants to bail out mortgage paper , meaning that he wants to save Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs .
Bush is adamant that there will be no bailout .
An irrepressible conflict is therefore more than likely .
We have seen how Bush dealt with Iraq , and then with Katrina .
Now we are seeing how he deals with a financial breakdown crisis .
THE PAULSON - BERNANKE PLUNGE PROTECTION TEAM IN ACTION
The $ 38 billion is outrageous , but it is not all that the Fed was doing for the wealthy parasites of Wall Street .
Since about 1989 , the Fed has funded a shadowy organism called the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets , more popularly known as the plunge protection team or PPT .
This entity intervenes every day to prop up Wall Street 's speculative house of cards .
The PPT buys stock futures in Chicago with the goal up updrafting stock prices in New York .
As long as the PPT can keep the price of the Chicago future above the price of the underlying stock on the NYSE , speculators and program traders will sell the future and buy the stock , accomplishing the PPT 's goal of generating totally fictitious demand and preventing gaping market breaks where there is simply no bid for stocks offered .
A few billion of futures buying in Chicago can generate tens of billions of buying in New York ­ especially when the operation is signaled by Wall Street figures known to be de facto spokespersons for the PPT , such as Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs .
Once speculators know the PPT is moving in , they can pile on the bandwagon , and realize nifty short - term gains before selling to the suckers before the next dip .
Hundreds of billions of dollars of Fed money have been committed in this way .
Whenever you see a sharp rise of the DJIA right before the close based on no news , you can be sure that the PPT is in action .
The PPT is basically illegal , but it may have been authorized by secret presidential executive orders , starting under Bush senior and Clinton .
Today , Bush would justify it as a war measure to maintain orderly markets .
One of the first published descriptions of what is now called the PPT appeared in my George Bush : The Unauthorized Biography ( 1992 ) .
In the wake of 9/11 , accounts in the corporate press boasted of the protection that the PPT was giving small investors .
Since then , discussion of the PPT has largely been banished to the Yahoo Finance message boards of stocks like JPM , C , GS , BSC , WM , LEH , MS , and other financial institutions .
Journalists beholden to the financier oligarchy never mention the PPT .
On CNBC , ham - handed interventions by the PPT are nervously explained away as " bargain hunters " or " small investors making a stand . "
Most recently , Gary Dorsch has contributed a detailed study of the PPT entitled " The ' Plunge Protection Team ' Working Overtime , " Global Money Trends Magazine , August 9 , 2007 .
The panic had started in mid-June , when two hedge funds controlled by Bear Stearns , the sleazy sixth - ranked investment bank in Wall Street , had disintegrated .
First it was announced that the hedge fund investors would get fifty cents on the dollar .
Then they were told they would get nothing .
In spite of this , the DJIA hit an all - time record at 14,000 and a fraction on July 20 , although only with a big push from the PPT .
" The entire capital structure from equity all the way to AAA can go to nothing , " Steve Eisman , a portfolio manager at Front Point Partners , told a July 19 conference call on the subprime mortgage debacle , according to the New York Times .
By July 26 - 27 , triple digit dives of the DJIA had become the order of the day , as rumors swirled about Bear and Goldman .
Soon it became known that investors in a third Bear hedge fund were being told that they could not withdraw their money .
SYSTEMIC BREAKDOWN CRISIS
In Surviving the Cataclysm , my 1999 study of the world financial crisis , I developed the distinction between collapse and disintegration .
A collapse can be very serious , like the Wall Street crash of 1929 .
Prices plummet , but the exchange still remains open for business .
Disintegration is much more serious , like the British default of September 1931 that swept away the only monetary system the world had in those days , or the German hyperinflation of 1923 , which wiped out the entire German middle class .
The US crash of 1987 was a classic collapse , and it was followed by a short recovery of sorts .
What is happening today looks much more like disintegration , meaning that credit markets , including bond and junk bond markets , have partly ceased to function as far as non-government securities are concerned .
The discredited Bush Administration has counted for very little in this crisis .
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , a Goldman Sachs insider , said in the early phases of the panic that the subprime crisis was " contained . "
At a later point Bush commented that he had been told that there was a " soft landing " ahead .
The only thing that Bush was sure of was that there should be " no bailout " ­ and this is now the Republican line , no matter how many ordinary families were thrown out on the streets .
As for the financiers , they get their bailouts through the corrupt Federal Reserve .
NOT JUST ONE BANKRUPT HEDGE FUND , BUT TWO DOZEN -- FOR STARTERS
Back in September 1998 , at the time of the Russian state bankruptcy around bonds called GKOs , Long Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) , a Connecticut hedge fund , went bankrupt , blowing a hole of several hundred billion dollars in the world banking system .
LTCM used high leverage and the Black - Scholes model to place gigantic bets on currency movements .
If Greenspan had not rushed in with billions of Fed money to carry out a back - door crony bailout , the interbank clearing systems of the US , UK , and perhaps Japan ­ known as CHIPS , CHAPS , and BoJ Net , would have jammed up , and the hearts of the financier universe would have ceased to beat , leading swiftly to world economic chaos and depression .
But this time it is not one LTCM , but two dozen highly - leveraged hedge funds which have blown up or are about to .
Prominent among them are the so - called quant funds , which bet $ 10 billion and up on financial fluctuations using computerized predictive models .
Prominent among these is Renaissance .
The quants complain that their models , which are supposed to incorporate 45 years of market history and experience , are now failing to forecast what will happen next , and losses are mounting .
The reason is that we have now encountered a cataclysmic singularity which has not been seen in more than half a century ­ the beginning of the end of the US dollar .
To find a financial earthquake comparable to the present one touching the leading currency of the world , we must in fact go back to the disintegration of the British pound in September , 1931 .
In recent days , reality has filtered through , even on CNBC .
Commentators have warned of " systemic risk if a big bank blows , " " the end of the world , " " depression , " " Armageddon , " " panic , " " the Hindenburg " ( the dirigible , not the signal ) , " a return to 1990 " ( when Citibank was bankrupt and secretly seized by the Controller of the Currency ) , the crash of 1987 , the hedge fund crisis of 1998 , and a " credit crunch . "
" Bond traders are afraid . "
" Wall Street is afraid . "
Led by Jim Cramer with his celebrated on - air psychotic episode on the afternoon of Friday , August 3 , Wall Street has been heaping insults on Helicopter Ben and demanding that he open the cash spigots , cut the fed funds and discount rates drastically and quickly , and reassure the stockjobbers that back door crony bailouts will be available for all , starting with the too big to fail , like JP Morgan Chase and Citibank .

What needs to be done first of all is the commitment that not one nickel of public funds should be spent on bailing out bankrupt and panic - stricken junk bonds and other paper .
The US needs a uniform federal law stating quite simply that , unless and until the president can certify that the current world financial crisis has been overcome , any and all foreclosures on homes , farms , businesses , hospitals , and infrastructure are banned .
This would be accompanied by a debt freeze or debt moratorium on payment of principal and interest , again for the entire duration of the crisis .
Something similar was done in the New Deal .
The interests of bankrupt banks and mortgage lenders must yield to the social imperative of not evicting 10 or 15 million people over the coming months .
No bailout of the financiers .
Just a law that stops foreclosures , and lets the financiers , not the people , fend for themselves .
A federal ban on foreclosures is obviously a measure in the New Deal tradition .
A monetarist follower of Milton Friedman or von Hayek , by contrast , would say that the homeowners who default should be thrown into the street , so that the market can work .
A Malthusian might care only about the carbon footprint of the homes involved .
A mexophobe would rant that illegal aliens might get some of the money .
In this wasteland of ideas , the New Deal approach emerges as the only one consistent with human life and human civilization in such a crisis .
Republican Ron Paul , interviewed on August 10 after the close by the infamous Kudlow , blamed the credit market panic on interest rates which had been too low .
Paul should recall that any interest rates above 5 % , as charged on these mortgages , are historically very high .
( During World War II , for example , successful New Deal policies allowed a typical 2 % yield for a 10 - year Treasury note , with other rates in line with that . )
Paul was adamant that there be no bailout , but did not distinguish between help for ordinary people facing foreclosure and eviction on the one hand , and bailouts for predatory financier sharks on the other .
His only advice was to " let the market liquidate bad debt and bad investment " ­ which , under current conditions , will mean that more than 10 million people will be thrown out on the street during the next few months .
One hears an echo of monetarist Andrew Mellon , Herbert Hoover 's Secretary of the Treasury , whose advice on how to deal with the Great Depression was " Liquidate labor , liquidate stocks , liquidate real estate . "
Those on the receiving end of such " creative destruction , " as Schumpeter called it , have generally lost their enthusiasm for monetarism .
Paul mocked warnings that " poor people are losing their homes " ­ a sadly Dickensian moment , since that is just what is happening to ten million Americans .
When asked how much he would like to cut federal spending , Paul said that under his presidency it would come down by " 50-60 -70 % " ­ figures which seem to bode ill for the future of Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , food stamps , unemployment insurance , WIC , Head Start , S - CHIP ( medical care for poor children ) , TANF ( what is left of welfare for mothers with dependent children ) , and other programs which keep many Americans alive .
The Republican line from Giuliani to Paul is that these institutions are part of the hated " nanny state . "
When asked for specifics about what he would cut , Paul mentioned the abolition of the Department of Education , a favorite target of Republicans .
Does that include Pell grants and federal support for subsidized Stafford loans , which are the only way the ghetto poor and much of the middle class can hope to send their children to college ?
No help here for victims of the current economic breakdown crisis , but Kudlow said that this approach would be well received on Wall Street ..
GOPer Ron Paul has said that he admires the late Ohio Senator Robert Taft , " Mr. Republican , " who was like many in his family a member of Skull and Bones .
One wonders if this admiration includes Taft 's sponsorship of the infamous union - busting Taft - Hartley Act , which has allowed many southern states to effectively block union organizing with so - called " right to work " laws , thus greatly facilitating the demolition of the US labor movement over recent decades .
Taft - Hartley has been the key to the race to the bottom in wages and working conditions in this country .
It should be repealed and replaced with a modern version of the pro-labor Wagner Act , which made it easier for workers to organize , bargain collectively , and defend themselves .
Repeal of Taft - Hartley would be a first step towards rolling back the low - wage Walmart - McDonalds model for the US economy .
THE UPTICK RULE OF 1934 ABOLISHED ­ JUST IN TIME FOR THE PANIC
In an irony of history , traders in the Chicago futures pits have been complaining to CNBC about the abolition only a few weeks ago of the 1934 New Deal era rule which had required short sellers to wait for an uptick in the stock they were targeting before they could complete their trade .
The rule change had produced disruptions and uncertainty , the trader complained on CNBC .
The New Deal rule , one of the final vestiges the regulations introduced after the Great Crash of 1929 , was one of the last factors saving today 's finance oligarchs from themselves .
Once the uptick rule was gone , the death agony of the current system entered a new phase .
WORLDWIDE ASSET BUBBLE
Tiresome commentators have been prating on ad nauseam about the unprecedented world - wide boom .
What we have in fact been witnessing since Bush 's attack on Iraq has been a world asset bubble , benefiting derivatives , hedge funds , stock and real estate speculation , junk bonds , and other paper instruments .
In the real world , 2 billion people , a third of the world , have to get by on less than $ 2 per day .
Some 40,000 human beings per day do not make it , and succumb to starvation , malnutrition , or diseases like dysentery and diarrhea which can be cured for pennies .
Under almost two decades of globalization , this situation has been getting worse , not better .
That is the big picture from which all real analysis must start .
As for the United States , the living standard has fallen by about 65 % since the beginning of the current reactionary political cycle with the coming of Nixon in 1968 .
The US is currently running a merchandise trade deficit of between $ 800 and $ 900 billion , heading for a trillion dollars per year soon .
This means that the US has to borrow more than $ 2 billion per day just to keep sucking in food , consumer electronics , and services from the rest of the world .
The foreign dollar overhang is enormous : about $ 1 trillion each in Japan , China , and Saudi Arabia , who now in effect hold a mortgage on the USA .
On top of all this , the US is already thoroughly de-industrialized .
Steel , chemical , and auto are now a shadow of their former selves .
Industrial employment has dropped to the lowest levels in well over a century .
The US industrial economy ended when Volcker ran the Federal Reserve and instituted a 22 % prime rate in 1978 - 1980 .
As the dollar falls , we will hear commentators assuring the public that a collapsed currency will mean that US exports are cheap .
The problem is that there are almost no factories left to produce anything that might be exported , so these benefits cannot accrue .
THE COLLAPSE OF AUTO AT THE ROOT OF TODAY'S CRISIS
The big event , the great economic watershed of the last two years , has been the demolition of the auto industry , the heart of the US postwar economy .
Not just the Big Three have been hit hard , but also suppliers like Delphi , Lear Corp. , Tower , and Collins & Aikman have been gutted by predators like Cerberus and Wilbur Ross .
During the Bush years , 300,000 industrial jobs have been lost in auto .
But the tragedy does not stop here .
As the Minneapolis bridge collapse tragedy , the New York steam pipe explosion , and the Utah mine disaster remind us , this is an economy approaching the point of actual physical breakdown , that is to say of thermodynamic collapse .
The interstate highway system with its bridges and tunnels is in ruins .
Freight rail , passenger rail , and commuter rail are junk heaps .
The electricity grid goes into brownouts and blackouts on hot summer days .
Commercial aviation has passed beyond the breaking point .
Water systems , from the Mississippi levees of Katrina to the cryptosporidium - laced water of Washington DC , are appalling .
There is a deficit of about 1,000 modern hospitals in rural American and in the inner cities , but viable hospitals are being shut down all the time because of predatory financier incursions ­closing that need to be stopped in their tracks by that federal law forbidding foreclosures , however camouflaged .
This is an economy decades deep in post - industrial rot , running an infrastructure deficit of $ 10 trillion and probably much more .
The private sector has already struck out , as in the case of the high - toll Dulles Greenway near Washington DC during the 1990s , and in the looting of the fixed capital of the freight rail system by predatory management .
What is to be done ?
Let the venture privateers build the Trans - Texas corridor ?
Call in the hedge fund vultures and privatize the Indiana turnpike , guaranteeing only that money will be siphoned off the pay greedy venture capitalists located based abroad ?
Tell people they should walk or use bicycles ?
Or take the New Deal approach , which would rebuild infrastructure with thirty - year 2 % loans from a special window at the nationalized Fourth Bank of the United States , the former Federal Reserve .
This would include giving every US city a comprehensive urban mass transit - interurban train system with the goal of saving the billions of man hours lost to traffic jams and road rage , while taking perhaps one third of cars off the roads during rush hours by offering an attractive commuting alternative .
BREAKDOWN STAGE OF GLOBALIZATION
Under the globalization of the 1990s , the system lurched from one brush with systemic crisis to the next ­ the Mexico and Orange County crisis of 1994 was a typical example .
In 1998 , when the globalized system threatened to implode because of the LTCM and Russian GKO crises , Greenspan began citing the danger , not of systemic breakdown , but rather of the Y2 K computer glitch , which might cause viable banks and firms to appear bankrupt .
Greenspan therefore cranked up the printing presses and flooded the gutters of Wall Street with sloshing liquidity .
When Brazil was about to go bankrupt in 1999 , Soros demanded a " wall of money , " and he got it .
The result of all this was the dot com bubble of 1999 - 2000 ; the dot communists went belly up starting in the spring of 2000 .
The dot com-heavy NASDAQ lost 80 % of its value .
Greenspan responded to this with a new bubble , this time in housing and real estate .
As home prices went into the ionosphere and adjustable rate mortgages and interest - only mortgages were given to applicants of the most modest means , Greenspan celebrated the " wealth effect , " meaning that home owners were now supposed to take out a second mortgage ( or home equity loan ) on the additional value of their property , and then spend that extra money in the stock market .
The housing bubble got going in earnest with Bush 's attack on Iraq in March 2003 , and expanded home ownership was a favorite Republican theme in the 2004 elections .
The Wall Street - London casino economy of hedge funds , derivatives , and pure speculation may sometimes seem to be a separate and self - contained universe , but it is not .
It ultimately depends on income flows which have to be derived from the real productive and physical economy of the world ­ that is to say , from manufacturing , farming , mining or other production somewhere .
Finance oligarchs do not like to be reminded of this , but every few decades a depression or even a breakdown crisis comes calling to remind them of this basic fact .
Contrary to what is said on CNBC , the US economy is not sound , and the debt - strapped US consumer has indeed reached the end of the line .
THE FOUR TRILLION DOLLAR HEDGE FUND BUYOUT ORGY OF 2006 Under Bush , with figures like White and Paulson at the Treasury , Wall Street has forgotten what productive investment in new plant and equipment even looks like .
Millions of jobs have been lost to the runaway shop under the auspices of free trade swindles NAFTA , CAFTA , GATT , and WTO .
Under the reign of these financial parasites , we have witnessed an unprecedented boom in leveraged buyout deals , where one group of corsairs used junk bonds to take over an existing company , often firing many of the employees , cutting the wages and increasing the hours of those who remain , introducing speedup , busting unions , terminating health care , selling off parts of the business , and leaving what is left groaning under the burden of crushing debt which has not added anything to technology or other capabilities , but has lined the pockets of Wall Street lawyers and investment bankers .
These deals are a microcosm of what is wrong with US vulture capitalism today : paper wealth for a few gluttons of privilege is maximized , while jobs , wages , working conditions , and productive output in the real economy are mercilessly driven down .
Leveraged buyouts and junk bonds need to be outlawed as a public menace .
When Wall Street begs for aid in the coming months , do n't forget that they were the ones who for years applauded every time American workers were fired by a leveraged buyout ( LBO ) pirate .
Since paper profits are no longer invested in anything productive , they flow into these leveraged buyout deals , often called private capital transactions .
The peak of this activity came in 2006 , when there were $ 4 trillion in mergers and acquisitions , with $ 1 trillion of straight leveraged buyout deals .
About $ 500 billion of this frenzy came in December 2006 , setting the stage for 2007 to become the crisis year it has now become .
Every LBO or private equity or private capital deal means fewer jobs , lower wages , less buying power , and thus , most to the point , less ability to keep up with mortgage payments .
This problem was escalated by the takeover of many of the subcontractors and parts suppliers of the auto industry by predator hedge funds during 2005 - 2006 .
It got even worse when battered Chrysler was sold by Daimler Benz to the Cerberus Fund , aptly named after the hound of hell .
As the collapse and looting of auto rippled through the economy , the income flows on which the sustenance of the mortgage bubble depended were severely constricted , leading to the current panic .
CONTRACTION IN REAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE USA
Thirty - six years ago this week , on August 15 , 1971 , President Nixon ended gold settlement among nations and fixed currency parities , and thus pulled the plug on the Bretton Woods world monetary system , the most successful world currency arrangement that the world has ever known .
Nixon was responding to British demands for gold payment .
Among many crimes , this was Nixon 's greatest .
Since then , world economic growth has gone negative , into reverse , with net world deindustrialization in the US , the former USSR , eastern Europe , the UK , the EU , and elsewhere .
( Only China , partially outside the system , represents a consistent exception . )
During all these years , the London - New York financiers have been concerned to keep political power in their own hands by engineering a gradual decline or " soft landing , " treating the US population like the frog in the pot of water which is slowly brought to a boil .
The key to this has been the looting of underdeveloped countries to keep the homeland stupefied and inert .
In all these years , the big question has been about The Contraction ­ that is to say , about the moment when events like the 1987 stock market and dollar crash , the 1990 banking crisis , or the 1998 hedge fund debacle would begin to translate into mass layoffs , business shutdowns , economic disruptions , Hoovervilles , and bread lines inside the US itself .
This is what happened over 1930 , as the US descended into the Great Depression .
It appears to be happening right now .
HARBINGERS : FREIGHT CAR LOADINGS DOWN 4.2 % ; TRUCKLOAD VOLUME DOWN 5 %
It would appear that the point of Contraction has been reached in the first months of 2007 , and that the real or physically productive economy has been in marked decline for some time .
This is also the opinion of Richard C. Cook .
It is hopeless to rely on the cooked figures of the Bush administration , the most notorious liars of the age .
Private associations may well be more accurate .
One obvious data series for measuring real economic activity is freight car loadings and trucking ton-miles , which few hedge fund operators have ever heard of .
But these real - world physical units are a useful way of estimating overall levels of real economic activity , as distinct from total derivatives held by banks and other measures based on toxic paper .
According to the American Trucking Associations , " the truckload industry started 2007 poorly as seasonally adjusted ( SA ) volumes plummeted 5.0 percent from December .
This was the largest monthly decrease since a 6.5 percent drop in February 2000 .
Compared to January 2006 , the total SA loads index was off 2.3 % , which was the first year over year contraction since July 2006 . "
( American Trucking Associations , Trucking Activity Report , 15:3 ( March 2007 ) .
The same tendency was confirmed several months later by the Association of American Railroads , which announced that for the week ending April 28 , weekly rail car loadings were down 1.7 % and intermodal units were down 5.6 % , both compared to the same week a year before .
For the first 17 weeks of 2007 , rail car loadings were down a cumulative 4.2 % , while intermodal trailers were down 11.5 % ( Dow Jones , May 3 , 2007 )
These are only fragmentary snapshots , but they do provide more than a strong hint that the Contraction is indeed upon us .
Are there any economists left who still look at the real , physical economy ?
The great question posed by any depression is , who should pay for it ?
Should working people , the victims , pay by having their wages , working conditions and standard of living driven down even lower than the current minus 65 % ?
Or should it be those responsible -- the economic royalists and financial parasites , the jackals , lampreys , and hyenas of Wall Street -- who are made to disgorge ?
For any person of good will , the answer is clear .
The full program for doing this is discussed in my book Surviving the Cataclysm : Your Guide Through the Worst Financial Crisis in Human History ( 1999 ) .
One more example will suffice .
SLAP A SECURITIES TRANSFER TAX ON WALL STREET
With the New York Stock Exchange churning over 2.5 billion shares per day , and with the VIX volatility index at an all - time high , how might markets be cooled down ?
One socially useful way to do this would be the Securities Transfer Tax or Tobin tax , a levy of about 1 % on the total turnover of securities markets ­ stocks , bonds , futures , options , derivatives , Treasuries , foreign exchange , and other paper property titles ­ paid by the seller on each transaction .
It is named after Professor James Tobin of Yale University , who originated this idea as a way to discourage rampant speculation in currency markets .
It would be eminently fair .
Right now the financiers who send trillions of dollars rushing through the markets every day all get an absolutely free ride .
By contrast , working people who need to buy clothing , shoes , and school supplies in many states have to pay the odious and regressive sales tax , second only to the ultra - regressive poll tax as the worst tax ever devised .
In Maryland the sales tax is 5 % , but groceries are exempt .
In Virginia , there is a 7 % sales tax , and supermarket checkouts are included .
In California the sales tax is often 7.75 % .
If working people have to pay these taxes , why cannot finance oligarchs pay a mere 1 % on their speculative activity ?
The results could be liberating : right now US banks probably hold derivatives , including structured notes , to the tune of some $ 400 to $ 500 trillion of notional value .
A 1 % Securities Transfer
Tax would thus produce some $ 4 to $ 5 trillion of new revenue ­ enough to guarantee Social Security into the 22nd century , replenish Medicare and Medicaid , fully fund Head Start and WIC , and begin rebuilding vast sectors of infrastructure to give the US a modern economy , not a post - industrial rubble field .
All that is needed is political will .
CREDIT FOR JOBS AND PRODUCTION , NOT FINANCIAL BAILOUTS
The Fed 's $ 38 billion at 4 % , if committed for a decade or two , would have been enough to reconvert and retool the dying Detroit automobile industry to produce modern urban mass transit and long - range maglev trains .
( Consider than Chrysler was sold to Cerberus recently for a paltry $ 5 billion . )
A hundred thousand industrial jobs could have been secured , and much more .
Or , $ 38 billion would finance a permanent human colony on the moon , with incalculable benefits in the form of technological spin-offs , and honoring Stephen Hawking 's prophetic observation that humanity has no future if we do not go into space .
The $ 325 billion wasted worldwide would have been enough to give all of Africa clean water , electricity , and transportation .
Instead , that third of a trillion was shoveled into the furnace of the panic to keep the hyenas above water for one more day .
The Fed has never lifted a finger to prevent millions of Americans from being thrown out of their homes , but when the malefactors of great wealth , the Wall Street bankers , were threatened , the Fed sprang into action .
NEEDED : CHEAP FEDERAL CREDIT FOR REAL PRODUCTION
At the end of the day , the secret of economic recovery is that the Federal Reserve System is illegal , unconstitutional and a failure .
It thus needs to be nationalized at once , and incorporated into the federal government as a bureau of the US Treasury .
This means that decisions about interest rates , money supply , relative priorities of full employment or reducing inflation , bailouts or non-bailouts , would have to be made by public laws , debated in election campaigns , passed by the congress , and signed by the president ­ not decided in secret by unelected and unaccountable cliques of finance oligarchs .
The resulting national bank or Fourth Bank of the United States should issue tranches of $ 1 trillion long - term , low - interest credit from time to time for production for business activity in industry ( meaning manufacturing ) , farming , mining , infrastructure , home building , public construction at Davis - Bacon rates , new productive plant and equipment , new productive jobs with union pay scales , infrastructure of all types , and other areas of tangible , physical production .
New schools , hospitals , libraries , and other socially necessary projects should also be funded .
But those who want money for any kind of financial speculation , flipping condos , gambling , prostitution , organized crime , narcotics , drug money laundering , pornography , and other sociopathic activities will be cordially invited to take their chances in the free credit market they admire so much .
As long as the credit goes only to well - managed productive projects , the loans will be repaid , and revolving credit arrangements will allow these payments to be recycled into a series of additional projects .
With these methods , it should be possible to create 4 to 5 million new , productive , jobs per year at union wages , putting an end to decades of monetarist unemployment , underemployment , and despair .
Full employment , something most living Americans have never experienced , would be attained within four to five years , and the country returned to the status of a high - wage economy , not a low - wage service economy .
As Richard C. Cook says , the essence of New Deal economics is to see credit as a public utility .
It is too important to be left to greedy banksters .
The nationalization of the Fed is more feasible now than it was a few months ago .
Wall Street is boiling with resentment against Helicopter Ben , partly for his failure to bail out the Bear Stearns hedge funds and other entities silently , through the back door .
A cartoon lampooning Helicopter Ben 's ineptitude and incompetence has even appeared in the Washington Post , which since the mid-1930s has been the house organ of the Federal Reserve System .
( August 11 , 2007 )
In the current crisis , Helicopter Ben may well assume the role of the infamous Brownie of Hurricane Katrina , and this is in fact the theme of the cartoon just mentioned .
Helicopter Ben may actually believe some of the monetarist garbage that he has been spouting before his students for so many years .
If he does , the damage will be incalculable .
The Fed may soon become so hated by wide sectors of the US population , providing the first chance we have had for a serious attack on this illegal institution since the late 1930s .
CHENEY'S THERMONUCLEAR BAILOUT
The disintegration of the dollar system is ultimately one of the strongest factors impelling Cheney 's controllers ­ meaning the George Shultz - Rupert Murdoch faction of the US - UK ruling elite .
From Cheney 's point of view , an economic depression requires drastic austerity measures to drive the standard of living down even further below its present reduced level , with the proceeds going to the finance oligarchs .
Can these cuts in the standard of living be accomplished under the present system ?
If not , what kind of dictatorship can be used to impose them ?
This is , after all , the reason the German financiers like Schacht turned to Hitler .
The Cheney doctrine calls for a staged terror attack in the US using WMD , followed by an attack on Iran and the declaration of martial law under Bush 's many executive orders .
As I pointed out on July 21 in my " Cheney Determined to Strike in US with WMD this Summer , " there are many signs that the neocon group is driving hard to implement the Cheney doctrine this summer .
Thom Hartmann has reported on Air America that lawmakers with whom he has spoken report that the US intelligence community continues to issue warnings to the Congress that a new terrorist attack is coming .
According to one unconfirmed report , a US Senator is reported to have told an impeachment activist that the Democrats could not impeach Bush - Cheney , because the senators were being threatened with " them blowing up seven US cities " ­ a possible reference to statements by Juval Aviv , a veteran Israeli intelligence fixture .
Aviv warned on August 2 that there would be a new terrorist attack on the US within no more than 90 days , with multiple targets : " What they 're going to do is hit six , seven or eight cities simultaneously to show sophistication and really hit the public .
This time , which is the message of the day , it will not only be big cities .
They 're going to try to hit rural America . "
The McClatchy newspaper chain is reporting that Cheney is continuing to push behind the scenes for an attack on Iran : " Behind the scenes , however , the president 's top aides have been engaged in an intensive internal debate over how to respond to Iran 's support for Shiite Muslim groups in Iraq and its nuclear program .
Vice President Dick Cheney several weeks ago proposed launching air strikes at suspected training camps in Iraq run by the Quds force , a special unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps , according to two U.S. officials who are involved in Iran policy . " ( Warren P. Strobel , John Walcott and Nancy A. Youssef , " Cheney urging strikes on Iran , " McClatchy Newspapers , August 10 , 2007 ) A MIRROR FOR CHENEY : THE FÜHRERKONFERENZ OF AUGUST 22 , 1939 What do Cheney 's closed - door arguments to Bush sound like ?
We cannot know for sure right now , but we can use historical precedent to get an idea of what the old reprobate is saying .
To cite the obvious parallel at the beginning of the last world war , let us recall Hitler 's arguments in favor of the Nazi attack on Poland at the Führerkonferenz of Nazi bigwigs , government ministers , and top generals on August 22 , 1939 ­ almost 68 years ago this month .
The reader will note from these excerpts how Hitler emphasized the prospect of economic breakdown as a key reason impelling him towards war : " I have called you together to give you a picture of the political situation in order that you may have some insight into the individual factors on which I have based my irrevocable decision to act and in order to strengthen your confidence .
For us , it is easy to make the decision .
We have nothing to lose ; we can only gain .
Our economic situation is such that we cannot hold out more than a few years .
Goering can confirm this .
We have no other choice , we must act .
The political situation is favorable to us .
All these fortunate circumstances will not prevail in two or three years .
No one knows how long I shall live .
Therefore a showdown , which it would not be safe to put off for four or five years , had better take place now .
I shall give a propagandist reason for starting the war ­ never mind whether it is plausible or not .
The victor will not be asked afterward whether he told the truth or not .
In starting and waging a war it is not right that matters , but victory .
Close your hearts to pity !
Act brutally !
Eighty million people must obtain what is their right
The stronger man is right !
Be harsh and remorseless !
Be steeled against all signs of compassion !
Whoever has pondered over this world order knows that its meaning lies in the success of the best by the means of force . "
( Shirer , Rise and Fall of the Third Reich , pp. 529-532 )
Acting out a Nietzschean creed which he shared with today 's neocons , Hitler within a few days manufactured the Gleiwitz radio station incident .
This operation was carried out SS General Heydrich on the evening of August 31 , and provided Hitler with the immediate trigger for war .
SS provocateurs staged a raid on a German radio station near the Polish border and read an anti-German tirade on the air .
Some drugged German concentration camp death row inmates were then delivered to the scene under Operation Canned Goods .
These bodies , dressed in Polish uniforms , were riddled with bullets and left around the station to give the impression of the aftermath of a firefight .
Goebbels , the controlled media of the day , screamed unprovoked Polish aggression against Germany .
This is the incident which Hitler then cited as the immediate pretext for war .
Neocon spokesmen are coming forward to glorify the coming slaughter .
Among them is Stu Bykofsky of the Philadelphia Daily News : " One month before The Anniversary , I 'm thinking another 9/11 would help America .
Remember the community of outrage and national resolve ?
America had not been so united since the first Day of Infamy - 12/7/41 .
We knew who the enemy was then .
America 's fabric is pulling apart like a cheap sweater .
What would sew us back together ?
Another 9/11 attack .
It will take another attack on the homeland to quell the chattering of chipmunks and to restore America 's righteous rage and singular purpose to prevail . "
In the last week of July , congressional scoundrel Tom Tancredo announced that a new terror attack was imminent , and demanded that the US issue an ultimatum that such an attack would be answered by the destruction of the Islamic holy places in Mecca and Medina .
The State Department invited Tancredo to shut up , which may actually signal some resistance there against the wider war .
On Friday , August 10 , after the carnage of the day on Wall Street , CNN reported that there were unsubstantiated internet threats of a radiological dirty bomb in truck bomb format which might be delivered in New York City , Los Angeles , or Miami .
In New York , the attack was supposed to come on 34th street , where Macy 's department store and the Empire State Building are located .
It then transpired that the only source for this absurd rumor was Debka File , a notoriously unreliable speaking tube for certain fringe elements in the Israeli intelligence community .
Debka
File claimed to have gotten this intelligence from intercepted al Qaeda communications , but the guess here is that it was simply made up out of thin air .
These incidents were part of a broader pattern : on the afternoon of August 8 , one of the hottest days of the year , a mysterious package , probably somebody 's lunch , was found in the DuPont Circle metro stop on the red line .
Three stations were ordered close by the Homeland Security Department , and the entire rush hour was held up for three hours , causing an upheaval on the lives of tens of thousands of commuters .
The mysterious package was then exploded , and found to be wholly innocuous .
Chertoff would like to be the P.T. Barnum of terror stunts , but he seems to be falling short .
The urgent need was for a politician to stand up on national television and warn that any new terrorist WMD attack would come directly from Cheney 's office , and that the Cheney faction should be held criminally responsible , including under the Nuremberg Code .
IS A STRIKE WAVE COMING IN THE US ?
Forty years of passivity , demoralization , apathy and defeat weigh heavy on the US population .
But the mass strike may not be as far away as is generally supposed .
A veteran organizer for the United Auto Workers observed in the 1980s that Americans were never going to rise up in mass action , because they were too concerned that one missed paycheck would result in eviction from their homes .
Suddenly , 10 million or more have nothing left to lose , and they may soon be joined by many more .
A mass strike cannot be decreed by bureaucrats , nor is it totally spontaneous .
It requires thorough preparation , but it is likely to be detonated by an outside event , often of the most unpredictable type .
The only thing to do is to keep up a campaign of mass political education about the vast possibilities of a general strike , especially in response to an illegal war and / or an unconstitutional dictatorship , of the type which Cheney 's controllers so ardently desire .
Royal has trailed Sarkozy in a hundred consecutive polls and is unlikely to make up the six to nine points that separate the two candidates .
With 44 million Frenchmen and women heading for the polls , it looks very much as if Sarkozy 's mix of promised radical change , economic liberalism and outright hard right populism has brought him victory - and possibly by a significant margin .
There is still a chance of an upset .
Polls in France have been badly wrong before and 14 per cent of the voters , enough to swing the election , were apparently still undecided last night .
But Sarkozy , 52 , one of the most controversial and divisive figures of recent French political history , remains likely to replace outgoing President Jacques Chirac at the Elysee Palace .
His slogan throughout months of campaigning has been ' Together , everything becomes possible ' .
' That ... is the least you can say , ' muttered Loïc Delaurens , 29 , a newspaper seller near the Place de la Republique in Paris , who voted Communist in the first round of voting two weeks ago .
Sarkozy 's team has already started working on the formation of a government and planning legislation , sources close to the former Interior Minister admitted .
' We 'll get the parliamentary elections out of the way [ in six weeks ] and then really get moving , ' said one member yesterday .
The campaign has been extraordinarily bitter , reflecting a polarised and divided people who know they are making a historic choice between very different individuals and very different programmes .
' If Sarkozy has the will and the ability to turn his announced policies into reality , he will turn France upside down , ' said Ivan Rioufol , a leader writer at the right - wing Le Figaro newspaper .
Royal , 53 , also provokes fierce emotions , attacked by the right as an incompetent spendthrift representative of an unreformed left responsible for decades of cultural , social and economic decline .
But the career politician , daughter of an army officer and educated at elite universities , remains far less controversial than her rival , the son of an immigrant seen as an outsider even by the establishment right .
For those who are voting against him , Sarkozy , whose electoral strategy has been to hunt votes amid the third of French voters who profess a ' sympathy ' with the ideas of the extreme right , is ' the abomination of abominations ' .
' This is a man who shook the hand of George Bush , who will destroy the French social model , who will institute a police state , ' said Geraldine Chene , a Lyon - based Socialist activist .
' We hate him and all he stands for . '
Sarkozy 's uncompromising statements on immigration are behind much of the fierce emotion he excites .
Lilian Thuram , the French football star , has vociferously attacked Sarkozy 's ' racist ' rhetoric .
He told The Observer yesterday he hoped that ' if Sarkozy is President he has the wisdom to find the words to unite the French ' .
Key public figures , such as the former tennis player and singer Yannick Noah , have pledged to leave the country in the event of his victory .
' You would think we were on the brink of civil war , ' said Jacques Marseille , an author and historian .
For Mohammed Chirani , 29 , who is walking across France to call for unity among his fellow citizens , ' the election has crystallised all the faultlines that divide the nation .
I 've never seen so much fear and hate .
I 'm not optimistic for the country , whoever wins . '
And though Royal 's claims last week that a Sarkozy victory would lead to ' violence ' were dismissed as scaremongering by her opponent 's media team , significant social strife is likely if he wins .
Many local mayors in areas where tensions are already high - Sarkozy is hated in many of the poorest housing estates in France for having described delinquents as ' scum ' - are planning heavy police deployments tonight .
There is talk too of a ' third round ' of the election in the streets .
France 's powerful unions last week vowed a trial of strength with Sarkozy who , through his plans to modify France 's legally enforced 35 - hour week , labour laws and expensive welfare model , is seen as the living incarnation of ' the excesses of American - style capitalism ' .
' If Nicolas Sarkozy thinks that if elected he will have the right to push through all the reforms that he has announced , whatever the unions think of them , then he is making a big mistake , ' said Bernard Thibault , the general secretary of the CGT , France 's biggest union .
If Sarkozy wins , his likely Prime Minister is Francois Fillon , a former minister and senator reviled by the left for his controversial pension reforms five years ago .
There is still a chance that the ' anyone but Sarko ' alliance might have scraped together enough votes for Royal to win .
Despite his final declarations on Friday promising unity , Sarkozy scares many .
' Normally I would n't vote for either of them , but the man 's thirst for power disgusts me , ' said Bruno Romain , 30 , a Parisian jobseeker as , with an estimated 23 million others , he watched the tense televised debate between the candidates last week .
But Royal - hindered by a lack of ideological coherence and a quarrelsome and jealous Socialist party - has failed to convince France 's restive working classes that she has the answer to their concerns about international economic competition , immigration and decreasing household incomes .
Sarkozy 's efficient campaign , specifically targeted at winning over the 11 per cent of voters who backed veteran extreme - right leader Jean - Marie Le Pen , tapped into the spirit of much of the nation .
It is in the old mining towns , the semi-rural zones on the periphery of the major cities , in the south and east , that Sarkozy has won most votes - helped by high unemployment , sluggish economic growth and a profound cultural identity crisis in the face of a globalised economy dominated by ' Anglo - Saxons ' .
Though Sarkozy 's voters tend to be old , he has won over the young too .
' We are losing all the values in this country , no one values the family , work , the nation any more , ' said Romain Mollica , 19 , a student in Marseille watching Sarkozy speak .
In Metz , Camille Goyot , 21 and at her first political rally , told The Observer France needed ' a strong leader ' who would get ' the lazy and pessimist French working again ' .
In Lyon , locals in one poor area talked of ' getting France back on track ' .
For one 73 - year - old man watching Sarkozy visiting a mining museum in staunchly conservative Alsace ' women have too much power ' .
For the campaign , Sarkozy dropped radical proposals on positive discrimination and state financing for mosques .
His speeches , with their references to Joan of Arc and Napoleon and bloody military victories such as Verdun , their rejection of guilt for collaboration with the Nazis , and their unapologetic insistence that those who do not want to conform to French values can always leave , have struck home .
Even among those worried by Sarkozy 's nationalism , his dislike of criticism or his taste for power , there are many attracted by his individualist , meritocratic message , whether defined as being able to choose a school , work longer hours or fire and hire more easily .
In Chaumont in the Haute - Marne , The Observer found scores of small businessmen - restaurateurs , shopkeepers - ready to vote for lower taxes and less social protection .
' Sarkozy 's support bridges any theoretical divide between haves and have - nots , ' said Jacques Levy , a political geographer at Lausanne University .
' He has won over the traditional economic bourgeoisie and has got the working classes back from the National Front . '
There is also support in communities of immigrant origin .
' We are sick of being parked in high - rises like victims , ' said one 29 - year - old man in Marseille .
' He 'll shake things up and allow us to stand on our own two feet . '
Sarkozy 's young spokeswoman Rachida Dati , a judge whose parents were born in North Africa , is likely to be an early ministerial appointment .
Yet Socialists such as Jean - Louis Tourai , deputy mayor of Lyon , had yet to give up hope yesterday .
He said Royal was the only person to heal France 's bitter divides .
' There are those who have faith in the future based in a positive vision of humanity and its evolution .
Then there are those who fear the future , who want to return to a mythical past where these supposed traditional values prevailed .
France is choosing between two ways of seeing man and his place in the world . '
A Sarkozy France ...
First Lady : Cecilia Sarkozy , occasionally absent wife , former concert pianist .
Prime Minister : François Fillon , Sarkozy campaign troubleshooter , or Jean - Louis Borloo , current Minister of Employment .
Power base : working classes ; small businessmen ; the very wealthy ; a grateful and loyal UMP party ; the old .

New national motto : ' If a President of France can not speak of France , what can he speak of ? ' or ' Work longer to earn more . '
A Royal France ...
First Man : Francois Hollande , father of Royal 's four children and Secretary of French Socialist party .
Prime Minister : Dominique Strauss - Kahn , moderate Socialist party veteran .
Power base : a grudgingly grateful party ; coalition of urban middle classes ; the young .

Together we are stronger .
Human values , not financial values . '
Predicted date Commentary
2000
There 's something about those three zeroes that made 2000 a favorite year among doomsday prophets .

Jan 1 , 2000 January 1 , 2000 .
Jesus did not descend from the heavens .
President Clinton did not declare himself dictator - for - life .
The Antichrist did not rise to power .
Nuclear missiles were not launched .
Aircraft did not fall out of the sky .
The global economy did not collapse .
Terrorist bombs did not explode .
The power did not go out .
My computer still works .
What we did have were some huge parties , spectacular fireworks displays , a Barry Manilow concert , head - splitting hangovers , lots of confetti to clean up , and some embarrassed survivalists who had spent their New Years holed up in armed fortresses when they could have been partying in Times Square .
Y2K !!
Compounding people 's apocalyptic hopes and fears for 2000 was a technological problem that came to be known as Y2 K .
This problem was hyped by the media , preachers , doomsayers and the authors of a myriad Y2 K preparedness books as something that promised to bring the world to a catastrophic standstill .
But thanks to the diligent efforts of programmers , governments and companies throughout the world , the bite of the " Y2 K bug " turned out to be mostly harmless .
There were a few minor glitches here and there , but nothing serious .
The fundamentalists who claimed that Y2 K is all part of God 's plan or that the Antichrist would use Y2 K to seize power have been proven wrong !
In the aftermath of this ultimate disconfirmation many of them have tried to salvage their dignity by saying " Just you wait !
It 's only the beginning of the end ! "
To the Y2 K doomsayers I smugly say , " I told you so ! "
In the honored tradition of the " comet pills " of 1910 , many hucksters took advantage of people 's Y2 K fears to reap a tidy doomsday profit by selling survival gear .
Now all those who " stocked up for Y2K " will have to figure out what to do with all those packets of freeze - dried food , bottles of water , gasoline generators , wood - burning stoves and shotgun shells .
Gary North was a major proponent of Y2 K preparedness back in the day .
In your face , Gary !!!
The Christian apocalyptic cult House of Prayer , headed by one Brother David , expected Christ to descend onto the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem on this day .
The Israeli government kicked them out of the country in a preemptive strike against potentially violent doomsday nutcases who may attempt to catalyze the Apocalypse through terrorist acts such as blowing up the Dome of the Rock .
John WorldPeace sent this post to Usenet , claiming that the failure of Jesus to return on January 1 will lead to the people of the world finally abandoning war and hatred as foolish pursuits and instead embracing peace , love and tolerance .
Would n't it be great if he were right ?
Bobby Bible , a 60 - year - old fundamentalist , believed that Jesus would descend from Heaven at the stroke of midnight in Jerusalem and rapture his church .
A Philippine cult called Tunnels of Salvation taught that the world would end on January 1 .
The cult 's guru , Cerferino Quinte , claimed that the world would be destroyed in an " all consuming rain of fire " on January 1 .
( I guess his prediction came partially true : there were plenty of fireworks going off around the world that night . )
In order to survive the world 's destruction , the cult members built an elaborate series of tunnels where he had stockpiled a year 's worth of supplies for 700 people .

( This date is shown as January 6 , 2000 in Richard Abanes ' book End- Time Visions . ) ( Abanes p. 43 )

Copeland did not imply he believed this to be accurate , though , but he went on to say that the Rapture will come soon .
Feb 29 , 2000
This day was the Gary North types ' last best hope for the collapse of civilization due to the millennium bug .
February 29 happens to be the exception to the exception to the 4 - year leap year rule , which some programmers may have neglected to incorporate into their date algorithms , and some believe computers may crash on this day .

Apr 5 , 2000 Doomsday , according to Michael Rood , who claimed that this day would start out with " bloodshed , plagues , and all manner of pestilence . "

May 5 , 2000 According to archaeologist Richard W. Noone in his book 5/5/2000 ­ Ice : The Ultimate Disaster , a buildup of excess ice in Antarctica ( strange -- I thought global warming making it melt ... ) is causing the earth to become precariously unbalanced , which is a ridiculous idea to anyone with the slightest understanding of earth science .
All that 's needed to upset this supposed imbalance and cause the obligatory pole shift -- which would cause billions of tons of ice to go cascading across the continents -- is the planetary alignment that took place on this date !
Not that it matters .
The big day has come and gone .
The Nuwaubians ( also known as the Holy Tabernacle Ministries or Ancient Mystical Order of Melchizedek ) claimed that the planetary lineup would cause a " star holocaust , " pulling the planets toward the sun .

Anyway , the email claims that there is a documentary entitled Welcome to Armageddon that features an interview with Jacob Hawkins of the cult House of Yahweh ( all members of their cult are required to change their surnames to Hawkins ! ) .
During the interview , Jacob claims that the world will end in a nuclear war in the middle of 2002 .
He supports his claim using the following logic : " It will happen ... there is no possible way it can't happen ! "

Agee has not yet tired of setting dates for the Rapture .
Now the Rapture is scheduled to take place on July 19 .
Yawn ....
Apr 22 , 2003 Theprophet foresees the Rapture occurring between October 10 , 1999 and April 22 , 2003 , more likely closer to the later date than the earlier date .
May 5 , 2003 A UFO will pick up true believers on this date , according to the Nuwaubians , a Georgia cult headed by Dr. Malachi Z. York , who claims to be the incarnation of God and a native of the planet Rizq .
( Time Magazine , July 12 , 1999 )
May 13 , 2003 Nancy Lieder of ZetaTalk believes that the " end time " will take place on this day with the approach of a giant planet known as the " 12th Planet " .
This planet supposedly orbits the sun once every 3600 years .
The planet will cause ... you guessed it !
A pole shift !!
Ms. Lieder gives some information about this on her Troubled Times site .
May 15 , 2003 A Japanese cult called Pana Wave , whose members dress in white , claimed that a mysterious 10th Planet would pass by Earth , causing its axis to tip and engendering devastating earthquakes .

The human race all but wiped out by nuclear war between Oct 30 and Nov 29 , 2003 , according to Aum Shinrikyo .
( Alnor p. 98 )
2003
The end of the Kali Yuga and the arrival of Krishna as the Kalki Avatar according to Sree Veera Brahmendra Swami .
( Both my sources have disappeared from the Net - you 'll just have to take my word for it . )
A number of Internet prophets are predicting that a giant planet called Planet X or the " Twelfth Planet " will pass by Earth in 2003 and cause anything from pole shifts to altered orbits or what have you .
In any event , the results are supposed to be catastrophic and apocalyptic , yadda yadda yadda ....
2004 Major world events beginning in August 1999 will lead to full - scale war in the year 2000 , followed by a rebirth from the ashes in 2004 , according to Taoist prophet Ping Wu .
Apr 24 , 2005 Ted Porter claims that the Second Advent will take place April 23 or 24 , 2005 .
He also said that the Rapture would occur at 6:13 pm ( Jerusalem time ) on April 23 , 2002 !
Most prophets set their predictions a long time in the future in an attempt to cover their asses , but this guy made this prediction barely 2 weeks before the Rapture was supposed to happen !
Oct 4 , 2005
The end of the world , according to John Zachary in his 1994 book Mysterious Numbers of the Sealed Revelation .
The Tribulation was to begin on August 28 , 1998 .
( McIver # 3477 )
Oct 15 , 2005
In an earlier posting , Ted Porter calculated that the Second Advent will happen on this date .
Oct 17 , 2004 Clay Cantrell puts the dimensions of Noah's
Ark through some contorted mathematics to arrive at this day as the date of the Rapture .
Oct 18 , 2005
The beginning of Christ 's Millennium , according to Tom Stewart in his book 1998 : Year of the Apocalypse .
The Rapture was to take place on May 31 , 1998 , and the Parousia on October 13 , 2005 .
( McIver # 3226 )
Nov 11 , 2005
A man named Kjell Wrengsted emailed me , claiming that the 7 - year Tribulation started on November 11 , 1998 , when the Israeli cabinet approved the Wye River Agreement .
2006
An atomic holocaust started by Syria is to take place between the years 2000 and 2006 , according to Michael Drosnin 's book The Bible Codes ( O' Shea p. 178 ) .
Here 's an excerpt from Drosnin 's discredited book : " I checked ' World War ' and ' atomic holocaust ' against all three ways to write each Hebrew year for the next 120 years .
Out of 360 possible matches for each of the two expressions , only two years matched both - 5760 and 5766 , in the modern calendar the years 2000 and 2006 .
Rips later checked the statistics for the matches of ' World War ' and ' atomic holocaust ' with those two years and agreed that the results were ' exceptional . ' "
The British cult The Family believes the end will come in 2006 .
Feb 12 , 2006 According to an unnamed Internet prophet , this will be the date of the height of the Antichrist 's power .
The Antichrist is none other than Prince William of England !
( This guy 's website breaks an inordinate number of web design taboos .
Prepare to be annoyed ! )
2007
The unnamed author of www.oocities.com/secondcoming1 suggests 2007 as the year of the Second Coming and the end of the world .
He ( she ? ) marks the Sharm Memorandum signed by Israel and the Palestinians on September 5 , 1999 .
Everett Vasek claims that Jesus might return between 2000 and 2007 .
Apr 29 , 2007
In his 1990 book The New Millennium , Pat Robertson suggests this date as the day of Earth 's destruction .
( Abanes p. 138 )
Aug 2007 Thomas Chase uses an incredible mishmash of Bible prophecy , numerology , Y2K , Bible codes , astrology , Cassini paranoia , Antichrist speculation , news events , New Age mysticism , the shapes of countries , Hale - Bopp nuttiness and more to show that Armageddon will happen around the year 2007 , perhaps in August of that year .
Sep 13 , 2007
The second Rapture , according to Marilyn J. Agee .
An asteroid is also supposed to hit the Earth on this day , she claims .
( Oropeza p. 89 )
Mar 21 , 2008
On this page , the Lord 's Witnesses use convoluted numerology to demonstrate that " the end of the world is 2008 March 21st . "
They also claim that the United Nations will take over the world between March 26 and April 24 , 2001 , and afterward nobody will be able to buy or sell without the Mark of the Beast !
Apr 6 , 2008
The beginning of Christ 's millennial reign , according to Philip B. Brown .
2009 According to Earth changes prophetess Lori Adaile Toye of the I AM America Foundation , a series of Earth changes beginning in 1992 and ending in 2009 will cause much of the world to be submerged , and only 1/3 of America 's population will survive .
You can even order a map of the flooded USA from her website !

( Shaw p. 223 )
2011 Another possible date for Earth 's entry into the Photon Belt .
( See the May 5 , 1997 entry )
May 11 , 2011 A Taiwanese prophet calling himself " Professor Wang " predicted that Taiwan would be destroyed in a 14.0 earthquake , triggering a tsunami that would kill millions .
May 21 , 2011 Harold Camping , whose rapture predictions failed in 1994 and 1995 , decided to jump back in to the date - setting game , predicting this as the day of the Rapture .
His prediction attracted major publicity .
" The Bible Guarantees It " , the billboards proclaimed , and thousands of people around the world actually fell for it .
May 29 , 2011 Marilyn
Agee has been at it consistently throughout the last couple of decades .
After countless failed predictions over the years , she has set yet another date for the Rapture .
Oct 21 , 2011
After the embarrassing non-rapture of May 21 , Harold Camping called the non-event an " invisible Judgement Day " and reset the Rapture to October 21 .
Dec 31 , 2011
In an interesting parallel to the Harmonic Convergence concept , Solara Antara Amaa - ra , leader of the " 11:11 Doorway " movement , claims that there 's a " doorway of opportunity " lasting from January 11 , 1992 to December 31 , 2011 in which humanity is given the final chance to rid itself of evil and attain a higher level of consciousness , or doom will strike .
( Wojcik p. 206 )
2012 James T. Harmon 's Rapture prediction # 3 . ( Oropeza p. 89 )
Dec 21 , 2012 Terence McKenna combines Mayan chronology with a New Age pseudoscience called Novelty Theory to conclude that the collision of an asteroid or some " trans - dimensional object " with the Earth , or alien contact , or a solar explosion , or the transformation of the Milky Way into a quasar , or some other " ultranovel " event will occur on this day .
Anyway , something is supposed to happen , and he has lots of pseudoscientific gobbledygook to back up his thesis .
Ever since the VRM conversation began with the Identity conversation , we ’ve looked to the car rental business as one that desperately needs unscrewing .
This has come home to me in the last few weeks , while I ’ve been on the road with the family , renting a bunch of cars .
Three experiences stand out .
First was when I brought my rental Chevy Cobalt back to Budget at SFO ( San Francisco ’s airport ) .
I had just filled the tank .
The indicator on the dashboard , however , said slightly less than full .
I showed my receipt to the woman who took in the car .
She said “ You only bought 1.35 gallons of gas , but drove 65 miles . ”
She said nothing more , and printed out a receipt from her hand - held device ( what do you call that thing ? ) , with a “ fuel charge ” of $ 9.50 .
By my math , the car got 48 miles to the gallon for the little I drove it : from San Jose to San Francisco and then to the airport — all highway driving .
How far off from reality could that be for a car that small and weak ?
But never mind the math .
This was clearly a screw - you .
To this woman I was a cheat , clearly .
And I was being punished for that .
Never mind that I ’m a Budget FastBreak member and rent from them a great deal .
Rules are rules .
The next unpleasantness happened in Cambridge , Mass , where our rented Buick from Alamo was a victim in a 5 - car accident in which an out - of - control car actually took off the corner of a cop car before jamming into the side of ours .
Nobody was hurt , and the whole thing was almost comically weird .
But at the end of the incident our car could not be driven and had to be towed somewhere .
I called Alamo ’s roadside assistance number , where the woman on the phone told me that she could n’t help me at all unless I had a police report .
The police on the scene told me that would n’t be ready until the next day .
When I relayed that information to the roadside assistance woman , she said she was sorry , but could n’t help me without the report .
She also told me I was n’t allowed to have the car towed back to the Alamo agency at Logan Airport until the police report was ready .
The only choice then was to let the police have it towed to an impoundment yard , where I would have to pay to spring it at some later time .
We reached an impasse there , at the end of which I asked if she could be of any further help to me , and she said no .
So I hung up — or thought I hung up — after which I said to my wife , “ Well , Alamo can go to hell . ”
Then the voice in my bluetooth headset said “ Pardon me , sir ? ”
Turns out I had n’t actually hung up .
The Treo does that , sometimes .
You press “ hang up ” and it does n’t .
I said , “ I did n’t know you were still on . ”
“ I ’m trying to help you , sir , ” she said .
“ I thought we had agreed that you could n’t do that without a police report , ” I said .
Then she explained that she has this routine that she has to go through in dealing with customers , and that the police report thing was pro forma .
But in fact she could at least help me by giving me a claim number .
Why she could n’t do that earlier she would n’t explain , and I did n’t press her on it .
With the help of the claim number , we were able to get a replacement car after we towed it back to the agency , and payed the tow fee , of over $ 100 .
But the runaround was no fun .
The third unfun experience came yesterday with Enterprise , from which we were renting a rather nice Toyota Corolla that we picked up at the airport in Baltimore .
Turns out it had extremely squeaky brakes , however , so we brought it in to the nearest Enterprise location .
There they swapped it for a Suzuki Reno .
Now , we had already upgraded from a “ compact ” to an “ intermediate ” at the airport so we could get a car with room for a family ’s full set of bags in the trunk .
The Suzuki barely has a trunk , and is hardly in the same class as the Corolla in other respects .
The guy at the agency said the Suzuki and the Corola are both “ considered intermediate ” in size ; but let ’s face it : they ’re not equivalent , much less “ similar ” ( which is the weasel word the car agencies use to swap you from what you thought you rented ) .
I would have preferred it if the guy had just said “ Hey , we ’re sorry , but this is all we ’ve got . ”
I could have accepted that .
But instead he tried to convince us that a clearly inferior car was “ equivalent ” .
In all three cases the agencies took a “ those are the rules ” approach to customer relations .
And , for all the gloss of fake - friendly greetings at the counter , it ’s clear that underneath these car agencies are as customer - hostile as ever .
So let ’s tell them what the rules are , instead .
Once we can do that , I ’ll know VRM has succeeded .
1. Wal - Mart
Because if there 's anything America loves , it 's a politician ...
In an attempt to put a smiley face on its tarnished image , Wal - Mart hires heavy - hitting public relations firm Edelman , which sets about using tactics derived from political races to reverse public perceptions of the giant retailer .
Dubbing its campaign " Candidate Wal - Mart , " the firm trumpets all manner of new Wal - Mart initiatives : improved employee health - care benefits , higher starting pay levels , new stores in downtrodden neighborhoods , reasonably priced organic foods , and a flat $ 4 fee for hundreds of generic prescription drugs .
As a result , candidate Wal - Mart quickly becomes , well , the most popular politician since Spiro Agnew .
By year 's end Wal - Mart suffers its first quarterly profit drop in a decade , sees same - store sales decline in November 's run-up to the crucial holiday shopping season , and suffers a series of public relations gaffes so stunning that it lands six spots in this year 's edition of the 101 Dumbest Moments .
It has several ' Modes ' , each one for performing a different task :
ImgBurn is a lightweight CD / DVD / HD DVD / Blu-ray burning application that everyone should have in their toolkit !
JAPAN has the oldest median age in the world , at nearly 43 .
Its wealth and a famously healthy diet keep its people going to a ripe old age , while a low fertility rate means fewer young people to redress the balance .
Europe accounts for the other nine countries in the top ten .
Germany and Italy both benefit from generous pension and healthcare systems , coupled again with fewer babies .
Bulgaria and Croatia , on the other hand , probably owe their rankings to the outflow of their young to find work .

[ Python - 3000 ] PEP Parade
So the PEP submissions are in , and a few late ones will be submitted ASAP .
Let me write up a capsule review of what we 've got .
Please let me know if I missed anything ( e.g. a PEP that someone has committed to write but has n't submitted yet ) .
First the PEPs that have numbers as of this writing ( I 'm pasting the section heads right out of PEP 0 , so apoligies for the formatting ) : S 3101 Advanced String Formatting Talin
While we 're still tweaking details , I expect this will be ready for acceptance soon .
We also have an implementation in the sandbox !
S 3108 Standard Library Reorganization Cannon
I expect this to happen after 3.0 a1 is released .
S 3116 New I / O Stutzbach , Verdone , GvR A prototype is in the py3 k branch .
There are details to work through ( like how to seek on text files with non-trivial encodings ) but I feel that the basis is solid .
I could use help coding !
S 3117 Postfix Type Declarations Brandl
I forgot to reject this -- it was my favorite April Fool 's post of the year though .
:-)
S 3118 Revising the buffer protocol Oliphant , Banks
Where 's this standing ?
I 'm assuming that it 's pretty much ready to be implemented .
I have n't had the time to participate in the discussion .
S 3119 Introducing Abstract Base Classes GvR , Talin
This is clearly still controversial .
It is also awaiting a rewrite .
I am still in favor of something this ( or I would n't bother with the rewrite ) .
S 3120 Using UTF - 8 as the default source encoding von Löwis The basic idea seems very reasonable .
I expect that the changes to the parser may be quite significant though .
Also , the parser ought to be weened of C stdio in favor of Python 's own I /O library .
I wonder if it 's really possible to let the parser read the raw bytes though -- this would seem to rule out supporting encodings like UTF - 16 .
Somehow I wonder if it would n't be easier if the parser operated on Unicode input ?
That way parsing unicode strings ( which we must support as all strings will become unicode ) will be simpler .
S 3121 Module Initialization and finalization von Löwis I like it .
I wish the title were changed to " Extension Module ... " though .
S 3123 Making PyObject_HEAD
conform to standard C von Löwis I like it , but who 's going to make the changes ?
Once those chnges have been made , will it still be reasonable to expect to merge C code from the ( 2.6 ) trunk into the 3.0 branch ?
S 3124 Overloading , Generic Functions , Interfaces Eby I have n't had the time to read this in detail , but in general I 'm feeling favorable about this idea .
I 'd rather see it decoupled from sys._getframe ( ) and modifying func_code ( actually __code__ nowadays , see PEP 3100 ) .
S 3125 Remove Backslash Continuation Jewett Sounds reasonable .
I think we should still support \ inside string literals though ; the PEP is n't clear on this .
I hope this falls within the scope of the refactoring tool ( sandbox / 2to3 ) .
S 3126 Remove Implicit String Concatenation Jewett Sounds reasonable as well .
A fixer for this would be trivial to add to the refactoring tool .
S 3127 Integer Literal Support and Syntax Maupin Fully in favor .
S 3128 BList : A Faster List - like Type Stutzbach
I still have misgivings about having too many options for developers .
While wizards will have no problem deciding between regular lists and BLists , I worry that a meme might spread among junior coders that the built - in list type is slow , causing overuse of BLists for no good reason .
But I am deferring to Raymond Hettinger in this matter .
S 3141 A Type Hierarchy for Numbers Yasskin Jeffrey has promised to rewrite this , removing most of the references to algebra .
I expect I 'll like his rewrite , once it happens .
Now on to the PEPs that do n't have numbers yet .
PEP : Supporting Non-ASCII identifiers ( Martin von Loewis ) I 'm on record as not liking this ; my worry is that it will become a barrier to the free exchange of code .
It 's not just languages I can't read ( Russian transliterated to the latin alphabet would be just as bad and we do n't stop that now ) ; many text editors have no or limited support for other scripts ( not to mention mixing right - to - left script with Python 's left - to - right identifiers ) .
But if this receives a lot of popular support I 'm willing to give it a try .
The One Laptop Per Child project for example would like to enable students to code in their own language ( of course they 'd rather see the language keywords and standard library translated too ... ) .
PEP : Adding class decorators ( ???)
I 'm in favor of this .
I 'm just writing for someone to write it up .
PEP : Eliminate __del__ ( Raymond Hettinger )
I would be in favor of this or one of the alternative ideas for fixing the can 't - GC - a - cycle - with - __del__ issue if there was a clear recipe and ( if necessary ) stdlib support for what to do instead .
There are real use cases for automatic finalization for which the atexit module is n't the right solution and try / finally or with statements do n't cut it either .
PEP : Information Attributes ( Raymond Hettinger )
This would be better served by a continued discussion about the merits and flaws of ABCs ( PEP 3119 and 3141 ) .
PEP : Traits / roles instead of ABCs ( Collin Winter )
This could serve as an interesting alternative to PEP 3119 .
However , I believe that it does n't really solve the distinction between abstractions that can be implemented as " classic " ABCs and abstractions that require a metaclass ( like TotalOrder or Ring ) .

During the first months of life Cinder was treated with all kind of medications , but in the end nothing helped .
Cinder was diagnosed with
Alopecia areata “ is a highly unpredictable , autoimmune skin disease resulting in the loss of hair on the scalp and elsewhere on the body " .
This common but very challenging and capricious disease affects approximately 1.7 percent of the population overall , including more than 4.7 million people in the United States alone ” according to the National Alopecia Areata Foundation .
When there is a total loss of hair , as in the case of Cinder , the condition is referred to as alopecia universalis .
According to the zoo , Cinder is otherwise a normal , healthy chimpanzee and , unlike humans , is not faced with the psychological and social challenges the disease presents .
Cinder has never been treated differently by her parents or foster siblings , as beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and hair is not essential quality in the eyes of chimpanzees .
Cinder is a hairless chimpanzee living at St Louis zoo ( US ) .
She looks like an old wise monkey , but she 's actually 13 years old .
When she was born , August 1994 , she had a beautiful , full coat of hair , but she began to loose her hair after some months .
A year later , Cinder was completely bald .

Health outcomes for patients in Canada are as good as or better than in the United States , even though per capita spending is higher south of the border , suggest Canadian and U.S. researchers who crunched data from 38 studies .
The findings were published in the inaugural edition of Open Medicine , a new online medical journal launching Wednesday in the aftermath of a rift last year between some editors and the publisher of the Canadian Medical Association Journal .
" In looking at patients in Canada with a specific diagnosis compared to Americans with the same diagnosis , in Canada patients had at least as good an outcome as their American counterparts – and in many situations , a better health outcome , " said one of the 17 authors , Dr. P.J. Devereaux , a cardiologist and clinical epidemiologist at McMaster University in Hamilton .
" And that is important because in the United States , they 're currently spending a little over $ 7,100 per individual on health care annually , whereas in Canada we 're spending a little over $ 2,900 per individual annually , " he said in a telephone interview from Brantford , Ont .
The study covered data on patient populations in the United States and Canada from 1955 to 2003 .
To conduct their meta- analysis , researchers identified almost 5,000 titles and abstracts .
Of these , 498 appeared potentially eligible on initial review .
Eventually , 38 studies were deemed to be eligible .
Researchers began by asking the question :
Are there differences in health outcomes ( mortality or morbidity ) in patients suffering from similar medical conditions treated in Canada versus those treated in the United States ?
" Overall , Canada did better , and in fact we found a statistically significant five per cent mortality advantage to people with diagnoses in Canada compared to their counterparts in the United States , " Devereaux said .
Because of the extreme variability in study - to - study results , the researchers suggested caution was appropriate in interpreting this finding .
Overall , 14 of the 38 studies showed better outcomes in Canada , while five favoured the U.S.
The other 19 studies showed equivalent or mixed results in the two countries .
Canada really stood out in one area – lower risk - adjusted death rates for dialysis care .
" What it ( the study ) shows is that despite an enormous investment in money we do not see better health outcomes ( in the U.S. ) , " Devereaux said .
" And importantly , where our two systems do diverge is that America has a mixture of private insurance in terms of the funding for health care whereas in Canada we have medicare system for hospital and physician services .
The medicare system allows us enormous efficiencies in terms of cost saving relative to private insurance . "
He said the Canadian health - care system does have issues and needs improvement , " but certainly using medicare funding and not - for - profit delivery is the best way to actually maximize health outcomes and in a cost - effective manner . "
The public is barraged by people saying Canada 's health - care system has problems and the solution is to move toward allowing two - tiered medicine , and for - profit health - care delivery , he said .
The researchers " wanted decisions made based on evidence , and not based on beliefs and ideologies , " Devereaux added .
Few uninsured patients in the U.S. , who probably suffer the worst quality care , were included in the studies examined .
Some explanations for the results include the fact that American health care has administrative inefficiencies that public funding – without multiple competing insurance companies – eliminates .
And because drug prices are controlled , Canada saves on prescription drug costs .

What is the meaning of subculture and what is its importance ?
So subculture means the culture which has differentiated norms and Values from its parent culture .
Subculture often maintains the founding principles of the parent culture .
Subcultures create their own norms and values regarding political as well as cultural matters .
They keep their specialties as well as specific characteristics intact as they ’re a part of the society .
Bikers , hippies and Goth are examples of subcultures .
The main development of subcultures took place in cultural studies as well as sociology .
Counter Culture and subcultures are two different matters of the society ’s part .
In the Oxford English dictionary , the meaning of subculture is quite different , it says “ the subcultures are cultural groups which exist within the larger cultures , and have interests and beliefs different from the larger culture . ”
In 1950 David Reisman differentiated between a majority group who “ accepted the commercially provided store styles and the meanings associated with them ” and a minority group forming the ‘ subculture ’ which took part in subversive values and actively sought minority styles .
In the year 1979 Dick Hebdige released his book in which he argued that subcultures are the subversion of normalcy .
The name of the book is “ Subculture : The Meaning of Style ” .
According to him subcultures dominated societal standards and were criticized usually thus Perceiving negativity .
To Hebdige ’s belief subcultures brought like minded people closer who felt neglected by the society of high standard , also it helped them in developing an identity .
In year 1995 , Sarah Thornton said that “ subcultural capital ” is the cultural commodity and knowledge that the minority group had in common and differentiated them from other groups and members .
In the year 2007 Ken Gelder differentiated counter cultures from subcultures and it was done on the basis of immersion of these cultures in the society .
There are 6 key ways proposed by Gelder in which subcultures can be identified such as :
The relation with work was seen negative , i.e. parasitic or idle , at leisure or at play . )
There was a negative relationship with the class as subcultures do n’t conform to a single traditional class definition and thus subcultures are not class conscious .
Association with the territory instead of properties i.e. the hood , the club , the street etc .
There are movements outside home and are indulged in domestic forms of belongings that is they ’ve social groups other than families .
Stylistic ties to exaggerations and excess .
Well , they do have exceptions .
Refuse to Massification and the banalities associated with the ordinary life .
There are many more personalities who did their research on subcultures and countercultures which mostly had sociologists included .
In year 1979 two sociologists Sheryl Kleinman and Gary Alan Fine argued that subcultures depict a group who motivates many potential members to shoot the behavior , artifacts asking with the values and norms which is the main characteristic of the group .
Interesting subcultures that you ’ll love to know about :
So , there are many subcultures which are formed over time by a minority group of people who are said to be like minded .
Well , many of these minority groups were able to establish their own identity and independently owned their values and norms .
So , let ’s have a look at different kinds of subcultures that you might find interesting .
The Parsis
The Parsis are the descendants of the people who were driven out of Iran due to religious persecution .
They flew to India during 640 CE .
There is widespread community of Parsis in the present scenario and that is mainly due to the immigration of professionals to the USA and Europe who are highly qualified .
The Parsis initially were considered as the followers of Zoroastrian religion which dated back to 3000 BCE .
Due wisp is their Central tenet which can also be found in the earlier religions .
They keep up with the previous religious tenets even when they tube their lives in the present scenario .
Presently Parsis are taking part in politics , cultural activities , philanthropy and businesses very actively and are getting highly educated too .
Within the past few decades the community has been dwindling due to less birth ratios and marriages .
Real Vampires
Alright , this term “ real vampires ” must have already got your attention .
Many of the people in the present generation are curious about learning more and more about vampires , but to be honest vampires are creatures which have fascinated mankind a lot .
Thus , there are secret community which consists of members who firmly believe that they might feed on blood or the psychic power that can be found from other humans .
They believe and do so in order to stabilize their physical , mental as well as emotional well - being .
Over the past three decades , there ’s a group which has got a lot of exposure on social media and is thus growing rapidly .
Like many other young subcultures vampire ’s community help people to meet online with similar living or psychology .
They perform specified vampire centric events and they mostly meet in private .
They follow a strict moral code which holds it safe and consent as a paramount concern .
Cybergoths
Cybergoths is a subculture which is a mixture of Goth , Raver , cyberpunk and Rivethead fashion .
They follow electronic dance music rather than rock music .
The cybergoths usually wear black colored attire along with hints of neon colors .
Usually the clothing ’s are made of huge platform boots , PVC and many reflective materials .
Few cyber Goths wear Shiny PVC marks similar to the doctor ’s and also gas masks .
They get multiple piercing which is a must and they wear glasses more often .
Their hair extensions , mostly incorporate bright colors .
Mostly cybergoths are found to be the center of Nightlife and are mainly found in the United Kingdom which provides them with clubs such as the Wendy house in Leeds , slim light Autonomy in Leicester , Nightmare in Nottingham , Tech noir in New Castle , club antichrist in London , chains in velvet in Norwich and Bedlam at Queen Margaret Union in Glasgow , along with the yearly infest festival .
Cybergoths in the U.S. connect via the internet on different online platforms .
A forum site that maintains and acitve subculture is XMEETS as detailed by https://hookupdatingreviews.com.
Other than UK cybergoths are also found in the US as well as Canada .
In the US there are clubs like Necto in Ann Arbor , Leland city club in Detroit , Tampa , the castle in Ybor City , Das bunkers in Los Angeles and death guild in San Francisco which shows the strong presence of cybergoths .
In Canada the cyber goths subculture is found at Toronto club with the event of Toronto ’s monthly Dark rave .…
Justin Raimondo is taking the day off .
His column will return Monday .
The anniversary of the U.S. bombing of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is , perhaps , a good time to note that arguments rationalizing and even valorizing the use of nuclear weapons , once considered beyond the pale , are now back in fashion .
Here we have yet more evidence of the Bizarro Effect , which , ever since 9/11 , has stood everything  especially our traditional concept of morality  on its head , not only repealing the laws of logic and common sense but also ensconcing evil in the place of good .
Why , just the other day , U.S. presidential aspirant and sometime antiwar candidate Barack Obama was asked by a reporter if he would authorize the use of nuclear weapons against al - Qaeda .
Instead of looking at the man as if he were more than half - crazy and pointedly asking to see his press credentials , Obama ruled out the possibility or , maybe not .
I ’ll leave it to my readers to make the call :
“ ‘ I think it would be a profound mistake for us to use nuclear weapons in any circumstance involving civilians , ’ he said , appearing uncomfortable with the query .
“ A moment later , he seemed to retract the entire response , saying : ‘ Let me scratch that .
There ’s been no discussion of nuclear weapons .
That ’s not on the table . ' ”
If it was n’t “ on the table , ” it sure is now .
As to how we would fight al - Qaeda with nukes is hard to imagine , at least in any realistic sense .
The real threat from bin Laden ’s boys comes from cells inside the United States , not from the wilds of Waziristan .
Hillary Clinton knows this perfectly well , and yet :
“ A smile darted onto Clinton ’s face Thursday when she was read Obama ’s comment during a Capitol Hill news conference several hours later .
“ ‘ I think that presidents should be very careful at all times in discussing the use or non-use of nuclear weapons , ’ she said .
‘ And I do n’t believe that any president should make any blanket statements with respect to the use or non-use of nuclear weapons .
But I think we ’ll leave it at that , because I do n’t know the circumstances in which he was responding . ' ”
Mass murder ?
We ca n’t rule it out .
That would n’t be “ presidential . ”
In the age of empire , the main weapon of the American hegemon is a double - edged sword of fear , wielded by our imperial “ president ” against citizens and non-citizens alike .
To foreigners , the message is : get out of line and you may just be nuked  for the good of mankind , of course .
As for the Americans , the specter of a nuclear - armed enemy convinced them to go to war with Iraq , and the same gambit is being used to provoke the coming war with Iran .
This fearful dynamic is what Obama dared not challenge , as he hurriedly retracted his abjuration of nuclear mass murder and correctly noted that the nuking of Pakistan and / or Afghanistan is not on anyone ’s agenda .
Hillary ’s blanket statement about never making blanket statements regarding the use ( or “ non-use ” ) of nukes is in line with the policy of American presidents stretching all the way back to Harry Truman .
The U.S. government has never rejected the first use of nuclear weapons .
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has followed a similar policy , and this is the default position of the “ responsible ” sectors of the foreign policy commentariat : Hillary is merely following in the footsteps of husband Bill and his postwar predecessors .
Everyone knows that the U.S. is perfectly prepared to use nuclear weapons  after all , what other government on earth has actually nuked an enemy nation ?
And this fondness for nuclear brinkmanship is a bipartisan phenomenon , as Hillary ’s comments illustrate .
Harry Truman , the author of the single most unjustified act of savagery in American history , is the iconic figure of today ’s “ national security ” ( i.e. , pro-war ) Democrats , the hero of Peter Beinart ‘s paean to Cold War liberal interventionism , The Good Fight .
And it is not for nothing that the pro-war Left has taken up the cause of Truman ’s genocide .
Oliver Kamm presents the case for mass murder here , in his typically bilious , self - important manner .
According to Comrade Kamm , “ New historical research in fact lends powerful support to the traditionalist interpretation of the decision to drop the bomb . ”
Yet , somehow , in all his research , this learned scholar has never come across Gen. Dwight David Eisenhower ’s dissent from Truman ’s deadly decision .
He likewise ignores the almost unanimous opinion of top military figures at the time  including Adm.
William Leahy , Gen. Douglas MacArthur , Gen. Curtis LeMay , Gen. Henry Arnold , Brig .
Gen. Bonner Fellers , Adm. Ernest King , Gen. Carl Spaatz , Adm. Chester Nimitz , and Adm. William “ Bull ” Halsey  that using the Bomb twice was not a military necessity .
The Japanese , for their part , were ready to surrender : all that prevented them from doing so was the Americans ’ insistence on unconditional surrender .
They feared the emperor would be harmed or deposed .
In any event , a non-lethal demonstration of the fearful power at America ’s disposal  say , in the Sea of Japan  would arguably have convinced the Japanese to dispense with such niceties as honor and devotion to tradition .
Instead , Truman chose to incinerate hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians  not in order to save American lives , since the Japanese were more than ready to give up the fight , but as a demonstration of raw American power .
There is merit to the argument that this was directed not so much at the remnants of Japan ’s war party as it was at the Kremlin  and that in dropping the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki Truman was firing the first two shots of the Cold War .
Yet I would n’t emphasize this too much , because it detracts from what seems to be the unique nature of this particular weapon as an expression of pure hubris .
One can well imagine our little pygmy of a president , the haberdasher who knew he was making history , glorying in his Zeus - like role as the hurler of thunderbolts .
Arrogance of that sort cannot go unpunished for long .
To be able to wreak massive instantaneous destruction , to wield such godlike power with impunity and without regard for innocent human life , invites retaliation , human if not divine .
If the U.S. will not renounce first use of nuclear terror , then no wonder our rulers are constantly conjuring the looming threat of nuclear terrorism in one or more of our major cities .
As the Bizarro Effect continues to wreak havoc with the moral sense of millions , and especially in the vicinity of Washington , D.C. , so far , in the Democratic Party presidential primary , a major candidate has proposed invading Pakistan  and the front - runner declares that we ca n’t rule out using nukes to go after al - Qaeda , even if that means wiping out , say , the city of Islamabad .
Lest I be accused of partisanship , I hasten to point out that Dr. Strangelove is all the vogue in the GOP , too .
At one or another of the Republican debates , all the GOP presidential aspirants  with the notable exception of Ron Paul  refused to rule out nuking Iran .
The liberal - conservative bipartisan unity on this question of nuclear mass murder  extending all the way from Hillary on the left to Tom “ Nuke Mecca ” Tancredo on the nut - job right  is really rather breathtaking , and it illustrates an important point : when it comes to the intersection of war , nukes , and foreign policy , Hillary and her hickish / hawkish constituency are but a milder and less kooky left - wing version of the fiercely nationalistic Republican fundamentalist hicks , who positively welcome the prospect of nuclear devastation as a sign of the “ end times ” and the second coming of Christ .
There is a sinister campaign afoot to make the use of nuclear weapons , albeit miniaturized “ bunker - busters , ” acceptable , and this , too , is part of the spreading Bizarro Effect : in a world ruled by moral inversion , the unthinkable is now being openly talked about and justified .
In a further sign that the Bizarro Effect has taken over the national consciousness , Hillary refusing to rule out the possible mass killing of hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis and / or Afghans is now considered a move toward the “ center , ” while Obama ’s initial moral revulsion ( quickly overcome ) is considered a “ radical ” deviation from the norm .
Ah , but do n’t forget : in the Bizarro World universe we slipped into after 9/11 , the “ norm ” is the bizarre .

Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components .
You might think Facebook solved all of its fault tolerance problems long ago , but when a serpent enters the Edenic datacenter realm , even Facebook must consult the Tree of Knowledge .

Some fall for beautiful eyes while others are smitten with a smile .
But when it comes to deciding on true love , you might be better off looking at your intended 's waistline .
Scientists have shown that we tend to marry partners with a similar level of body fat to our own .
Flab , or the lack of it , is just as important as background , class or age in determining who we choose to spend our lives with .

It is thought the phenomenon - known as assortative mating - could be a key factor in Britain 's growing obesity problem .
Adult obesity rates have nearly quadrupled over the last 25 years , making this the second - fattest nation in the developed world , trailing behind only the U.S .
Children of overweight couples are likely to inherit genes that make them prone to putting on weight too , and so be more likely to have a weight problem themselves - according to the researchers - from Aberdeen Universityand the Rowett Research Institute .
" If someone who is overweight or obese gets together or marries someone who is overweight or obese , their children could have a genetic disposition to obesity , " said one of the researchers , Dr Diane Jackson .
The study , published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , found body scans of 42 couplesshowed they shared similar levels of body fat .
The finding held true even when factors which can influence weight , such as age and class , were taken into account .
The study also showed that rather than couples simply growing fat together , they actually started off that way .
" In the 1940s and 1950s , people mostly got married in their early twenties before they were overweight or obese , " said researcher Professor John Speakman .
" So it would have been difficult for them to assortatively mate for body fatness because it would have been impossible to distinguish somebody who was thin from somebody who was thin but going to become fat .
" Nowadays , we choose partners and have children much later , but if we are going to become obese , on average we do so much younger .
" This makes it possible for potential partners to select each other on the basis of body fatness .
What is currently unclear is how these associations come about .
Perhaps the social activities of the overweight and obese people coincide , making them more likely to meet partners who are also overweight or obese .
Recent research has shown that the company we keep has a huge effect on our weight .
Those with fat friends are almost three times more likely to become obese themselves .
Why women do n't trust a handsome hunk
If fairy tales are to be believed , a girl can't do better than a tall , dark , handsome stranger .
Reality , however , begs to differ .
Research shows that women dismiss macho types as being cold , domineering and with a roving eye .
And bad fathers to boot .
In contrast , more feminine - looking men are regarded as warm , caring and committed - and ideal daddy material .
The researchers , from St Andrews and Durham universities , asked more than 400 men and women to rate a selection of male faces , which had been digitally altered to look more masculine or feminine , on whether they appeared to be ambitious , domineering , faithful , warm or a good parent .
The analysis showed that both sexes regarded the classic hunks as the big losers .
Dr Lynda Bothroyd , who led the research , said : " This shows agreement between women about what they see , personality wise , when asked to judge a book by its cover . "
I 'm up in Waukesha , Wisconsin visiting my family .
Both parents have been in the hospital while I 'm here , so I 've spent a fair amount of time at Waukesha Memorial Hospital .
A couple of blocks from the hospital , there 's the most surprising home .
There was a 675,000 gallon water reservoir that had become quite an eyesore .
Judy Fuller bought it for $ 1,000 and transformed it into a beautiful home in a " South Flordia " style .
Indeed , it looks like it should be shaded with Palm trees and and have a path leading to white sand and crystal blue waters .
It 's 4 stories high , has 24 " thick walls ( which would keep out the sound of sirens ) , underground parking , and a " plaza " on the roof .
It 's already at a pretty high point in the town , so I 'm guessing it has pretty great views .
It has an estimated value of about $ 1.3 million .
And it 's for sale .
If I were considering moving back to the frozen north , I 'd be very tempted .
Apparently she 's known for turning architectural atrocities into gems .

How do you get rid of the body of a dead astronaut on a three - year mission to Mars and back ?
When should the plug be pulled on a critically ill astronaut who is using up precious oxygen and endangering the rest of the crew ?
Should NASA employ DNA testing to weed out astronauts who might get a disease on a long flight ?
With NASA planning to land on Mars 30 years from now , and with the recent discovery of the most “ Earth - like ” planet ever seen outside the solar system , the space agency has begun to ponder some of the thorny practical and ethical questions posed by deep space exploration .
Some of these who - gets - thrown - from - the - lifeboat questions are outlined in a NASA document on crew health obtained by the Associated Press through a Freedom of Information Act request .
Ethical issues
NASA doctors and scientists , with help from outside bioethicists and medical experts , hope to answer many of these questions over the next several years .
“ As you can imagine , it ’s a thing that people are n’t really comfortable talking about , ” said Dr. Richard Williams , NASA ’s chief health and medical officer .
“ We ’re trying to develop the ethical framework to equip commanders and mission managers to make some of those difficult decisions should they arrive in the future . ”
One topic that is evidently too hot to handle :
How do you cope with sexual desire among healthy men and women during a mission years long ?
Sex is not mentioned in the document and has long been almost a taboo topic at NASA .
Williams said the question of sex in space is not a matter of crew health but a behavioral issue that will have to be taken up by others at NASA .
The agency will have to address the matter sooner or later , said Paul Root Wolpe , a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania who has advised NASA since 2001 .
The document does spell out some health policies in detail , such as how much radiation astronauts can be exposed to from space travel ( no more radiation than the amount that would increase the risk of cancer by 3 percent over the astronaut ’s career ) and the number of hours crew members should work each week ( no more than 48 hours ) .
Policy needed
But on other topics – such as steps for disposing of the dead and cutting off an astronaut ’s medical care if he or she cannot survive – the document merely says these are issues for which NASA needs a policy .
For now , astronauts and cosmonauts who become critically sick or injured at the International Space Station – something that has never happened – can leave the orbiting outpost 220 miles above Earth and return home within hours aboard a Russian Soyuz space vehicle .
That would n’t be possible if a life - and - death situation were to arise on a voyage to Mars , where the nearest hospital is millions of miles away .
NASA will consider whether astronauts must undergo preventive surgery , such as an appendectomy , to head off medical emergencies during a mission , and whether astronauts should be required to sign living wills with end - of - life instructions .
Some believe the U.S. space agency has not adequately prepared for the possibility of death during a mission .
“ I do n’t think they ’ve been great at dealing with this type of thing in the past , ” said former astronaut Story Musgrave , a six - time space shuttle flier who has a medical degree .
“ But it ’s very nice that they ’re considering it now . ”

[ From One is a Crowd , by Frank Chodorov , 1952 . ]
It all began , as you know , with the Declaration of Independence .
The Americans stated their case , both as to the disabilities put upon them by the British Crown and as to the kind of government they considered it fitting for men to live under .
The indictment was rejected and the issue was joined in battle .
The god of war decided in favor of the Americans , insofar as removing the grievous rule was concerned ; but in the establishment of a government to their liking the victors were on their own .
Nobody could help them .
Even history could not make a suggestion ; for never had there been a political establishment constructed or operating on principles laid down in the Declaration .
These principles , moreover , were quite metaphysical , completely outside the realm of experience .
They were : ( 1 ) that all men are created equal , and , ( 2 ) that all men are endowed with inalienable rights .
When you come down to it , the two metaphysical concepts are really one .
For the postulate of equality did not apply to human capacities or attributes , which are quite unequal and far beyond the scope of government , but to the enjoyment of rights or prerogatives .
In that respect , they maintained , all men must be considered on a par .
This was a brand - new base for government .
In all political science hitherto known it had been an axiom that rights were privileges handed down to subjects by the sovereign power ; hence there was nothing positive about them .
A new king or a new parliament could abrogate existing rights or extend them to other groups or establish new favorites .
The Americans , however , insisted that in the nature of things all rights inhere in the individual , by virtue of his existence , and that he instituted government for the sole purpose of preventing one citizen from violating the rights of another .
Sovereign power , they said , resides in the individual ; the government is only an agency of his will .
If it fails to carry out its duties properly , or if it itself presumes to invade his rights , then the moral thing to do is to kick it out .
But , government is not an abstraction ; it consists of people , and the inclination of all people is to improve upon their circumstances with whatever skills or capacities they possess and by whatever opportunities they meet up with .
The power placed in the hands of this agency — to enforce the observance of an equality of rights — is in itself a temptation from which only the saintly are delivered .
The Founding Fathers were therefore confronted with a difficult contradiction : men being what they are , a government is necessary ; and government being what it is , men must be safeguarded against it .
Their recipe was the Constitution .
Whether or not the ensuing government would materialize the metaphysics of the Declaration , the Constitution was , at any rate , a definite pattern ; and when it was ratified and put into operation , it became the end - product of the Revolution .
To be sure , the Constitution cut corners around the doctrine of natural rights .
We must remember that it was , after all , a political instrument , concocted by men .
Only in its preamble can such an instrument serve the moralities ; its working parts must be geared to the interests of the dominating groups in society , and hence it must be a compromise ; to effect the compromise the moralities must be watered down .
The Constitution was no exception .
The assumed equality of rights was distinctly out of line with the profitable slave trade ; owners of large estates wondered how it might affect their business ; merchants and manufacturers deemed it dangerous to their preferred position .
The Constitution was therefore so framed that the doctrine could not be employed to disrupt the status .
There were many Americans who contended that the profit of the Revolution was liquidated by the Constitution and at their insistence a Bill of Rights was included .
The Basic Social Struggle
The Founding Fathers forged well .
Putting aside what it might have been , the Constitution did pay homage to the doctrine of natural rights .
It did so by the simple expedient of putting restraints and limitations on the powers of government .
We learn from their published statements that the intent of the Founding Fathers was to prevent the despised " democrats , " should they come into power , from using it for spoliation .
They were quite forthright about it , and not a little could be said in favor of their thesis .
In recent years the " mob " they feared has indeed come into power and the result seems to support the contention of Madison , Adams , and Hamilton .
But regardless of their argument and regardless of their intent , the Constitutional shackles did in fact , though perhaps inadvertently , protect the people in the enjoyment of their cherished rights .
From this we learn a little heeded lesson in social science , namely , that the real struggle that disturbs the enjoyment of life is not between economic classes but between Society as a whole and the political power which imposes itself on Society .
The class - struggle theory is a blind alley .
True , people of like economic interests will gang up for the purpose of taking advantage of others .
But within these classes there is as much rivalry as there is between the classes .
When , however , you examine the advantage which one class obtains over another you find that the basis of it is political power .
It is impossible for one person to exploit another , for one class to exploit another , without the aid of law and the force to back up the law .
Examine any monopoly and you will find it resting on the State .
So that the economic and social injustices we complain of are not due to economic inequalities , but to the political means that bring about these inequalities .
If peace is to be brought into the social order it is not by accentuating a class struggle , but by restraining the basic cause of it ; that is , the political power .
To bring about a condition of equal rights , which is a condition of justice , the hands of the politician must be so tied that he cannot extend his activities beyond the simple duty of protecting life and property , his only competence .
To the extent , then , that the Founding Fathers delimited the powers of the new government — by the system of checks and balances — to that extent did they render inestimable social service .
And to that extent did they insure the victory of the Revolution .
For about a century and a half the American citizen enjoyed , in the main , three immunities against the State : in respect to his property ; in respect to his person ; in respect to his thought and expression .
Pressure upon them was constant , for in the pursuit of power the State is relentless , but the dikes of the Constitution held firm and so did the immunities .
Only within our time did the State effect a vital breach in the Constitution , and in short order the American , no matter what his classification , was reduced to the status of subject , as he was before 1776 .
His citizenship shriveled up when the Sixteenth Amendment replaced the Declaration of Independence .
The income tax completely destroys the immunity of property .
It flatly declares a prior right of the State to all things produced .
What it permits the individual to retain is a concession to expediency , not by any means a right ; for the State retains the liberty to set rates and to fix exemptions from year to year , as its convenience dictates .
Thus , the sacred right of private property is violated , and the fact that it is done pro forma makes the violation no less real than when it is done arbitrarily by an autocrat .
The blanks we so dutifully fill out simply accentuate our degradation to subject status .
Demagoguery loves to emphasize a distinction between human rights and property rights .
The distinction is without validity and only serves to arouse envy .
The right to own is the mark of a free man .
The slave is a slave simply because he is denied that right .
And because the free man is secure in the possession and enjoyment of what he produces , and the slave is not , the spur to production is in one and not in the other .
Men produce to satisfy their desires and if their gratifications are curbed they cease to produce beyond the point of limitation ; on the other hand the only limit to their aspirations is the freedom to enjoy the fruits of their labors .
That fact , deep rooted in the nature of man , accounts for the progress of civilization when and where the right of property is recognized , and for the retrogression that follows from its denial .
Property rights and human rights are more than complementary ; they are identical .
The income tax did more than revoke the immunity of property .
It gave the State the means of effectively attacking the immunities of mind and of person ; it transferred to the State that sovereignty which , according to the American theory , is lodged in the individual .
In the final analysis , sovereignty is a matter of dollars .
The more dollars the more sovereignty .
The individual is no longer sovereign when his living is dependent on a superior will , when that will becomes dominant by the economic strength behind it .
The edicts of the State are not self - enforcing , since they lack the voluntary support of public opinion , and are therefore only as effective as the size of the police force ; but the police force must be paid , and since the payments must come out of the property of those upon whom the edicts fall , there is no standing up to it .
Without an FBI , military conscription — which violates the immunity of person — would be impossible ; it failed during the Civil War simply because Lincoln did not have the funds to support such an agency .
The Espionage Act — which violated the immunity of mind — would have been but a piece of paper but for the thugs hired by the State to enforce it .
Bribing the Constitution
Further , the wealth acquired by the State at the expense of the producers enabled it to buy its way into sovereignty .
The Founding Fathers put a check on the central power by clearly delimiting its scope , specifying that all other prerogatives , named and unnamed , shall reside in the component and autonomous commonwealths .
They knew from experience what a far - away and self - sufficient authority could do to human liberty , and sought to avoid that danger by making local government the residuary of all unspecified power ; not that the local politician is different in kind from the national politician , but that his proximity to the people makes him more sensitive to their will .
However , with the advent of the income tax this safeguard lost all meaning , for from then on the local politician was less and less under obligation to his constituents ; on the other hand , they fell under his obligation by his ability to hand out gratuities derived from federal grants , for which he gave up nothing but the dignity vested in him by the Constitution .
His political preferment is now largely a matter of dispensing federal patronage .
The American no longer regards his local government as anything more than an agency of the State .
Thus , the original federation — the Union — has been superseded in fact by a single , centralized power , and the citizen of the commonwealth has become a subject of that power .
The income tax alone made this possible , inevitable .
The transmutation of the Constitution by bribery has also been effected through private channels .
The income tax has made the State the largest single buyer in the country and , since " the customer is always right , " it is unthinkable that the recipients of its patronage would oppose the State on any issue important to its purposes .
Subvention of agriculture , education , and the press has been supplemented by gratuities to sundry pressure groups , all easing the shift of sovereignty from the individual to the State .
To top it all off , the capital absorbed by the State , via the income tax , has put it into business in a big way , so that it is now the largest employer in the nation ; loyalty to a boss of that potential breeds a peculiar kind of freedom of conscience .
Lost Will for Freedom
Our forefathers were not unaware of the inverse ratio of taxation to liberty .
Their experience with the British Crown was still fresh when the Founding Fathers came up with the Constitution , and they scrutinized its taxing provisions most carefully .
About the only fiscal power generally conceded to the federal authority was a levy on imports .
Hamilton knew this would hardly yield enough to support the establishment contemplated and pleaded with great acumen for the right to levy internal excise taxes .
His argument prevailed , but only because , as he pointed out , without this revenue the government would be compelled to ask for the unthinkable : a land tax or an income tax .
And , until 1913 , the federal establishment had to get along as best it could with what it picked up from custom duties and a few excise taxes .
Its sovereignty was thus contained .
In 1913 the relationship between the State and Society was reversed .
Areas which had heretofore been considered within the private domain , sacred ground so to speak , were now invaded by the arrogant and enriched State , and within thirty years the individual was squeezed into a corner so small that even his soul lacked elbow room .
His case was far worse than it was in 1776 ; in exchange for an income tax King George III would have conceded every point made against him by the colonists , and might even have done penance for past sins .
But , such was the character of these Americans that they challenged him to battle because he presumed to impose a miserable tax on tea .
What they won at Yorktown was lost by their offspring one hundred and thirty - two years later .
Were the disposition of the current crop of Americans comparable to that of their forbears , a new revolution , to regain the profit of the first one , would be in order .
There is far more justification for it now than there was in 1776 .
But , people do not do what reason dictates ; they do what their disposition impels them to do .
And the American disposition of the 1950s is flaccidly placid , obsequious and completely without a sense of freedom ; it has been molded into that condition by the proceeds of the Sixteenth Amendment .
We are Americans geographically , not in the tradition .
In the circumstances , a return to the Constitutional immunities must wait for a miracle .
The American people have only one question left about Iraq : What is President Bush ’s plan for a timely and responsible exit ?
That is the essential precondition for salvaging broader American interests in the Middle East and for waging a more effective fight against Al Qaeda in its base areas in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
And it is exactly the question that Mr. Bush , his top generals and his diplomats so stubbornly and damagingly refuse to answer .
Yesterday provided two more frustrating and shameful examples of this denial .
One was a new war plan drawn up by America ’s top military commander and top diplomat in Baghdad that will keep American troops fighting in Iraq at least until 2009 .
The other was yet one more speech by President Bush that claimed that Iraq was the do - or - die front in the war on terrorism  rather than a rallying point for extremists and a never - ending drain on the resources America needs to fight that fight .
The war plan drawn up by Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker simply assumes that a large - scale United States military presence in Iraq will continue for at least two more years .
So much for Mr. Bush ’s soothing incantations about a relatively short - term “ surge ” of additional troops .
The plan ignores the fact that the volunteer Army cannot sustain a prolonged escalation without grievous losses in quality , readiness and morale .
Even more unrealistically , the plan assumes that with two more years of an American blank check , Iraqi politicians will somehow decide to take responsibility for their political future  something they ’ve refused to do for the last four years .
After delays , denial , and double standards , Monsanto maintains unjust monopoly on major food crop .
Time to talk to the cooks about a new recipe ?
In a jaw - dropping affirmation of Monsanto 's monopoly control over commodity crops , one of the world 's most notorious patents for genetically engineered crops was upheld by the European Patent Office ( EPO ) in Munich on May 6 , 2003 -- this despite a nine year battle by civil society ( and industry ) to have it revoked .
European Patent No. 301,749 , granted in March 1994 , is an exceptionally broad " species patent " which grants gene giant Monsanto exclusive monopoly over all forms of genetically engineered soybean varieties and seeds -- irrespective of the genes used or the transformation technique employed .
The patent , attacked as immoral and technically invalid by food security advocates worldwide , was vigorously opposed by Monsanto itself until they purchased the original patent holder ( Agracetus ) in 1996 , and switched sides to make the soybean species patent a major ingredient in its global recipe for crop monopoly .
Backburner :
The case simmered on the EPO 's backburner for an astonishing nine years before reaching the patent tribunal in Munich yesterday .
The EPO took only ten hours ( including coffee and cake breaks ) to hear oral arguments and uphold Monsanto 's monopoly .
Monsanto did surrender one unsustainable claim in the patent ( claim no. 25 ) , which sought control beyond soybeans to other plants as well .
ETC Group , who maintained its opposition to the patent since first uncovering it nearly a decade ago , were present in Munich yesterday with expert legal counsel , UK barrister Daniel Alexander and patent attorney Tim Roberts .
Other opponents included Greenpeace , activist Stefan Geene , Syngenta and Pioneer Hi-Bred ( a subsidiary of DuPont ) .
ETC Group and other opponents expressed bitter disappointment at the outcome .
Same old recipe : " Monsanto has made overtures in the media to reinvent themselves as a gentler , humbler company , " said Hope Shand , ETC Group Research Director , " But their behavior in court showed that where it matters , Monsanto is still aggressively pursuing monopolistic control by any means available .
Even more alarming is how readily the patent system rewards such behavior , ignoring basic morality , and failing to encourage socially beneficial innovation .
When ETC Group first challenged this patent we were primarily concerned about the threat to food security from the Gene Giants -- today , nine years later , we find ourselves equally shocked and concerned about the threat to democracy from such an unresponsive patent system .
It portends much larger patent problems to come with nanotechnology and other emerging technologies . "
" This is a thoroughly bad decision , " said patent attorney Tim Roberts .
" You would look far to find another patent in which such a small advance has justified such an enormous claim .
It seems to have been reached by mechanically applying inappropriate precedent , while ignoring the fundamental principle of the patent system -- the balance of rights between the innovator and society .
If the Opposition Board 's decision is correct in law , then the law needs to be changed , " said Roberts .
SARS bars and Geene engineering : Monsanto began the proceedings in Munich with successful legal moves to deny some expert witnesses the right to speak ; including Dr. Suman Sahai of the Gene Campaign who had been brought by Greenpeace from India to testify about the impact of the patent on food security .
Most amazingly , soybean experts from China , the genetic homeland of soya , had already been barred from the EPO court because of SARS fears .
Monsanto then proposed to the tribunal that ETC Group and long - time German campaigner Stefan Geene be disqualified from the hearing , claiming that Geene , despite being present in the courtroom , was a `fictitious person ' .
Although Monsanto's request was denied , it set the tone for its strategy throughout the day .
Debate on ethical questions was largely marginalised by Monsanto and an unresponsive Tribunal .
Secret Recipe : Perhaps most astonishing was Monsanto 's legal maneuvering to sidestep its own evidence .
In 1994 Monsanto gave unambiguous evidence in an opposition statement requesting that the patent be revoked .
One of Monsanto's top scientists testified in 1994 that the genetic engineering process described in the patent was insufficient to allow someone skilled in the science to replicate the procedure -- a necessary criterion for patentability .
Nevertheless Monsanto's lawyers successfully argued that the company should be allowed monopoly over any genetically engineered soybean seed and variety obtained through any and all modification processes .
Let them eat cake ?
" It 's a bit like publishing a badly written cake recipe and then claiming ownership of any cakes baked by anybody using any recipe any time in the future , " explained Jim Thomas , of ETC Group 's Oxford office .
" In fact , since acquiring Agracetus , Monsanto has already leveraged this patent as part of their strategy to grab as much of the cake as they can -- seeking to control one of the world 's most important food crops .
Monsanto now controls 100 % of the world 's genetically engineered soybeans covering 36.5 million hectares in 2002 -- that 's over half of the world 's total soybean area .
It 's hard to imagine a more blatant and dangerous monopoly . "
Soy Berger King : According to Dr. Christoph
Then , patent expert for Greenpeace , " This case is a clear signal that the European Patent Directive should be revoked .
Europe needs new patent legislation that expressly prohibits patents on life . "
Dr. Then and Stefan Geene represented Greenpeace at the EPO tribunal yesterday .
Matter Monopolies : ETC
Group also regards the maintenance of this patent as a dangerous precedent for other broad claims on new emerging technologies , in particular nanotechnology -- the atomic manipulation of matter to create new molecular forms .
" This broad patent on Soybeans was allowed precisely because aggressive corporations and lax governments were pushing the boundaries in the early days of biotech , allowing exclusive monopoly patents on all biological products and processes , " explained Shand .
" Today , corporations are grabbing nano - patents on molecular products and processes , even the chemical elements that make up all of nature .
With nanotech patents , ` Matter Moguls ' threaten to control the fundamental building blocks of nature . "
Recipe change : " We fear that the EPO decision on Monsanto 's soybean patent gives comfort to those who want to establish ever wider legal claims -- including matter monopolies , " emphasized Jim Thomas .
" Monsanto may have won an entire species but others are seeking to monopolise entire elements of nature .
Atomic - level manufacturing provides new opportunities for sweeping monopoly control over both living and non-living matter . "
With technologies converging at the nanoscale , ETC Group warns that efforts to oppose intellectual monopolies must not be limited to campaigns against the patenting of life .
This issue will be discussed at an upcoming seminar for policy makers , civil society and the media in the European Parliament in Brussels on June 11th .
" If the recipe is this bad we 'll take it back to the cooks , " Thomas concludes .
Seminar in European Parliament : Together with the European Greens , The Ecologist , Greenpeace , The Dag Hammarskjld Foundation , Genewatch UK , Clean Production Action and a cross-party group of MEP's , ETC Group will hold a seminar on nanotechnology in the European Parliament in Brussels on June 11 , 2003 .
Led by international experts , the seminar will look at both the issues related to nanotech and intellectual property as well as societal and safety questions with a view to consider appropriate steps for government regulation .
Speakers include physicist Dr. Vandana Shiva and toxicologist Dr. Vyvyan Howard .
The seminar will be followed on June 12 by a discussion among civil society organisations in Europe on strategies to address the issues involved in nanotechnology .

Note to editors :
Although the EPO tribunal decisively ruled in favour of Monsanto , the panel will not release its written judgment for several more weeks .
There are different ways to measure success .
With Bush , they 're all pointing at rock bottom , whether it 's the war in Iraq , whether it's his approval ratings , whether it 's the approval ratings of his party , or voter polling on issues .
Here 's another :
President Bush ’s success rating in the Democratic - controlled House has fallen this year to a half - century low , and he prevailed on only 14 percent of the 76 roll call votes on which he took a clear position .
The previous low for any president was in 1995 , when Bill Clinton won just 26 percent of the time during the first year after Republicans took control of the House .
If Bush ’s score holds through the end of the year , he will have the lowest success rating in either chamber for any president since Congressional Quarterly began analyzing votes in 1953 .
A study of House and Senate floor votes , compiled by CQ over the August recess , also showed that House Democrats have backed Bush ’s legislative positions this year only 6 percent of the time , making for the strongest opposition from either party against a president in the 54 years CQ has kept score .
Meanwhile , House Democrats may be offering up the most united caucus ever :
An organic compound found in grapes , berries and some nuts extended the life span of fish in a recent study .
lives an average of nine weeks in captivity but lacing its food with resveratrol boosted longevity by more than 50 percent .
Previous research had shown that resveratrol prolongs the life span of yeast and insects , but this study marks the first proof of its antiaging effects in a vertebrate .
Neuroscientist Alessandro Cellerino and his colleagues at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa , Italy , tested different doses of the compound on more than 150 fish .
Thirty fish received a small dose in their regular food , 60 received a medium dose and 20 received a large helping ; meanwhile , 47 control fish enjoyed their insect larvae meals sans resveratrol .
The control and low - dose fish saw no benefits , but even the fish who received only a middling amount of the compound lived up to 27 percent longer .
The resveratrol - fed fish also showed more vivaciousness , swimming more than their counterparts even as they aged up to 10 weeks .
Old fish that ate resveratrol were able to complete tasks , such as remembering to move from one compartment to another when a light was flashed , much better than the controls did .
And dissection showed that the neurons in their brains did not decay as fast as those of the untreated fish did , leading the researchers to speculate that resveratrol could be prolonging life by protecting the central nervous system .
The compound , particularly concentrated in red wines such as pinot noir , seems to confer protective effects across a wide range of animals , leading to hopes that it might prove a potent boon for humans as well .
" The mechanisms by which resveratrol prolongs life span in model organisms are not clear , " Cellerino 's team writes in the paper presenting the findings , published today in Current Biology .
" But the observation that its supplementation with food extends vertebrate life span and delays motor and cognitive age - related decline could be of high relevance for the prevention of aging - related diseases in the human population . "

BANGKOK ( Reuters ) -
One billion people will die of tobacco - related diseases this century unless governments in rich and poor countries alike get serious about preventing smoking , top World Health Organization ( WHO ) experts said on Monday .

One billion people are likely to die of tobacco - related diseases this century unless governments get serious about cutting smoking rates , United Nations health experts said on Monday .
REUTERS / Sukree Sukplang
“ Tobacco is a defective product .
It kills half of its customers , ” Douglas Bettcher , head of the WHO ’s Tobacco Free Initiative , said at the start of an international conference in Bangkok to draw up a masterplan for the world to kick the habit .
“ It kills 5.4 million people per year and half of those deaths are in developing countries .
That ’s like one jumbo jet going down every hour , ” he said .
With smoking rates in many developing countries on the rise , particularly among teenagers , that annual death toll would rise to 8.3 million within the next 20 years , he added .
However , if governments introduced measures such as aggressive taxation , banning cigarette advertising and making offices and public places totally tobacco - free , smoking rates could halve by 2050 , he said .
“ It ’s a completely preventable epidemic , ” Bettcher said , citing countries such as Singapore , Australia and Thailand where tough anti-smoking laws have helped people to quit .
“ If we do that , by 2050 we can save 200 million lives . ”
Officials from 147 countries are attending the week - long conference , which is likely to agree on binding laws against cross - border tobacco advertising -- a move against events such as Formula One -- as well as tougher legislation against cigarette smuggling .
Around 600 billion cigarettes were smuggled in 2006 -- 11 percent of the world ’s consumption -- according to the Framework Convention Alliance ( FAC ) , an umbrella group of hundreds of anti-tobacco organizations .
As well as keeping the prices artificially low and thereby stimulating demand , the counterfeit cigarette industry also deprives governments of more than $ 40 billion in missed taxes , the FCA estimates .
BAN ON ADS
In Thailand , smoking rates have fallen from 30 percent in 1992 to around 18 percent , a decline health officials attribute to a ban on all domestic tobacco advertising 15 years ago .
“ The most important medicines in tobacco control are : number one , increasing taxation ; number two , bans on advertising ; and number three , smoke - free public places , ” said Hatai Chitanondh of the Thailand Health Promotion Institute .
Besides agreeing laws on cross - border advertising and smuggling , the conference is also likely to issue guidelines for countries introducing legislation on “ second - hand smoke ” and “ smoke - free ” areas .
Although not legally binding , anti-smoking campaigners are delighted with the explicit wording of the guidelines .
“ There is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke and notions such as a threshold value for toxicity from second - hand smoke should be rejected as they are contradicted by scientific evidence , ” a draft copy of the guidelines said .
“ Approaches other than 100 percent smoke - free environments , including ventilation , air filtration and use of designated smoking areas have repeatedly been shown to be ineffective . ”

Prince is threatening to sue a raft of major websites , including YouTube , eBay and Pirate Bay , as part of a legal initiative to " reclaim the internet " from rampant piracy .
Lawsuits relating to Prince 's material will be launched in the US and UK as part of a campaign led by anti-piracy firm Web Sheriff , which is representing the star .
The Web Sheriff managing director , John Giacobbi , said the extent of piracy online has become " ridiculous " , spanning videos , music downloads , bootleg merchandise and unlicenced ringtones .
" 99 % of the stuff online is totally unauthorised , " he told MediaGuardian.co.uk .
" Someone has to start somewhere and we know this will make a serious impact - a hell of a lot of artists are going to follow suit .
" We have to build a 21st century model for the entertainment industry . "
Mr Giacobbi described YouTube , eBay and Pirate Bay as being in " the vanguard " of online piracy and said he hoped that once cases against those companies had been won , smaller sites would be more respectful .
In the past two weeks , Prince 's legal representatives have requested the removal of around 2,000 illegally uploaded videos from YouTube .
Mr Giacobbi said the action was not intended to place blame on web users , but said artists should have the right to control their own work , where it is experienced and how their image is portrayed .
He questioned why YouTube was able to filter porn from the site , but not copyrighted material .
A spokeswoman for YouTube said the site " had no way of knowing " whether content had been uploaded legitimately or not .
Many artists upload their own material to YouTube , and on some occasions , she added , one part of a company had requested the takedown of material uploaded by another division .
The spokeswoman said the company will be introducing video fingerprinting technology that will scan videos for copyrighted material as they are uploaded , and will work with rights owners to build a database of such footage .
Prince joins a queue of media entities planning to sue YouTube .
In March , MTV owner Viacom announced a $ 1bn copyright infringement suit against the site , and in May the English Premier League said it would also sue .
Mr Giacobbi described Prince as being a " radical and pioneering " artist , citing his spat with Warner in the early 90s when he changed his name to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince in order to regain control of his own rights .
Prince " wants to create a template for other artists " , he added .
" Prince does n't really want to go around suing people - he'd much rather people just respected his rights .
He will be victorious . "
A spokeswoman for Anschutz Entertainment Group , Prince 's tour management company , said the performer is ready to challenge the system .
" Very few artists have ever taken this kind of action over their rights , " she added .

We ’ve written before about why schools continue the practice of favoring legacy admissions – accepting the sons and daughters of wealthy alumni .
Now there is some empirical evidence of the economics that drive this practice .
Slate Magazine recently ran an article about the puzzle of charitable giving in economics – if markets are driven by individuals rationally pursuing their own best interest , where does charity come from ?
A new study by Jonathan Meer of Stanford and Harvey S. Rosen of Princeton shows that when it comes to donations to one ’s alma mater , charity is n’t altruism .
Alumni with kids are 13 percent more likely to donate , and they are more and more likely to donate as their kid reaches age 14 .
At that point there ’s a big split – for those parents who ’s kids go on to apply to the school , donations continue to increase .
The parents whose kids do not apply to the alma mater drop off giving .
It seems pretty clear that many parents give to their schools because they think it will influence their kids ’ chances of getting in .
Colleges an universities benefit from this , but the study did not examine whether or not the donations worked .
This whole process strikes most people as unfair , mostly because the focus on GPAs , SAT scores , and admissions essays makes it look like it ’s supposed to be a meritocracy .
Americans love democracy ( where everyone gets an equal say and an equal chance ) and stories about unlikely success stories and self - made men .
Allowing external factors to secretly skew admissions is so unpopular that affirmative action has been continuously attacked .
Legacy admissions are affirmative action for rich people .
So my advice to schools is to either do away with the practice ( not very likely ) , or make it public .
Why not set aside a certain number of admissions , and just let parents bid on them in an auction ?
The regular admissions will be more of a meritocracy , and auctions are pure capitalism , something Americans love .
Heck , put the admissions up on eBay , that way you do n’t have to build your own infrastructure .

I ’ve written before about tips for offshoring .
One specific thing I said to watch for is the bait - and - switch of talent : during the sales process you ’re shown rockstars , but the real code you get is written by clueless newbies .
When you set up a project such that you ’ve minimized the cost per hour of development , but you do n’t have anyone checking the work product ( i.e. code reviews ) coming from the subcontractor , very bad things happen .
Here ’s a doozy :
In 2007 , people are still writing JSP like this …
Check out the 4th message in the thread , with the big code sample .
Table based HTML layout , and no CSS at all ?
Check .
Heck , the table width % values do n’t even add up to 100 % .
SQL in the JSP ?
Check .
Making a new JDBC connection for each page view , instead of using a connection pool ?
Check .
Unescaped strings in the SQL ?
Check .
( Not strings coming from the browser in this particular JSP page , but you do n’t know where those strings originate .
Why would n’t you escape it just in case ? )
Failing to use a prepared statement ?
Check .
( That would also solve the escaping problem . )
Using a string literal in a SQL or command line context , so you ca n’t log it beforehand ?
Check .
Even better , the code makes a query string first , prints it ( commented out ) , and then uses a different string in the actual query .
Nice !
. Nice !
Using the JdbcOdbc driver ?
Check .
( From Sun ’s JDBC Basics :
The JDBC - ODBC Bridge driver provided with JDBC is recommended only for development and testing , or when no other alternative is available . )
I ’m guessing that the use of ODBC here is the only reason why the database username and password are n’t embedded in the code sample and posted for all to see .
Empty exception catch block ?
Check .
I ’d have a hard time coming up with a fake example of bad code that was worse .
But wait , what else has this person asked about ?
No way .
Yes !
Error in Socket and File Writing !
The post includes the router ’s username and password , and its configuration including :
Its IP address , and all of the routes it contains , and all of its interfaces and where they go
A couple of other passwords stored in the router
A crypto key that appears to be to a VPN ( looks like a pre-shared key , meaning not a public key but one that must be kept secret ) !
I ’m not gonna say “ you get what you pay for ” since open source software has served me very well , but I will say that you get what you bargain for .
If your bargain includes not looking at the work product of the people you hire , which is to say , hiring the cheapest people available and not supervising them , you ’re not going to be happy with what you get .
Of course , this could have been written by a U.S. citizen who works in a cube on - site and makes $ 200 / hour .
Point is , hire carefully , and supervise your workers .
It seems simple when put that way , but it ’s amazing how often companies are willing to hire software subcontractors carelessly ( solely on price ? ) and then pay little or no attention to the resulting work , when the arrangement involves offshore outsourcing .
By the way , the IP addresses in the original post ( with the awful code sample ) are listed next to the name “ Areva ” , implying that this code is part of a project for Areva .
Who is Areva ?
They make nuclear power plants .
Sweet dreams !
( CNN ) --
Two years after his wife of 34 years died in a fire , an Iowa man continues to maintain the blaze was started by a faulty cruise control switch under the hood of her 1996 Ford F - 150 pickup truck -- while it was parked in the garage attached to his home .
Ford says a faulty cruise control switch did not start the blaze that engulfed Dolly Mohlis ' F - 150 truck .
Although Ford has denied -- and continues to deny -- the switch started the fire that killed 74 - year - old Dolly Mohlis in 2005 , the company recently settled a lawsuit brought against it by Earl Mohlis .
And last week , it issued a recall of an estimated 3.6 million vehicles -- bringing the total recalled over the past decade to more than 10 million -- every single car and truck built with a similar cruise control switch .
Dolly Mohlis woke up smelling smoke in May 2005 , Earl Mohlis has told CNN .
She woke him to find out the source while she called 911 .
When he looked in the garage , he said , he saw the truck was in flames .
Earl Mohlis said he opened the garage door to try to get the truck out , but the wind -- blowing that night at about 50 mph -- fanned the flames , which spread to the house .
The fire department in the Mohlises ' rural town could not arrive fast enough .
Dolly Mohlis , who suffered from debilitating arthritis , was suddenly trapped inside the home .
" I says to Dolly , ' You got to get out of that house , ' " Earl Mohlis told CNN .
" She come a - running and she never made it . "
Watch Mohlis describe how the flames trapped his wife »
In 2005 , CNN began airing a series of investigative reports on unexplained and sudden fires in Ford cars and trucks , tracing them to a tiny electrical switch in the cruise - control system that could lead to a vehicle catching fire , even hours after the car was turned off .
Ford had begun recalling the parts in vehicles with similar designs in 1999 .
Ford says media reports like those on CNN have sparked fear among Ford owners .
The newly recalled vehicles , a Ford spokesman told CNN , do not have " a higher than normal fire incidence . "

Asked about the recall , the Ford spokesman said the company voluntarily announced the recall because it " could not be confident about the long - term durability of these switches , " and to address consumer concerns about the potential for fires .
But while federal safety officials say it is technically accurate there was no confirmed increase of incidents of fires in the newly recalled vehicles , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has seen " evidence of elevated fire complaints . "
A spokesman said the agency was sharing that information with Ford when the company suddenly recalled all of the vehicles last week .
The spokesman went on to say there is no need for NHTSA to investigate further , because Ford took the corrective action .
NHTSA has documented more than 600 fires in which the cruise control switch is suspected since the switch was first introduced in 1992 .
Ford continues to insist the fire that killed Earl Mohlis ' wife of 34 years started elsewhere in his garage .
But this spring , Ford settled Mohlis ' wrongful death lawsuit .
Neither Mohlis nor Ford released terms of the settlement .
The hog farmer told the Des Moines Register he still cries for his wife every day .

Lord Justice Scott Baker said further inquiries were not necessary
Lord Justice Scott Baker said it was neither " appropriate or necessary " now but he would review his position .
He was responding to requests made by Michael Mansfield QC , for Dodi 's father Mohammed Al Fayed , at a hearing ahead of the inquests due in October .
Diana and Dodi died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 .
' Powers at work '
Mr Mansfield had asked the coroner to urge Prince Philip to " answer inquiries " and the Queen to agree to be a " potential witness " .
But Lord Justice Scott Baker told the High Court hearing : " It does n't seem to me that any further inquiries at this stage would be appropriate or necessary . "
Mr Mansfield said he wanted the Queen to be asked about a conversation she allegedly had with former royal butler Paul Burrell , referring to " other forces or powers at work within the state " .
He also raised the issue of the duke allegedly sending what one witness described as " nasty " letters to the princess .
Mr Mansfield said the Metropolitan Police inquiry into the deaths - which concluded they were a tragic accident - did not make any of these inquiries .
It also emerged that Diana 's original note to Mr Burrell containing claims that her husband was " planning an accident in my car " had been obtained for the inquest .
Mr Al Fayed , owner of Harrods department store , alleges the crash was part of a secret plot by the British establishment .
Lord Justice Scott Baker replaced Baroness Butler - Sloss in June when she stepped down saying she lacked the experience required to deal with an inquest with a jury .
This article from Forbes.com shows how Halliburton skirts the law :
Halliburton , for example , manages to do business with Iran obliquely .
Its Dubai - based affiliate , Halliburton Products & Services Ltd. , allegedly has no Americans on staff ; the Houston oil services company claims it has no direct ownership of the operation .
Nevertheless , FORBES has obtained documents showing how Kala Ltd. , the British arm of the National Iranian Oil Co. , solicited at least 17 separate bids from the affiliate during 1997 and 1998 ( when Vice President Cheney was Halliburton 's chief executive ) .
A few bids include handwritten notes that say " FOB [ free on board ] Dubai Airport " or " FOB Dubai port " -- meaning that the U.A.E. was just a way station between Halliburton and Tehran .
Other American products documented include spark gaps , which can be used to detonate nuclear bombs , ended up in Pakistan , in the same fashion .
This source claims that Halliburton was involved with bribes and other shenanigans involving Iran 's nuclear ambitions :
Scandal - plagued Halliburton -- the oil services company once headed by Vice President Cheney -- sold an Iranian oil development company key components for a nuclear reactor , say Halliburton sources with intimate knowledge into both companies ' business dealings .
Halliburton was secretly working at the time with one of Iran 's top nuclear program officials on natural gas related projects and sold the components in April to the official 's oil development company , the sources said .
SNIP ...
Now comes word that Halliburton , which has a long history of flouting U.S. law by conducting business with countries the Bush administration said has ties to terrorism , was working with Cyrus Nasseri , vice chairman of the board of directors of Oriental Oil Kish , one of Iran 's largest private oil companies , on oil and natural gas development projects in Tehran .
Nasseri is also a key member of Iran 's nuclear development team and has been negotiating Iran 's nuclear development issues with the European Union and at the International Atomic Energy Agency .
SNIP ... Nasseri was interrogated by Iranian authorities in late July for allegedly providing Halliburton with Iran 's nuclear secrets and accepting as much as $ 1 million in bribes from Halliburton , Iranian government officials said .
During the first round of interrogations in the judiciary , a huge network of oil mafia has been exposed , according to the IPS report .
And most people probably do n't realize that it was White House darling Henry Kissinger who led the way for Iran to become a nuclear country :
In the mid-1970s , led by Kissinger who saw in Iran a " platform state " to fight communism in the region , Washington proposed that The Shah expand his nuclear capacity by acquiring as many as twenty three nuclear reactors .
And like we 've seen in " The Sopranos " , those who do business with the cabal of gangsters risk ending up arrested , or worse :
CYRUS NASSERI ARRESTED Iranian Press Service
Posted Friday , July 29 , 2005 PARIS , 29 July ( IPS ) Cyrus Nasseri , one of the senior Iranian negotiators with both the European Union 's so called " Big 3 " and the Vienna - based International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) has been arrested .
Both " Baaztab " news service that belongs to Mr. Mohsen Reza'i , a former Commandeer of the Revolutionary Guards and the present secretary of the Expediency Council and the independent " Roshangari " said Mr. Nasseri has been arrested by the Judiciary investigating the consortium made of Oriental Kish and Halliburton -- which has US Vice President Dick Cheney as the Chairman of its Board of Directors -- awarded for the exploitation of phases 9 and 10 of the huge South Pars gas and oil field in the Persian Gulf .
The information is so far not confirmed by the Iranian authorities and neither sites say when Mr. Nasseri , a carrier diplomat , had been arrested and the mobile telephone of Mr. Nasseri , an outspoken negotiator , was not responding on 29 July .
According to Baztab , the phases 9 and 10 should yield 50 billions of natural gas and 400 tons of sulfides by the next Iranian year of 1385 for a cost of 282 millions US Dollars .
SNIP ... Kish Oriental - Halliburton won the contract last year .
The big question here :
Who is really the enemy of the U.S. ?
And to whom is Bush and Cheney and their conspirators more loyal ?
The United States , or their UAE friends ?
Because , like The Sopranos , they seem to have no loyalty whatsoever except to their own gang .
With Halliburton / USA threatening to go to war against one of its best customers , Iran , one has to wonder what kind of real arm - twisting is going on behind the scenes .
P.S. I 'm indebted to the amazing " Octafish " over at Democratic Underground ( and elsewhere ) for the original incarnation of this information .
WASHINGTON , July 17 — Nearly six years after the Sept. 11 attacks , the hundreds of billions of dollars and thousands of lives expended in the name of the war on terror pose a single , insistent question :
Are we safer ?
On Tuesday , in a dark and strikingly candid two pages , the nation ’s intelligence agencies offered an implicit answer , and it was not encouraging .
In many respects , the National Intelligence Estimate suggests , the threat of terrorist violence against the United States is growing worse , fueled by the Iraq war and spreading Islamic extremism .
The conclusions were not new , echoing the private comments of government officials and independent experts for many months .
But the stark declassified summary contrasted sharply with the more positive emphasis of President Bush and his top aides for years : that two - thirds of Al Qaeda ’s leadership had been killed or captured ; that the Iraq invasion would reduce the terrorist menace ; and that the United States had its enemies “ on the run , ” as Mr. Bush has frequently put it .
After years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq and targeted killings in Yemen , Pakistan and elsewhere , the major threat to the United States has the same name and the same basic look as in 2001 : Al Qaeda , led by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahri , plotting attacks from mountain hide - outs near the Afghan - Pakistani border .
CARACAS , Venezuela , Sept. 4 — Goodbye , Tutankamen del Sol .
So long , Hengelberth , Maolenin , Kerbert Krishnamerk , Githanjaly , Yornaichel , Nixon and Yurbiladyberth .
The prolifically inventive world of Venezuelan baby names may be coming to an end .
If electoral officials here get their way , a bill introduced last week would prohibit Venezuelan parents from bestowing those names — and many , many others — on their children .
The measure would not be retroactive .
But it would limit parents of newborns to a list of 100 names established by the government , with exemptions for Indians and foreigners , and it is already facing skepticism in the halls of the National Assembly .
“ I need to know how they would define those 100 names , ” said Jhonny Owee Milano Rodríguez , a congressman representing Cojedes State .
“ For example , why not 120 ?
This seems arbitrary to me . ”

BOIS CHERI , Mauritius ( Reuters ) -
The remains of a dodo found in a cave beneath bamboo and tea plantations in Mauritius offer the best chance yet to learn about the extinct flightless bird , a scientist said on Friday .

The discovery was made earlier this month in the Mauritian highlands but the location was kept secret until the recovery of the skeleton , nicknamed “ Fred ” , was completed on Friday .
Four men guarded the site overnight .
Julian Hume , a paleontologist at Britain ’s Natural History Museum , told Reuters the remains were likely to yield excellent DNA and other vital clues , because they were found intact , in isolation , and in a cave .
“ The geneticists who want to get their hands on this will be skipping down the street , ” he said , after bringing the last of the remains to the surface .
Given the nickname “ Fred ” after the 65 - year - old who found them , the remains should provide the first decent specimens of dodo DNA , he said .
“ Then you can work out how it actually got to Mauritius , because it must have originally flown here before evolving into flightlessness and the big , fat bird that we know , ” he said .
“ We know it ’s a giant pigeon , ” he added .
It the first discovery of dodo remains away from the coastal regions , suggesting that the bird , extinct since the 17th century , lived all over the Indian Ocean island , he said .
Hume said the dodo was almost certainly finished off by animals introduced by Europeans about 400 years ago .
Theories that it was hunted to extinction by the Dutch were “ total nonsense ” , he said , adding that the remains were highly fragile .
“ If you try and pick it up , it just falls apart , ” he said .
“ You wo n’t see a mounted , beautiful thing from this . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A divided Supreme Court on Monday curtailed free - speech rights for students , ruling against a teenager who unfurled a banner saying “ Bong Hits 4 Jesus ” because the message could be interpreted as promoting drug use .
In its first major decision on student free - speech rights in nearly 20 years , the high court ’s conservative majority ruled that a high school principal did not violate the student ’s rights by confiscating the banner and suspending him .
The decision marked a continuing shift to the right by the court since President George W. Bush appointed Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito .
The court has issued a series of narrow 5 - 4 decisions on divisive social issues like abortion and the death penalty .
In another decision on Monday by the same 5 - 4 vote , the court ruled taxpayers cannot challenge Bush ’s use of government funds to finance social programs operated by religious groups .
“ Both of these First Amendment cases reflect the clear right - wing trend of the Roberts court .
Unmistakably .
Both are clearly wrong , ” said Abner Greene , a Fordham University law professor .
In the school case , student Joseph Frederick said the banner ’s language was meant to be nonsensical and funny , a prank to get on television as the Winter Olympic torch relay passed by the school in January 2002 in Juneau , Alaska .
But school officials say the phrase “ bong hits ” refers to smoking marijuana .
Principal Deborah Morse suspended Frederick for 10 days because she said the banner advocated or promoted illegal drug use in violation of school policy .
The majority opinion written by Roberts agreed with Morse .
He said a principal may restrict student speech at a school event when it is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use .
YOUTH DRUG ABUSE ‘SERIOUS ’ PROBLEM
Drug abuse by the nation ’s youth is a serious problem , Roberts said .
Liberal Justices John Paul Stevens , David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented on the free - speech issue .
“ Although this case began with a silly nonsensical banner , it ends with the court inventing out of whole cloth a special First Amendment rule permitting the censorship of any student speech that mentions drugs , ” Stevens wrote .
Justice Stephen Breyer said he would have decided the case without reaching the free - speech issue by ruling the principal cannot be held liable for damages .

The Bush administration supported Morse and argued that public schools do not have to tolerate a message inconsistent with its basic educational mission .
Kenneth Starr , the former special prosecutor who investigated former President Bill Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal , argued the case for Morse and said the ruling has implications for public school districts nationwide .
Morse said , “ I am gratified that the Supreme Court has upheld the application of our common sense policies . ”
The American Civil Liberties Union , which represented Frederick , criticized the ruling for allowing censorship of student speech without any evidence that school activities had been disrupted .
“ The court ’s ruling imposes new restrictions on student speech rights and creates a drug exception to the First Amendment , ” said Steven Shapiro , its national legal director .
How do you test a new kind of rocket engine ?
Step 1 : Bolt it to a trailer in the middle of the Mojave Desert .
Step 2 : Vroom !
In this case , NASA is firing up the 5M15 , which runs on compressed liquid methane .
The odorless substance has multiple advantages over conventional rocket propellants :
It 's cheaper , it requires much less insulation , and it exists on several planets NASA hopes to travel to — Mars , here we come .
That means astronauts could collect their own fuel for the trip home .
Bonus rocket science :
Those glowing figure eights in the blast stream are called Mach disks , after the guy who lent his name to the speed of sound .
They 're shock waves , created as the expanding fuel hits the higher atmospheric pressure outside the nozzle .
If part of this blast were n't obscured , you could take the number of Mach disks ( we count seven ) and multiply by the speed of sound — about 758 mph at the 1,300 - foot altitude of this test — to estimate the speed of fuel exiting the engine .
Just do n't get too close .

Lisp系のプログラミング言語であるSchemeは，言語仕様の美しさから多くのファンを持つ。著名なハッカーであり書籍「ハッカーと画家」
（Paul Graham著，オーム社発行）の翻訳でも知られる川合史朗氏（写真1）が作ったScheme処理系が「
Gauche」である。2007年5月9日，Gaucheのイベントである「GaucheNight」が東京都新宿区のライブ・スペース「NAKED LOFT」で開催された。50枚のチケットが事前に完売し，当日もほぼ満席状態。米国ハワイ在住の川合氏も来日し，Gauche関連の開発者やGaucheユーザーの熱気で大いに盛り上がった。
第 1部 は 「 Gaucheのパワーと楽しさを語れ！」と題した座談会が開催された（写真2，公開されている資料）。出演者はプログラミングの各分野の第一人者。「 Common Lisp最強」（司会のえんどうやすゆき氏による）の黒田寿男氏（参考リンク），Gauche作者の川合氏，著名なPerlハッカーである小飼弾氏，書籍「
On Lisp 」 （Paul Graham著，オーム社発行）の翻訳者である野田開氏，著名なHaskellハッカーである山下伸夫氏。Ruby作者であるまつもとゆきひろ氏もSkypeでリモート出演した（残念ながらSkypeの調子が悪く，まつもと氏は最初だけしか議論に参加できなかった）。
野田氏 は 「 On Lisp」の出版の経緯を紹介（参考記事）。そこからHaskellやRubyとの比較でCommon LispやSchemeのマクロに関する議論が盛り上がった。次いで黒田氏が，2007年4月に英国で開催された「 International Lisp Conference 2007 」 について報告した。
座談会のメインテーマである「 Scheme五つの誤解」では，Common Lisp派の黒田氏がSchemeの問題点を指摘し，それに対して川合氏が答えるという展開になった。といっても，ぎすぎすした雰囲気ではなく，あくまで純粋な技術論。むしろ，黒田氏の「芸としてのツッコミ」を聴衆が楽しむといった趣だった。
第2部はデモ大会「 GaucheGong」。ライトニングトークス形式で，7人のGaucheハッカーが自慢の自作ソフトウエアのデモを競った。まず，久井亨氏が，3次元アニメーションのライブラリであるmephistoをデモした。小黒直樹氏は，VNCプロトコルを使ったシンプルなグラフィックス・ライブラリ「Gauche-rfb」を紹介。VNCクライアント上でライフゲームなどを表示するデモを行った。
植山類氏は，自作したコンビネータ・パーザーのライブラリを使い，「今週金曜日の午後」といった日本語の文章から実際の日付データを生成するデモを披露。山田淳雄氏は，Gaucheスクリプトの起動を高速化する「speedygosh」というツールを紹介した。Fast CGIには少し及ばないものの，Gaucheで書かれたCGIスクリプトの高速化に有効だという。
はやしけんたろう氏が作っ た 「 Gauche - hpdf 」 はPDFを生成するソフトウエア。伊東勝利氏は「Class-Partitioning -Class on Kahua」というハックを披露。備前達矢氏は ，Wiki風の記法でWeb上にプレゼンテーションを記述できるKuhuaアプリケーション「 Kahua-S5（仮）」を紹介した。
イベントが終わった後も，会場では川合氏や小飼氏を囲んでの技術的な雑談が夜中まで続いた。中には，手持ちのノートパソコンに川合氏のサインをもらう参加者もいた（写真3）。川合氏が自身のノートパソコンを開いて「こんな新記法を考えてるんだけど，どう思う？」と取り囲んだ人に尋ねる場面もあるなど，終始アットホームな雰囲気のイベントだった（写真4）。
Near this dusty town in southeastern Arizona , Manuel Reyna pitches watermelons into the back of a trailer hitched to a tractor .
His father was a migrant farm worker , but growing up , Mr. Reyna never saw himself following his father 's footsteps .
Now , as an inmate at the Picacho Prison Unit here , Reyna works under the blazing desert sun alongside Mexican farmers the way his father did .
" My dad tried to keep me out of trouble , " he says , wearing a bandanna to keep the sweat out of his eyes .
" But I always got back into the easy money , because it was faster and a lot more money . "
He 's serving a 6 - 1/ 2 year sentence for possession and sale of rock cocaine .
As states increasingly crack down on hiring undocumented workers , western farmers are looking at inmates to harvest their fields .
Colorado started sending female inmates to harvest onions , corn , and melons this summer .
Iowa is considering a similar program .
In Arizona , inmates have been working for private agriculture businesses for almost 20 years .
But with legislation signed this summer that would fine employers for knowingly hiring undocumented workers , more farmers are turning to the Arizona Department of Corrections ( ADC ) for help .
" We are contacted almost daily by different companies needing labor , " says Bruce Farely , manager of the business development unit of Arizona Correctional Industries ( ACI ) .
ACI is a state labor program that holds contracts with government and private companies .
" Maybe it was labor that was undocumented before , and they do n't want to take the risk anymore because of possible consequences , so they are looking to inmate labor as a possible alternative . "
Reyna and about 20 other low - risk , nonviolent offenders work at LBJ Farm , a family - owned watermelon farm , as part of ADC 's mission to employ every inmate , either behind prison walls or in outside companies .
The idea is to help inmates develop job skills and save money for their release .
" It helps them really pay their debt back to the folks who have been harmed in society , as well as make adequate preparation for their release back onto the streets . " says ADC director Dora Schriro .
If it were n't for a steady flow of inmates year - round , says Jack Dixon , owner of LBJ , one of the largest watermelon farms in the western US , he'd have sold out long ago .
Even so , last year 400 acres of his watermelons rotted on the ground – a $ 640,000 loss – because there were n't enough harvesters .
Mr. Dixon had applied for 60 H2 - A guest worker visas , but only 14 were approved because of previous visa violations .
" We are in desperate need for hand labor , " says Dixon , who started working on the farm when he was 9 , alongside mostly migrant workers .
" It 's hard to get migrant workers up here anymore , with all the laws preventing them .
It 's not what it used to be , " Dixon says .
" It 's dangerous for them with all the coyote wars and smuggling . "
Other farmers wonder if inmates could be their solution .
Dixon has received calls from a yellow - squash farmer in Texas inquiring about how to set up an inmate labor contract as well as from another watermelon farmer in Colorado seeking advice on how to manage inmate crews .
For labor - rights activists , federal immigration reform is the only viable solution to worker shortages .
Marc Grossman , spokesman for the United Farm Workers of America , says inmate labor undermines what unionized farmworkers have wanted for years : to be paid based on skill and experience .
" It 's rather insulting that the state [ Arizona ] would look so poorly on farm workers that they would attempt to use inmates , " Grossman says .
There is also the food - safety aspect , he says : Experienced workers understand sanitary harvesting .
" Agriculture does not have a reliable workforce , and the answer does not lie with prison labor , " says Paul Simonds of the Western Growers Association , a trade association representing California and Arizona .
" This just underscores the need for legislation to be passed to provide a legal , stable workforce . "
A prison lockdown would be disastrous , he points out , with perishable crops awaiting harvest .
Other crops , like asparagus and broccoli , require skilled workers .
Although the ADC is considering innovative solutions – including satellite prisons – to fulfill companies ' requests for inmate labor , prison officials agree that , in the end , the demand is too high .
" To go into a state where agriculture is worth $ 9.2 billion and expect to meet a workforce need is impossible , " says Katie Decker , spokeswoman for ADC .
At any given time only about 3,300 prisoners statewide ( out of a prison population of about 37,000 ) are cleared to work outside .
ACI provides inmates to nine private agricultural companies in Arizona , ranging from a hydroponics greenhouse tomato plant to a green chile cannery .
Unlike other sectors where federal regulations require that inmate workers be paid a prevailing wage and receive worker compensation , agricultural companies can hire state inmates on a contract basis .
They must be paid a minimum of $ 2 per hour .
Thirty percent of their wages go to room and board in prison .
The rest goes to court - ordered restitution for victims , any child support , and a mandatory savings account .
Private companies are required to pay for transportation from the prison to the worksite and for prison guards .
For Reyna , his work on farms over the past couple of years has added $ 9,000 in his savings account and given him a renewed respect for his Mexican father 's lifetime of stoop labor .
At Dixon 's farm , it 's 103 degrees F .
The inmate crews , wearing orange jumpsuits , work in a rhythmic line , calling out the number of the watermelons , and alongside the trailer .
Just a few yards away , Mexican workers also work in a line .
The inmates will quit at 4 p.m. , while the immigrant laborers may work 13 - hour days .
" We go back , they stay out here , " Reyna says .
" It really is n't the same . "
In the farm 's office , watermelons line the counter , and photos of migrant workers hang in dusty frames .
When asked why he does n't sell the farm , Dixon says , " the inmates , the migrants , these people are part of the family – that 's why I keep this darn place . "
Dixon says he supports the idea of a reformed , guest - worker program that would employ migrant workers during the harvest and return them to Mexico in the winter .
But until that happens , he 's willing to fight for the workers he 's shared the land with for most of his life .
" People are crossing the border because they are starving to death , " Dixon says , " I do n't care what their status is .
If they are hungry and thirsty , I am going to feed them . "
" I could sell this and quit , " he continues , " But I believe in supporting the American farming industry . "

Almost twice as many women as men wish they had married someone else , says a survey .
More than one in five married women ( 22 per cent ) said that if they could go back in time they would change their husband .
Just 12 per cent of married men , however , admitted picking the wrong wife .
Over 35s were asked to name their biggest regrets for the study .
Scroll down for more
Three in ten told researchers they would like to have gone into a different career while over a third ( 37 per cent ) wished they had saved more money .
The biggest regrets centred on travel , with 53 per cent wishing they had done more globetrotting before settling down .
Paul Whitlock , head of savings at Bradford & Bingley bank , which commissioned the survey of 1,250 men and women , said : " There 's no reason why people can't set up their own business , travel more or be prepared for that once - in - a - lifetime opportunity that may arise . "
NEW YORK – Last year , when my wife and I had to beg permission from our co-op board in Jackson Heights , Queens , to swap our one - bedroom apartment for a two - bedroom unit , only one thing stood between us and our dream of getting our one - year - old son into his own room .
Noise .
My wife is a professional percussionist .
After three years of hearing her play marimba , djembe and conga in our living room – and hearing me fumble around on our upright piano – our neighbors wanted assurances that we would keep things quiet in our new home .
One resident , a kindly old man who had always greeted us warmly in the hall , told us that he and his wife would never have voted us into the building in the first place if they 'd known how loud we would be .
Others told us we had to guarantee their peace and quiet .
Determined to be good neighbors and to get that extra room , we volunteered to do some soundproofing .
That 's when things got complicated .
The measures that my wife and I took – spending thousands of dollars ( and countless hours ) on consultants , contractors , materials and gadgets in order to turn our new dining room into a professional - caliber music studio – might go beyond the needs of many people .
But the lessons we learned would benefit anyone who entertains thoughts of soundproofing their home .
Noise problems are typically complex and multifaceted , and as our acoustic consultant told us , sound is like water : block it from traveling along one path , and it will simply find another .
To make matters worse , applying almost any soundproofing measure is harder in practice than it seems in theory .
Soundproofing materials can be difficult to work with , contractors are n't always familiar with them , and the quirks of existing construction can derail even the best - laid plans .
Go Green
Home theater aficionados and soundproofing geeks are all atwitter over the latest in soundproofing technology : a gooey compound called Green Glue that converts sound energy into heat .
Green Glue compares favorably with conventional methods of soundproofing walls and ceilings , like factory - damped drywall .
But it 's much cheaper : A case of 12 tubes costs only $ 175 , and is enough to cover a decent sized wall .
Just remember :
Green Glue must be sandwiched between two rigid surfaces , which means laminating your existing walls with a layer of sheetrock that 's been slathered with the goop .
( Use the thickest sheetrock you can ; mass helps block sound , too . )
Green Glue takes time to cure .
It may be 10 days before you notice a real difference , and 30 days before the stuff reaches its maximum sound dampening potential .
Green Glue works better at lower frequencies than many soundproofing options , but it is n't perfect .
Expect some leakage from that 800 - watt subwoofer .
False Ceiling , Real Results
Laminating your walls with Green Glue is a no-brainer .
You can do the same to your ceiling , but for extra soundproofing , go a step further and drop the damn thing .
To create a drop or false ceiling , just attach furring channels to your existing ceiling and hang a bunch of sheetrock panels from them .
The dead air space between the original ceiling and the new one creates a sound - trapping chamber .
We took a different route -– and our upstairs neighbors have n't complained yet .
Attach some plain wooden strips to the ceiling , spaced two feet apart .
Screw a layer of sheetrock onto the strips .
Slather some Green Glue onto another layer of sheetrock , and screw that onto the first layer .
The result : a soundproof ceiling sandwich .
Just make sure your ceiling can support all that weight before trying this at home .
This Carpet Sure Is Heavy
We were n't too worried about sound carrying through our floor into the laundry room below .
But our acoustic consultant warned us that an untreated floor could act like a giant drumhead , transmitting sound vibrations to our walls and hence to our ceiling .
To prevent this problem , which soundproofing pros call " flanking noise , " we put down several hundred pounds of high - density , mass - loaded vinyl .
Remember , more mass means less sound transmission .
And at densities of up to 2lbs .
per square foot , MLV is the next best thing to lead .
For best results , make sure the MLV is n't in direct contact with the floor .
The experts advise floating it over a thin layer of open - cell polyurethane foam .
Sound can travel between the seams of adjacent strips , so seal them good with lead - impregnated tape .
Or do what we did , and put down two layers at right angles to one another .
Block Those Exits
Doors are often the weak links in a soundproofed room .
But there are ways to improve them .
Replace hollow - core doors with heavy solid - core ones to minimize sound transmission through the door bodies .
Add acoustic seals around the edges and automatic door bottoms , which drop neoprene sound seals to the floor every time you close your doors , and retract them upon opening .
They are very cool , but a bitch to install , especially if your floors and doors are n't perfectly level .
So be prepared to tweak , tweak , tweak .
A Few Last Tips
Fill any gaps or cracks with flexible , non-hardening caulk .
Mount anything that shakes – speakers , instruments , whatever -– on neoprene vibration isolation pads to prevent sound energy from flowing into your floor .
Hang some high - density fiberglass baffles on your walls and ceiling .
They 'll improve the acoustics of the room and absorb some of the noise that would otherwise leak out .
As our acoustic consultant told us , soundproofing is not one thing , but a bunch of little things that add up , decibel by decibel .
Our total labor and sheetrock costs were around $ 4,000 , with an additional $ 3,000 for materials .
( We also invested $ 1,000 to have fiberglass insulation pumped into our walls to give the apartment a smidgen of sound isolation before the real work began . )
The results were impressive .
We had originally been concerned about sound leaking directly up through our ceiling , and out through the doors into neighboring , un - soundproofed rooms .
After the work was finished , high - frequency stuff like the upper range of Ingrid 's marimba simply was n't audible from our upstairs neighbor 's apartment , and low - frequency stuff like bass drum hits were much , much softer .
I occasionally rehearse with a piano trio in a professional music studio , and our home soundproofing job is every bit as effective as theirs .
Of course , this did n't come easy .
It took weeks for the job to be completed , and many , many frantic calls and e-mails to our acoustic consultant , not to mention daily huddles with our contractor .
Our floors were n't level , so we had to finesse the automatic door bottoms for days to get them to work right ; the Green Glue folks disagreed with our consultant over how to handle the drop ceiling ; it took forever to find an MLV package that fit our budget ; and everyone had a different opinion on how to install the door seals , including our consultant and the manufacturer .
But it did get done , and at remarkably little cost to our marriage , despite the stress – probably because I handled all the soundproofing details , while Ingrid managed the rest of the renovation .
It ’s stating the obvious to say that the worst thing about the internet is the horde of morons that populate it ( present company excluded , of course ) .
I will admit to antagonising these sad excuses for human beings for my own amusement in the past .
What can I say ?
As a kid I used to stir up ant ’s nests .
But no more .
I ’m done with these losers .
I refuse to even acknowledge their pathetic attempts at insults until they make a decent effort .
They may never reach the standard of the classics listed below but I ’m not going to indulge people who do n’t even try .

UPDATE
Wow , Reddit is doing funny things to my blog again .
I ’m glad so many people are enjoying this post but it means it ’s impractical to respond to all the comments ( which is what I ’d usually do ) .
Although I will be reading all comments .
Speaking of comments , are the people leaving incredibly lame insults in response to this post indulging is some through - the - looking - glass meta-irony ?
Or are they really , really stupid ?
My favourite is the people saying this list exists somewhere else , as if that ’s some huge revelation .
Really ?
Some of the most notable people in history have been quoted before ?
Wow , that ’s a shocker !
I ’ll be the first to admit that this blog post is almost no work on my part .
The work is actually in the video .
As I say in the video , I saw the the collection posted to a mailing list from my old college .
It happened to fit in exactly with how I was feeling about YouTube in particular .
I thought I ’d make a video version that would be appreciated by people I knew were constantly suffering stupid harrassment on YT .
The blog post was , in all seriousness , an afterthought .
I was posting the video before I went to bed and when I checked the time I realised it was Friday morning in the US .
I thought to myself “ who wants to work on a Friday ?
– I ’ll give everyone a little time waster . ”
It seems it was appreciated by most , which is nice .
To the tools who want to whine and bitch to try and distract themselves from their own inadequacies … ah screw it , just imagine I said something as clever as one of the above to you .
SECOND UPDATE
I was asked about the music accompanying the video .
This is my angryaussie theme music , done for me by another YouTuber , nsgmusic .
He has his own site at www.nsg-music.com and if you really like the angryaussie theme you can actually download it for free here .

A police official on Tuesday said the plaza bombing in the south Philippine city of Zamboanga , in which at least 20 people were injured , could have been masterminded by a military intelligence agent , local TV network ABS - CBN News reported .
Senior Superintendent Manuel Barcena , Zamboanga
City police chief , declined to name the agent but said the identity of the agent was revealed to them by one of three suspects arrested for the bombing .
" One of the suspects said [ the military agent ] was the one who provided the bomb , " Barcena told ABS - CBN .
He said the suspect is a known " murderer " in Zamboanga City .
Barcena said the Zamboanga City Police Office is now coordinating with the military to confirm the agent 's involvement in the bombing .
The bombing took place at a plaza in Zamboango on Aug. 21 , more than 24 hours after Philippine President Arroyo visited the city for a major command conference with military commanders in the region .
At least 20 people were injured in the bombing but no one was killed .

With Karl Roves sudden announcement that he would be stepping down at the end of August , you knew this was coming .
On tonight 's " Countdown " Keith talks with Newsweek 's Howard Fineman about Rove 's disturbing and delusional presser this afternoon before departing and what lies ahead for President Bush -- and his Brain .
Download Download
Fineman : " The silence has been deafening from Republicans .
From Republican presidential contenders , from members of Congress who by the way , are out of town , another good reason for Rove to leave now .
I have n't heard a word from any Republican leader about Karl Rove because they do n't like Karl Rove .
And the reason they don ' t like Karl Rove is that his soul focus has been on George Bush .
This notion that Karl Rove 's aim was to build a new Republican majority , ala McKinley , is ridiculous .
His only mission was to get George Bush elected .
He did it twice , and did n't really care a whole lot about the Congress , Republicans included . "
" George Bush is counting the minutes till he gets out of town .
I always felt about George Bush -- that he wanted to win desperately , I 'm not sure he really wanted to be president and he 's looking enviously at Karl Rove as he heads back to Texas . "

Larisa Alexandrovna at the Huffington Post :
I think that with the exception of a few real journalists and honest columnists in the MSM , the American media - industrial - political complex is a discredited , decadent , ugly thing to behold and , sadly for us , a real danger to democracy .
They are a collective Faust , selling their very souls for access , power , money and anything that relates to those three commodities so important to the morally vacuous .
They sell their souls , we pay the price , and they make a profit .
If I seem to be exaggerating in my absolute disgust over the state of our media , then youâ € ” dear readerâ € ” have not been paying attention or you simply do n't care .
The most significant story in American politics is how the corporate media has moved from its standard historical hatred for progressives to hatred for regular centrist Democrats .
( See Clinton , Bill ; Gore , Al ; and now Pelosi , Nancy . )
Meanwhile , the Democrats still do n't get it , even as CNN and the Washington Post beat the crap out of them every day , and refuse to fund competing media .
Artist 's illustration of an " isolated neutron star . "
Credit : Casey Reed , courtesy of Penn State University
Using NASA 's Swift satellite , McGill University and Penn State University astronomers have identified an object that is likely one of the closest neutron stars to Earth -- and possibly the closest .
The object , located in the constellation Ursa Minor , is nicknamed Calvera , after the villain in the movie " The Magnificent Seven . "
If confirmed , it would be only the eighth known " isolated neutron star " -- meaning a neutron star that does not have an associated supernova remnant , binary companion , or radio pulsations .
" The seven previously known isolated neutron stars are known collectively as ' The Magnificent Seven ' within the community and so the name Calvera is a bit of an inside joke on our part , " says co-discoverer Derek Fox of Penn State .
A paper describing the research will be published in the Astrophysical Journal .
First author Robert Rutledge of McGill University in Montreal , Quebec , originally called attention to the source .
He compared a catalog of 18,000 X - ray sources from the German - American ROSAT satellite , which operated from 1990 to 1999 , with catalogs of objects that appear in visible light , infrared light , and radio waves .
He realized that the ROSAT source known as 1RXS J141256.0+792204 did not appear to have a counterpart at any other wavelength .
The group aimed Swift at the object in August 2006 .
Swift 's X - ray Telescope showed that the source was still there , and emitting about the same amount of X - ray energy as it had during the ROSAT era .
The Swift observations enabled the group to pinpoint the object 's position more accurately , and showed that it was not associated with any known object .
" The Swift observation of this source is what got the show going , " says paper coauthor and Penn State undergraduate Andrew Shevchuk .
" As soon as I saw the data , I knew Calvera was a great neutron - star candidate . "
The team next targeted Calvera with the 8.1 - meter Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii .
These observations , along with a short observation by NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory , showed that the object is not associated with any optical counterpart down to a very faint magnitude .
Chandra 's sharper X - ray vision sees the object as point - like , consistent with the neutron - star interpretation .
According to Rutledge , there are no widely accepted alternate theories for objects like Calvera that are bright in X - rays and faint in visible light .
Exactly which type of neutron star it is , however , remains a mystery .
As Rutledge says , " Either Calvera is an unusual example of a known type of neutron star , or it is some new type of neutron star , the first of its kind . "
Calvera 's location high above the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy is part of its mystery .
In all likelihood , the neutron star is the remnant of a star that lived in our galaxy 's starry disk before exploding as a supernova .
In order to reach its current position , it had to wander some distance out of the disk .
But exactly how far " " The best guess is that it is still close to its birthplace , and therefore close to Earth , " says Rutledge .
If this interpretation is correct , the object is 250 to 1,000 light - years away .
This would make Calvera one of the closest known neutron stars -- possibly the closest .
" Because it is so bright , and probably close to Earth , it is a promising target for many types of observations , " says Fox .
Indeed , to clear up the mysteries surrounding Calvera the team will be taking a longer observation with Chandra to see if the source pulsates in X - rays , and to measure its spectrum .
They also joined a group using a radio telescope to search for radio pulsations , which were not seen .
Calvera could represent the tip of the iceberg for isolated neutron stars .
" There could easily be dozens , " says Fox .
" The key point is that until our Swift survey , no one was able to refine the X - ray positions of large numbers of ROSAT sources to the point where it became clear which ROSAT sources were ' missing ' their optical counterparts . "

( CNN ) --
Inventors across the country are being asked to find a way to lighten the load U.S. soldiers carry on their backs -- largely due to the high - tech gear that uses batteries -- and the solution will be decided in a $ 1 million contest .
The military wants to lighten the load troops carry into combat .

The Department of Defense is asking a person or team to come up with a way to lessen the weight of the 20 - 40 pounds of batteries a solider carries on a typical four - day mission .
The batteries power everything from soldiers ' GPS systems to their night - vision goggles .
" In many missions the batteries are heavier than the ammunition they are carrying , " said Dr. William S. Rees Jr. , Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Laboratories and Basic Sciences -- whose office , the Director of Defense Research and Engineering , is sponsoring the prize competition .
" We 'd like to reverse that ratio . "
Some missions require as much as 100 pounds of equipment , according to Brig .
General Mark Brown who commands the Army 's Program Executive Office Soldier program .
See what troops are carrying and wearing into combat »
" Any weight reduction on batteries would really help us out , " Army Spc. Daniel Tinsely , currently serving in Iraq , told CNN 's Federick Pleitgen .
Watch as Tinsely explains the gear he carries and the batteries required »
" It 's a challenge we 've had in the military forever , " said CNN military analyst retired Army Brig .
Gen. James " Spider " Marks .
Marks says one of the best things to help out the soldiers would be to give them a " power pack " that 's miniaturized -- one that can last a long time and does n't weigh much .
And that 's the key to winning the $ 1 million .
The whole prototype must weigh 8.8 pounds ( 4 kilograms ) or less and produce 20 watts average power for 4 days or 96 hours .
It has to be wearable , like a vest , and will undergo rigorous testing .

Defense Research and Engineering Prize Program Executive Office ( PEO ) Soldier
The entry that can demonstrate a wearable electric power system that can provide 96 hours of equipment operation at 8.8 pounds or less , will take first place and the $ 1 million .
Systems coming in second and third place will receive $ 500,000 and $ 250,000 .
The contest , announced July 5 , will take place in the fall of 2008 .
It is open to individuals and teams and the DDR&E hopes to attract entrepreneurs as well as traditional defense contractors .
This is the first cash prize giveaway by the DDR&E , Rees added .
" We welcome all players to the game , " he said .
An individual must be a U.S. citizen and at least 21 years old .
A team can be comprised of non-citizens but the team leader must be a U.S. citizen at least 21 years old .
During the five - day competition , the top performing systems will take part in an eight - hour trial meant to mimic real life troop activities .
Competitors will strap on their prototypes and " subject their power systems to periods of walking , lying prone , outdoor environmental conditions , potentially short - term cold chambers and off - wearer operation in an airtight container . "
The judging panel will consist of government scientists , engineers and military personnel .
The military hopes these power packs may also have commercial use in camping , hiking and other outdoor activities .
First responders could power radios and search lights with the new technology , Rees suggested .
" You could run a small refrigerator off of it , " he added .
In September the military will hold a public meeting to brief potential competitors on technical details , the rules and qualification requirements .
The registration deadline is November 30 , 2007 .

Notice that I did n’t title this as “ the best way to bank ” , because it may not be .
This is simply what works pretty well for us and we have n’t had a late payment in years .
Heck , we have emergency funds setup just in case the emergency fund goes dry .
Before you roll your eyes and think it ’s impossible , know that I am a normal guy and not some super - suit executive – I just started early .
If you take a portion and implement it , great .
If you have a tip that you use , I would love to hear it .
Day - to - Day Stuff :
Chase Checking Account A : This is where my paycheck goes and where the bills are paid from .
We try to have bills first go to a credit card to collect enough points to pay for an annual vacation .
We then pay off the credit card each month before financing charges are applied ( do n’t try it if you cannot commit to paying the credit card off ) .
There are NO debit cards issued to this account , only a checkbook if we need it – which is never .
All bills are paid electronically and NO , I do n’t wait until the last minute to collect extra interest .
I am not playing timing games , I have enough stress so I pay bills within 48 hours of receiving them .
Chase Checking Account B : This is my personal expense account .
We transfer money here from Account A bi-weekly , when I get paid .
Gas , Gifts , Personal Cell phone , etc. are paid from this account and the transfer amount never changes .
Regardless of what I make , I get $ 150 per week .
If I do n’t have enough to watch Monday Night Football at the bar with the guys , I do n’t go .
If I win at poker , my winnings go here and the wife is none the wiser .
If an event is coming up , I skimp in other areas to make sure I have enough money .
Chase Checking Account C :
This is my wife ’s personal expense account .
She currently gets $ 280 per week .
She gets a lot more than I do because she is paying for the groceries and kids ’ activities .
Nevertheless we treat it the same way as my account .
If she does n’t have enough money for Girls Night Out , she does n’t go .
When she goes 200 minutes over her cell plan , she gets docked .
This forces her to clip coupons and be frugal .
Before anyone says this is mean , know that we agreed on this before implementing it .
Harris Bank :
We have a savings account in each of the kids ’ names here .
This is for the kids ’ birthday money .
Through online banking we also contribute random amounts of money each time we pay the bills .
For example , if I pay the bills one day and the balance in the checking account shows $ 1123.30 , I will send $ 3.30 to one of the kids ’ accounts .
Kind of dumb , but its an easy way to keep money flowing into their accounts for college or whatever .
Back - up / Emergency Funds :
Chase Money Market :
This is a holding account .
I always want to have 3 months of bill - money set aside in this account .
If I get canned , hurt , or otherwise cannot bring in an income , this will pay our way until I can find something else .
This took a while to save up , but it ’s there now .
While it ’s not the best interest rate in the world , I ’d rather have the funds there immediately if needed as opposed to make an extra $ 30 / year .
Chase 13 - month CD :
This is the emergency fund .
It took a minimum of $ 10 K to open and that ’s what I put in .
If something really bad happens and we go through the ‘ Jay got fired ’ money , we tap into this .
It gets over 5 % interest so we ’re looking at $ 600 / year .
Again , this took a while to accumulate so do n’t get discouraged or irritated .
Investment :
My company matches $ 0.50 on the dollar up to 9 % .
So I contribute 9 % of my paycheck to 401K .
I manage the fund selections myself and am pretty aggressive because I still have a while before retirement .
We had 4 other 401k plans consolidated and are now managed by Chase .
This is one of the ways that we got out of all the service fees at Chase .
I have an account at Schwab with $ 0.02 in it .
A long time ago I put in a couple thousand and bought a bunch of garbage .
Believe it or not that $.02 is actually a share value , I hold shares of a stock now worth .0001 per share .
Just do n’t do it , I wanted to try it out and I learned a lesson fast .
Business Accounts :
You guys may remember that I have rental property listed under my LLC .
This is mainly for liability purposes , however you will run into people saying that an LLC is worthless .
I just do what the lawyer says and it makes sense to me – if a tenant slips and falls , they can sue the LLC but not necessarily me .
Anyway , I chose a bank that was less than a mile from my house and had branches next to the tenants .
The tenants just go there and deposit their money orders into my account using the deposit stubs I gave them .
This account just grows based on the monthly profit .
Each year we take money from this account as a ‘ paycheck ’ and then deposit it into the Chase IRA .
Paying Bills :
Quicken .
We have used Quicken since 1999 and regardless of all the cute little tools and websites out nowadays , my opinion is that Quicken is the best option .
I have a ridiculous amount of reports available and every expense has a category .
To this day my wife makes fun of me because when we were saving for a down payment on a house , I actually entered a .25 gumball she bought from one of those vending machines .
College Funds :
We have 2 kids and the plan is to use the appreciation gains and monthly profit from the rentals to pay for college .
I bought these things with 10 % down and although the depreciation tax write off slows as the property ages , I will have a fair amount of money for the kids ’ college by the time I sell them .
Plus , I am going to buy more at some point when I have time to find a new lender .
Like I said , some of this may work for you and I know it ’s not ideal .
However , we have most things covered which unfortunately is more than most people do .
Several years ago my income went from $ 28 K to $ 44 K in one year .
I thought I was rich until I realized I blew it all and had nothing to show for it .
Now that I am making substantially more than that , it ’s those early lessons that guide me .
Do yourself a favor – build a plan .
– Jay

After getting his butt kicked by Chris Dodd , BillO needed someone to come on and validate his point of view .
The fact that Dodd knew about his Coit Tower and anti-San Francisco statements surprised him and so he tried to use the usual trick out of the Conservative handbook .
He did n't deny his remarks , but tried to confuse the issue about where he said it originally .
Miller is just the " yes- man " for the job and actually said that Dodd sandbagged O'Reilly !
I 'm not making this up ..
Maybe he has regained his sense of humor after all .... He had the nerve to call Dodd a hack and he said that Chris never read the Daily Kos .... I guess he used the washed up comic 's trusty crystal ball for that one .
I met him once backstage in Santa Barbara after a show I played in '03 and he sucked up to the band , but seemed friendly enough at the time .
Who knew he was destined for the loving arms of O'Reilly ?

A federal judge in California ruled on Tuesday that five states may continue their investigations of allegations that AT&T participated in a National Security Agency wiretapping program .
Each of the five states — Missouri , Maine , New Jersey , Connecticut , and Vermont — have launched investigations under their state laws concerning AT&T 's alleged cooperation in large - scale surveillance programs .
State regulators sought information about the companies ' activities , including whether such a program existed at all , and if so , how many customer records had been released and what information they contained .
The Bush administration intervened in the case , arguing that the states ' demands conflict with federal law , intrude on the federal government 's authority over national security , and risk divulging sensitive state secrets .
Government lawyers urged that the case be dismissed at the outset in the interest of national security .
Judge Vaughn R. Walker rejected the first two arguments .
He held that states have long had the power to regulate telecommunications companies and that merely demanding information from AT&T did not run afoul of federal law .
He also ruled that there is no reason to expect that the states ' actions , which are focused on traditional regulatory concerns like privacy , will interefere with the federal government 's conduct of foreign policy .
However , Walker declined to rule on the state secrets issue .
On that question , Walker deferred to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , which is currently considering a similar argument in Hepting v. AT&T , the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's class action lawsuit against AT&T for sharing its customers ' confidential information with the government .
In the Hepting case , also heard by Judge Walker , the government asserted that the very existence of the NSA wiretapping program is a state secret , and so any litigation regarding it must be dismissed at the outset to avoid disclosing sensitive details of the program .
Judge Walker rejected that argument last year , and the case is now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals .
If the Ninth Circuit agrees with Judge Walker ( and if the Supreme Court does n't intervene ) , then the lawsuit will go forward .
But a final resolution of the case is likely to take several years .
Another challenge to the NSA 's program , this one spearheaded by the ACLU , was rejected by a different appeals court earlier this month on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the lawsuit .
The government successfully argued that the ACLU could not demonstrate that any of the individual plaintiffs in the case had actually been spied on .
Both the EFF lawsuit and the state investigations have arguments to sidestep that objection .
EFF has a sworn statement from an AT&T employee about the existence of a secret room in AT&T's San Francisco facilities that is limited to NSA personnel .
According to the statement , AT&T has diverted the vast majority of the traffic that goes through its San Francisco network to the NSA room , making it likely that the plaintiffs — who are AT&T customers in the San Francisco area — had their communications intercepted .
As for the state regulators , they are making use of their existing regulatory authority over telecommunications providers in their states , so there are no standing concerns .
However , once the Ninth Circuit hands down its ruling on the state secrets issue , AT&T and the government will have the opportunity to argue that the appeals court ruling in that case precludes the disclosure of some or all of the information sought by the regulators .
We have also covered a third challenge to the program .
That case involved an Islamic group with alleged ties to terrorism that was inadvertently given classified information alluding to the NSA 's wiretapping program .
That case , too , sidestepped the standing objection because the plaintiffs have direct evidence that their communications were intercepted by the secret program .
Litigation is likely to drag on for several years .
This week 's ruling merely cleared the way for state regulators to begin their investigations , and the Ninth Circuit 's ruling will merely determine whether EFF can begin the discovery process in its subsequent lawsuit .
If EFF prevails in its lawsuit , or if the regulators uncover evidence that AT&T violated state laws , those decisions will almost certainly be challenged by AT&T or the government .
And if a court ever orders the program ( or AT&T 's participation in it ) shut down , the issue would likely find its way to the Supreme Court .
In all likelihood , the controversy will outlast the Bush administration .
Congress has also been actively investigating the issue .
In May , Rep. Silvestre Reyes ( D - TX ) , the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , announced his intention to investigate the phone companies ' involvement in NSA 's surveillance programs .
And in June , the Senate Judiciary Committee subpoenaed the Bush administration regarding the program .
The administration will almost certainly oppose Congressional efforts to uncover details of the program , making it likely that any standoff with Congress will also outlast the Bush administration .

The base gameplay is focussed around the art of movement , meaning moving , speed and tricks play a big part in the gameplay .
Besides this , mapcontrol , aim , teamplay and fragging skills play their role too .
For the movement we 've basicly looked at four games : Quakeworld ( legendary for it 's speed ) , Quake3 CPMA , Jet Set Radio and Speedball .
Another twist in gameplay is Warsow 's weapon system .
Warsow has two firing modes for each weapon ; by picking up a weapon , you will be equipped with the standard ( weak ) ammo for the weapon , but when you pick up an ammo pack , you will equip your weapon with special ( strong ) ammo .

Add me to the list of the puzzled .
Many signs are from those advising Iraq commander Gen .
David Petraeus that he and his advisors think they have a strategy that they say is somewhat succeeding and do n’t want Congress to pull the plug .
In other words , Petraeus and the White House are ostensibly pretty close in advocating a continued large scale US presence in Iraq for as long as possible .
So it ’s bizarre that the White House is apparently indicating that it wants to preempt his findings and hijack the Petraeus report from Petraeus , and confine Petraeus and Amb.
Ryan Crocker to testifying before Congress in closed session .
So puzzling that one is suspicious : is the White House ultimately going to “ give in ” to Congressional pressure and “ let ” Petraeus testify , only to have it revealed , that , what do you know , it turns out that the good general too thinks the surge has done wonders and , with time , might reduce violence to a degree that greater political reconciliation takes hold .
He even forecasts that over the next year , he might be able to move troops out of the areas where violence has gone down , hinting at a lower US troop presence by next year , without offering too many specifics .
Of any reported White House effort to silence or sideline Petraeus , one of the general ’s close associates emails me , “ I do not believe it . ”
I am not sure I do either .
The only explanation that makes sense to me is that the White House is seeking to control the optics with Congressional Republican leaders anxious about how basically continuing a maximal US presence in Iraq will affect their ’08 reelection prospects .
Máte skvelý nápad , no nemáte dostatok finančných prostriedkov na jeho uskutočnenie ?
Chcete vydať vlastné dielo , ale brzdia vás financie ?
V súčasnom svete je začiatok podnikania skutočne zložitý .
Málokto má dosť peňazí na to , aby ho bez problémov mohol rozbehnúť .
Dnes sa teda bližšie pozrieme na to , aké sú možnosti v prípade , že do tejto kategórie šťastných ľudí nepatríte .
Okrem úverov a pôžičiek od banky či iných investorov , je tu aj takzvaný crowdfunding .
Tento pojem je vo svete celkom známy , no u nás ho pozná iba málokto .
História crowdfundingu na území Slovenska
História crowdfundingu
Poďme sa najprv spoločne pozrieť , o čo vlastne v tomto pojme ide .
Jeho podstatou je financovanie davom .
To znamená , že keď presvedčíte dostatok ľudí o tom , že váš projekt má zmysel a oni sa ho rozhodnú financovať , môžete sa pustiť do jeho realizácie .
Jednoduché , však ?
No vzhľadom na to , že konkurencia je pomerne vysoká , máte šancu uspieť iba vtedy , keď je váš projekt skutočne dobre prepracovaný a dokáže zaujať .
Čo sa týka crowdfundingu na Slovensku , jeho začiatky siahajú do roku 2015 , kedy vznikla crowdfundingová platforma s názvom StartLab .
Prezentovať tam môžete svoj projekt týkajúci sa takmer čohokoľvek , čo je verejnoprospešné .
Verejnosť má k vášmu projektu prístup , môže si pozrieť jeho rozpracovanie a na základe toho sa rozhodnúť , či ho finančne podporí alebo nie .
V niektorých prípadoch sa majiteľ projektu zaväzuje vrátiť istú odmenu svojim prispievateľom .
To závisí však od toho , ako je projekt postavený .
Crowdfunding – ako začať ?
Crowdfunding funguje na tom , že vy vytvoríte projekt a verejnosť sa rozhodne , či ho podporí .
Z toho jasne vyplýva , že váš projekt musí byť skutočne unikátny .
Dobre urobíte , ak celý projekt niečím ozvláštnite .
Skúste napríklad natočiť video , v ktorom svoj projekt predstavíte a spropagujete .
Keď vás ľudia uvidia „ naživo “ vo videu , bude to pre nich autentickejšie .
Nezabudnite takisto spomenúť odmeny .
Je na vás , či sa rozhodnete pre finančné odmeny pre tých , ktorí prispejú , alebo to bude odmena v podobe malého darčeku .
Crowdfunding je niečo , čo dokáže neuveriteľne pomôcť tomu , kto nedisponuje dostatočn ými finančn ými prostriedkami , no má skvelé nápady na podnikanie .

Bringing our fellow Americans to a greater understanding of the evils of a government - dominated society and the virtues of a free society has always been difficult and frustrating work .
It ’s no wonder that Albert Jay Nock likened it to Isaiah ’s job .
People are easily misled by promises of government salvation , especially when they are consumed by fear for their physical safety or their economic security .
Making matters even more difficult is the state ’s co-optation of a large number of people who have discovered that in the United States the rise of Big Brother offers enormous opportunities for personal enrichment — fascism ’s greatest advantage over socialism .
The potential for making off with such loot has long been appreciated in connection with the military - industrial - congressional complex ( MICC ) , and recent years have witnessed another great bonanza there .
Between the fiscal years 2001 and 2006 , Department of Defense ( DoD ) outlays , excluding payments to military personnel , increased from $ 217 billion to $ 366 billion , or by 69 percent ( 49 percent after the DoD ’s generous allowance for inflation ) .
Nearly all of this money finds its way into the pockets of the owners , employees , and suppliers of military - contracting companies .
We are not likely to win many converts to the cause of liberty in this crowd .
Alongside this entrenched predatory monstrosity , the government has built during the past five years a completely new and even more menacing apparatus , which I call the security - industrial - congressional complex ( SICC ) .
According to Paul Harris ’s September 10 , 2006 , report in the Guardian : “ Seven years ago there were nine companies with federal homeland security contracts .
By 2003 it was 3,512 .
Now there are 33,890 .
The money is huge .
Since 2000 , $ 130 billion of contracts have been dished out . ”
Harris adds : “ With so much money on offer and such riches being made , there is a powerful economic incentive to exploit the threat to America .
The homeland security industry has an army of lobbyists working for its interests in Washington .
It grows bigger each year and they want to keep the money flowing .
America is in the grip of a business based on fear . ”
I tracked one of Harris ’s sources to the informative Web site of the Center for Public Integrity .
If you want to become truly discouraged about the prospects for liberty , spend some time perusing the center ’s voluminous data on the lobbyists , their clients , the amounts of money being spent , and so forth .
According to these data , the number of companies and other organizations registered as lobbying the federal government with regard to homeland security increased from 3 in 2001 to 671 in 2004 ( the latest year for which the center has compiled such data ) .
Small wonder that Alex Knott , manager of the center ’s Lobby Watch project , declares : “ All this money in the industry is just up for grabs .
It ’s like a gold rush . ”
No gold rush , however , ever involved the massive amounts of money now on tap in the SICC .
To gain an appreciation of the contours of this piratical apparatus , visit the Web site of Government Security News ( GSN ) , an online publication that bills itself “ the newspaper of record for government security . ”
In only the few issues I examined , I discovered enough material to throw any sane person into a funk of despair for the cause of liberty .
In an August 2006 issue ( vol. 4 , issue 12 ) , for example , one finds a beautiful advertisement in full color with the headline , “ Looking for Billions in Upcoming Government Contracts ? ”
Underneath a pie chart depicting the dimensions of the various categories of loot up for grabs , the text continues : “ Knowing where to look is half the challenge .
Federal , State and Local Government IT Spending Will Exceed $ 70B in 2007 .
What are you waiting for ? ”
After which the reader is directed to a Web site “ to learn more about System Integration contracts and who ’s winning . ”
You can be sure that the winners do not include the taxpayers in general or the citizens whose rights are being suffocated by the fear - exploiting opportunists who are rushing to get rich by supplying goods and services to the Surveillance State .
Among the many fascinating features in GSN are “ Around the Country , ” which describes contracts placed in various states ( extensive geographical spreading of government contracts , long an attribute of the MICC , is a telltale sign of congressional intervention ) , “ Contracts , ” which gives the details of recent awards , and “ Business Opportunities , ” which describes “ recent and upcoming government solicitations . ”
In the August 2006 issues , GSN features an eye - popping list of leading SICC companies , which range from obscure firms such as 4D Security Solutions , Alutiq , and Cernium to familiar names such as Boeing , Diebold , Northrop Grumman , and Lucent Technologies .
Come one , come all .
The only losers are the citizens ’ wallets and their liberties .
As in any other dynamic industry , the SICC firms are being brought together in trade shows to display and tout their new wares .
( If you ’ve never checked out the trade publications and shows in the MICC , you do n’t really know the meaning of gruesome , slick yet disgusting advertising . )
Thus , the GSN for August 2006 contains an ad for a massive trade show to be held at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York on October 24 — 25 .
There you can “ source new products and solutions , make new contacts and gain critical industry knowledge . ”
The participants will include “ 9,100 industry professionals ” and “ more than 400 leading exhibiting companies , ” including Bosch , Brinks , Honeywell Security , Panasonic , Tyco , and many others .
GSN also makes available a job placement service , where employers and employees can find one another .
Among the nearly two thousand jobs listed , those for systems and software engineers , IT managers , and other techie types loom largest , but other sorts of jobs are available for you and me — well , truth be known , probably not for me , but surely many takers will come forth to occupy these well - paid positions .
After all , the U.S. government is sparing no expense ostensibly to protect all Americans from every known form of threat and from many threats yet undreamt of , too .
Americans expect nothing less from their government , which constantly presents itself as their savior of first resort .
Strange to say , however , no one seems especially distressed by the bogus quality of most of the goods and services being procured under the rubric of “ homeland security , ” a nebulous objective that now elicits — not by accident , but by design — little more than a gigantic exchange of political pork for items that merely purport to protect Volk und Vaterland .
For present purposes , however , the bad news is that the owners and employees of the SICC firms are not likely to have any interest in joining a movement to restore our lost liberties .
On the contrary , these people are literally Big Brother ’s little brothers and sisters .
However unwittingly , these private - sector facilitators and handmaidens of the government ’s pervasive invasion of everyone ’s privacy have formed a new bulwark against those who seek to divert the American people from their headlong rush into tyranny .

The Federalist Papers
Welcome to our Federalist Papers e-text .
The Federalist Papers were written and published during the years 1787 and 1788 in several New York State newspapers to persuade New York voters to ratify the proposed constitution .
In total , the Federalist Papers consist of 85 essays outlining how this new government would operate and why this type of government was the best choice for the United States of America .
All of the essays were signed " PUBLIUS " and the actual authors of some are under dispute , but the general consensus is that Alexander Hamilton wrote 52 , James Madison wrote 28 , and John Jay contributed the remaining five .
The Federalist Papers remain today as an excellent reference for anyone who wants to understand the U.S. Constitution .
We have three ways to browse the Federalist Papers .
Thee first two are both in numerical order .
Frames make it slightly easier to flip back and forth between different pages .
The third is by author .
Other important documents of the period :
These Federalist Papers Web pages were originally created by Rob Knautz and replace his version hosted online from 1996 to 2000 .

Many other historic texts are also available from the Gutenberg archives .
The copy of the Federalist Papers that is pictured above is a first edition in the collection of the Library of Congress .
It was originally owned by Alexander Hamilton 's wife , Elizabeth , who gave it to her sister , Angelica Church , from whom her friend , Thomas Jefferson , acquired it .
Apparently relying on information supplied by Madison , Jefferson assigned the pseudonymous " Publius " essays to Hamilton , Madison , and Jay in a list on the flyleaf of this volume .

The head of a US intelligence agency told the Associated Press that commercial satellite services like Google Earth may need to be censored in the future in order to protect American interests .
Vice Admiral Robert Murrett , who heads the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency , spends his days helping the government map the planet and studying imagery .
Once the exclusive domain of the government , commercial satellite imagery has attained high - enough resolutions that the government is thinking about ways to restrict its use in times of war or other emergency situations .
" If there was a situation where any imagery products were being used by adversaries to kill Americans , I think we should act , " he said in the interview .
" I think we may need to have some control over things that are disseminated .
I do n't know if that means buying up all the imagery or not .
I think there are probably some other ways you can do it . "
The reference to " buying up all the imagery " refers to the government 's practice of purchasing all commercially - available satellite data on Afghanistan during the early days of the conflict there .
While buying up all available images may be one solution to the problem , the government may also be able to exert a different kind of pressure , as it provides nearly $ 1 billion in grants to major US imagery firms .
As the imagery market becomes international , though , the competing demands of local governments may be more difficult to sort out .
The issue is already becoming tricky for companies like Google that offer popular products using satellite imagery .
Google has already faced requests from Vice President Cheney to remove images of his residence and from the Indian government to blur sensitive military sites .
Headlines in the UK have already claimed that Iraqi insurgents are using Google Earth to attack British troops .
Certain disruptive technologies ( peer - to - peer file sharing comes to mind ) are difficult to stuff back inside the bag once they 've been unleashed on the world , and and satellite mapping may someday be one of them .
For now , though , the number of commercial satellites is still quite limited , and the companies that do the mapping well are few in number .
As that changes , the US government — and all other governments — will find it harder and harder to control the information that is produced .
British Army deploys new weapon based on mass - killing technology John Byrne
Published : Thursday August 23 , 2007
Print This Email This Parliament not told , minister says A new ' super - weapon ' being supplied to British soldiers in Afghanistan employs technology based on the " thermobaric " principle which uses heat and pressure to kill people targeted across a wide air by sucking the air out of lungs and rupturing internal organs .
The so - called " enhanced blast " weapon uses similar technology used in the US " bunker busting " bombs and the devastating bombs dropped by the Russians to destroy the Chechen capital , Grozny .
Such weapons are brutally effective because they first disperse a gas or chemical agent which is lit at a second stage , allowing the blast to fill the spaces of a building or the crevices of a cave .
When the US military deployed a version of these weapons in 2005 , DefenseTech wrote an article titled , " Marines Quiet About Brutal New Weapon . "
According to the US Defense Intelligence Agency , which released a study on thermobaric weapons in 1993 , " The [ blast ] kill mechanism against living targets is unique -- and unpleasant ....
What kills is the pressure wave , and more importantly , the subsequent rarefaction [ vacuum ] , which ruptures the lungs .
If the fuel deflagrates but does not detonate , victims will be severely burned and will probably also inhale the burning fuel .
Since the most common FAE fuels , ethylene oxide and propylene oxide , are highly toxic , undetonated FAE should prove as lethal to personnel caught within the cloud as most chemical agents . "
A second DIA study said , " shock and pressure waves cause minimal damage to brain tissue ... it is possible that victims of FAEs are not rendered unconscious by the blast , but instead suffer for several seconds or minutes while they suffocate . "
" The effect of an FAE explosion within confined spaces is immense , " said a CIA study of the weapons .
" Those near the ignition point are obliterated .
Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal , and thus invisible injuries , including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs , severe concussions , ruptured lungs and internal organs , and possibly blindness . "
British defense officials told the UK Guardian that British bombs were " different . "
" They are optimized to create blast [ rather than heat ] " , one said , speaking on the standard condition of anonymity in Britain .
The official added that it would be misleading to call them " thermobaric . "
Officials told the Guardian the new weapon was classified as a soldier launched " light anti-structure munition " and that the bombs would be more effective because " even when they hit the damage is limited to a confined area . "
" The continuing issue of civilian casualties in Afghanistan has enormous importance in the battle for hearts and minds , " said Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell in the article .
" If these weapons contribute to the deaths of civilians then a primary purpose of the British deployment is going to be made yet more difficult . "
According to Campbell , the deployment of the weapons was not announced to Parliament .

いま騒がれているクチコミはただのブームにすぎません。今回は、筆者が主催するWOM勉強会でも、ここ最近話題になっているブログPR広告について、クチコミブームと絡めならがまとめてみたいと思います。
クチコミブームの到 来
新聞、雑誌でもここ最近は「クチコミ」という文字が躍っています。クチコミに関する書籍もたくさん出版されています。Amazonを見てみましたが、クチコミに関する類書は10冊どころではありませんでした。筆者も何冊かは読んでいますが、とても追いつきません。まさにブームの最中というわけですが、今回はブログを対象にした記事広告サービス、「ブログPR広告」について述べたいと思います。
第1回で「Buzzはお金では買えない」と書きましたが、その後もこの手のサービスは増え続けています。筆者が先日調べただけで、16サービスもありました。海外、とりわけ米国ではPayPerPostなど主だったところでは3社くらいしかないので、日本の状況は異常なのかもしれません。この手のサービスは、新規参入系（このサービスで起業）もしくはアフィリエイト会社やSEOコンサル会社の新事業系の大きく2種類に分類されます。
筆者の記憶が正しければ、この業界のファーストエントリーは、2005年の12月にスタートした「プレスブログ」です。なぜ憶えているか、それは筆者も似たようなサービスを考えていたからです。少し話はそれますが、当時考えていたサービスの仕組みをご紹介します。
現在存在する各社のサービスは、上記項目をある程度実現しています。しかしながら、現在筆者がこれらのサービスに否定的な態度を取っているのは、大事なポイントを外しているからです。それは「企業とブロガーの良好な関係構築を手助けする」という本質部分がほとんど消えてしまっていることに尽きます。
筆者のサービス案と、現状のサービスにおいて具体的に異なる点を挙げるとすれば、ほとんどのサービス事業者が、自社の抱えるブロガーリストに対して、メール（リリース）配信サービスを提供しているのに対して、筆者が考えたのは第三者機関としてのサービス事業者が（全配信ではなく）興味を持ちそうなブロガーをリストアップする、抽出サービスであることです。それにより、企業とブロガー双方にとってノイズの少ない環境を実現できると考えました。ただ、現在のこの手のサービスの使われ方からすると、参加ブロガーはノイズを減らすよりは数多くのオファーを受ける方を希望しているようです。ここは筆者の読み違いでしたが、それでも品質管理の観点からは間違っていると思います。
後は最後のポイントで挙げているように、集合知の活用です。これは「悪意のある記事を書くブロガー」や「ルールを守ってくれる良心的なブロガー」などを利用企業全体でソーシャルレーティングすることで参加ブロガーの質を担保する仕組みです。同時に「担当者が誠実な企業」や「記事を書く際に強引な指定をする企業」、「教えた連絡先にメールマガジンなどを許可なく送りつけてくる企業」などをブロガー同士でソーシャルレーティングすることにより、不誠実なサービス利用企業（広告主企業）を排除する仕組みも用意して、双方向の評価システムを提供したいと思っていました。今のところ、このような評価システムを採用したサービスはないようです。
企業がブロガーと付き合うことは良いことだと思います。ただそのバランスは非常に難しくて、企業がコントロールしようとしてはいけないし、かといってブロガーも不遜な態度を取るべきではありません。その中間で調整をすべきで、サービス事業者がどこまでこのことを理解して運営しているのかは多いに疑問です（きちんと節度を持って運営しているサービスもあると信じています）。
回答率は67%、3分の2の企業から回答を得た
そこで筆者は今年１月に各サービス事業者に対して公開質問状を送りました。この質問と事業者の対応について説明しましょう。
The Pirate Bay together with the ACFI have worked out a plan to buy the micronation of Sealand .
Future citizens of this country can look forward to high speed Internet and the absence of copyright laws .
Sealand and its hosting company HavenCo have no regulations concerning copyright , patents , libel , restrictions on political speech , non-disclosure agreements , cryptography , restrictions on maintaining customer records , tax or mandatory licensing , DMCA , music sharing services , or other issues ; child pornography is the only content explicitly prohibited .
On buysealand.com we read , “ With the help of all the kopimists on Internets , we want to buy Sealand .
Donate money and you will become a citizen and nobleman .
It should be a great place for everybody , with high - speed Internets access , no copyright laws and vip accounts to The Pirate Bay . ”
Worth a donation !
If they do n’t raise enough money to buy Sealand they will try to buy another small island , and claim it as their own country .
Earlier this year , The Pirate Bay supported ACFI ’s war against Ladonia , a micronation located in the south of Sweden .
肉食の猫ですが、日本では魚というイメージが強くあります。
日本の地理的な面と文化の影響でしょう。
最近では、肉食の猫には肉ということで、穀物も含まない肉メインのキャットフードが増えつつあります。
そのメリット、デメリットを見てみましょう。
肉メインのキャットフードのメリットは、猫の好む動物性タンパク質ですから、食いつきが良いことです。
身体を作り、エネルギーにもなるタンパク質は魚よりも多く含まれています。
最も多く使われるチキンは健康に欠かせないビタミンやリンなどのほか、免疫力を高めるセレンも含んでいます。
アレルギー性の低さから療養食にも使われるターキーは、高タンパク低脂肪で、コレステロールも少なく、セレンや鉄分、亜鉛などをチキンよりも多く含んでいます。
ヘルシーな食材とされているラム肉は、低カロリー低コレステロールの食材で、人の脂肪燃焼効果で知られるカルニチンを含み、代謝を促進します。
必須アミノ酸や鉄分、ビタミンなども含んでおり、皮膚や被毛の健康にもいいものです。
デメリットは、猫の健康維持に欠かせない必須アミノ酸が少ないということです。
猫の体内では生成できませんので、食物から摂取しなければならない栄養分です。
細胞を正常に保ち、肝臓の働きを助けるタウリンやアンモニアの毒性を解毒し腎機能を支えるアルギニンなどが不足します。
キャットフードに添加物として補う必要がありまっす。
また、猫は独特の機能を持った腎臓のため、腎炎などの腎臓の病気にもかかりやすいものです。
その際には、タンパク質を控える必要がありますので、キャットフード自体を変える必要もあります。
肉をメインにしたキャットフードは、価格がかなり高くなります。
ウェットフードは高いといわれますが、肉メインのフードは、それ以上に高いため、経済的な負担は大きくなります。
肉食の猫ですが、肉メインのキャットフードには一長一短あり、完全に肉メインのフードにするよりも、他のタイプのキャットフードも併用する方がいいでしょう。
それぞれのメリットを活かした食事が愛猫の健康ためになります。
こちらではドライキャットフードの人気商品が紹介されています。
また、キャットフードの口コミサイトもすごく参考になりますので、併せてご覧ください。
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
The logo failed the Harding FPA test
Launch footage for the London 2012 logo sparked seizures , but how is television checked for footage that could harm people with epilepsy ?
For the organisers of the 2012 Olympics vilification over its logo has taken a turn for the worse with reports that people with epilepsy suffered seizures as a result of watching an animation in the launch video .
One section , featuring a diver causing ripples in a pool , has led to 18 people reporting ill effects .
It is believed to be the biggest episode of triggering of photosensitive epilepsy in British broadcasting history .
THE ANSWER
A machine can check it for various patterns
Episodes like this are now rare in the UK because of a gadget called the Harding Flash and Pattern Analyser , used by broadcasters and advertising agencies to avoid triggering seizures .
Only 5 % of people with epilepsy suffer from photosensitivity , but this still amounts to 23,000 people in the UK , Epilepsy Action says .
For them flashes , strobing and flickers , typically at rates of 16 to 25 times a second but as low as three and as high as 60 , are a danger .
Two incidents in the 1990s intensified research into the way television triggers photosensitive epilepsy .
A Pot Noodle advert in 1993 sparked three reports of seizures and prompted concern and a ban on the advert .
But nothing in Britain has come near the episode sparked by a Pokemon cartoon in Japan in 1997 when more than 600 children were admitted to hospital after suffering epileptic seizures .
Three - quarters of those had never suffered from symptoms of epilepsy before .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
Based on research by British expert Professor Graham Harding , Cambridge Research Systems released the Harding FPA in 2001 .
Before the machine , work was done by hand to analyse pieces of contentious video , frame by frame .
Don Jackson , of CRS , explains that the £ 12,000 analyser is looking for phenomena that break Ofcom guidelines .
" The machine is looking for changes in luminance , red flashes , red is a particularly difficult colour , a known trigger for epileptic seizures .
It looks for stationary patterns . "
The Ofcom guidelines say :
A potentially harmful flash occurs when there is a pair of opposing changes in luminance ( ie an increase in luminance followed by a decrease , or a decrease followed by an increase ) of 20 candelas per square metre ( cd. m - 2 ) or more .
This applies only when the screen luminance of the darker image is below 160 cd.m - 2 .
Irrespective of luminance , a transition to or from a saturated red is also potentially harmful .
There are regulations over how much screen area a flash can use , how many flashes can be in a sequence ( three a second ) and what patterns and particularly stripes can be displayed .
But Mr Jackson insists : " Nothing can guarantee to stop all seizures . "
The guidelines are not absolute rules and material that presents a low risk , such a repeated flash photography , is often broadcast with a warning .
Advertising agencies regularly produce video that needs to be checked by an analyser , with many big agencies having access to a machine or using the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre .
" Adverts are a major problem as they are trying to attract attention .
One way is to make the material very active .
Sixty per cent of photosensitive epileptics have their first seizure while watching television . "
Mr Jackson thinks the " secrecy " of the logo project may have led to the need for analysis of the risk being forgotten .
But running it through an analyser and hearing " computer says no " would have saved a lot of pain and anguish .
Hacker attacks target Windows NT computers
Microsoft downplays connection to Gates ' testimony
March 4 , 1998
Web posted at : 9:31 p.m. EST ( 0231 GMT )
SEATTLE ( CNN ) --
Hacker attacks caused thousands of computers that use a type of Microsoft operating system to crash this week , and the company is offering its customers a " patch " to prevent further such incursions .
Among those victimized by the attacks were NASA , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , the U.S. Navy and the University of California at Berkeley .
There were no reports that any data was lost or stolen .
The attacks began Monday night , targeted at computers with Internet access that use Windows NT , a popular operating system for large computers and networks .
They continued Tuesday and Wednesday .
On Tuesday , Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates appeared before a congressional committee to defend his company against charges that it has created an unfair monopoly in the software industry .
Company officials downplayed any possible connection between the attack and Gates ' testimony .
" All the major operating systems are attacked from time to time over the course of the year , " said Ed Muth , Microsoft 's security manager .
The hackers apparently preyed on the computer systems by sending a barrage of invalid data to them via the Internet .
The computers then devoted more and more of their memory and processing power to the invalid data until they crashed , said Craig Huckabee , research associate at the University of Wisconsin 's computer lab , where more than 160 computers were hit .
" It seems to be a prank sort of thing , " he said .
" It could be just to draw attention to Windows NT or some of the failures in Microsoft products .
I do n't know . "
Users of the computers were confronted with the so - called " blue screen of death , " which appears with an error message when Windows crashes .
The only solution was to restart the computer .
Individual users -- those not hooked up to a network -- were probably immune from the attack because they were insulated by their Internet service provider , Muth said .
He also said the attack only affected computers directly connected to the Internet .
" All of the systems that have more sensitive data are typically insulated form the Internet by proxy servers or firewalls , " he said .
" It would be very bad data processing practice not to do that . "
To fight any future similar attacks , Microsoft is urging its customers to download a software " patch " that would prevent computers from reacting to the flawed data .
That patch has been available since January .

Congressman inquires if it 's legal to use spy satellites on Americans Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday August 22 , 2007
Print This Email This A Democratic congressman is seeking answers after revelations that the US plans to use spy satellites against American citizens .
Rep. Ed Markey ( D - MA ) , who chairs a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee , has written Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to ask a series of detailed questions about the new spying initiative .
The congressman 's letter , which was first reported by Secrecy News , outlines a string of inquiries about the legality of the domestic spying program and seeks assurances that American civil rights will be protected once the program becomes operational .
" Recent media reports of an unprecedented expansion of access to imagery from United States satellites for domestic surveillance purposes raise significant questions about the scope of this new program , its legal basis ... the privacy safeguards in place to prevent abuse and related issues , " the letter begins .
Markey goes on to ask why current spy satellite protocols , which according to press reports grant U.S security officials access to satellite images on a case - by - case basis , are inadequate .
" How many of these requests were denied , if any ? " he asks .
" How does the [ Department of Homeland Security ] plan to ensure Americans ' privacy and civil rights are protected once this new program becomes operational ? " the congressman continues later in the letter , requesting a copy of materials that explain what " policies and procedures are currently used to guide the use and dissemination of information obtained through the use of spy satellites . "
Eyeing the legality of the proposed spy plan , Congressman Markey inquires as to what " memoranda , opinions or analyses have been prepared " to evaluate the new program , and asks specifically if the spying would violate the Posse Comitatus Act , which regulates the use of the U.S. military for non-military purposes .
" If reviews of the program uncover improper usage of the program in a manner that undermines Americans ' privacy and civil liberties , " Markey asks , " will the Department convey such information to the Congress and the public ?
If not , why not ? "
A copy of the Aug. 16 letter , which requests a response from the Department of Homeland Security no later than Sept. 7 , can be found at this PDF link .
We ’ve been following the saga of MindFreedom and the attempts to make court documents associated with a Zyprexa lawsuit public .
Last week , a website was successful in publishing all of the Zyprexa documents online in PDF format .
The documents are hefty in number ( there were 360 in total ! ) and would take someone a few days to review in detail and in - depth .
Furious Seasons has published about a third of the Zyprexa documents on their website now .
After reviewing some of the documents , it appears they contain more than a few zingers in there that I can understand why a company would n’t want made public .
The marketing of a pharmaceutical medication is often not pretty and often has little to do with the research and science behind the medication .
Defending that medication against an increase of serious negative side effects ( including death ) is messier still , as these memos and communications show .

Images of World War II How the Camera Became a Weapon
Never before in history was photography such an integral part of the military machine as it was during World War II .
Many of the photos in SPIEGEL's new photo book " Images of World War II , " were only possible because German soldiers hid them from their Nazi censors .
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents an exclusive selection .
The term " cluster " is actually not very well defined and could mean different things to different people .
According to Webopedia , cluster refers to a group of disk sectors .
Most Windows users are probably familiar with lost clusters -- something that can be rectified by running the defrag utility .
However , at a more advanced level in the computer industry , cluster usually refers to a group of computers connected together so that more computer power , e.g. , more MIPS ( millions instruction per second ) , can be achieved or higher availability ( HA ) can be obtained .
Beowulf , Super Computer for the " Poor " Approach Most super computers in the world are built on the concept of parallel processing -- high - speed computer power is achieved by pulling the power from each individual computer .
Made by IBM , " Deep Blue " , the super computer that played chess with the world champion Garry Kasprov , was a computer cluster that consisted of several hundreds of RS6000s .
In fact , many big time Hollywood movie animation companies , such as Pixar , Industrial Light and Magic , use computer clusters extensively for rendering ( a process to translate all the information such as color , movement , physical properties , etc. , into a single frame of picture ) .
In the past , a super computer was an expensive deluxe item that only few universities or research centers could afford .
Started at NASA , Beowulf is a project of building clusters with " off - the - shelf " hardware ( e.g. , Pentium PCs ) running Linux at a very low cost .
In the last several years , many universities world - wide have set up Beowulf clusters for the purpose of scientific research or simply for exploration of the frontier of super computer building .
High Availability ( HA ) Cluster Clusters in this category use various technologies to gain an extra level of reliability for a service .
Companies such as Red Hat , TurboLinux and PolyServe have cluster products that would allow a group of computers to monitor each other ; when a master server ( e.g. , a web server ) goes down , a secondary server will take over the services , similar to " disk mirroring " among servers .
Simple Theory Because I do not have access to more than one real ( or public ) IP address , I set up my two - node cluster in a private network environment with some Linux servers and some Win9x workstations .
If you have access to three or more real / public IP addresses , you can certainly set up the Linux cluster with real IP addresses .
In the above network diagram ( fig1.gif ) , the Linux router is the gateway to the Internet , and it consists of two IP addresses .
The real IP , 24.32.114.35 , is attached to a network card ( eth1 ) in the Linux router and should be connected to either an ADSL modem or a cable modem for internet access .
The two - node Linux router consists of node1 ( 192.168.1.2 ) and node2 ( 192.168.1.3 ) .
Depending on your setup , either node1 or node2 can be your primary server , and the other will be your backup server .
In this example , I will choose node1 as my primary and node2 as my backup .
Once the cluster is set , with IP aliasing ( read IP aliasing from the Linux Mini HOWTO for more detail ) , the primary server will be running with an extra IP address ( 192.168.1.4 ) .
As long as the primary server is up and running , services ( e.g. , DHCP , DNS , HTTP , FTP , etc. ) on node1 can be accessed by either 192.168.1.2 or 192.168.1.4 .
In fact , IP aliasing is the key concept for setting up this two - node Linux cluster .
When node1 ( the primary server ) goes down , node2 will be take over all services from node1 by starting the same IP alias ( 192.168.1.4 ) and all subsequent services .
In fact , some services can co-exist between node1 and node2 ( e.g. , FTP , HTTP , Samba , etc. ) , however , a service such as DCHP can have only one single running copy on the same physical segment .
Likewise , we can never have two identical IP addresses running on two different nodes in the same network .
In fact , the underlining principle of a two - node , high - availability cluster is quite simple , and people with some basic shell programming techniques could probably write a shell script to build the cluster .
We can set up an infinite loop within which the backup server ( node2 ) simply keeps pinging the primary server , if the result is unsuccessful , and then start the floating IP ( 192.168.1.4 ) as well as the necessary dæmons ( programs running at the background ) .
A Two - Node Linux Cluster HOWTO with " Heartbeat " You need two Pentium class PCs with a minimum specification of a 100MHz CPU , 32MB RAM , one NIC ( network interface card ) , 1G hard drive .
The two PCs need not be identical .
In my experiment , I used an AMD K6 350M Hz and a Pentium 200 MMX .
I chose the AMD as my primary server as it can complete a reboot ( you need to do a few reboots for testing ) faster than the Pentium 200 .
With the great support of CFSL ( Computers for Schools and Libraries ) in Winnipeg , I got some 4GB SCSI hard drives as well as some Adaptec 2940 PCI SCSI controllers .
The old and almost obsolete equipment is in good working condition and is perfect for this experiment .
node1 AMD K6 350MHz cpu
4G SCSI hard drive ( you certainly can use IDE hard drive )
128MB RAM
1.44 Floppy drive
24x CD - ROM ( not needed after installation )
3COM 905 NIC node2 Pentium 200 MMX
4G SCSI hard drive
96MB RAM
1.44 Floppy
24x CD-ROM
3COM 905 NIC
The Necessary Software Both node1 and node2 must have Linux installed .
I chose Red Hat and installed Red Hat 7.2 on node1 and Red Hat 6.2 on node2 ( I simply wanted to find out if we could build a cluster with different versions of Linux installed on different nodes ) .
Make sure you have installed all dæmons that you want to support .
Here is my installation detail : Hard disk partitions : 128MB for swap and the rest mounted for " / " ( so that you do n't need to worry about whether there is too much or not enough for a certain subdirectory ) .
Installed Packages : Apache
FTP
Samba
DNS
dhcpd ( server )
Squid
Heartbeat Heartbeat is a part of Ultra Monkey ( The Linux HA Project ) , and the RPM can be downloaded from www.UltraMonkey.org.
The download is small and RPM installation is smooth and simple .
However , the document or HOWTO for configuration is hard to find and confusing .
In fact , that is the reason I decided to write this HOWTO ; so that hopefully you can get your cluster setup with less problems .
Setting Up the Primary Server ( node1 ) and the Backup Server ( node2 )
It is not the purpose of this article to show you how to install Red Hat ; a lot of excellent documentation can be found at either www.linuxdoc.org or www.redhat.com.
I will simply include some of the most important configuration files for your reference : /etc/hosts 127.0.0.1 localhost 192.168.1.1 router 192.168.1.2 node1 192.168.1.3 node2
This file should be the same on both node1 and node2 ; you may add any other nodes as you see fit .
Check HOSTNAME ( cat /etc/ HOSTNAME ) and make sure it returns either node1 or node2 .
If not , you can use this command ( uname -n > /etc/HOSTNAME ) to fix the hostname problem .
ifconfig for node1 eth0 Link encap : Ethernet HWaddr 00:60:97:9C:52:28 inet addr:192.168.1.2 Bcast : 192.168.1.255 Mask :255.255.255.0 UP

Install the Heartbeat RPM
If you are using Internet Explorer on Windows , you might have problems accessing FTP ( Netscape works much better ) .
I suggest you either use a command - line FTP or an FTP Windows / X Window System client ( e.g. , wu_ftp ) to access the FTP site of Ultra Monkey ( ftp.UltraMonkey.org ) .
Once you log in to the FTP server of Ultra Monkey , go to pub , then UltraMonkey and then the latest version 1.0.2 ( not the beta ) .
The only package is heartbeat - 0.4.9-1.um.1.i386.rpm ; save heartbeat - 0.4.9-1.um.1.i386.rpm on your Linux box , log in as root and install it with rpm -ivh heartbeat - 0.4.9-1.um.1.i386.rpm
Null Modem Cable , Crossover Cable , Second NIC
According to the accompanying documentation , you need to install a second NIC on both nodes and connect them with a cross overcable .
Besides the second NIC , a null modem cable connecting the serial ( com ) ports of each node is mandatory ( according to the documentation ) .
I followed the instructions in the documentation and installed everything .
However , as I did more tests on the cluster , I found that the null modem cable , crossover cable and the second NIC are optional ; they are nice to have but definitely not mandatory .
Configuring Heartbeat is the most important part of the whole installation and must be set up correctly to get your cluster working .
Moreover , it should be identical on both nodes .
There are three configuration files , all stored under / etc / ha.d : ha.cf , haresource and aythkeys .
My /etc/ha.d/ha.cf debugfile /var/log/ha-debug # #
File to write other messages to # logfile / var / log / ha - log # # Facility to use for syslog ( ) / logger # logfacility local0 # # keepalive : how many seconds between heartbeats # keepalive 2 # # deadtime : seconds - to - declare - host - dead # deadtime 10 udpport 694 # #
What interfaces to heartbeat over ?
# udp eth0 # node at m1 node cluster1 # # ------> end of ha.cf
Whatever is not shown above , you can simply leave as it was ( all commented out by the # ) .
The last three options are most important : udp eth0 # node at m1 node cluster1
Unless you have a cross cable , you should use your eth0 ( your only NIC ) for udp ; the two nodes at the end of the above files must be the same as returned by uname -n from each node .
My /etc/ha.d/haresources atm1 IPaddr ::192.168.1.4 httpd smb dhcpd
This is the only line you need ; in the above example , I included httpd , smb and dhcpd .
You may add as many dæmons as you want , provided they have the exact same spelling as those dæmons under /etc/rc.d/init.d My /etc/ha.d/authkeys
You do n't need to add anything to this file , but you have to issue the command chmod 600 /etc/ ha.d/ authkeys
Start the Heartbeat Daemon
You may start the dæmon with service heartbeat start or /etc/rc.d/init.d/heartbeat start
Once heartbeat is started on both nodes , you will find that the ifconfig from the primary server will return something like : node1 ifconfig for node1 eth0 Link encap : Ethernet HWaddr 00:60:97:9C:52:28 inet addr:192.168.1.2 Bcast : 192.168.1.255 Mask :255.255.255.0 UP

When you see the line eth0:0 , heartbeat is working , and you can try to access the server by using http://192.168.1.4 and check the log files / var / log / ha - log .
Also , check the log file on node2 ( 192.168.1.3 ) and try ps - A | grep dhcpd and you should find no running dhcpd on node2 .
Now , the real HA test .
Reboot , and then shut down the primary server ( node1 : 192.168.1.2 ) .
Do n't just power down the server ; make sure you issue reboot or press CTL - ALT - DEL and wait until everything is shut down properly before you turn off your PC .
Within ten seconds , go to node2 and try ifconfig .
If you can get the IP aliasing eth0:0 , you are in business and have a working HA two - node cluster .
eth0 Link encap : Ethernet HWaddr 00:60:08:26:B2:A4 inet addr:192.168.1.2 Bcast : 192.168.1.255 Mask :255.255.255.0 UP

You can try ps - A | grep dhcpd or you can try to release and renew the IP info on your Win9x workstation , and you should see the new address for the dhcpd server .
The retrial of William Hurwitz ( the subject of my Findings column ) began Monday looking like a rerun of the first trial as the prosecutor spouted familiar horror stories and waved the same red flags .
But this is already looking like a tougher case for the prosecution .
Jonathan Fahey , one of the prosecutors in federal court in Alexandria , Va. , told the jurors in his opening statement that Dr. Hurwitz was a drug trafficker — part of a drug - trafficking conspiracy , in fact — because he prescribed large quantities of OxyContin and other pills while ignoring clear “ red flags ” that his patients were misusing and reselling the pills .
The prosecutor said that Dr. Hurwitiz ’s prescribing was “ without a legitimate medical purpose ” and “ in its wake it left destruction , devastation and death . ”
Those were the arguments that persuaded jurors to convict Dr. Hurwitz of drug trafficking charges in 2004 .
The jury foreman , Ralph Craft , told the Washington Post after the trial that the prescribed dosages “ went beyond the bounds of reason ” and would never have been prescribed by a “ legitimate doctor . ”
Dr. Hurwitz ’s defense — that he genuinely believed his patients needed the medicine and did n’t realize he was being duped by drug addicts and dealers — did n’t work , in no small part because the judge told the jury it did n’t matter if he had acted in “ good faith . ”
The verdict vindicated the Drug Enfrocement Administration ’s strategy of using the power of drug - trafficking laws against doctors prescribing opioids even when there was no evidence ( as in Dr. Hurwitz ’s case ) that they were getting a cut of the illegal sales .
Karen Tandy , the D.E.A. administrator , praised the 25 - year sentence imposed on Dr. Hurwitz by saying he “ was no different from a cocaine or heroin dealer peddling poison on the street corner . ”
Since then , though , there have been a couple of different opinions about the intepretation of federal drug law .
Last year the Supreme Court ruled that it applies to doctors only when they ’re guilty of “ drug dealing and trafficking as conventionally understood . ”
And an appeals court ordered a retrial for Dr. Hurwitz because the jury should have considered whether he acted in “ good faith . ”
So for this trial Dr. Hurwitz has a new argument — and a new defense team eager to use it as a mantra .
He ’s being represented by two experienced lawyers who are working pro bono : Richard Sauber , of Fried , Frank , Harris , Shriver & Jacobson , and Larry Robbins , of Robbins , Russell , Englert , Orseck & Untereiner .
Mr. Sauber used his opening statement to tell the jury over and over that the case boiled down to one question : Was Dr. Hurwitz a doctor or a drug dealer ?
Calling him a “ passionate advocate for patients who had been unfairly treated , ” Mr. Sauber talked about Dr. Hurwitz ’s work in the Peace Corps and in Veterans Administration hospitals , and his belief that too many patients were in pain because doctors were afraid to give them proper dosages of opioids .
Mr. Sauber also promised to do something that the defense did n’t effectively do in the first trial : use expert testimony to show that the dosages prescribed by Dr. Hurwitz were within the bounds of legitimate medicine .
The first day of the trial ended with the testimony of Cynthia Denise Horn , a former patient of Dr. Hurwitz , who was a prosecution witness .
She said she had repeatedly faked pain in order to get him to prescribe OxyContin pills , which she used herself and also sold .
When it was the defense ’s turn to question her , Mr. Robbins resumed the doctor - or - drug - dealer mantra .
As he went through her medical records , noting the regular examinations by Dr. Hurwitz and the questionnaires he had made her fill out about her pain , he repeatedly asked her to compare Dr. Hurwitz with the street dealers who had supplied her with OxyContin .
“ Did any of the people who sold you drugs and medication ever ask you about your pain ? ” Mr. Robbins inquired .
The prosecution objected , but the judge , Leonie Brinkema , directed Ms. Horn to answer .
“ No , ” she said .
That was n’t surprising , of course , but it was a good moment for the defense .
It reminded the jury that there is at least some difference between a street - corner dealer and a doctor .

Birds changed diet after humans killed shrimp eaters .
Old eggs show Adélie penguins switched from fish to shrimp 200 years ago .
S. Emslie
Ancient eggshell fragments show that Adélie penguins living in Antarctica switched from eating fish to krill around the time that humans began hunting seals and whales .
The finding suggests that when humans removed krill - eating predators the penguins exploited the resulting shrimp surplus .
Steven Emslie of the University of North Carolina in Wilmington , and William Patterson of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon , analysed more than 220 fossil eggshell pieces ranging from 100 to 38,000 years old , and compared them with samples from modern nests .
By comparing the proportion of certain forms of carbon and nitrogen in the shells with the proportions found in fish and krill , the researchers could tell what the birds had been eating .
Emslie expected to find changes in diet matching climate change .
Instead , the penguin menu remained biased towards fish until about 200 years ago , when the birds switched to krill .
Recent global warming and the rise in krill fisheries has reduced krill stocks and could be contributing to the decline in Adélie penguin populations on the Antarctic Peninsula , says Emslie .
The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1 .
Dietary switch
“ This implies a huge dietary response . ” Keith Hobson , Canadian Wildlife Service , Saskatchewan .
From 1793 to 1807 , an estimated 3.2 million seals were taken from the Southern Ocean .
The resulting crash in the seal population — including the Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella , which fed primarily on krill — caused the industry to collapse .
Whaling took off in the 1800s and continued until the mid-twentieth century , eventually depleting baleen whale populations by more than 90 % .
It 's estimated that the combined harvest of seals and whales resulted in more than 150 million tonnes of extra krill each year .
Krill is an attractive food for penguins because it is high in protein and tends to travel in swarms .
" The birds can capture lots of high - energy prey in a short time , " says Emslie .
" This implies a huge ecological dietary response by the penguins in relation to some change in their environment , " says Keith Hobson of the Canadian Wildlife Service in Saskatchewan .
But the reasons behind this switch are less obvious , he says .
" Abundance of a secondary food item does not necessarily explain this unless it was accompanied by a reduction in fish , " says Hobson .
" Why does it matter that krill became more abundant to a predator that previously happily made eggs from fish ? "

The switch might be explained by an increase in fishing , says David Ainley of the California ecological consulting firm H. T. Harvey & Associates .
" Not only were whales and seals removed , " he says , " there was a massive removal of fish from the Scotia Sea and western Antarctic Peninsula region at the same time . "
Many of these fish ate krill , so their removal would have further boosted krill supplies .
Their dietary flexibility demonstrates the penguins ' ability to adjust to large ecological changes , but that does n't mean they 'll survive the changes to come , says Hobson .
" I remain a pessimist when it comes to how they may now cope with the onslaught of climate change , " he says .

CIA said to step up operations against Iran as hawks seek to tie Iraq bombs to Tehran

 They still need a trigger ,  former official says
In an effort to build congressional and Pentagon support for military options against Iran , the Bush administration has shifted from its earlier strategy of building a case based on an alleged Iranian nuclear weapons program to one invoking improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) purportedly manufactured in Iran that are killing US soldiers in Iraq .
According to officials  including two former Central Intelligence Agency case officers with experience in the Middle East  the administration believes that by focusing on the alleged ties between IEDs and Iran , they can link the Iranian government directly to attacks on US forces in Iraq .
The US military has provided credible evidence that the specialized IEDs known as explosively formed penetrators ( EFPs ) , which have been killing US troops in Iraq , appear to have been manufactured in Iran .
Intelligence and military officials caution , however , that there is nothing tying the weapons directly to the Iranian government , nor is there a direct evidentiary chain of custody linking the IEDs to Iran .
 There is clear evidence that someone in Iran is manufacturing the EFPs ,  said a source currently working with military and intelligence joint operations in the Middle East , who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the topic .
 They have a distinctive signature .
These devices are being used against US troops , Sunnis , and even some Shi'as . 
 This is viewed by some in the Bush Administration as sufficient justification for taking military action against Iran ,  the source concluded .
Nearly half of all fatalities and serious injuries among US forces in Iraq are caused by IED attacks , including 43 % of US casualties in Iraq this month .
CIA reported to step up operations
A senior intelligence official told RAW STORY Tuesday that the CIA had stepped up operations in the region , shifting their Iran focus to other approaches in preference to the black propaganda that Raw Story has already reported on . 
The source would not elaborate on what these other approaches are .
A recent Washington Post report indicated that the US plans to label Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist group , the first such designation for a foreign nation 's military .
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano would neither confirm nor deny that other operations were taking place .
 The CIA does not , as a matter of course , comment on allegations involving clandestine operations , despite the large amount of misinformation that circulates publicly on the subject , " responded Gimigliano in a late Thursday email .
RAW STORY revealed in June that , according to sources , Iran was being targeted by CIA activities promoting a pro-democracy  message and that the agency was supporting overt pro-democracy  groups .
Two former CIA case officers interviewed said that the administration has zeroed in on the EFPs as proof positive of Iran 's involvement in Iraq , despite lacking any direct trail to Tehran .
One former CIA case officer who served in the Middle East even suggested that politically framing the Iranians for its own failures in Iraq would allow the Bush administration to avoid accountability , as well as providing a casus belli for an attack .
The Bush Administration can say its [ the Iranians ' ] fault we are losing the war in Iraq and that would be a convenient out for their failed policy ,  the officer said Monday .
The Iranians have declared war against the US by sabotaging the war on terror is how they might sell it .
I would not be surprised to next hear of Al Qaeda - Iranian connections because these people do n't know the difference between a Sunni and a Shi'a . 
Some continue to press for ' surgical strikes '
Another former CIA case officer with experience in the Middle East said that some in the administration have continued to make a case for limited or surgical strikes inside Iran , and that preparations are well underway for such an operation to occur before next years presidential election .
 If you were to report that a US surgical strike against key targets in Iran were to happen sooner rather than later , you would not be wrong ,  said this source , who wished to remain unnamed due to the sensitivity of the topic .
None of the sources interviewed for this article referenced President George W. Bush or alluded to the end of the Bush presidency as the deadline for an Iranian offensive .
Each , instead , mentioned either the Office of Vice President Dick Cheney or Cheney himself .
Intelligence expert Steven Aftergood , Research Director for the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists , said he doesnt believe a surgical strike would be wise .
 A surgical strike simply refers to a precisely targeted attack on a particular installation , conducted so as to minimize collateral damage .
Israel 's 1981 attack on Iraq 's Osirak reactor would be an example ,  Aftergood remarked .
 I do n't believe there is a consensus that a surgical strike could be used effectively to disable Iran 's nuclear program , or that it would be wise to attempt such a strike . 
Iranian 's Revolutionary Guard
In addition to shifting from a strategy that uses an alleged immediate threat posed by a nuclear - armed Iran to one featuring IEDs as the tool by which Iran is allegedly trying to sabotage the efforts of US forces in Iraq , the administration has also moved toward directly implicating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  sometimes referred to as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard  by labeling the group a " specially designated global terrorist " organizations .
According to an August 15 , Washington Post article , the Guard will be designated a global terrorist organization under Executive Order 13224 , which was issued shortly after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 to target and block funding to terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda .
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard is the largest branch of Iran 's military , boasting well over 100,000 elite active duty soldiers and roughly 300,000 reservists .
The designation of the Guard as a " specially designated global terrorist would be the first time a foreign military has been declared a terrorist organization .
Some officials speculate that the administration is trying to provoke the Iranians into an incident that will justify an airstrike in response , suggesting that the combined effect of circumstantial evidence tying Iran to the IEDs and an event or incident involving the Iranian Revolutionary Guard might just be enough to justify military action against Iran .
Experts and officials in the US military and intelligence communities read the administration 's move to declare the Guard a terrorist organization as an indication that something ominous is looming over the horizon .
One of the former CIA case officers interviewed for this article explained that the Office of the Vice President is making this drastic move in order to lay the groundwork for a possible incident .
 They still need a trigger and I would not be surprised if we will see some event in Iraq which implicates the Iranians ,  said this source .
 They need a pretext . 
The motivations for an Iran strike were laid out as far back as 1992 .
In classified defense planning guidance  written for then - Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney by then - Pentagon staffers I. Lewis  Scooter  Libby , Paul Wolfowitz , and current UN Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad 
Cheney 's aides called for the United States to assume the position of lone superpower and act preemptively to prevent the emergence of even regional competitors .
The draft document was leaked at the time to the New York Times and the Washington Post and caused an uproar among Democrats and many in George H. W. Bush 's Administration .
Previous attempts at fixing the facts  around the policy of a military strike against Iran have failed on several occasions , including ramped up allegations of an Iranian WMD program being close to completion that culminated in a near - offensive in March of 2006 and attempts at provocation by positioning US aircraft carriers in the region during the summer of 2006 .

" The young woman was trying to buy tampons , " Mrs. Crockett said , barely able to hold back tears .
" I snatched that girl by the hair and pulled her outside ... there were children present !
Can you imagine how they'd be damaged by hearing such evil ideas ? "
“ I explained to this young lady that we do not carry such phallic devices as tampons and when attending to her monthly curse , " Mrs. Martin said , adding that " Satan himself controls the manufacturing of those things . "
The young woman then began to verbally abuse her , she said .
" A Godly woman is only to use a Maxi - Pad , " Mrs. Crockett stated .
" Why , they even have them with little angel wings now !
I handed her a box and told her unless she wanted my handprint across her face she was never to utter that evil T word again ! ”
The as yet unidentified woman then fled the store in humiliation .
Landover Security sketch artists are preparing a likeness to aid in identifying the young woman .
Her salvation status is unknown , but based on this event , it is likely she is Hellbound .
" Toxic Shock Syndrome is God 's way of punishing unsaved harlots who choose Satan ’s cotton fingers over a Godly pad , " Pastor Deacon Fred stated upon hearing of the event .
" These playthings of Satan are created under the guise of a ladies hygiene product to bring unsuspecting women and young girls to the fold of the Devil . "
Church members are commanded to talk to your teen - age daughters , and search their rooms if you have to .
" Souls are at stake and God is taking names , " added Pastor Wiley .
Mrs. Crockett has organized the Ladies of Landover Phone Bank to spread the word , and has called for both a letter writing protest campaign and a boycott on all stores who are found to carry these satanic sexual devices .
Manufacturers who create such vile products will also be targeted for salvation , or , failing that , closure .
Mrs. Crockett has secured six 24 - foot trucks for use in her new ministry , " Stop Satan From Pulling The Strings . "
She and the other Ladies of Landover plan a nationwide tour , going city to city , pulling what she calls " The Devil 's delight " from store shelves once clerks are distracted .
Upon the ladies ' return , Mrs. Crockett plans a large bonfire .
“ We shall pray over the flames as we watch these evil devices go back to the fiery pits of hell from whence they came , ” Mrs. Crockett said during her church news conference , adding , " these things are created by Satan for pleasure , and young women are succumbing to the Devil without even realizing it .
This is one battle Satan will NOT win ! "
Her statements drew a standing ovation from the congregation .
All church members are encouraged to join in the BBQ and bring a covered dish as we celebrate yet another Victory over Satan .
Marshmallows for roasting over the bonfire will be provided by The Ladies of Landover .
Due to the nature of this event , the roasting of hot dogs will be prohibited for obvious reasons .
On the streets of New York or Denver or San Mateo this summer , it seems the telltale cap of a water bottle is sticking out of every other satchel .
Americans are increasingly thirsty for what is billed as the healthiest , and often most expensive , water on the grocery shelf .
But this country has some of the best public water supplies in the world .
Instead of consuming four billion gallons of water a year in individual - sized bottles , we need to start thinking about what all those bottles are doing to the planet ’s health .
Here are the hard , dry facts :
Yes , drinking water is a good thing , far better than buying soft drinks , or liquid candy , as nutritionists like to call it .
And almost all municipal water in America is so good that nobody needs to import a single bottle from Italy or France or the Fiji Islands .
Meanwhile , if you choose to get your recommended eight glasses a day from bottled water , you could spend up to $ 1,400 annually .
The same amount of tap water would cost about 49 cents .
Next , there ’s the environment .
Water bottles , like other containers , are made from natural gas and petroleum .
The Earth Policy Institute in Washington has estimated that it takes about 1.5 million barrels of oil to make the water bottles Americans use each year .
That could fuel 100,000 cars a year instead .
And , only about 23 percent of those bottles are recycled , in part because water bottles are often not included in local redemption plans that accept beer and soda cans .
Add in the substantial amount of fuel used in transporting water , which is extremely heavy , and the impact on the environment is anything but refreshing .
Tap water may now be the equal of bottled water , but that could change .
The more the wealthy opt out of drinking tap water , the less political support there will be for investing in maintaining America ’s public water supply .
That would be a serious loss .
Access to cheap , clean water is basic to the nation ’s health .
Only A Fraction Of Promised Money Spent Rebuilding New Orleans Posted by wizeGurl ( 13011 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
On the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina , President Bush made yet another visit to the Mississippi Gulf Coast and New Orleans , where he told astonished residents that , as an occasional visitor to the city , he could see all kinds of improvements that they -- being merely residents who see the city every day -- could not .
And he repeated constantly the huge numbers to show that the federal government had showered the area with as much cold , hard cash as Katrina had showered it with rain .
But the people of New Orleans , who deal daily with the stalled reconstruction , the funds mired in red tape , the gutted health care system , the schools that were failing before the storm and are now only half - rebuilt , the closed day care and the public housing that has not yet reopened -- even the undamaged parts -- and the rebuilding of which has not even begun -- well , they see things differently .
And on their behalf , New Orleans City Councilwoman Shelley Midura sent the following open letter to President George Bush .
( Emphasis added . )
August 28 , 2007
Dear Mr. President :
Thank you for visiting New Orleans for the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina , the worst federal levee - failure disaster in United States history followed by the worst federal disaster response in United States history .
On the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina , President Bush made yet another visit to the Mississippi Gulf Coast and New Orleans , where he told astonished residents that , as an occasional visitor to the city , he could see all kinds of improvements that they -- being merely residents who see the city every day -- could not .
And he repeated constantly the huge numbers to show that the federal government had showered the area with as much cold , hard cash as Katrina had showered it with rain .
But the people of New Orleans , who deal daily with the stalled reconstruction , the funds mired in red tape , the gutted health care system , the schools that were failing before the storm and are now only half - rebuilt , the closed day care and the public housing that has not yet reopened -- even the undamaged parts -- and the rebuilding of which has not even begun -- well , they see things differently .
We 're also grateful for the $ 116 billion federal allocation for the Gulf Coast .
That $ 116 billion has served you well , as your spokesmen often cite it as an indicator of your dedication to our recovery .
But , it has n't served us as well - - it 's not enough , it 's been given grudgingly , and only after our elected officials have had to fight for it .
So I feel I must correct the record about you and your administration 's dedication to our recovery and implore you to take action to make things better .
Indeed , you have allocated $ 116 billion for the Gulf Coast , but that number is misleading .
According to the Brookings Institute 's most recent Katrina Index report , at least $ 75 billion of it was for immediate post - storm relief .
Thus only 35 % of the total federal dollars allocated is for actual recovery and reconstruction .
And of that recovery and reconstruction allocation , only 42 % has actually been spent .
In fact , while your administration touts " $ 116 billion " as the amount you have sent to the entire area affected by Katrina and the levee failures , the actual long term recovery dollar amount is only $ 14.6 billion .
This amount is a mere 12 % of the entire federal allocation of dollars , billions of which went to corporations such as Halliburton for immediate post - storm cleanup work , instead of to local businesses .
Contrast that to the $ 20.9 billion on infrastructure for Iraq that the Wall Street Journal reported in May 2006 that you have spent , and it's an astonishing 42 % more than you have spent on infrastructure for the post - Katrina Gulf region .
The American citizens of the Gulf region do not understand why the federal obligation to rebuilding Iraq is greater than it is for America 's Gulf coast , and more specifically for New Orleans .
New Orleans has more challenges and fewer resources than we 've ever had in my lifetime in the City of New Orleans .
Yet , other than FEMA repair reimbursements , the only direct federal assistance this city has received from you has been two community disaster loans that you are demanding be paid back even though no other city government has had to pay back a these types of loans for as long as our research can determine ( at least since the 70's ) .
These loans are being used to balance the city budget to provide basic services to citizens who need far more than the pre-Katrina basics .
Despite this obvious contradiction , your administration blames local leadership for our continued need for federal assistance .
But this argument is disingenuous , Mr. President .
There are a host of tasks that only you and your administration can accomplish for our recovery .
These are some concrete steps you can take to make good on your 2005 Jackson Square promises :
Completely fix the federally managed levees
Fully fund our expertly crafted recovery plan
Give New Orleans all that you have promised to Baghdad - schools ,
hospitals , infrastructure , security , and basic services
Forgive the community disaster loans , as authorized by the new Congress
Appoint a recovery czar who works inside the White House that reportsdaily and directly to you and whose sole job is the recovery of New Orleans and the rest of the region
Restore our coast and wetlands
Work with Congress to reform the Stafford Act
Cut the bureaucratic red tape
In turn Mr. President , the people of New Orleans are more than willing to do our part .
We have already :
Consolidated and reformed the state levee board system .
Consolidated and reformed our property assessment system .
Passed sweeping ethics reform legislation .
Created an Ethics Review Board .
Hired an Inspector General .
Submitted a parish - wide recovery plan .
Much has changed in New Orleans for the better since the storm , and more progress is coming .
Civic activism is at an all time high .
For the first time in my lifetime , there is an actual reform movement in New Orleans driven by the people .
" Best Practices " has become a City Council mantra .
We have a new Ethics Board .
Our incoming Inspector General , Robert Cerasoli , is considered one of the elite in the Inspector General world , as is our new Recovery Director Dr. Ed Blakely in that world and our Recovery School Superintendent Paul Vallas in the realm of public education .
We are attracting the cream of the crop .
Young people from around the country seeking to make a difference in their lives are moving to New Orleans to teach in public schools , provide community healthcare , build housing , work for nonprofits engaged in post - Katrina work , and , in general , do whatever they can for the recovery because they all know what I am not so sure that you know , mainly that what happens in New Orleans over the next few years says something about the very heart of America itself .
Mr. President , we are in fact doing our part locally in New Orleans despite contrary comments by your administration .
Our intense civic activity and government reform initiatives are serious indicators of our local commitment to do our part for the recovery .
But we are drowning in federal red tape .
We are being nickel and dimed to death by your Federal Emergency Management Agency .
We are resource - starved at the city level .
The mission here is not accomplished .
What we need is Presidential leadership , not just another speech filled with empty promises .
Our recovery 's success , struggle , or failure will be intimately woven into your legacy , for better or worse .
What Americans think about America is deeply affected by how this country rises to national challenges , none more significant than post - Katrina New Orleans .
Fully restoring New Orleans to its formerly unique and permanent place in American culture is this nation 's greatest domestic challenge .
Your leadership of our country through this difficult time will serve as an American character lesson for future generations .
Sincerely , Shelley Midura
New Orleans City Councilmember
District A

If you 're trying to lose weight , avoiding sugar is one of the best ways to reduce your calorie intake .
Many dieters use artificial sweeteners and artificially sweetened foods as a way to cut sugar without eliminating all things sweet .
However , not all artificial sweeteners are calorie free .
In fact , some have almost as many calories as sugar .
They 're also somewhat controversial .
Although the manufacturers '
Web sites and the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) say that artificial­ sweeteners are perfectly safe , some consumer groups and physicians disagree .
Even if you try to avoid artificial sweeteners , you may still be consuming them in products you 've never considered .
Did you know that artificial sweeteners are in your toothpaste , mouthwash , chewable vitamins and cough drops ?

E7 - a champion of the avian world
A bird has been tracked from its Southern Hemisphere summertime home in New Zealand to its breeding ground in Alaska - and back again .
The bar - tailed godwit , a female known as E7 , landed this past weekend after taking just over eight days to fly 11,500 km from Alaska to New Zealand .
Unlike seabirds , which feed and rest on long journeys , godwits just keep going .
The migrant champion was one of 13 satellite - tagged bar - tails ( Limosa lapponica baueri ) that left New Zealand at the beginning of the year .
Tag bonus
E7 set her first record on the way north , when she flew non-stop for 10,200 km ( 6,340 miles ) to Yalu Jiang in China .
She then flew a further 5,000 km ( 3,000 miles ) to the godwit breeding grounds in Alaska .
And on the way back to New Zealand , her tag still working , E7 set another record ( 7,150 miles ) .
" We were pretty impressed when she did 10,200 km on the way north , " says Massey University ecologist Phil Battley .
" And the fact that she can now do 11,500 km ... it 's just so far up from what we used to believe 10 years ago when we were thinking a five or 6,000 km flight was extremely long .
Here we 've doubled it , " adds the New Zealand coordinator of what is an international study .
For researchers , tracking the second leg of E7's journey was a bonus - her implanted satellite tag kept working well past its expected cut - off date .
" If you 're trying to confirm how far birds fly and whether they are making stop - offs , it 's only now with the technology being small enough , you can do this remotely .
Otherwise we 'd still be using educated guess work , " Dr Battley says .
And that means the researchers now know that the godwits really are the champions of avian migration .
Unlike seabirds , which feed and rest on their long journeys or swifts which feed in flight , the godwits make their long journeys without feeding or drinking .
Plump up
Next year , Dr Battley hopes to implant satellite tags into larger male godwits ( this year the males had external satellite tags attached ) to check that the male birds follow the same path as the females .
Scientists now have real data on these long distance fliers
" Some might fly down in flocks with adults but other ones will fly down without any adults involved at all which is pretty amazing , " says Dr Battley .
" They 're only two months old and here they are about to fly from Alaska to New Zealand . "
And their mum ?
" She 'll be eating lots at the moment and probably resting up ; and she 'll go back to her main routines .
Then , come about February next year or January , she 'll start moulting into her breeding plumage and getting fat again .
" Then it will all start again . "
The New Zealand godwit tracking effort is part of the broader Pacific Shorebird Migration Program , a joint initiative between the US Geological Survey and PRBO Conservation Science .
Seasoning with salt and pepper has taken on new meaning in recent years — for professional and home cooks alike .
For this we might have a former accountant in California to thank .
Traveling the world with a suitcase filled with spices and gadgets , Jing Tio is something of a spice whisperer , introducing chefs , and diners , to new flavors .
He turned Wylie Dufresne at New York ’s WD - 50 on to wild hops , which recently made their debut in a savory pudding , and the pastry chef at Joël Robuchon at the Mansion in Las Vegas now makes ice cream with the herbal coffee substitute teeccino .
Hops and teeccino : coming soon to a spice rack near you .
A second - generation Indonesian spice trader and a passionate home cook , Tio , 33 , was an accountant and property manager in Southern California until his frustration with the lack of high - end culinary equipment and ingredients led him to sell his cars — all six of them — to open Le Sanctuaire in Santa Monica .
The Barneys of cooking stores , it sells everything from Hermès porcelain to Pacojet ice - cream makers , Ferran Adrià ’s Texturas - brand agar to $ 125 cooking chopsticks .
Beach - bound Angelenos have been stumped by the boutique ’s rarefied offerings since it opened in 2003 , but chefs realized that Tio was a kindred spirit , someone who , when asked what he cooks with eucalyptus leaves , shrugs and says , “ Usually just a foam . ”
Chefs also realized that Tio ’s spices were different .
His mother supplied him with peppercorns — black , white , red , cubeb , Sichuan , long pepper , four grades of tellicherry — that were still bright and round , not the dusty , desiccated fruits you usually see .
“ Spices can last maybe two or three years , depending on how well you store them , ” Tio says in accented English .
“ But most of the spice that the consumer gets is already two , three years old . ”
So he made arrangements with Indonesian spice growers and began selling directly to chefs .
“ The spice trade is really tricky , ” Tio says with a laugh .
“ People want the money quick .
Sometimes they harvest too fast , and the black pepper ’s not dry enough , and mold starts growing .
And then they cover it — you know when you cut the battery ?
The black dust ?
You do n’t wanna know ! ”
Now Tio and his mother have a 50 - 50 partnership with farmers on Java , Sumatra and Banda islands .
Tio also uses sources in India , China and Malaysia , changing suppliers whenever quality dips .
He is already on his fourth Sichuan - pepper grower on Sumatra .
Jews Celebrate Killing of Iranian Anti-Semites Jews worldwide began celebrating Saturday night the killing of tens of thousands of Persian anti-Semites in the 4th century BCE .
Ezra HaLevi ,
Scroll of Esther Jews in Israel and throughout the world Saturday night began celebrating the thwarting of a genocidal decree in 356 BCE , which was followed by the two - day killing of tens of thousands of the Iranian anti-Semites who were poised to wipe out the Jews .
The Festival of Purim celebrates the hidden hand of G -d working through a seemingly fortuitous sequence of events that brought a Jewess named Hadassah to the Persian King ’s palace under the assumed name Esther ( meaning “ hidden ” ) and allowed her to use her position to thwart the genocidal plans of the monarch ’s Jew - hating advisor Haman .
The holiday , though sometimes erroneously treated as a children ’s festival , was considered by Jewish sages and mystics to be the holiest day of the year , surpassing Yom Kippur and the high holidays in its stature .
The Talmud says that even in Messianic times , after other holy days will no longer be marked , Purim will remain in effect .
The Megillah , or Scroll , of Esther is read Saturday evening , as well as the following day .
Jews are also obligated to send gifts of ready - to - eat food to at least one friend and to give charity to a number of poor .
A festive meal takes place during the joyous day , during which wine is imbibed , the Purim story recounted , songs are sung and the contemporary relevance of the holiday ’s lessons are expounded upon .
Though wine plays a central role in the holiday , with the sages exhorting Jews to drink until they can no longer distinguish between the hero Mordechai and the villainous Haman , organizations such as the Orthodox Union have highlighted minority rabbinical opinions that joy should be attained without alcohol , or that the inablility to distinguish be attained by going to sleep .
In cities that were walled at the time of the Megillah ’s events – notably Jerusalem - the Megillah is read on the 15th of Adar ( Sunday night / Monday ) .
In Yaffo ( Jaffa ) , Acco , Tzfat and Hevron the Megillah is read on both days due to uncertainty about the walled status in those times .
This year , several outdoor Megillah readings are taking place throughout the country .
In Tel Aviv , the Megillah was read on the corner of Rothschild and Sheinkin Street – a bastion of the city ’s Bohemian set .
In Haifa , a similar reading took place as well and Chabad and Breslev Hassidim are making the rounds ensuring that IDF soldiers in far flung bases and positions can hear the Megillah .
The IDF has put a complete closure on Palestinian Authority administered parts of Judea , Samaria and Gaza ahead of the holiday .
Police are on high alert , with 70 intelligence reports of impending terrorist attacks .
The following are a selection of Torah essays about the holiday : Yeshiva.org.il 's Purim articles Wikipedia site on Shushan today and photos of the Iranian town of Susa Megillat Esther in Hebrew and English Jacob Richman 's Purim Links { Editor 's note :
We of course realize that Iran is the modern name of Persia , and that the anti-Semites killed in the time of Purim would not identify themselves as Iranian , nonetheless , levity is a purim tradition . }

Mir Sees Eclipse from Outer Space by Roger Herzler ( photo ( c ) CNES )
08/19/1999
The Mir Space Station got an unprecidented view of the August 11 , 1999 total solar eclipse that traveled across Europe .
This is just down - right exciting , hence the posting here .
The photo was taken by spationaut Jean - Pierre Haigneré and the copyright is held by CNES .
Clear skies !
Update 09/03/1999
Its been asked what those two " objects " are in the top left corner of the image .
Some suggestions include space junk or even stars .
After some postulating and investigating by myself and other folks on the Astro List , a case has been made that they are the planets Jupiter and Saturn .
According to CNES ( the French space agency ) this photo was taken by the French spationaut on board Mir at exactly 10h13 m Universal Time .
That puts the eclipse at around 50N 05W ( latitude & longitude ) , or in the head waters of the English Channel .
When the appropriate times and locations are entered into SkyMap ( and other planetarium packages from folks on the Astro List ) both Jupiter and Saturn are right on the money for that shot .
In addition , Bill Arnett of the Astro List made this observation : " And Mir was above France 's Massif Central .
When I tell Starry Night to put me at that time and place I clearly see the English channel and , sure enough , Jupiter and Saturn in the correct orientation above the horizon and the Moon shadow . "
So , while its not conclusive ( only the photographer might know for sure ) , a good case can be made that the two objects in the frame are in fact Jupiter and Saturn , both of whom were ( and still are ) bright enough in our skies to take a good photograph of .

Dan Riehl on the Republicans and Democrats :
At the risk of being politically incorrect , is it really worth voting in an election when D stands for Dumb-ass and R stands for retarded ?
Perhaps not .
I could always do something constructive like go fishing on election day .
I ca n’t think of a time when I have been more disenchanted with America ’s political class and that is saying something , as I basically distrust them to start .
You never knew when you ’ll need to blast away zombies , so it ’s quite handy to keep one of these guns around .

I ’m surfing instead of working , so to win back some productivity , I ’ll describe my basic searching strategy !
When Google does n’t find what you want , it ’s because you are probably using an overly - general search query , or one that has been polluted by e-commerce junk information .
Argh !
To get to the real opinions on the Internet , you need to search for words that people use , as opposed to the lifeless copywriting you see in a lot of “ professional business communication . ”
The more specific you can make your search terms , the better your search results will be .
There are also nifty advanced search options at Google that can filter your results by date range , file format , and so on .
Try Model Numbers or other ID .
This sometimes helps to isolate a particular product .
Use Amazon or Epinions to narrow down which model number you ’re interested in .
However , as models are often quickly replaced , you might not have much luck finding the dirt on a specific generation of unit .
Sometimes Shelf Keeping Units ( SKUs ) are helpful –those are the numbers on the barcodes you see on retail packaging , and eCommerce sites sometimes list them in their online catalogs .
UN - search for marketing copy .
I remember looking for reviews on a particular ricecooker ( the Zojirushi NS - KCC05 ) , and the entire search result space was saturated with Amazon and Amazon.com feeder microstores : basically , the exact same information over and over again .
Use this against them !
Find a unique phrase in the copy and ignore it in the research results by adding a – in front of it .
For example , if the ad copy says something like , “ re - heats rice to the perfect serving temperature ” , do this search : zojirushi NS - KCC05 - " re- heats rice to the perfect serving temperature " .
You ’ll not see any results that contain that phrase .
Thank God .
When all that fails , it ’s time to go to the mattresses .
Try other information sources on the Web to learn more about the topic , and search on the cues that point to expert commentary .
Search eBay .
When you ca n’t find information or photos on some object , you might actually find it on eBay , which is not indexed by Google .
I spent days looking for a reference photo of a Hebrew keyboard , eventually cobbling one together out of scraps of information from programming reference articles .
Just yesterday I searched eBay and a dozen photos of the keyboards were there .
Sometimes the sellers write a great deal of personal history about the items in general .
Do n’t forget to search past auctions , and it may be worth looking at other specialized auction sites ( gunbroker.com , for example ) that cater to specialty markets .
In either case , you might find a seller who is willing to tell you want you want to know about the item .
Search Wikipedia .
Wikipedia entries do n’t often get ranked high in Google results , so go there first .
Chances are , someone ’s written something about what you ’re looking for , and some high - quality links have been already researched for you .
Search The Top Specialty Information Sites .
For nerd stuff , that means going to Slashdot .
For digital photography , that ’s Digital Photo Review .
And so on .
You ’ll probably start to get a sense who ’s on top once you ’ve visited a dozen sites , particularly smaller ones that have lists of links to other informational sites .
They are usually the same , so eventually you will see who they all point to .
Search USENET .
USENET was the primary Internet discussion system , a kind of global bulletin board system , until the World Wide Web balkanized the infosphere into millions of website - states .
Prior to the mid 1990s , USENET was our primary community - driven information database covering thousands of topical interests .
It still lives on at Google Groups .
USENET will often deliver pieces of insight you will not have found on the Web .
Search The Blogosphere .
Technorati , for example .
[ UPDATE ]
Google has added blog searching .
Try that !
Search FAQs .
One byproduct of the USENET era was the creation of Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ ) post .
Groups like comp.graphics were often inundated by newcomers to the group who asked the same questions over and over again .
Over time , the FAQ postings have become quite comprehensive .
While not all of them are actively maintained , they represent a trove of practical information on a broad range of topics .
A lot of them are archived at faqs.org .
You can do a full - text search .
Search Magazine Indexes .
Sites like FindArticles.com index articles in magazines that may not always float to the top of a Google search .
Worth a try .
Search Amazon .
Type in your search subject , and see what books pop up .
The titles alone , the people mentioned , and the commentary left by other amazon shoppers are immensely useful when mapping out a new information space .
You can then use that information to narrow down your search on Google .
Searching the Wishlists for a particular book title can also help narrow down the search field .
Find Secondary Information Sites .
There is often useful commentary on the smaller personal websites .
They do n’t rank high on Google , so use a blog indexer like Technorati and see who ’s linking to that major blog you like .
Use Google to find sites that link to two or more other good sites you ’ve found .
Are there people out there who read both Dooce and Crossroad Dispatches , and feel strongly enough to provide a link ?
That might be an interesting person to read .
Look for Color Commentary .
Sometimes you really just want to get some random guy ’s opinion .
I like to search for terms like “ really sucks ” , “ I think ” , “ I would ” , “ technically speaking ” , and other phrases that someone giving your their opinion might say .
The general principle here is to mix the topic of your search with some kind of “ biased phrase . ”
Slang that ’s in use by a particular generation can be useful too .
For example , “ friends with benefits ” versus “ casual sex ” versus “ free love ” … all used by different generations ( 20 - somethings , 30 - somethings , hippies … )
Likewise , if you are looking for negative opinions , try words like “ stupid ” , “ dumb ” and “ sucks ” .
Use your imagination , and you ’ll be rewarded .
Look for Expert Cues .
The relative obscurity of a word can help narrow down the results .
So instead of searching for best plasma tv television , which will turn up crappy e-commerce websites , look for color balance reproduction fidelity plasma tv television … you ’re more likely to get an article that ’s written by someone who edits Audiophile magazine on the side .
Or if you ’re looking for something more academic , use academic words or titles .
“ Ph.D. ” , “ professor ” , “ research ” , and “ bibliography ” might slant the results more in that direction .
Hunt by lineage , not by category .
Sometimes , keywords fail to reveal useful search results because the keyword space is heavily saturated by another meaning or by common - place daily use .
If you ’re looking for the rare and the exceptional , you need to search for topical anchors : key people , key philosophies and key innovations that shaped the field you ’re searching .
You first may have to read a general history of the topic you ’re searching to get an idea of what those key anchors are .
People who are learned in their field will often reference key principles as a statement of their belief ; following these chains of beliefs and the sites that they link to will help you form an alternative search topology that Google is unable to provide through keyword techniques .
Search Patent Databases .
When you ’re looking for a utilitarian or specialty item that is n’t directly used by the average consumer , the trail often goes cold , or is polluted by unrelated commercial offerings .
Find out who holds key patents by searching the US Patent Office Database .
There are other patent registries online too , so just look around .
The wealth of information you can gain from patent applications can put you back on track : names of inventors , manufacturers , and related patents –not to mention the description of the apparatus itself–can give you more to Google .
Or look for the patent number on an actual object you ’re interested in ( if there is one ) and look it up online .
That can save you buckets of time .
Do n’t Neglect Your Local Research Librarian !
If you are lucky enough to live near a university library , or even a decent public library , go check it out .
The good libraries have people trained in navigating piles of information … librarians !
The specialist ones know where everything is .
You can also find out how to access the library ’s card catalog over the Internet , which might save you some legwork .
In a pinch you might go to Barnes and Noble or Borders or a decent independent bookstore , and ask someone where the books on XYZ are .
I was reading this article from David Herron today .
It looks back on an article from a decade ago talking about how Java was predicted to be a technology that “ does n’t stand a chance . ”
David suggests that , “ Looking at that 10 years later I can only think the rumors of Java ’s death are greatly exaggerated . ”
I ’m not so sure about that .
Java did in fact die .
It died quite a horrible death .
That death occurred in the consumer - grade desktop application market .
We never really saw any significant , widespread desktop applications written in Java .
Although it did and does get much use on the client - side in many enterprises , it never caught on in the wider market .
Part of this may be that it did n’t allow enough integration with the host system .
Another reason may be that the Java runtime was too bulky and difficult to obtain , especially in a world of dial - up users .
Beyond that , the relatively poor performance of even Sun ’s Java virtual machine implementation during those critical early years surely did n’t help .
So in the end , we never really saw any popular games written in Java .
We never saw any successful word processors , or spreadsheets , or Web browsers written in Java .
There were efforts , but they usually failed .
The “ Java : Slow , ugly and irrelevant ” article covers these failures quite well .
But Sun and Java did get lucky , even since the Salon.com article was published .
Java did end up getting used for many server - side applications , where the hardware was usually powerful enough to help negate the lower performance of Java applications .
And the developer productivity jump relative to C and C++ , due in part to Java ’s extensive class library , did help , as well .
So it ’s best to think of Java as a language that got a second lease on life .
It did pass away the first time around .
But on it ’s second go - round , in a different market , it did manage to entrench itself .
Nevertheless , this latter success should not cause us to forget how it failed so badly the first time around .
Whatever the world thinks of Robert Novak , Robert Novak wants the world to know that he does n't much care .
" I do n't watch my words very closely .
I 'm 76 years old , and I do n't have that much time on this earth , " says the conservative columnist , his hand tapping idly on a chair in his downtown Washington office .
" There 's very little people can do to hurt me , and so I say what I want to say . "
And so he does .
Four years ago , that was what made Novak the most notorious journalist in Washington .
On July 14 , 2003 he wrote a column - which is syndicated in almost 300 papers nationally , including the Washington Post - that contained the name of CIA operative Valerie Plame .
The piece led to a three - year investigation into how her name was leaked , a 30 - month jail sentence for vice presidential aide Lewis " Scooter " Libby , and the biggest personnel scandal of the Bush administration .
Two weeks ago , that scandal appeared to be on the verge of running its course .
President Bush commuted Libby 's sentence , and Plame 's damage suit against Dick Cheney was thrown out of court .
But now Novak has wandered back into the fray with a new memoir , titled , after his old nickname , The Prince of Darkness .
It is a title that the book tries its best to live up to : settling scores across five decades , discussing his best sources and favourite scoops , and reigniting the debate over whether or not he should have included the name of Plame .
The role of the sinister Washington insider is one Novak has cultivated with cartoonish consistency .
He has worked out of the same address , a handsome building one block from the White House , for 43 years .
He wears a three - piece pinstripe suit every day , his braces now stretched by weight and age .
As he holds forth on the failures of what seems like every politician he has ever known , his jowls and arched dark eyebrows form into a familiar scowl .
Around his neck is the same stained orange and blue tie that he is wearing on the cover of his new book .
Fifty years in Washington have not made Novak an optimistic man .
" I do n't have a lot of faith in the political process or politicians , " he says .
" They 're all disappointing , because they 're just politicians .
The only perfect man was Jesus Christ , and he 's never run for anything that I know of . "
Despite being often accused of using his column to serve the interests of powerful Republicans , his verdict on the current president is succinct : " George Bush is one of the worst presidents I have ever seen . "
Novak came to Washington in 1957 as a reporter for the Associated Press and joined Wall Street Journal in 1958 , where he covered the Senate and solidified his reputation as an able political reporter .
In 1963 he accepted an offer to write a nationally syndicated column from New York with Herald - Tribune reporter Rowland Evans , a partnership that produced one of the great institutions of Washington journalism .
The career has given Novak a bottomless supply of stories to draw on - from meeting Ezra Pound in the Senate , to a reckless midnight car ride with John F Kennedy , to having his wedding reception hosted by Lyndon Johnson .
Evans retired in 1993 and died in 2001 , but Novak continues to write the syndicated column , now three times a week .
And , unlike most of his fellow columnists , his work is still based mostly on gossipy inside reporting , not opinion .
He is well known for using unnamed sources in high places .
Of top presidential aide Karl Rove , he writes : " In 44 years as a Washington reporter , I never had better access to a White House as I did to the George W. Bush administration .
Karl Rove was a grade A - plus source . "
His sourcing methods and lack of firm ideological commitments open Novak to criticism from the right and left .
In 2003 , former Bush speechwriter David Frum wrote a cover story for the conservative National Review magazine that charged Novak with being unpatriotic in the fight against terror , and last week he published a three - part critique of Novak 's new memoir on the magazine 's website .
" One of the things I found so shocking about Novak 's memoir was his use of his very powerful column for personal ends , " Frum says .
" Lots of Washington insiders exchange better treatment for information , but Novak is one of the few who uses that to exact retribution . "
Critics say that this habit was on display nowhere better than during the Plame affair .
Geneva Overholser , a professor of journalism at the University of Missouri who has criticised Novak in the past , says he represents " the worst in insider Washington journalism " .
" It seems to me that for Novak access is the most important thing - and he surely does have it .
But his behaviour shows just how much harm you can do as a journalist when access is everything .
He allowed a powerful person to make a damaging assertion about someone else under the cover of anonymity . "
Of course , Novak has harsh words for his critics , too .
He describes Frum as " a dishonest journalist and a fraud " , and writes in his memoir that Frum 's attacks were motivated by personal animus .
He is equally dismissive of Overholser : " Journalists of Overholser 's stripe despised me for being a conservative , " he writes .
But the most damning judgments are reserved for Plame 's husband , Joe Wilson , of whom Novak writes : " What an asshole ! "
He remains unrepentant .
" That was n't a conclusion I reached after three years , " laughs Novak .
" That was a conclusion I reached after three minutes . "
Novak does seem to have some remorse about the fallout from his column , and says he regrets " all the trouble that happened " .
But he sees little in his own conduct to apologise for .
" It 's an irrelevant question to ask what I would do if I could do it all over again , because I do n't have the chance to do it all over again .
It 's done . "
Novak argues that revealing Plame 's identity did not endanger her in any way .
Wilson disagrees .
" We have received any number of death threats since her name came out from al - Qaeda types or al - Qaeda wannabes . "
He plans to push ahead with his damage suit against Cheney , Libby , Rove and others in the Bush administration for revealing his wife 's identity as a CIA agent .
Wilson says he filed a notice of appeal on July 20 .
He is still bitter about Novak 's actions .
" I think it 's very clear that he 's got , at best , an occasional relationship with the truth .
And as a Catholic he ought to remember that bearing false witness is a sin . "
Novak says that Catholic faith - to which he converted from Judaism in 1998 - helps him put the criticism in perspective .
And , he says , despite three bouts of cancer and two broken hips , he has no plans to retire .
" I 'll keep writing the column as long as people print it .
That might be an open invitation for people not to print it , but I hope not . "
All he hopes is that there are no more questions about Plame .
" You can't imagine how tired I am of answering those questions .
But it 's my fault for bringing it up - after all , I wrote this book . "
Why naming Plame mattered
When President George Bush made the case for invading Iraq in January 2003 , he alleged that Saddam Hussein had attempted to buy yellowcake uranium from Niger .
On July 6 of that year a former US ambassador , Joseph Wilson , published an article in the New York Times that disputed the president 's claim .
Wilson wrote that the CIA had sent him to Niger in 2002 to investigate the yellowcake story , and he had found no evidence of an attempted sale .
A week after Wilson 's article was published , Robert Novak wrote a column in which , on the basis of information provided by two anonymous " senior administration officials " , he reported that Wilson had been sent to Niger only at the request of his wife , whom Novak identified as " CIA operative " Valerie Plame .
Novak did so even though the CIA had asked him not to use Plame 's name .
Because revealing the identity of an undercover CIA agent can , in certain circumstances , be a criminal offence , a special prosecutor was appointed in February 2004 to investigate the " alleged unauthorised disclosure " of Plame 's name .
Dozens of journalists and administration officials - including the president - were interviewed , and vice presidential aide Lewis " Scooter " Libby was convicted of criminally obstructing the investigation .
Novak 's sources were revealed to be the then deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage and top presidential aide Karl Rove .
Novak , Rove and Armitage were never charged with any offence .
Next week , Steve Jobs will stand on stage in San Francisco to make his keynote speech at the Macworld show , to unveil new - much - rumoured - products .
Here 's something I discovered in my 22 years at Apple : some of the toughest competition for the best seats , or the first of those new products , comes from former Windows - centric executives who Steve has personally sucked into his " reality distortion zone " in face - to - face executive briefings .
You want to go to one ?
You want to meet Steve Jobs to persuade him that Apple should build a tablet computer , or an iPhone ?
Then besides having a big purchasing budget and persuasive reasons , you 'd better bring a big ego .
In the spring of 2002 , I had been at Apple for nearly 20 years and had risen through the ranks to become its national federal sales manager .
I joined a delegation from the prestigious National Institutes of Health , the pre-eminent US federal agency for medical research , for an " executive briefing " at Apple 's Cupertino headquarters with Steve Jobs .
Most people have n't heard of NIH ; but its 2007 budget will be around $ 28.6 bn ( £ 14.6bn ) .
NIH also happens to be one of Apple 's premier scientific customers .
Nine key NIH people attended the meeting , including its two highest - ranking technology officers .
Setting up an executive briefing at Apple is a bizarre process that takes a couple of months ; if you also want Steve to grace the briefing , add another six weeks to run a formal request up the chain of command , including just about every detail but the DNA of the people who want to meet him .
With luck , and if Steve happens to be in town , you will get the commitment that unless something else turns up , he will drop by and stay as long as he feels necessary .
Horror stories
Once you have your ironclad guarantee that Steve might come by , the management chain starts telling horror stories about how the best thing is for Steve not to come .
That if he does come , he 'll talk about whatever he has immersed himself in recently , whether it is iTunes or Garageband .
That whatever Steve has to say might or might not have anything to do with what the customer wants to hear .
For a salesman , that 's disconcerting ; your customers normally only come to these executive briefings to understand where Apple executives stand on key issues .
And they 're customers , are n't they ?
They 're the ones who pay for it all , the ones who are always right ?
Yet it 's an amazing experience to take part in a briefing with Steve .
Stories about him reprimanding customers are true .
Once , when renegotiating a Pixar distribution deal with Disney , he humiliated Disney 's chief information officer in front of his staff .
Steve pointed to a couple of recent Disney flops , and told the attendees that they could expect more of the same as long as the CIO was stupid enough to keep Macs out of the creative process .
An executive briefing always looks , on paper , like a clash of titanic egos .
From what I saw , most wilt quickly in Steve 's presence .
And customers ' reverence for him usually overwhelms any hostility .
In fact , it does n't really matter who is presenting or what is being discussed .
When Steve enters a room , everything stops and attention turns to him .
When he walks in you get the feeling that he has sucked all the other thoughts out of the room .
As for quoting him precisely - you do n't take notes if you want to live .
( At Apple 's most recent sales briefing , nobody was allowed to have a notebook , phone or computer out while Steve spoke . )
I 've checked these recollections with an NIH attendee .
Steve did show up wearing shorts , sandals and a few days ' stubble .
Everyone else was in east coast business casual - sports coats and khaki pants .
He also brought his brilliance but not , that day , the arrogance you often hear about .
The NIH delegation wanted to know whether Apple would build a tablet computer that would work in their clinical situation .
Actually , more than that : they wanted to convince Steve to make a tablet .
After all , Bill Gates had launched one the year before at CES in January , boldly saying " within five years , I predict that it will be the most popular form of PC sold in America " .
Tablets were the future - were n't they ?
Not like those music players that Apple had launched the previous October .
Pod -somethings ?
But as Apple 's then vice - president of hardware , Jon Rubenstein , once told me : " Customers do not know what they want to buy .
We have to tell them . "
Steve had not been forewarned about the tablet question , but it became obvious he had given the topic serious consideration .
He listed a number of reasons why Apple was not interested .
And they provide some of the best insights into why Apple does or does not do a product .
The tablet situation
First , he said , tablet computers were not a big enough market for Apple to spend its limited resources chasing .
And even if the market grew , it would not reach a size to be of interest .
The form factor was all wrong .
Apple was more interested in defining markets than trying to catch other companies that were busy trying to create a market for questionable products .
Still , some of the NIH scientists pressed the issue .
Steve 's follow - up answer was the most impressive I had heard him give .
First , he said , the wireless bandwidth for huge images , plus the security needed to successfully do what NIH wanted , was just not on the horizon .
( Apple staff had been notably fuzzy earlier in the briefing about wireless standards after 802.11b . )
Plus , tablets ' screen resolution was nowhere near that required for NIH 's high - quality medical images .
Finally , any product designed to work in the medical field would attract significant liability .
The hint was that Apple was n't interested in anything with that kind of potential liability .
That pretty well shut down the issue .
So , no tablet .
But NIH at the time had more than 2,000 BlackBerry users .
The NIH CIO wanted Apple to push RIM for better compatibility .
Tough :
Steve basically said it was another niche product , and that while there would be convergence of computing and phones , the BlackBerry was not that product .
He did not see that compatibility as an area where Apple should spend any effort .
So what will the converged product - what is being called the " iPhone " ( even though that 's a Cisco trademark ) - look like ?
He said the really converged , ubiquitous devices would have to fit in your shirt pocket , and be better than either a phone or a computer by itself .
That was 2002 .
But let 's examine the rumours that Apple will next week unveil a tablet computer or iPhone in light of Steve 's comments that day .
The market for a converged computer and phone should be very attractive : Gartner forecast last year that 986 m mobiles would be sold in 2006 .
And there 's an " Apple gap " : mobile phone users often find their interfaces confusing , even within the same brands .
Apple 's unique ability to simplify while innovating looks like a good fit there .
Plus Apple 's deal with Samsung means it is well placed for anything that needs lots of flash memory .
It has played around with unique relationships with phone manufacturers : Jobs used a Sony Ericsson phone to demonstrate Bluetooth capability in July 2002 , and showed off the Motorola ROKR , the first to play iTunes , in 2005 .
This fits Apple 's pattern of learning what it needs to know through partnership before jumping into a market .
Significantly , the first Powerbooks , in 1991 , involved Sony .
Now the companies ' laptops compete , although Sony still makes the batteries .
Logically , Apple will make its own phone if it is holding true to pattern .
But a tablet computer ?
Most analysts would agree the market is growing only slowly , mostly in the healthcare and other specialised industries , and that these models will make at most 5 % of the laptop market by 2009 ( they account for 1 % now ) .
Even Dell does n't make its own tablet .
Furthermore , the tablet was championed by Bill Gates .
I do n't see Steve stepping up to the plate to help Bill 's reputation as a forecaster of computer trends .
I believe there are other reasons why Apple wo n't make a tablet computer .
Even before the iPod gained momentum , Apple executives had a theory that the route to success will not be through selling thousands of relatively expensive things , but millions of very inexpensive things like iPods ; and not necessarily computers .
Tablet computers remain expensive .
Yet the mobile phone market is almost perfect for Apple strategy .
There is no real market leader , and it 's ripe for simplification .
Plus it 's worldwide , and engineers from the network operators would be available to do localisation .
Apple might even be able to do a Java - based phone platform which could integrate into current systems .
With a focus on simple mail and contact integration with its online .
Mac ( mac.com ) service , Apple could provide advantages for early adopters while making its .
Mac service better value ( because it is n't right now ) .
Few non-technical people consider doing anything other than transferring numbers to their new mobiles by typing .
On anything other than a Mac , the process is just too complex .
Apple already knows how to make this easy .
It just needs to convince people to buy an Apple phone and a Mac .
Also anti-tablet is Apple 's sales force , which often spends so much of its time forecasting what it 's going to sell in a given quarter there 's precious little time left to actually sell anything .
Right now they sell everything from iPods to Xserve RAIDs .
However , an Apple phone would n't need a new sales force .
The network operators ' sales force could handle it - probably cutting Apple sales people out of any new commission revenue for phones , much as they have done for the iPod .
Even if Apple partners only with a single national carrier it will get an immediate , huge retail presence .
What about a more targeted tablet - perhaps to control all the devices in your home entertainment stable ?
Traditionally , Apple stays away from markets where it cannot define all of the standards , so I really do n't think Steve will devote resources to make non-Apple stuff work together .
Even the vertical markets like healthcare suffer from this problem : too many pieces in a very complex puzzle .
So next week , I 'm sure we wo n't see any kind of tablet computer from Apple .
I am 99 % confident we will see an Apple phone , with enhanced music capabilities and maybe a few computing features such as email and contacts synchronisation with Macs or through .
Mac .
Steve 's ability to know where consumers and technology will intersect often creates a road paved in gold .
That 's why he 'll focus his energy on mobiles .
The potential there that only Steve can see could well turn into another must - have product for the legions who do n't even know they are part of Steve 's army .
They have n't met him across a table .
But they 've met the products of his thinking .

In my darker moods , I think that the rest of my life can be encapsulated in a single sentence : I grew up and grew into other preoccupations , some of which have served me well .
I became a music critic and culture writer , first for the SoHo News , and then for the Times , Newsday , and the Washington Post .
In the middle of all this , I became enamored of the American author Dawn Powell , whose life and works I absorbed in much the same manner I had the World Book , and I spent five years editing her novels , short stories , plays , diaries , and letters and writing her first biography .
I look back on these projects with a certain mystified satisfaction ; I ’m glad they were done , but it is as though they had been accomplished by somebody else , for the particular furies and fevers that impelled them have long since evaporated .
In the fall of 2000 , in the course of what had become a protracted effort to identify — and , if possible , alleviate — my lifelong unease , I was told that I had Asperger ’s syndrome .
I had never heard of the condition , which had been recognized by the American Psychiatric Association only six years earlier .
Nevertheless , the diagnosis was one of those rare clinical confirmations which are met mostly with relief .
Here , finally , was an objective explanation for some of my strengths and weaknesses , the simultaneous capacity for unbroken work and all - encompassing recall , linked inextricably to a driven , uncomfortable personality .
And I learned that there were others like me — people who yearned for steady routines , repeated patterns , and a few cherished subjects , the driftwood that keeps us afloat .
The syndrome was identified , in 1944 , by Hans Asperger , a Viennese pediatrician , who wrote , “ For success in science or art , a dash of autism is essential . ”
Yet Oliver Sacks makes a clear distinction between full - fledged autism and Asperger ’s syndrome .
In The New Yorker some years ago , Sacks wrote that “ people with Asperger ’s syndrome can tell us of their experiences , their inner feelings and states , whereas those with classical autism cannot .
With classical autism there is no ‘ window , ’ and we can only infer .
With Asperger ’s syndrome there is self - consciousness and at least some power to introspect and report . ”
In his 1998 book “ Asperger ’s Syndrome : A Guide for Parents and Professionals , ” Tony Attwood observed , “ The person with Asperger ’s syndrome has no distinguishing physical features but is primarily viewed by other people as different because of their unusual quality of social behavior and conversation skills .
For example , a woman with Asperger ’s Syndrome described how as a child she saw people moving into the house up the street , ran up to one of the new kids and , instead of the conventional greeting and request of ‘ Hi , you want to play ? , ’ proclaimed , ‘ Nine times nine is equal to 81 . ’ ”
David Mamet , in his recent book “ Bambi vs. Godzilla , ” discerned redeeming qualities in the condition .
Considering filmmakers past and present , he stated that “ it is not impossible that Asperger ’s syndrome helped make the movies .
The symptoms of this developmental disorder include early precocity , a great ability to maintain masses of information , a lack of ability to mix with groups in age - appropriate ways , ignorance of or indifference to social norms , high intelligence , and difficulty with transitions , married to a preternatural ability to concentrate on the minutia of the task at hand . ”
The Asperger ’s spectrum ranges from people barely more abstracted than a stereotypical “ absent - minded professor ” to the full - blown , albeit highly functioning , autistic .
Symptoms of Asperger ’s have been attributed ex post facto to successful figures , but these are the fortunate ones — persons able to invent outlets for their ever - welling monomanias .
Many are not so lucky , and some end up institutionalized or homeless .
( In the late nineteen - seventies , I saw a ragged , haunted man who spent urgent hours dodging the New York transit police to trace the dates and lineage of the Hapsburg nobility on the walls of subway stations . )
For some — record collectors with every catalogue number at hand , theatre buffs with first - night casts memorized , children who draw precise architectural blueprints of nineteenth - century silk mills — a cluster of facts can be both luminous and lyric , something around which to construct a life .
We are informally referred to as “ Aspies , ” and if we are not very , very good at something we tend to do it very poorly .
Little in life comes naturally — except for our random , inexplicable , and often uncontrollable gifts — and , even more than most children , we assemble our personalities unevenly , piece by piece , almost robotically , from models we admire .
( I remember the deliberate decision to appropriate one teacher ’s mischievous grin and darting eyes , which I found so charming that I thought they might work for me , too . )
So preoccupied are we with our inner imperatives that the outer world may overwhelm and confuse .
What anguished pity I used to feel for piñatas at birthday parties , those papier - mâché donkeys with their amiable smiles about to be shattered by little brutes with bats .
On at least one occasion , I begged for a stay of execution and eventually had to be taken home , weeping , convinced that I had just witnessed the braining of a new and sympathetic acquaintance .
Caring for inanimate objects came easily .
Learning to make genuine connections with people — much as I desperately wanted them — was a bewildering process .
I felt like an alien , always about to be exposed .
Or , to adapt another hoary but useful analogy , not only did I not see the forest for the trees ; I was so intensely distracted that I missed the trees for the species of lichen on their bark .
My first and most powerful obsession was music — the same records played again and again while I watched them spin , astonished at their evocation of aural worlds that I not only instinctively understood even as a toddler but in which I actually felt comfortable .
I was both terrified of and tantalized by death ( which was absolutely real to me from earliest childhood ) , and by the way recordings restored Enrico Caruso and Nellie Melba to life for a few minutes , ghostly visitors who had returned to sing for me at 78 r.p.m. , through a hiss of shellac and antiquity .
When I was ten , I became fascinated by silent films , the visual complement to my old records .
I spent hours at the library of the University of Connecticut , a few minutes ’ walk from home , researching the lives of actors and actresses on microfilm , and recall the genuine sense of mourning that came over me when I saw Barbara La Marr ’s sad , youthful face on an obituary page from 1926 .
Not surprisingly , “ Sunset Boulevard ” was my favorite “ talkie ” ( I actually called them that — in 1965 ! ) , and I ’d regularly set the alarm and wake in the middle of the night to watch Chester Conklin or Louise Dresser take on minor roles in some B movie that the Worcester , Massachusetts , UHF station put on when nobody else was watching .
“ I despise the Beatles and their ilk , ” this remarkably Blimpish young man proclaimed in a school paper shortly after the first Ed Sullivan show , when other boys my age were growing their hair long and learning to play the guitar .
My favorite pop musician then was the Scottish comedian Harry Lauder , a star in vaudeville and music halls at the beginning of the last century , who told obscure jokes in brogue and sang through exaggerated hiccups in a state of pretend intoxication .
The depth of my admiration for Lauder now baffles me as much as the steady diet of horehound drops I adopted as snack food , or my insistence , much of one autumn , that I wear a rabbit ’s foot in each buttonhole of my shirt , which I kept tightly fastened up to the neck .
But nobody could have persuaded me to abandon these quirks , and any attempt to do so would have been taken as a physical threat and reduced me to hysteria .
MISSION : DIY RELATIONSHIPS
How your guy 's hormone cycle can help you have a closer relationship Women are n’t the only ones with hormone cycles — men have them , too .
Unlike our month - long cycle , theirs lasts a mere 24 hours .
“ Their testosterone is highest in the morning and goes down as the day goes on until it reaches the lowest point at night , ” notes Michael Gurian , psychotherapist , gender expert and author of What Could He Be Thinking ?.
Once you know how your guy 's hormone cycle affects him , you can use it to create a closer relationship .
For instance , you 'll be able to pin him down for a heart - to - heart talk , get a “ yes ” to a favor and even avoid fights .
Read on to learn how …
Morning ( when he wakes up to noon ) :
He ’s energetic , talkative , aggressive , focused and confident .
He may also be combative , quick to anger and more likely to say “ no ” to a favor or request .
The hidden hormone reason :
His testosterone is at its highest level .
To make your relationship closer : Avoid bringing up " hot button " topics that can be put off till later in the day .
His high testosterone makes him more likely to fly off the handle even about little things , says Gurian .
Make your guy feel needed by asking him to fix something around the house , for instance , a broken shelf or leaky faucet .
His high testosterone makes it easier for him to do anything that requires hand - eye coordination .
But once he starts the project , leave him alone — a man ’s high testosterone makes him feel more independent now , so he ’s happiest working by himself .
Need to travel somewhere ?
Make your guy feel important by asking him to map out the best route to your destination — he ’ll pick the quickest one !
“ That ’s because testosterone makes his spatial skills — which are needed for map - reading — peak in the morning , ” explains Barbara Pease , author of Why Men Do n’t Have a Clue and Women Always Need More Shoes .
In the mood for some bedroom fun ?
Fit it in during the morning hours .
High testosterone makes a man ’s libido peak in the early part of the day , which turns these into the most passionate hours for sex with your sweetie .
Afternoon ( noon to 5 pm ) :
He ’s a tad mellower but still upbeat , chatty , driven and focused .
He ’s also more open to working with others .
You ’ll catch him smiling more now , too .
The hidden hormone reason :
His testosterone is at the mid-point of its cycle .
To make your relationship closer :
Want to know how your mate really feels about an issue , say , an impending move or job change ?
Invite him to join you in a physical activity , such as walking , biking or shooting hoops .
Then ask him about his feelings while you 're doing the activity .
Believe it or not , he 'll share !
The reason ?
At this point in their hormone cycle , men have energy to burn , so they 'll enjoy being active .
And males find it easier to open up about their emotions when they ’re engaged in an activity , so they 're more open to answering those probing questions , explains Gurian .
If you ’ve got a problem you 're working on , now ’s the best time to ask your mate to join you in brainstorming solutions .
Not only will his hormones have him in a talkative mood , he 's also more open to partnering up during these hours .
Plus , helping you come up with answers to problems will make him feel more needed by you .
Evening ( 5 pm to 7 pm ) :
His energy is bottoming out and he ’s feeling mentally foggy .
He craves an hour or so of down - time while he recharges .
The hidden hormone reason :
His testosterone is reaching the low point of its cycle .
To make your relationship closer : Avoid pouncing on your sweetie the moment he gets home from school or work .
Instead , let him zone out in front of the TV , listen to music or do whatever other low - key activity he likes to do to recharge , advises Pease .
To get closer to him during these hours , simply sit silently next to him as he vegges out .
Even though he probably wo n’t say it — or anything during this energy - zapped part of the day — he ’ll appreciate your quiet company .
Want to make him feel even closer to you ?
Bring him pep-boosting snacks , like cheese and crackers , advises Gurian .
“ He ’ll appreciate your kind nurturing .
Plus , eating helps men get their flagging energy back up — and that will make the rest of the night with him even more enjoyable . ”
Night ( 7 pm to bedtime ) :
He ’s feeling relaxed , agreeable and close to you .
The hidden hormone reason :
His testosterone has reached the lowest point of its cycle , but he 's gotten past the zoned - out part of his day .
To make your relationship closer :
Bring up all those hot button subjects that you need to get out of the way — such as finances and future relationship plans .
“ Because his testosterone levels are lower , he ’s less likely to get fired up while discussing topics like these , ” says Pease .
This is also the perfect time to ask the man in your life for a favor — for instance , to pick up the dry cleaning tomorrow or agree to the new pink curtains .
Low testosterone makes men less argumentative and , therefore , more likely to say “ yes ” .
If you want to have a quiet heart - to - heart with your honey about a serious topic , here 's your chance .
During these hours , low testosterone makes men most open to sitting through emotion - filled chats with minimal squirming .
Craving some physical affection , like a hug or massage ?
Now ’s the best time to get it from him , says Pease , since his level of the hormone “ oxytocin ” , known as the bonding hormone , is higher .
Your sweetie is also feeling more romantic , so a candlelit dinner or bubble bath will appeal to him more now than at any other time of day .
Did you know ?
When a man watches a romantic movie , it raises the level of his progesterone by more than 10 percent , making him mellow and more nurturing .
Did you know ?
A man ’s testosterone level rises when he drinks alcohol , watches an action movie , plays video games or sees images of seductive women .
It also rises when he competes in or watches a sports game .
But if his team loses , his testosterone plunges !
Did you know ?
You can tell how much testosterone a man has by looking at his face — and it can reveal a lot about his personality !
For instance ...
Does he have a strong , square jaw , finds it easy to grow a full beard and has a masculine look ?
Then he has a high level of testosterone .
What it reveals about him :
He 's independent , ambitious , competitive and a bit of a flirt .
Does he have a rounded chin , could n't grow a beard even after a Rogaine facial and has a more feminine look ?
Then he has a low level of testosterone .
What it reveals about him :
He 's sensitive , laid - back , cooperative , considerate and is more likely to want to settle down with one gal and have kids .
Does he have a mix of masculine and feminine features ?
Then his testosterone level is in the middle .
What it reveals about him :
He 's assertive without being too overbearing , cooperative without being passive and is open to marriage , but will understand if you do n't want to take your relationship to that level .
The small , barefoot man in black T - shirt and blue jeans barely rates a second glance from the other Starbucks patrons in downtown San Rafael , although he is one of the men who virtually made the '60s .
Because Augustus Owsley Stanley III has spent his life avoiding photographs , few people would know what he looks like .
The name Owsley became a noun that appears in the Oxford dictionary as English street slang for good acid .
It is the most famous brand name in LSD history .
Probably the first private individual to manufacture the psychedelic , " Owsley " is a folk hero of the counterculture , celebrated in songs by the Grateful Dead and Steely Dan .
For more than 20 years , Stanley -- at 72 , still known as the Bear -- has been living with his wife , Sheila , off the grid , in the outback of Queensland , Australia , where he makes small gold and enamel sculptures and keeps in touch with the world through the Internet .
As a planned two - week visit to the Bay Area stretched to three , four and then five weeks , Bear agreed to give The Chronicle an interview because a friend asked him .
He has rarely consented to speak to the press about his life , his work or his unconventional thinking on matters such as the coming ice age or his all - meat diet .
Sporting a buccaneer 's earring he got when he was in jail and a hearing aid on the same ear , he keeps a salty goatee , and the sides of his face look boiled clean from seven weeks of maximum radiation treatment for throat cancer .
Having lost one of his vocal cords , he speaks only in a whispered croak these days .
At one point , he was reduced to injecting his puree of steak and espresso directly into his stomach .
" I never set out to change the world , " he rasps in recalling his early manufacture of LSD .
" I only set out to make sure I was taking something ( that ) I knew what it was .
And it 's hard to make a little .
And my friends all wanted to know what they were taking , too .
Of course , my friends expanded very rapidly . "
By conservative estimates , Bear Research Group made more than 1.25 million doses of LSD between 1965 and 1967 , essentially seeding the entire modern psychedelic movement .
Less well known are Bear 's contributions to rock concert sound .
As the original sound mixer for the Grateful Dead , he was responsible for fundamental advances in audio technology , things as basic now as monitor speakers that allow vocalists to hear themselves onstage .
Says the Dead 's Bob Weir : " He 's good for a different point of view at about any given time .
He 's brilliant .
He knows everything . "
Bear , whose grandfather was a Kentucky governor and U.S. senator , grew up in Los Angeles and Arlington , Va .
He was thrown out of military school in the eighth grade for being drunk and dropped out of school altogether at 18 .
He managed to get accepted to the University of Virginia , where he spent a year studying engineering .
By 1956 , he was in the Air Force , specializing in electronics and radar .
Later , Bear studied ballet , acting and Russian , worked in jet propulsion labs as well as radio and television , and then entered UC Berkeley in 1963 , but lasted less than a year .
Then he discovered acid .
He found the recipe for making LSD in the Journal of Organic Chemistry at the UC Berkeley library .
Soon after , Bear began to cook acid .
The Berkeley police raided his first lab in 1966 and confiscated a substance that they claimed was methedrine .
When it turned out to be something else -- probably a component of LSD -- Bear not only walked free but successfully sued the cops for the return of his lab equipment .
By the time he made a special batch called Monterey Purple for the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival -- Owsley Purple was the secret smile on Jimi Hendrix 's face that night -- " Owsley " was an underground legend .
In December 1967 , agents arrested him at his secret lab in Orinda .
The " LSD Millionaire " headline in The Chronicle prompted the Dead to write the song " Alice D. Millionaire . "
In 1970 , after a pot bust in Oakland , a judge revoked Bear 's bail , and he served two years at Terminal Island near the Los Angeles Harbor .
" If you make some , you 've got to move some to get some money to make it , " he says now .
" But then you had to give a lot away to keep the street price down .
So anyway , I 'm sort of embedded in this thing that I 'm tangled up in .
...
Just as soon as it became illegal , I wanted out .
Then , of course , I felt an obligation . "
Bear , chemist to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters , was involved with the Dead almost from the band 's beginnings at Kesey 's notorious Acid Tests .
Bear was the Dead 's first patron and , briefly , their manager .
He bought the band sound equipment and began to use the Dead as a laboratory for audio research .
" We 'd never thought about high - quality PAs , " says the Dead 's Weir .
" There was no such thing until Bear started making one . "
Bear made the first public address system specifically dedicated to music in 1966 .
If he was the first concert sound engineer in rock music to take his job seriously , his habit of making tape recordings of the shows he mixed also gave the Dead an unprecedented archive of live recordings dating back to the band 's first days .
Many of Bear 's tapes have been turned into albums .
Bear has always lived in a quite particular world .
" He can be very anal retentive , on a certain level , on a genius level , " says Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane .
" I 've seen him send his eggs back three times at Howard Johnson's . "
His all - meat diet is a well - known example .
When he was younger , Bear read about the Eskimos eating only fish and meat and became convinced that humans are meant to be exclusively carnivorous .
The members of the Grateful Dead remember living with Bear for several months in 1966 in Los Angeles , where the refrigerator contained only bottles of milk and a slab of steak , meat they fried and ate straight out of the pan .
His heart attack several years ago had nothing to do with his strict regimen , according to Bear , but more likely the result of some poisonous broccoli his mother made him eat as a youth .
As a sound mixer , Bear holds equally strict viewpoints , insisting that the most effective rock concert systems should have only a single source of sound , his argument quickly veering into the realm of psycho-acoustics .
" The PA can only be in one spot , " he says .
" All the sounds have to come from a single place because the human brain is carrying around the most sophisticated sound processing of any computer or living creature .
It equals the bats that fly by echo .
It equals the dolphins .
It equals the owls that hunt at night without any daylight at all .
It is a superb system for locating and separating one sound from everything else . "
Bear left Northern California in the early ' 80s , convinced that a natural disaster was imminent .
He predicted at the time that global warming would lead to a six - week - long ultra-cyclone that could cover the Northern Hemisphere with a new ice age .
Determining that the tropical northern side of Australia would be the most likely region to survive , Bear made a beeline for Queensland and says he felt at home the moment he set foot on the new continent .
" I might be right about the ice age thing , " he allows .
" I might be wrong . "
Old friends express shock that Bear would ever even admit to that possibility , but , if not exactly mellowed in his old age , he has found room to accommodate other points of view .
" He 's come a long way , " says Wavy Gravy , who visited Bear in Australia this year .
" He used to be real snappy and grumpy .
Now he can be actually sweet . "
His four children are grown .
He has five grandchildren , and his oldest son , Pete , in Florida , just became a grandfather , making Bear a great - grandfather for the first time .
His other son , Starfinder , a veterinarian , hosted a party for him last month at his Oakland home attended by the old Dead crowd , a tortoise and a caged iguana .
He has two daughters , Nina and Redbird , and maintains his own Web site ( www.thebear.org) where he sells his sculpture and posts various diatribes and essays .
He keeps up with the music scene -- he singles out Wolfmother and the Arctic Monkeys as new bands he likes .
" Any time the music on the radio starts to sound like rubbish , it 's time to take some LSD , " he says .
Owsley Stanley ( he legally dropped the " Augustus " 40 years ago ) has also not joined the ranks of the penitent psychedelicists who look on their experiences as youthful indiscretions .
" I wound up doing time for something I should have been rewarded for , " he says .
" What I did was a community service , the way I look at it .
I was punished for political reasons .
Absolutely meaningless .
Was I a criminal ?
No .
I was a good member of society .
Only my society and the one making the laws are different . "
At the hilltop San Anselmo home where Bear had been house - sitting , pretty much all available space was taken over with his belongings .
He squatted over the piles , trying to figure out what to ship and what to take with him .
Two days before his flight , it looks like he 'll need every minute .
This time , he was extending his stay to catch his old friends Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady of Hot Tuna play at the Fillmore .
But when he left for the airport the next day , he got as far as Sausalito before he discovered that he had left the briefcase with the tickets back in San Anselmo , and the trip home was postponed for another week .
" I even said , ' I wonder what I 'm leaving behind this time ? ' before I left , " he says , somewhat sadly .
Joe cited a great Politico article ( great in the “ my God they ’re completely insane ” kind of way ) in the post below , and I wanted to excerpt one more very telling part :
McCain also slammed Democrats who asserted that the surge is a failure , and he took a veiled shot at Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( Nev. ) , who has already declared the “ war is lost . ”
“ If we lost the war , does that mean that someone else has won ? ” McCain asked .
“ Has Al Qaeda won ? ”
More of the irrational , chest - thumping non-logic that got us into this war , kept us from questioning how the war was going , and now keeps us from leaving .
Well , I ’ll answer the question : Yes , Senator McCain , we lost and al Qaeda won , and it ’s your fault .
You were in the majority in Congress for most of this war , you had the oversight responsibility , and you did absolutely nothing while Bush fiddled away any possibility of victory .
You let George Bush send not enough troops .
You did nothing while al Qaeda infiltrated Iraq AFTER our invasion and made it their premiere base of operations , learning better and better ways to kill us there and here .
And you are demanding that we stay after we ’re no longer welcome , after there is no longer hope .
You , Senator McCain , along with George Bush and the entire Republican party let al Qaeda win this war , so spare us your macho bluster about how - dare - we - imply - that - al - qaeda - won .
Al Qaeda DID win , and it ’s your fault because you let your testosterone make the decisions – hell , you ’re still letting your hormones do the talking – and now we ’re paying for the worst price imaginable , with our soldiers ’ lives , and you could n’t give a damn about them , all you care about is continuing the war , continuing the disaster , continuing the lie .
All you ’ve got left is bravado , Senator McCain .
And the American people finally know it .
And that ’s why you ’re never going to be president .
It was Mendoza Stewart 's pride and joy .
A 1972 hand - crafted Bristol 411 - one of only 287 ever made and worth £ 30,000 .
But the vehicle 's status as a classic car was apparently lost on parking officials at Lambeth Council in South London .
Despite it being legally parked , they towed it away and crushed it .
Mr Stewart , a 51 - year - old music producer , is devastated by the loss of his rare car and has not yet received any compensation despite the council admitting it was in the wrong .
" It was a very special car that I bought in 1984 after a long search , ' he said .
' I found it with a dealer in Wimbledon .
It is unlikely I shall find another . "
Mr Stewart , who lives in Kennington , South London , parked the car in a council - run car park near his son's flat in nearby Camberwell .
But when he returned it was missing .
" I was horrified , " he said .
" I thought it had been stolen and went to the police .
They were unable to find it but after investigating discovered that Lambeth had taken it away .
" Someone who spotted my car arriving at the pound said that within minutes they had used a mechanical grab to pick it up by the roof instead of carefully lifting it down .
" By then it was all over .
It was utterly wrecked before I had a chance to retrieve it .
I have not seen it since .
They cannot explain why they took away what is obviously a special , rare car . "
The aluminium - bodied vehicle , built by British manufacturer Bristol Cars , was in good condition and was exempt from road tax because of its status as a classic car .
Mr Stewart , who insists a special " nil payment " disc was clearly displayed in the windscreen , took legal action against the council after the incident in December 2004 .
But more than two years on , despite the council admitting liability , he has still not received a penny - and he has been reduced to driving an ageing van instead of his treasured Bristol .
" I cannot believe it has taken so long , " said Mr Stewart .
The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency confirmed Mr Stewart 's Bristol would have been a classic car because of its age and not subject to road tax .
A Lambeth spokesman said : " Solicitors acting for Lambeth council have accepted breach of duty on behalf of their client .
The council apologises to Mr Stewart .
" As the matter is currently being litigated , we cannot comment further at this time but we are working hard to resolve this case as soon as possible . "
Bristol Cars has made hand - built luxury cars at Filton , Bristol , since 1945 .
The 411 was produced between 1968 and 1976 and only 287 were made .
In 1972 its showroom price was just under £ 7,000 .
Its Chrysler V8 engine made it the fastest four - seater car of its time , capable of accelerating from 0 - 60 in seven seconds and a top speed of 143mph .
The company , which has a showroom in Kensington , West London , deals direct with the public and has no distributors or dealerships .
It boasts of being the last wholly British - owned luxury car builder .
Originally an aircraft manufacturer , Bristol began making cars after World War II when the company found it had a surplus of skilled workers with nothing to build .
The original designs were modified from those acquired from the BMW factory in Munich as part of war reparations paid to Britain by Germany .
The Fanciest and Most Valuable Easter Eggs in the World
When we celebrate the end of Lent , we attend Mass and have a nice family dinner .
Or we may decide to hold an Easter Egg hunt at our home or at a party somewhere for the kids .
But all around the Christian world , Easter is a holiday that has fascinated artists who have been inspired by what it stands for .
On the other end of the commercial spectrum , there are also those who have used many holidays as a way to create beauty and sell it for a handsome sum .
Some jewelry manufacturers , for example , have used Easter as a theme ; it ’s something you can see promoted time and again in their works .
Let ’s work on that thought for a moment : here are a few trinkets that you can get for someone who has everything .
Talk about some really unique gifts stoked in tradition , history and beauty : I thought I would provide some interesting bits of trivia for you about Easter and its eggs .
Russian Easter Eggs
Easter eggs are well - known Russian memorabilia whose fame outside of this country is probably second only to painted wooden matryoshka dolls .
Lately , however , the interest toward the Easter egg has been of a special nature .
It is explained by its somewhat illegal status for 70 years .
Antique Easter eggs were stored away in different museums , almost inaccessible to the public .
It goes without saying that in Soviet times the good tradition of giving and receiving artistically painted Easter eggs on the bright holiday of Christ ’s Resurrection almost disappeared .
In the late 1980s forgotten customs and rituals returned , including the old Russian tradition of a triple kiss and the giving of an Easter egg .
Easter eggs are an attribute of one of the most important Christian holidays : the day of prayer for the miraculous Resurrection of the crucified Jesus Christ .

Faberge Eggs
For the wealthy collector among us , here are some of the finest Easter eggs in the world .
If you have a few thousand to several million dollars to spare , you could set up a collection of these items .
For those with more modest budgets , you can check home catalogs for something more affordable .
Fabergé Easter eggs have been prized possessions of the wealthy for over a century .
Crafted in the shops of Peter Carl Fabergé from 1885 to 1917 , the eggs were designed primarily at the behest of Russian Tsars Alexander III and Nicholas II as annual Easter gifts for Tsarinas Maria and Alexandra .
Not all of the eggs were made for the Russian imperial family .
Alexander Kelch , a Russian gold magnate and industrialist , gave his wife Barbara seven eggs between 1898 and 1904 .
The Duchess of Marlborough , formerly Consuelo Vanderbilt and the wealthiest young woman at the turn of the 20th century , also commissioned an egg of her own .
Here is more on the most expensive eggs ever made !
The most expensive egg ever sold was the Faberge Winter Egg and it went for $ 9.5 million in 2002 .

Crafted Easter Eggs
These are beautiful Russian Easter Eggs inspired by the work of Peter Carl Faberge , the world famous Russian jeweler and purveyor of elegance to the Russian Court and the Tsars .
Created by Russian artists , the exquisite hand - painted icon eggs , are termed ovo-art , depicting Our Lord , Jesus Christ , the Mother of God , and many of the venerated saints .

Holey Easter Eggs
Can you believe how “ holey ” this Easter egg has turned out ?
Move over , Faberge .
Modern master Franc Grom creates and sells eggs that may outshine the 19th - century Russian jeweler ’s Easter bling .
Shown at work on Wednesday in Vrhnika , Slovenia ( map ) , Grom uses an electric boring tool to drill approximately 2,500 to 3,500 holes in an eggshell .
Inspired by traditional Slovenian designs , he has been known to pierce a shell as many as 17,000 times .

Guy Kawasaki held a focus group with six teenagers — this is a small sample , of course , but their view of MySpace is telling :
Two panelists were MySpace users .
The others expressed a certain backlash and purposeful resistance to the addiction of MySpace .
One 14 year old used to be an active MySpace user but stopped after the police came to her school to warn the students about various dangers lurking there .
This points to two key MySpace vulnerabilities ( among many ) :
When a fad becomes overhyped , teens will eventually retreat Most teens know that MySpace is n’t entirely safe
After reading this , I went to check out MySpace ’s latest Alexa chart :
![ MySpace Traffic May 23 2006 ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/publishing2-images/MySpace Alexa May 23 2006 .png )
Could it be that MySpace peaked in April ?
The traffic chart sure looks a dot com stock chart circa April 2000 — the run up always looks like it will never end … until it does .
Come to think of it , Facebook is looking kind of downish , too :
![ Facebook Traffic May 23 2006 ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/publishing2-images/Facebook Alexa May 23 2006 .
png )
Well , anyway , just wondering .
UPDATE
David Krug and others think the MySpace dip is cyclical , driven by spring break , finals , etc .
Well , hmmm .
Most spring breaks fall in March or early April — so it appears that extra free time drove MySpace to its peak — and then what ?
Studiousness swept the land as people got an early jump on studying for finals in mid April ?
And would n’t there have been a similar seasonal downturn last year ?
![ MySpace Traffic May 24 2006 - Two Years ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/publishing2-images/MySpace Alexa May 24 2006 Two Years.png )
Yeah , seasonality , that ’s go to be it .
And that ’s right , I have fallen out of touch with teenage psychology .
I forgot how conformist teenagers are — of course they will continue to embrace MySpace now that ’s gone totally mainstream .
It ’s totally hip to do what everyone else is doing .
Given David ’s brilliant seasonal theory , I wonder when we should see the sharp upturn as everyone finds time to rush back to MySpace .
UPDATE #2
I ’ve been told that I ’m “ so out of touch with this age group , ” so I ’m bringing in an outside expert ( from “ For Teens , MySpace.com Is Just So Last Year “ ) —
“ Amanda Lenhart , a senior researcher for the Pew Internet and American Life Project .
Lenhart has studied teens ’ online behavior since the late 1990s ” :
“ Teens will go where their friends go , ” she said .
“ They ’re always looking for new places to gather .
If those places become viewed as more regulated , they ’ll move on . ”
This is my favorite observation :
Teens like Larios are increasingly finding other social networks that meet their needs — and that are n’t as well known to their parents .
MySpace ’s notoriety could be a turnoff for young people who are looking for an online community of their own
Parents know all about MySpace — yeah , that really makes it a long - term winner for teens .
UPDATE #3
Since I ca n’t respond to this Bloggers Blog post on their site , I ’ll do so here .
It looks like they got their apples and oranges confused — they posted the Alexa REACH chart for MySpace to counter my posting of the PAGE VIEW chart :
![ MySpace Reach May 24 2006 ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/publishing2-images/MySpace Alexa Reach May 24 2006.gif )
So the reach is flat and the page views have dropped .
Yeah , must be because kids are spending more time outside .
I guess we ’ll have to check back in December .
For the record , I have no interest in declaring MySpace “ dead ” — just deeply , deeply vulnerable .
Add colon cancer to the list of maladies that aspirin keeps at bay - but how much is too much ?
Aspirin is what you might call nature ’s little wonder drug .
It relieves pain , lowers fevers , fights heart disease and strokes , and now seems to prevent colon cancer .
All that from tree bark .
Sure it might cause you to bleed profusely from the gut , but it ’s still one of the most trusted and widely used medicines in human history .
Acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) is derived from salicylic acid , a compound found naturally in the bark of the willow tree .
Its use dates back as far as the fifth century BC , when Hippocrates himself wrote about a powder from willow bark that remedied pain and lowered fever .
It was used in its natural , woody format for centuries until the 1880s , when a handful of European chemists synthesized ASA in the lab .
German company Bayer finally trademarked the drug in 1899 ( they lost the trademark in the economic shakeup after World War I , but bought the company that owned it in 1994 ) .
Since its first commercial production , aspirin has remained a popular medicine for all sorts of common aches and illnesses .
But the full extent of its healing powers has only been uncovered in recent years .
Taken regularly , the little white pill enhances bloodflow by reducing the “ stickiness ” of platelets and assists arteries in remaining open , which helps to keep heart attacks and strokes at bay .
Aspirin has also been touted as reducing cancer risks .
The humongous Harvard - based Nurses ’ Health Study , which covers 30 years and almost 80,000 participants , found this March that women on low doses of aspirin ( 81 - milligram “ baby aspirin ” ) were less likely to die from heart disease , stroke or colon cancer .
On the flip side , women who consumed high doses – more than 14 adult tablets ( 325 milligrams each ) per week – did n’t receive health benefits , and were more likely to die from strokes .
On the other hand , a May study combining results from more than 7500 people found that only an adult dose of daily aspirin can lessen colon cancer risk .
An Oxford University study led by Peter Rothwell found that taking 300 milligrams of aspirin every day for five years diminishes the risk of colon cancer by an astounding 74 % over the following 10 – 15 years among both men and women .
Yet most people do n’t consume that much aspirin – not because of any clinical findings but because it can lead to painful stomach bleeding .
The FDA officially warned the public about this side - effect years ago .
A large review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in May found that thousands of Americans are likely sent to the ER needlessly each year for stomach bleeding and that doses higher than 75 to 81 milligrams do not improve cardiovascular health .
So if colon cancer runs in your family ( or you have an overwhelming need to eat vast quantities of red meat ) , you might bother considering the daily adult dose .
For everyone else , it seems baby is best .

" Real Programmers Don't Use PASCAL " -----------------------------------
Back in the good old days -- the " Golden Era " of computers , it was easy to separate the men from the boys ( sometimes called " Real Men " and " Quiche Eaters " in the literature ) .
During this period , the Real Men were the ones that understood computer programming , and the Quiche Eaters were the ones that did n't .
A real computer programmer said things like " DO 10 I =1,10 " and " ABEND " ( they actually talked in capital letters , you understand ) , and the rest of the world said things like " computers are too complicated for me " and " I can't relate to computers -- they 're so impersonal " .
( A previous work [ 1 ] points out that Real Men do n't " relate " to anything , and are n't afraid of being impersonal . )
But , as usual , times change .
We are faced today with a world in which little old ladies can get computers in their microwave ovens , 12 - year - old kids can blow Real Men out of the water playing Asteroids and Pac - Man , and anyone can buy and even understand their very own Personal Computer .
The Real Programmer is in danger of becoming extinct , of being replaced by high - school students with TRASH - 80's .
There is a clear need to point out the differences between the typical high - school junior Pac - Man player and a Real Programmer .
If this difference is made clear , it will give these kids something to aspire to -- a role model , a Father Figure .
It will also help explain to the employers of Real Programmers why it would be a mistake to replace the Real Programmers on their staff with 12 - year - old Pac - Man players ( at a considerable salary savings ) .
LANGUAGES ---------
The easiest way to tell a Real Programmer from the crowd is by the programming language he ( or she ) uses .
Real Programmers use FORTRAN .
Quiche Eaters use PASCAL .
Nicklaus Wirth , the designer of PASCAL , gave a talk once at which he was asked " How do you pronounce your name ? " .
He replied , " You can either call me by name , pronouncing it ' Veert ' , or call me by value , ' Worth ' . "
One can tell immediately from this comment that Nicklaus Wirth is a Quiche Eater .
The only parameter passing mechanism endorsed by Real Programmers is call - by - value - return , as implemented in the IBM \370 FORTRAN -G and H compilers .
Real programmers do n't need all these abstract concepts to get their jobs done -- they are perfectly happy with a keypunch , a FORTRAN - IV compiler , and a beer .
* Real Programmers do List Processing in FORTRAN .
* Real Programmers do String Manipulation in FORTRAN .
* Real Programmers do Accounting ( if they do it at all ) in FORTRAN .
* Real Programmers do Artificial Intelligence programs in FORTRAN .
If you can't do it in FORTRAN , do it in assembly language .
If you can't do it in assembly language , it is n't worth doing .
STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING
----------------------
The academics in computer science have gotten into the " structured programming " rut over the past several years .
They claim that programs are more easily understood if the programmer uses some special language constructs and techniques .
They do n't all agree on exactly which constructs , of course , and the examples they use to show their particular point of view invariably fit on a single page of some obscure journal or another -- clearly not enough of an example to convince anyone .
When I got out of school , I thought I was the best programmer in the world .
I could write an unbeatable tic - tac - toe program , use five different computer languages , and create 1000 - line programs that WORKED .
( Really ! )
Then I got out into the Real World .
My first task in the Real World was to read and understand a 200,000 - line FORTRAN program , then speed it up by a factor of two .
Any Real Programmer will tell you that all the Structured Coding in the world wo n't help you solve a problem like that -- it takes actual talent .
Some quick observations on Real Programmers and Structured Programming : * Real Programmers are n't afraid to use GOTO's .
* Real Programmers can write five - page - long DO loops without getting confused .
* Real Programmers like Arithmetic IF statements -- they make the code more interesting .
* Real Programmers write self - modifying code , especially if they can save 20 nanoseconds in the middle of a tight loop .
* Real Programmers do n't need comments -- the code is obvious .
* Since FORTRAN does n't have a structured IF , REPEAT ... UNTIL , or CASE statement , Real Programmers do n't have to worry about not using them .
Besides , they can to simulated when necessary using assigned GOTO's .
Data Structures have also gotten a lot of press lately .
Abstract Data Types , Structures , Pointers , Lists , and Strings have become popular in certain circles .
Wirth ( the above - mentioned Quiche Eater ) actually wrote an entire book [ 2 ] contending that you could write a program based on data structures , instead of the other way around .
As all Real Programmers know , the on ! useful .
data structure is the Array .
Strings , lists , structures , sets -- these are all special cases of arrays and can be treated that way just as easily without messing up your programming language with all sorts of complications .
The worst thing about fancy data types is that you have to declare them , and Real Programming Languages , as we all know , have implicit typing based on the first letter of the ( six character ) variable name .
OPERATING SYSTEMS
-----------------
What kind of operating system is used by a Real Programmer ?
CP /M?
God forbid -- CP /M , after all , is basically a toy operating system .
Even little old ladies and grade school students can understand and use CP / M .
Unix is a lot more complicated of course -- the typical Unix hacker never can remember what the PRINT command is called this week -- but when it gets right down to it , Unix is a glorified video came .
People do n't do Serious Work on Unix systems : they send jokes around the world on UUCP - net and write adventure games and research papers .
No , your Real Programmer uses 0S\370 .
A good programmer can find and understand the description of the IJK305I error he just got in his JCL manual .
A great programmer can write JCL without referring to the manual at all .
A truly outstanding programmer can find hugs buried in a 6 megabyte core dump without using a hex calculator .
( I have actually seen this done . )
OS is a truly remarkable operating system .
It 's possible to destroy days of work with a single misplaced space , so alertness in the programming staff is encouraged .
The best way to approach the system is through a keypunch .
Some people claim there is a Tire Sharing system that runs on 0S\370 , but after careful study I have come to the conclusion that they were mistaken .
PROGRAMMING TOOLS
----------------
What kind of tools does a Real Programmer use ?
In theory , a Real Programmer could run his programs by keying them into the front panel of the computer .
Back in the days when computers had front panels , this was actually done occasionally .
Your typical Real Programmer knew the entire bootstrap loader by memory in hex , and toggled it in whenever it got destroyed by his program .
( Back then , memory was memory -- it did n't go away when the power went off .
Today , memory either forgets things when you do n't want it to , or remembers things long after they 're better forgotten . )
Legend has it that Seymore Cray , inventor of the Cray I supercomputer and most of Control Data 's computers , actually toggled the first operating system for the CDC7600 in on the front panel from memory when it was first powered on .
Seymore , needless to say , is a Real Programmer .
One of my favorite Real Programmers was a systems programmer for Texas Instruments .
One day he got a long distance call from a user whose system had crashed in the middle of saving some important work .
Jim was able to repair the damage over the phone , getting the user to toggle in disk I /0 instructions at the front panel , repairing system tables in hex , reading register contents back over the phone .
The moral of this story : while a Real Programmer usually includes a keypunch and lineprinter in his toolkit , he can get along with just a front panel and a telephone in emergencies .
In some companies , text editing no longer consists of ten engineers standing in line to use an 029 keypunch .
In fact , the building I work in does n't contain a single keypunch .
The Real Programmer in this situation has to do his work with a " text editor " program .
Most systems supply several text editors to select from , and the Real Programmer must be careful to pick one that reflects his personal style .
Many people believe that the best text editors in the world were written at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center for use on their Alto and Dorado computers [ 3 ] .
Unfortunately , no Real Programmer would ever use a computer whose operating system is called SmallTalk , and would certainly not talk to the computer with a mouse .
Some of the concepts in these Xerox editors have been incorporated into editors running on more reasonably named operating systems -- EMACS and VI being two .
The problem with these editors is that Real Programmers consider " what you see is what you get " to be just as bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women .
No the Real Programmer wants a " you asked for it , you got it " text editor -- complicated , cryptic , powerful , unforgiving , dangerous .
TECO , to be precise .
It has been observed that a TECO command sequence more closely resembles transmission line noise than readable text [ 4 ] .
One of the more entertaining games to play with TECO is to type your name in as a command line and try to guess what it does .
Just about any possible typing error while talking with TECO will probably destroy your program , or even worse -- introduce subtle and mysterious bugs in a once working subroutine .
For this reason , Real Programmers are reluctant to actually edit a program that is close to working .
They find it much easier to just patch the binary object code directly , using a wonderful program called SUPERZAP ( or its equivalent on non-IBM machines ) .
This works so well that many working programs on IBM systems heat no relation to the original FORTRAN code .
In many cases , the original source code is no longer available .
When it comes time to fix a program like this , no manager would even think of sending anything less than a Real Programmer to do the job -- no Quiche Eating structured programmer would even know where to start .
This is called " job security " .
Some programming tools NOT used by Real Programmers : * FORTRAN preprocessors like MORTRAN and RATFOR .
The Cuisinarts of programming -- great for making Quiche .
See comments above on structured programming .
* Source language debuggers .
Real Programmers can read core dumps .
* Compilers with array bounds checking .
They stifle creativity , destroy most of the interesting uses for EQUIVALENCE , and make it impossible to modify the operating system with negative subscripts .
Worst of all , bounds checking is inefficient .
* Source code maintenance systems .
A Real Programmer keeps his code locked up in a card file , because it implies that its owner cannot leave his important programs unguarded [ 5 ] .
THE REAL PROGRAMMER AT WORK ---------------------------
Where does the typical Real Programmer work ?
What kind of programs are worthy of the efforts of so talented an individual ?
You can be sure that no Real Programmer would be caught dead writing accounts - receivable programs in COBOL , or sorting mailing lists for People magazine .
A Real Programmer wants tasks of earth - shaking importance ( literally ! ) .
* Real Programmers work for Los Alamos National Laboratory , writing atomic bomb simulations to run on Cray I supercomputers .
* Real Programmers work for the National Security Agency , decoding Russian transmissions . *
It was largely due to the efforts of thousands of Real Programmers working for NASA that our boys got to the moon and back before the Russkies .
* Real Programmers are at work for Boeing designing the operating systems for cruise missiles .
Some of the most awesome Real Programmers of all work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California .
Many of them know the entire operating system of the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft by heart .
With a combination of large ground - based FORTRAN programs and small spacecraft - based assembly language programs , they are able to do incredible feats of navigation and improvisation -- hitting ten - kilometer wide windows at Saturn after six years in space , Repairing or bypassing damaged sensor platforms , radios , and batteries .
Allegedly , one Real Programmer managed to tuck a pattern - matching program into a few hundred bytes of unused memory in a Voyager spacecraft that searched for , located , and photographed a new moon of Jupiter .
The current plan for the Galileo spacecraft is to use a gravity assist trajectory past Mars on the way to Jupiter .
This trajectory passes within 80 +/- 3 kilometers of the surface of Mars .
Nobody is goinq to trust a PASCAL program ( or a PASCAL programmer ) for navigation to these tolerances .
As you can tell , many of the world 's Real Programmers work for the U.S. Government -- mainly the Defense Department .
This is as it should be .
Recently , however , a black cloud has formed on the Real Programmer horizon .
It seems that some highly placed Quiche Eaters at the Defense Department decided that all Defense programs should be written in some grand unified language called " ADA " ( ( C ) , DoD ) .
For a while , it seemed that ADA was destined to become a language that went against all the precepts of Real Programming -- a language with structure , a language with data types , strong typing , and semicolons .
In short , a language designed to cripple the creativity of the typical Real Programmer .
Fortunately , the language adopted by DoD has enough interesting features to make it approachable -- it 's incredibly complex , includes methods for messing with the operating system and rearranging memory , and Edsgar Dijkstra does n't like it [ 6 ] .
( Dijkstra , as I 'm sure you know , was the author of " GoTos Considered Harmful " -- a landmark work in programming methodology , applauded by PASCAL programmers and Quiche Eaters alike . )
Besides , the determined Real Programmer can write FORTRAN programs in any language .
The Real Programmer might compromise his principles and work on something slightly more trivial than the destruction of life as we know it , providing there 's enough money in it .
There are several Real Programmers building video games at Atari , for example .
( But not playing them -- a Real Programmer knows how to beat the machine every time : no challenge in that . )
Everyone working at LucasFilm is a Real Programmer .
( It would be crazy to turn down the money of fifty million Star Trek fans . )
The proportion of Real Programmers in Computer Graphics is somewhat lower than the norm , mostly because nobody has found a use for computer graphics yet .
On the other hand , all computer graphics is done in FORTRAN , so there are a fair number of people doing graphics in order to avoid having to write COBOL programs .
THE REAL PROGRAMMER AT PLAY
---------------------------
Generally , the Real Programmer plays the same way he works -- with computers .
He is constantly amazed that his employer actually pays him to do what he would be doing for fun anyway ( although he is careful not to express this opinion out loud ) .
Occasionally , the Real Programmer does step out of the office for a breath of fresh air and a beer or two .
Some tips on recognizing Real Programmers away from the computer room : * At a party , the Real Programmers are the ones in the corner talking about operating system security and how to get around it .
*
At a football game , the Real Programmer is the one comparing the plays against his simulations printed on 11 by 14 fanfold paper .
*
At the beach , the Real Programmer is the one drawing flowcharts in the sand .
*
At a funeral , the Real Programmer is the one saying " Poor George .
And he almost had the sort routine working before the coronary . "
*
In a grocery store , the Real Programmer is the one who insists on running the cans past the laser checkout scanner himself , because he never could trust keypunch operators to get it right the first time .
THE REAL PROGRAMMER'S NATURAL HABITAT
-------------------------------------
What sort of environment does the Real Programmer function best in ?
This is an important question for the managers of Real Programmers .
Considering the amount of money it costs to keep one on the staff , it 's best to put him ( or her ) in an environment where he can get his work done .
The typical Real Programmer lives in front of a computer terminal .
Surrounding this terminal are : * Listings of all programs the Real Programmer has ever worked on , piled in roughly chronological order on every flat surface in the office .
*
Some half - dozen or so partly filled cups of cold coffee .
Occasionally , there will be cigarette butts floating in the coffee .
In some cases , the cups will contain Orange Crush .
* Unless he is very good , there will be copies of the OS JCL manual and the Principles of Operation open to some particularly interesting pages .
* Taped to the wall is a line - printer Snoopy calendar for the year 1969 .
* Strewn about the floor are several wrappers for peanut butter filled cheese bars -- the type that are made pre-stale at the bakery so they can't get any worse while waiting in the vending machine .
*
Hiding in the top left - hand drawer of the desk is a stash of double - stuff Oreos for special occasions .
* Underneath the Oreos is a flowcharting template , left there by the previous occupant of the office .
( Real Programmers write programs , not documentation .
Leave that to the maintenance people . )
The Real Programmer is capable of working 30 , 40 , even 50 hours at a stretch , under intense pressure .
In fact , he prefers it that way .
Bad response time does n't bother the Real Programmer -- it gives him a chance to catch a little sleep between compiles .
If there is not enough schedule pressure on the Real Programmer , he tends to make things more challenging by working on some small but interesting part of the problem for the first nine weeks , then finishing the rest in the last week , in two or three 50 - hour marathons .
This not only impresses the hell out of his manager , who was despairing of ever getting the project done on time , but creates a convenient excuse for not doing the documentation .
In general : * No Real Programmer works 9 to 5 ( unless it 's the ones at night ) .
* Real Programmers do n't wear neckties .
* Real Programmers do n't wear high - heeled shoes .
* Real Programmers arrive at work in time for lunch [ 9 ] .
* A Real Programmer might or might not know his wife 's name .
He does , however , know he entire ASCII ( or EBCDIC ) code table .
* Real Programmers do n't know how to cook .
Grocery stores are n't open at three in the morning .
Real Programmers survive on Twinkles and coffee .
THE FUTURE ----------
What of the future ?
It is a matter of some concern to Real Programmers that the latest generation of computer programmers are not being brought up with the same outlook on life as their elders .
Many of them have never seen a computer with a front panel .
Hardly anyone graduating from school these days can do hex arithmetic without a calculator .
College graduates these days are soft -- protected from the realities of programming by source level debuggers , text editors that count parentheses , and " user friendly " operating systems .
Worst of all , some of those alleged " computer scientists " manage to get degrees without ever learning FORTRAN !
Are we destined to become an industry of Unix hackers and PASCAL programmers ?
From my experience , I can only report that the future is bright for Real Programmers everywhere .
Neither OS \370 nor FORTRAN show any signs of dying out , despite all the efforts of PASCAL programmers the world over .
Even more subtle tricks , like adding structured coding constructs to FORTRAN have failed .
Oh sure , some computer vendors have come out with FORTRAN 77 compilers , but every one of them has a way of converting itself back into a FORTRAN 66 compiler at the drop of an option card -- to compile DO loops like God meant them to be .
Even Unix might not be as bad on Real Programmers as it once was .
The latest release of Unix has the potential of an operating system worthy of any Real Programmer -- two different and subtly incompatible user interfaces , an arcane and complicated teletype driver , virtual memory .
If you ignore the fact that it's " structured " , even ' C ' programming can be appreciated hey the Real Programmer : after all , there 's no type checking , variable names are seven , ( ten- eight - ) characters long , and the added bonus of the Pointer data type is thrown in -- like having the best parts of FORTRAN and assembly language in one place .
( Not to mention some of the more creative uses for # define . )
No , the future is n't all that bad .
Why , in the last few years , the popular press has even commented or the bright new crop of computer nerds and hackers ( [ 7 ] and [ 8 ] ) leaving places like Stanford and M.I.T. for the Real World .
From all evidence , the spirit of Real Programming lives on in these young men and women .
As long as there are ill - defined goals , bizarre bugs , and unrealistic schedules , there will be Real Programmers willing to jump in and Solve The Problem , saving the documentation for later .
Long live FORTRAN !

Insurance company memo lays out strategy to fight Michael Moore 's ' Sicko ' Michael Roston
Published : Friday July 6 , 2007 Print This Email This Enjoy this story ?
Get headlines instantly with RSS .
Oscar winning documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has published a memo written by a health insurance company executive on how to respond to his new film , ' Sicko , ' which criticizes shortcomings in America 's current system of private medical insurance .
" [ T ] he impact on small business decision makers , our members , the community , and our employees could be significant , " wrote Barclay Fitzpatrick , Vice President of Corporate Communications at Capital Blue Cross .
" Ignoring its impact might be a successful strategy only if it flops , but that has not been the history of Moore 's films ...
If popular , the movie will have a negative impact on our image in this community . "
RAW STORY was awaiting verification from Fitzpatrick that the memo was real and written by him .
Capital Blue Cross is based in Central Pennsylvania according to its website .
Fitzpatrick went to see the film in order to learn its message and to get a sense of how moviegoers would react to the story Moore tells .
He admitted that the film is effective in getting its message across .
" You would have to be dead to be unaffected by Moore 's movie , he is an effective storyteller , " Fitzpatrick wrote in the memo .
But he also accused Moore of misleading viewers of the film .
" As a health care industry educated viewer it is easy to pick out where Moore is cultivating misperceptions to further a political agenda , but you will also recognize that 80 % + of the audience will have their perceptions substantially affected , " he wrote .
Fitzpatrick ends his memo by including a set of talking points written by the Blue Cross / Blue Shield Association to rebut key claims in Sicko .
He was particularly concerned with the lumping of the not - for - profit Blue Cross / Blue Shield insurers in with for profit providers like Kaiser Permanente and Humana .
In response , Moore wrote on his website that he sought to debate the health insurance executive at the company in question .
" No more secret memos and hand wringing about the millions seeing ' Sicko , ' " he declared .
" Just me and your CEO openly debating the merits of a system that kills thousands of innocent Americans every year . "

Steny Hoyer and John Conyers just pulled a fast one on the GOP .
The GOP has been refusing to support the hate crimes bill because it does n't include members of the US Armed Forces and senior citizens .
Conyers just rose and basically said , okay , I 'll add them .
The Republicans ' response ?
Uh , no .
The Republicans have been railing for days about how this legislation does n't cover our Armed Forces and senior citizens , and now that the Dems offer to put our Armed Forces and seniors in this legislation , the Republicans said no and affirmatively stopped the Democrats from doing it anyway .
That means the Republicans had no intent on helping our Armed Forces and seniors , on protecting them .
It was just a stunt .
The GOP leaders in Congress just got up and used our Armed Forces and seniors as political fodder when they had no intent on actually doing anything to help our Armed Forces and seniors .
Here is Steny Hoyer 's statement , it 's a doozy .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks about hate crimes bill .
Wow , a rather amazing floor speech by Rep. Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) .
Wow .
Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL )
A few years ago , I decided to fry up a mess of smallmouth bass from my parents ' pond .
But when we – okay , my mom – started to clean the fish , they were full of parasites .
After identifying them ( thank you , Maine Fish & Wildlife Service ! )
I hopped online to learn more about the parasites .
What I found was amazing .
The parasites , known as yellow grubs , have a very circuitous life cycle .
The eggs are passed into the water by fish - eating birds like heron , then picked up by fish .
The more parasites that infest a fish , the more likely it is to swim near the surface – making it more likely to be eaten by a bird , inside of which the parasites lay their eggs .
And so the cycle of parasite life continues .
What caught my attention was the relationship between parasite population density and the odds of a fish being eaten .
Clearly , natural selection favored those parasites whose interactions caused the fish to adopt the riskiest behaviors – but I 'd always thought of evolution as a process that operated on individual adaptations , rather than group behaviors .
Talking with scientists , I learned that group selection is central to the storied , sometimes controversial field of superorganism theory , in which a population of creatures can be seen not as a collection of disparate individuals but as a high - level organism unto itself .
A leader in superorganism studies is Arizona State University 's Bert Hoelldobler .
I posted on his latest theory of evolution and altruism last month , and yesterday managed to get him on the phone .
( On a side note , I had to call him at the office of E.O. Wilson , with whom he 's writing a book on superorganisms . )
I asked him to explain the history of superorganism theory , and he graciously obliged :
The history is complicated .
In the early beginning of last century , it was William Wheeler and Alfred Emerson , two eminent entomologists , who compared insect societies to an organism .
They did n't use the term superorganism , but said that each unit is like a cell in a body , or an organ .
The reproductive units are the queens .
The picture was very popular .
It was taken over by philosophers , and all sort of things seen as superorganisms – a town , a city .
But it became so exaggerated that it became useless , more a philosophical issue than a biological issue .
The biological concept of the superorganism then experienced a demise with the better understanding of sociogenetics – understanding that insect societies are not so homogeneous on a genetic basis . [...]
For that reason , Wheeler 's superorganism concept was demolished , not taken seriously anymore .
The focus was more on the individuals in the colony
\– what is their selective advantage to not having offspring and taking care of the sisters .
The more we understood about genetics , the more the focus was on the gene .
Then , with the burst of inclusive fitness theory , better known as kinship selection theory , came a shift of thinking .
The work focused on how individual genes spread in a population , especially those genes , for example , that code for altruistic behavior , which the social insects have to the extreme .
Honeybees commit hara - kiri for sake of the colony – this was a puzzle to us .
( Darwin had even said , if I do n't resolve this problem , how such altruistic genes can be selected by natural selection , then the theory fails .
How can altruistic traits be selected and propagated if those who show it do n't reproduce ?
He said , unless I solve this problem , I can throw away whole theory .
Then Darwin found the solution : it was at that time a superorganism solution , but not in the Wheeler sense .
Darwin said , the target of selection does n't have to be individuals , but the group of the whole family .
And , basically , he was right . )
But as population genetics developed in the 60s , when Hamilton 's big papers came out , everyone focused on individuals and on the gene .
Richard Dawkins wrote The Selfish Gene , which was brilliant but totally gene - level .
Richard even said , it 's the gene that 's selected .
Classical evolutionary biologists say that selection works on the phenotype , the whole organism , and genes are the unit of selection .
We see the change of gene frequencies , but the process of selecting is the whole organism .
Arguing back and forth , the British school [ won ] : it all depends on the gene .
This has changed .
Now , slowly , there was again a focus on the phenotype , which is affected by selection .
Everyone agrees on this issue .
Through selection , gene frequency changed .
If a gene codes for a particular behavior , which gives the individual a carrier of the gene an advantage to reproducing , then identical copies represented in offspring .
Individuals who are better - adapted will have more offspring .
But it 's the individual , the carrier of this gene , who carries many other genes , that is exposed to selection .
When we breed , we select whole animals .
Now , slowly , guys like me and Ed Wilson who work on insects , began to say that the colony is the target of selection .
We came under fire for this , but slowly it 's been understood , now everyone agrees , that there is a multi - level selction : that selection can work on the individual , on the kin group , maybe even the group that is not a kin group .
So this is the theory .
I 'm an experimental behavioral biologist , my career committed to understanding the workings of insect societies : the mechanisms that make such a huge group of individuals , sometimes 20 million , work .
I work on communication mechanisms , what regulates division of labor among reproductive individuals – and you cannot help but come back and see these highly evolved societies , like leafcutter ants , as an organism .
To be continued ....
The First Digit Law
November 21 , 2006 at 12:57 am
If I were to pick a random city in the world , and tell you its population , what might the first digit of that number be ?
You may think there ’s equal probability for the first digit to be 1 to 9 , but over 30 % of the time it ’s 1 ( one ) .
Why ?
Think about it this way : let ’s say a stock price doubles every year , starting at $ 100 / share ; it would spend a year with a first digit of 1 until it reaches $ 200 , a year as $ 2x x or $ 3x x until it reaches $ 400 , a year as $ 4x x , $ 5x x , $ 6x x , or $ 7xx , and then just a month or so at $ 8 x x or $ 9xx , and all of a sudden it ’s at $ 1,000 and the first digit is 1 again .
Now it takes a long time ( a year ) to reach $ 2,000 .
There is a disproportionate amount of time when the stock price begins with the digit 1 .
Many things in nature increase logarithmically .
Benford observed this first - digit phenomenon in places including populations , addresses , baseball statistics , area of rivers , specific heats of compounds , and death rates .
This rule has been used to identify accounting fraud where made - up numbers do n’t match the distribution found in real accounting numbers .
Benford sampled over 20,000 numbers , and noticed the distribution of numbers was as follows ,
Digit Occurence 1 30.6 % 2 18.5 % 3 12.4 % 4 9.4 % 5 8.0 % 6 6.4 % 7 5.1 % 8 4.9 % 9 4.7 %
This can be closely modeled using the log distribution of
F_a = log ( 1 + 1/a )
where F_a is the frequency that the digit a is the first digit in used numbers .
Additionally , the frequency of the n-th digit of a number can also be calculated using a similar formula , presented in the paper .
This is the law of anomalous numbers .
We ’ve learned to count 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , … but nature counts 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , …

Green technology is n't always very green
If I see one more article about how wonderful alternative energy is compared to oil , I 'm gonna flip .
Alternative energy sources can be good — very good in fact .
And it 's pretty obvious that we 're going to need them , and that our dependence on oil ( foreign or otherwise ) is a Bad Thing .
But accepting that does not mean accepting that any kind of alternative energy is by default a good thing .
To be a good thing , it has to have three properties : 1 ) It has to help reduce our dependence on oil , 2 ) It has to be no worse for the environment , and 3 ) It has to be economically practical .
Many of the things touted meet one or even two of those criteria .
Solar panels , for example .
They can reduce our need for oil , at least in certain regions , and they 're certainly not bad for the environment .
But they 're prohibitively expensive .
If you spend the money to make your home solar - powered , you probably wo n't recoup your costs for at least 15 years , which approaches the lifespan of the panels .
I realize that these days , taking a moderate position on anything makes you the enemy of everyone who has an extreme view .
But green is n't always good , and oil is n't always bad .
Certainly we need to clean up our act big time and find viable sources of alternative energy .
Depending on the Saudis — and oil — for our energy needs is stupid .
But we also have to keep in mind that every one of these alternative - energy sources comes at a cost , which is something people seem to forget .
They hear the phrase " alternative energy " and automatically assume it 's got to be good .
And this makes them no better than the people who hear it and think it 's a waste of time .
It 's not easy being green
Two seemingly " green " technologies that pop up again and again are ethanol and electric cars .
Both are touted by well - meaning people as good for the environment and a way to reduce our oil dependence , especially as oil prices continue to rise .
I 've written in detail about ethanol before , but it deserves a rehash .
The Senate , you see , is considering a bill that would require a doubling of the amount of ethanol mixed with gasoline at the pump .
They say it 's about oil dependence and the environment , but it 's not .
It 's about buying votes from farmers by artificially creating demand for crops — ethanol coming , in large part , from corn .
But there are a bunch of problems with ethanol .
First , it does n't have as much energy as gasoline , which means it takes about 1.5 gallons of ethanol to get you as far as one gallon of gas .
Ethanol also requires a lot to produce it — 26 pounds of corn to get a gallon , in fact .
And growing corn requires lots of water and fertilizer and pesticide , not to mention the energy required to distill it into ethanol .
And by - products of that distillation include ( according to the EPA ) acetic acid , carbon monoxide , formaldehyde , and methanol , all of which are pumped into the air .
Yum .
It boils down to this : Ethanol sounds good , but the energy required to produce it , and the pollutants it generates , mean it 's arguably worse for the environment than gasoline , especially considering the cleanliness of today 's engines .
On the other hand , even with the acreage , water , fertilizer , and pesticide , ethanol has one big thing going for it :
It 's not produced by the Saudis .
It 's electric Hearing the un-researched praises heaped on ethanol sets my teeth on edge , but hearing the supposed ecological wonders of electric cars makes me want to bang my head against the desk .
( I 'm talking about true electric vehicles , not hybrids . )
Electric cars are dirty .
In fact , not only are they dirty , they might even be more dirty than their gasoline - powered cousins .
People in California love to talk about " zero- emissions vehicles , " but people in California seem to be clueless about where electricity comes from .
How else can you explain a state that uses more and more of it while not allowing new power plants to be built ?
Quoth Schoolhouse Rock : " Power plants most all use fire to make it : electricity , electricity / Burnin ' fuel and usin ' steam , they generate electricity — electricity . "
Aside from the few folks who have their roofs covered with solar cells , we get our electricity from generators .
Generators are fueled by something — usually a hydrocarbon ( coal , oil , diesel ) but also by heat generated in nuclear power plants .
( There are a few wind farms and geothermal plants as well , but by far we get electricity by burning something . )
In other words , those " zero- emissions " cars are likely coal - burning cars .
It 's just the coal is burned somewhere else so it looks clean .
It is n't .
It 's as if the California Greens are covering their eyes —
" If I ca n't see it , it 's not happening . "
But it 's worse than that .
Gasoline is an incredibly efficient way to power a vehicle ; a gallon of gas has a lot of energy in it .
But when you take that gas ( or another fuel ) and first use it to make electricity , you waste a nice chunk of that energy , mostly in the form of wasted heat — at the generator , through the transmission lines , etc .
In other words , a gallon of gas may propel your car 25 miles .
But the electricity you get from that gallon of gas wo n't get you nearly as far — so electric cars burn more fuel than gas - powered ones .
If our electricity came mostly from nukes , or geothermal , or hydro , or solar , or wind , then an electric car truly would be clean .
But for political , technical , and economic reasons , we do n't use much of those energy sources .
We should , but we do n't — that means those electric cars have a dirty past .
Furthermore , today 's cars are very , very clean .
I 'd be willing to bet they 're a lot cleaner than coal - burning power plants .
And that 's not even getting into whatever toxic niceties are in those electric cars ' batteries — stuff that will eventually end up in a landfill .
And finally , when cars are the polluters , the pollution is spread across all the roads .
When it 's a power plant , though , all the junk is in one place .
Nature is very good at cleaning up when things are not too concentrated , but it takes a lot longer when all the garbage is in one spot .
Being green is good .
We 've squandered our space program on things like the International Space Money Pit , so we wo n't be leaving the planet very soon .
It 's what we 've got and we should do better at taking care of it .
But that does n't mean we should jump on any technology labeled " green " anymore than investors should have jumped on any stock labeled " tech " in the 1990s .
We know what happened there .

( Editor ’s Note : This was first posted at ATP four years ago on November 27 , 2006 .
It remains one of our favorite ATP posts and we are re-posting it today on its fourth anniversary ) .
Pakistan is a country of many ethnic groups and cultures .
This is apparent not only in the looks of its people and the different languages and dialects they speak , but also in their traditions and dress .
One of the things a first time visitor to Pakistan would notice is the variety of caps and turbans Pakistani men wear , particularly in the rural areas .
( Urban Pakistanis , especially the educated class , are mostly bareheaded . )
With increased travel and TV exposure , the caps worn in one part of the country have also been adopted by people in other parts , but , still , the cap or turban a Pakistani wears could give away his ethnicity and , at times , even his social status .
The North - West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) and Gilgit - Baltistan have the largest variety of men’s headwear , the most common being the pakol , also known as Chitrali cap — that flat , round cap with a little brim , which , when not worn , looks somewhat like a Frisby and , if thrown into the air , could even fly like one for a short distance .
The pakol is made out of coarse woolen cloth , locally known as pattoo .
The pattoo is first sewn into the shape of a cylinder , about a foot or more long .
One end of the cylinder is capped with a round piece of the same material , slightly wider than the cylinder itself .
The woolen cylinder is then inverted and fitted onto a round wooden block ; the rim of the woolen cylinder is then rolled up to the top .
The flat top protrudes a little over the rolled - up edge to give the cap a tiny brim .
Otherwise , all Pakistani headwear , unlike the Western hats , is brimless .
This is so because Muslims pray with their heads covered ; a brimmed cap or Western hat would interfere with the sajdah ( act of prostration during prayers ) .
The little brim of the pakol , however , presents no such problem .
The cap comes in various colors : white , gray , and different shades of brown .
The pakol is believed to have originated in Afghanistan , where it is a popular headwear among the people of Northern Afghanistan .
The West got to look at this cap , and even like it , during the Soviet - Afghan war when Ahmad Shah Masud , an icon of the Soviet - Afghan war , and his fighters were often seen on TV and newspapers wearing this cap .
Some online stores began selling the pakol to the Western customers , both men and women , and probably still do .
In the southern and eastern Afghanistan , however , particularly since the advent of the Taliban , turbans have become a more common headwear .
In Chitral , and Gilgit - Baltistan , the white color pakol is more popular and is sometimes worn with a peacock plume stuck in the folds , like a badge , on the front or the side of the cap .
The deep blue and green of the peacock feather , set against the white of the cap , is quite eye catching .
Because of the woolen material , pakol is basically a cold weather cap .
In particularly chilly weather , the cap can be unrolled and pulled down over the ears , like a ski cap .
Worn this way , it may look sloppy but is effective against the cold .
However , when worn properly , the edges rolled up and the cap sitting lightly on the head at a slight angle , it is a smart looking cap .
Personally , I like this cap and occasionally wear it , too , in the winters .
The only problem I find with it is , since it is made of coarse woolen cloth , it is very itchy on the forehead .
I wish someone would think of lining the inside of the rim of the cap with some soft material .
The pakol also has another , unintended , use .
It can be used as money pouch .
Often , you see people , particularly the daily - wage laborers , when shopping at the the khokas and tandoors , retrieving the money out of the folds of their cap , and then carefully putting the change back .
Another cap , which is common in the NWFP , is the round , white cotton cap with a flat top , commonly worn by the madrassa students .
It resembles an overturned bowl or a cake mould with vertical walls and a flat top .
This is an all - weather cap and is much cheaper than the pakol .
( It is different from the white crocheted skullcap usually worn by many people all over the country , while going to the mosque ) .
Another flamboyant cap , the Swati cap , called so because it originated in Swat district of NWFP , is similar in shape to the white cotton cap mentioned earlier but is heavily embroidered with ’ tilla ’ or golden thread .
It ’s a colorful and attractive cap , usually worn by youngsters .
Also , coincidentally , it was , and probably still is , quite popular among the ‘ tanga - wallas ’ ( the horse carriage drivers ) and ‘ battair baaz ’ ( people who keep quails as pets and train them as fighter birds ) of Peshawar .
The social reputation of these people , not quite spotless , also rubbed on this otherwise attractive Swati cap and , therefore , it did not become popular among the educated and sophisticated classes of the NWFP .— or , perhaps , because it was too gaudy or loud for sophisticated taste .
Yet another cap that is worn more in the NWFP than anywhere else in Pakistan is the karakul or karakuli .
It originated in Central Asia .
While the pakol and the white cotton caps are worn by young , old , rich and poor alike , the karakul cap is worn by relatively well - to - do people .
A genuine karakul cap can be expensive .
Karakul , actually , is the name of a family of sheep bred in Central Asia .
This particular breed is known for its soft and curly pelt .
Shorter and tighter curls signify a better quality pelt .
The best quality pelt , however , is obtained from the sheep ’s kid when it is still in the mother ’s womb .
The pregnant sheep is slaughtered to get to the fetus , and then the fetus is killed to get the pelt .
( I wonder how the pro-life activists would react to the karakul cap . )
The karakul cap comes in two shapes : Collapsible boat - shaped and the hard oval - shaped .
In the later years of his life , Mohammad Ali Jinnah , the Quaid - e - Azam of Pakistan , started wearing the boat - shaped karakul cap along with achkan and shalwar in public .
Because of him , the boat - shaped karakul cap came to be known as Jinnah Cap .
The name still holds .
Later , President Ayub Khan also wore a karakul cap , the hard oval - shaped version , with his Western suits .
He wore it with a slight tilt , and the cap sat well on him .
During his presidency , when the US First Lady , Jacqueline Kennedy , came visiting and went to Peshawar , she was presented with a dark colored karakul cap by her hosts , which she wore , possibly emulating Ayub Khan , at a slight angle .
By wearing that cap , Jacqueline Kennedy not only complemented her hosts but also stood out as a striking figure in the crowd .
A boat - shaped karakul and a striped , green gown has also become the trademark attire of President Karzai of Afghanistan .
One cannot think of a cap that could be associated with Punjab .
The province is virtually “ cap-less ” .
Punjab is the land of ‘ pugs ’ , ‘ pugrees ’ or turbans .
However , one cap that can still be seen in Punjab , even though only occasionally , is the rumi topi , also known as fez in English and tarboosh in Arabic .
The rumi topi originated in the city of Fez in Morocco , hence the name fez .
Somewhere in the mid 19th century , the then Ottoman Sultan , in order to “ modernize ” Turkey and its armed forces , adopted the fez as national headwear , along with a Western style uniform for its armed forces .
Since the Ottoman Empire at that time extended to Egypt , Iraq and other Arab lands , the fez was adopted in those countries as well .
That is where it got the Arabic name tarboosh .
The Muslims of the Indo - Pak subcontinent , attracted to the Caliphate or Khilafat , among other things Middle - Eastern , adopted the fez as part of their Muslim attire , and gave it the name rumi topi .
( Turkey , also known as Rum in the Muslim world because of its earlier connection with the Roman Empire , then was the home of the Caliphate . )
Mustafa Kamal , however , abolished the Caliphate and along with it all its symbols , including the fez , in 1924 - 25 .
Instead , he introduced the Western hat .
But the fez stayed with the Indian Muslims until well after the establishment of Pakistan .
If one looks at the old pictures of the period of the Pakistan movement and soon after , one can see many fez caps in them .
The rulers of Bahawalpur state in Pakistan wore fez caps , possibly because of their Abbasi connection with Baghdad , and even made it mandatory for their staff and soldiers as long as the state was an autonomous part of Pakistan .
One of the most prominent Pakistani politicians who wore the fez all his life was Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan .
In fact , the fez – and hukka – became his identification .
Sindh has its own distinctive cap , which stands out for its colorful embroidery and glasswork .
The Sindhi cap is round in shape except that a portion in front is cut out to expose the forehead , possibly for religious reasons , as explained earlier .
It comes in two varieties : hard and soft .
The hard variety , when not worn , keeps its shape , but the soft variety can be folded , and even put into one ’s picket .
Many Sindhis , rich or poor , own a Sindhi cap and routinely wear it .
The Sindhi cap is also used in Balochistan , both by the Pashtuns and the Baloch .
Balochistan , otherwise , is land of distinctive turbans .
More on turbans in a different post .

The evening entertainment for roughly 500 financial executives at the Deutsche Bank global derivatives conference last month in Barcelona did not come cheap — the Rolling Stones reportedly were paid more than $ 5 million .
“ The best part is , it ’s coming out of your bonuses , ” Mick Jagger joked to the crowd .
The hosts of the conference could well afford it .
After all , the business of creating new finance vehicles like derivatives and structured products has exploded in recent years .
And at the time of the conference , there remained a mostly rosy view of such instruments , because of their ability to help businesses and investors spread out risk .
But the global financial turmoil — set off by problems with subprime mortgages — has prompted a backlash in some quarters against such financial engineering .
More broadly , it has led to a better understanding of the downside of spreading risk so well — it can be felt in all corners of the world , unsettling hedge funds , banks and stock markets as far away as Australia , Thailand and Germany .
In effect , reducing risk on a global scale appears to have increased it for some players .

A bit of a furor erupted last year , when a company decided to fire current employees who smoke , and no longer hire smokers .
The debate centered around the question of whether an employee paying for your health care could force you to cease unhealthy habits .
This was a bit of a debate , but for the most part , nobody outside of some libertarians really stuck up for the smokers , because smokers are “ icky ” and nobody likes them .
Discrimination against hated minorities rarely results in condemnation .
Now , though , a health - care company is raising the stakes , by telling their own employees they ’ll be fined for poor health :
For employees at Clarian Health , feeling the burn of trying to lose weight will take on new meaning .
In late June , the Indianapolis - based hospital system announced that starting in 2009 , it will fine employees $ 10 per paycheck if their body mass index ( BMI , a ratio of height to weight that measures body fat ) is over 30 .
If their cholesterol , blood pressure , and glucose levels are too high , they ’ll be charged $ 5 for each standard they do n’t meet .
Ditto if they smoke : Starting next year , they ’ll be charged another $ 5 in each check .
It is understandable for people to think this crosses some sort of line .
This essentially means that a company has shares in your health and consequentially , they want to see a decent return on their investment .
Maybe , as workers , we are more accustomed to employees trying to improve us in a professional sense rather than our health .
Things like workplace mentoring have been common for a long period of time , but an obsession with our BMI is relatively new .
More of this , of course , is inevitable .
Government intervention has created huge incentives for employers to provide healthcare to workers and made it nearly impossible for workers to self - insure .
However , some companies may have decided to introduce a health insurance plan for employees , to help them receive more benefits from this type of plan .
For example , small businesses may decide to self - insure their employees so that it has a better chance of suiting their healthcare needs .
When it comes to having healthcare for your business , it is easier than many people may think .
As health should be the top priority , it makes sense for employers to put this in place for their staff .
At the same time , anti-discrimination laws have made it impossible for employers to revoke coverage for high - risk individuals .
Due to this ( and a host of other interventions ) , healthcare costs are skyrocketing and employers are looking for any way to cut costs .
But the government has offered some clarification that relaxed the rules , and companies are taking advantage of it .
In addition , regulations that became effective July 1 could prompt cautious employers to step off the sidelines .
The federal government recently issued final rules on how wellness programs could comply with the nondiscrimination conditions of the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) .
While the new regulations have been proposed for years , the final rules provide employers with some sense of security and more clarification on how much they can reward or penalize employees based on specific health results .
“ When you get into things that involve discrimination , employers are n’t very comfortable with the words ‘ proposed regulation , ' ” says Jerry Ripperger , director of consumer health for the Principal Financial Group , a financial - services and insurance firm that offers wellness programs for large employers .
In fact , many would propose other means to go about improving employees morale and health over systems like this .
So put the two together , and employers are going to do anything in their power to cut their healthcare premiums .
Of course , anything in their power must take into effect employee morale , especially in an economy with low unemployment , where the desire to hire and retain talent requires that you keep those employees happy .
And some employees may not be happy :
Clarian Health admits that its program is aggressive by design , and that employee reaction has been mixed , with much debate on its internal message boards .
While some employees were supportive , there ’s been “ the other reaction that this is very personal , ” says Wantz , with people asking , “ ‘ How dare you ?
This is my personal space . ’
There ’s been a lot of questions and confusion . ”
Herein lies the problem .
Most people do n’t like being told what they must do with their bodies .
They do n’t like it especially when it ’s their employer , a relationship that already has the potential to be adversarial .
But employees are incorrect when they refer to this as “ personal ” space .
Insure yourself , and it ’s personal space .
Expect someone else to pay your health insurance premiums , and it no longer affects just you .
I can guarantee that most employees will not like this development , but as I ’ve always said with government , money and control come hand in hand .
You ’re taking their money , and you ’re surprised they want to keep their costs down by keeping you in a low - risk group ?
Sadly , while I support such efforts by companies to set their own insurance policies , I fear that this will lead to the wrong backlash .
If more employers head down this road , it will only increase the call for single - payer socialized medicine .
Americans do n’t want to pay for their own health care , and certainly do n’t want their boss telling them to drop a few pounds .
To them , the only alternative will be government .
Government control wo n’t help , of course .
Government will have the same ( likely worse ) rationing problems that private insurance has .
The costs will go through the roof .
And if you think your employer telling you what to do and not to do is bad , do you think it will be any better with the government in charge ?
DIGG THIS
We ’re at the brink of the police state , the Orwellian 1984 surveillance and control society , and on top of this horror there seems to be an environmental disaster approaching .
All kinds of bad things seem to be happening in the not so distant future .
The war on drugs seems to be losing , it might not work as good as we thought and if we do n’t do anything about it , it might fail .
The war on terrorism seems hopeless ; no matter how much money is spent , how many laws are enacted , or how much controls are enforced , the terrorists might always be one step ahead of us .
The war in ( on ) Iraq is not going too well ; unless more troops are sent there and more money invested in stifling resistance and wiping out insurgents the war might be lost .
Government spending is increasing rapidly and the national debt is increasing even faster ; unless things change we might end up a bankrupt nation .
Public schools seem to be unable to educate our children ; the number of people not learning how to read in our schools is increasing — if nothing is done things might become very , very bad .
The quality of public health care might turn into a right - out nightmare if we do n’t do anything .
There is one common denominator in the above paragraphs : they are all about horrors that might become real in the future .
Not a single one of them discusses the outright and obvious failure of each and every one of these policies and issues — they all might fail , they are approaching failure , they could go wrong if nothing is done .
How come we as humans always tend to realize the real risk of horrors tomorrow , but not understanding the horrors that are already upon us ?
We are not at the brink of an Orwellian police state — it is already here .
The wars on drugs , terrorism , poverty , and Iraq are n’t approaching failure — they have failed , and failed good .
People say we should learn from history or we might relive its horrors — history tends to repeat itself because we do n’t know about it or consider our collective experience of sufficient importance .
There is truth to these words , but why do we think people could learn from history when most of us regularly fail to identify the nature of the now ?
If we can not even see what we ’re in the midst of , then how can we expect to learn from the experience of previous years — or even previous generations ?
The fact is we ’re doomed to have history repeat itself simply because we always aim for the future — we never stop to bethink what we really have and what mess we ’re in , our minds are fixed on what might be .
This is a huge problem , not only because we as individuals might lose the greater part of our lives simply because we ’re not living it — we ’re living only in dreams of the future .
The real problem is political .
In a world where people tend to forget the now and always aim for the dream of a possible future , political policies become very , very important .
Of course , politics is short - term rather than long - term , but political decisions are made in the not too distant future and enforced soon thereafter — only after that do they have effect .
Politics cements and reinforces the illusion of life being in the future rather than in the now — it forcefully teaches that the uncertainty of the future can only be managed by government .
It is in the interest of political power to keep people from seeing the horrors of today .
Whatever is happening in the now can be settled in the future — a little more power granted government , and the future is safe .
We do not really care about the thousands of dead American soldiers on foreign soil as long as we have our eyes fixed on the possibility of a future terrorist attack .
We do n’t really care about our rights going down the drain if we have our minds on possible horrors in the future .
What are dead soldiers and rights anyway , if we believe someone we know could be killed or harmed in the future — especially if dead soldiers and annulled rights might establish control of the future ?
This is the fact that makes the size of government expand — if people only think of the future , government plans bring order and control to a seemingly chaotic and uncertain existence .
Most people would give up benefits of the now for profits of the future — we ’re all investors .
The problem is that we ’re tricked to believe that the future is a threat and that government is the savior .
We ’re not at the brink of a police state — habeas corpus is already gone .
We ’re not about to lose the wars on drugs and Iraq — they ’re already lost , and were probably lost even before they started .
We ’re not , as a nation , about to get broke — we ’re so deep in debt that it is already quite impossible " do something . "
We do n’t see a school system becoming unable to educate our children — the system has already failed .
The quality of health care and health care systems is n’t about to fall — it has already fallen .
Face it , we ’re already there .
It is time to see the now and its horrors — there ’s no time to plan to do something ; it is well past time to act .

Facebook CLEARWATER , Fla .  Prosthetic specialist Kevin Carroll travels the country tackling the toughest human amputation cases , so it was only natural that he was also drawn to Winter — the only known dolphin to survive the loss of her powerful tail flukes .
" My heart went out to her , and I was thinking I could probably put a tail on her , " said Carroll , vice president of prosthetics at Hanger Orthopedic Group , Inc .
Recreating one of the most powerful swimming mechanisms in nature turned out to be a lot tougher than expected .
But after months of experimenting , Carroll and a unique team of experts are well on their way to , as one of them puts it , " MacGyvering " a tail for Winter .
Unlike the 1980s cult TV hero " MacGyver , " who worked his way out of tight spots with everyday items , much of what Winter 's team is creating is first - of - its - kind stuff .
" We put together a team who does n't know what ' no ' means , " said Mike Walsh , Winter 's lead veterinarian and a program manager at the University of Florida 's aquatic animal health program .
" As long as you 're willing to try , you can make a big difference . "
Lessons can also be learned that will help human amputees .
Carroll , for example , found the gel sleeve he developed to cling to 18 - month - old Winter 's tail without irritating her sensitive skin also soothed a painful prothesis for Air Force Senior Airman Brian Kolfage , who lost both legs and his right hand in a 2004 mortar attack in Iraq .
The sleeve sticks to Winter 's tail with suction the same way a rubber surgical glove grips a human hand .
" When he tried to walk with prosthetics , you had these dagger - like boney growths sticking into the socket .
It was very painful , " Carroll said .
" Brian 's situation was similar to Winter's .
Winter helped him and hopefully she 'll help a lot of others as well . "
Carroll , an Orlando resident whose company is based in Bethesda , Md. , said he is already thinking of new materials to make human prosthetics tougher in saltwater .
And Walsh said the research on Winter is invaluable for understanding dolphin physiology and the treatment of back injuries , which can occur when dolphins are beached .
Winter lives at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium , a non-profit marine animal rescue center and popular local attraction located in the Gulf Coast city 's former water treatment plant .
She was a frail , dehydrated 3 - month - old when she came to the hospital in December 2005 .
A fisherman found her tangled in the buoy line of a crab trap in Indian River Lagoon near Cape Canaveral .
The line cut off the blood supply to her tail and it slowly fell off like shreds of paper as the aquarium team worked to save her life .
Winter learned how to swim without her tail , which is used for propulsion — amazing her handlers with a unique combination of moves that resemble an alligator 's undulating swimming style and a shark 's side - to - side tail swipes .
Winter uses her flippers , normally employed for steering and braking , to get moving .
But her unique swimming style is sure to lead to spinal problems .
She already sometimes bends her spine in an unnatural curve .
Trainers work with Winter , now 6 - feet - long and a healthy 180 pounds on an extensive physical therapy regimen , bending the tail up and down , to keep the right muscles strong .
Walsh said allowing Winter to work out daily with a prosthetic tail may keep her from deteriorating .
It is unlikely she will wear the tail full - time .
It 's uncharted territory .
Fuji , an elderly dolphin that lives at an aquarium in Japan , has a prosthesis , but it is attached to the remaining part of his tail .
Both of Winter 's tail flukes and peduncle , a wrist - like joint that allows a dolphin tail to move up and down , were lost .
Winter 's team also has to figure out how to keep the prosthesis from sliding off as the tail creates enough force to propel a 400 - pound dolphin out of the water and 10 feet into the air .
" Every step we take is unknown , " Clearwater Marine Aquarium CEO David Yates said .
" Another group came to us , analyzed her and said ... they did n't know how to make the tail stay on .
But Kevin came to us and said we 've got the technology .
We can do this . "
Carroll , who like the others on Winter 's team volunteers his time and resources , began by brainstorming elaborate vacuum attachments , but eventually settled on the simple silicone gel sleeve .
Handlers slide the sleeve over Winter 's stump and move her tail in up and down motions , teaching her how to swim like a normal dolphin when the prosthesis is attached .
It is a slow process .
They do n't want Winter to balk at the strange new attachment .
" I thought I could go down , cast her ( tail stump ) and put the tail on her , " Carroll said .
" I did n't understand the training that had to go with each fitting of the tail .
Working with Winter , we 're on her time , not my time .
If she 's ready to do something , we move forward .
It 's the same way working with a child .
It takes a lot of time . "
The team plans to keep socializing Winter with new pieces until , at a point yet to be determined , they will attach the first artificial tail flukes .
They plan to start out with small flukes that create a little resistance .
" She is the perfect dolphin for what she has to do , " Yates said , watching Winter toy with a herring in her tank .
" A lot of dolphins might reject this up front .
But every step of the way she has excelled in everything we have asked her to do . "
One day soon , Winter 's new prosthetic should have her keeping pace with the aquarium 's two rambunctious male dolphins , Nicholas and Indy .

Elephants have been found to recognise themselves in a mirror , putting them in an exclusive club of self - awareness whose other members are great apes ( including humans ) and bottlenose dolphins .
" The social complexity of the elephant , its well - known altruistic behaviour and , of course , its huge brain , made the elephant a logical candidate species for testing in front of a mirror , " said Joshua Plotnik , a psychologist at Emory University in Atlanta , who led a team whose study was published yesterday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
An 8ft mirror was put in the elephant enclosure at the Bronx zoo in New York and a watch kept on its three inhabitants .
The first question was if they greeted their reflection as if meeting another individual - they did not make this mistake , and used the mirror to inspect themselves , for example , moving their trunks to look at the inside of their mouths .
" Elephants have been tested in front of mirrors before , but previous studies used relatively small mirrors kept out of the elephants ' reach , " Dr Plotnik said .
" This study is the first to test the animals in front of a huge mirror they could touch , rub against , and try to look behind . "
Inspecting the mirror and trying to look behind it - as did the Bronx elephants - is another indicator of self - awareness .
One of the three also passed the " mark " test when painted in a place it would normally be unable to see .
It touched the paint mark on its head after looking in the mirror .
Diana Reiss of Columbia University in New York said that the research helped explain the society in which elephants lived : " Humans , great apes , dolphins and elephants , well known for their superior intelligence and complex social systems , are thought to possess the highest forms of empathy and altruism in the animal kingdom . "
The reactions to my How To Write A Kids '
Book column were amazing , ranging from , " How dare you , my child is not dumb ! " to , " Until your column , I 'd never noticed that my child was smaller than I am ! " to , " Sure , you taught us how to write a story with a chair as the main character , but what about one in which it 's an animal ? "
So let 's get started !
Step 1 .
Think of an animal .
Let 's use " rhino " .
( It does n't matter which animal , since all animals can be made to look cute , by drawing them in a cardigan . )
Step 2 .
Think of what the animal 's " problem " is .
It 's best if this relates to some actual trait of the animal .
For example , let 's say our rhino , " Fred " , has a bent horn ( aka Bent Horn Syndrome ) .
Let 's say Fred 's BHS repulses the other animals , who never invite him to their parties .
( Here we might have a drawing of Fred contemplating suicide while gazing sadly into a mirror at the horrible , twisted , phallic monstrosity at the end of his snout . )
Step 3 .
Introduce a character sympathetic to Fred 's plight - an elderly rhino , perhaps , whose horn is not bent , just calcium - deprived / droopy .
Wait , we may be getting into strange , Viagra - suggestive waters , so let 's say Fred has a youthful giraffe friend , " Pierre " , born without a neck .
I mean his head literally sits right on his shoulders .
What a freak .
Yikes .
No way can he eat fruit off the top of a tree .
Unless the tree has fallen down in a storm or something .
Anyway , Fred and Pierre run away together to some place known for its openness - southern California , for instance .
Step 4 .
The community is glad these two freaks have flown the coop .
Step 5 . Something befalls the community , something that only Fred and Pierre can solve .
This is the hard part .
Whatever befalls the community must be solvable by , and only by , a rhino with a bent horn working in close coordination with a neckless giraffe .
Also , somehow , Fred and Pierre must be made aware of this in Los Angeles , and be able to get back from LA in time to solve the problem before it kills the other animals .
A tough problem .
But I know you can solve it .
So could I , if I wanted to .
After all , I am a professional .
But this is your story .
If I give you a fish , and you eat the fish , you get a stomach ache because I did not cook the fish , and also it is rife with mercury .
Whereas if I teach you to test for mercury , you could get a good job at , say , Dow Chemical , eat nothing but steak , and never have to write a stupid kids ' book and go on a degrading tour and read night after night to a crowd of tiny ingrates rolling around on the floor while picking their noses and digging at their rears , whining that they want to go home .
Now : begin writing .

ActionScript 3 : The Language of Flex
A Conversation with James Ward , Part I

Summary Adobe announced this week that it would release the next version of its Flex SDK , Flex 3 , under the open - source Mozilla license .
The language used to create Flex applications is ActionScript 3 , an object - oriented , functional programming language .
ActionScript 3 is also Adobe 's implementation of ECMAScript 4 , the upcoming version of JavaScript .
In the first segment of a two - part interview with Artima , Adobe Flex evangelist James Ward introduces the key ActionScript 3 language features from the vantage point of developers coming to ActionScript from Java .

ActionScript 3 is also Adobe 's implementation of ECMAScript 4 , the upcoming version of JavaScript .
In the first segment of a two - part interview with Artima , Adobe Flex evangelist James Ward introduces the key ActionScript 3 language features from the vantage point of developers coming to ActionScript from Java .
Frank Sommers : What is ActionScript ?
James Ward : ActionScript 3 is our implementation of the ECMAScript 262 , Revision 4 standard .
That 's the same standard JavaScript 2.0 will be based on , once browsers officially support that version of JavaScript .
We 've done a few things differently from the ECMAScript standard , and the reason for that was that the standard was n't actually finalized when we built Flash 9 and Flex 2 .
We had to make some assumptions about what things would be in the spec before the spec was ratified by the ECMAScript standards committee .
As a result , there are probably a few slight variances between what we implemented in ActionScript 3 and the final ECMAScript specification , which , I believe , is still not final yet .
: What will surprise a Java developer the most when first encountering ActionScript 3 code ? : Java developers will recognize and get to know the ActionScript 3 language very quickly .
The syntax is very similar to Java's , and there are all the object - oriented features you 're familiar from Java , such as extending classes and implementing interfaces .
The similar syntax allows Java developers to very quickly come up to speed by not having to really learn a brand new language .
They can just focus on learning the slight differences from Java syntax , and learn how to actually use the ActionScript 3 language within the context of the Flash Virtual Machine .
One of the biggest differences from Java is optional static typing in ActionScript 3 .
When I came from Java to Flex , I was struck by the fact that I did n't have to type everything .
I could type things , when I felt that typing was important , and when I wanted code hinting in the IDE , and compile and runtime type checking , but then there were places when typing did n't matter so much .
There are places when you can leave things untyped or , to put it differently , dynamically typed .
Optional typing made me have to do a bit of a mental shift from how I , as a typical Java developer , really saw languages .
There are just a few differences in syntax from Java .
The package declaration is almost the same , with the one difference that we put curly braces inside the package keyword , so when you define a class , the class definition goes inside the curly braces within the package declaration .
Your import statements go inside that same block .
Instead of declaring methods , you explicitly have to say that something is a function , with the function keyword , and your function 's return types are specified with a colon after the function name .
Variables are defined with the var keyword , followed by the variable name , and then the type of the variable , if you want to specify a variable type .
ActionScript has very similar namespaces to Java's : private , public , protected .
If you do n't want something to be public , private , or protected , and want instead to have your own name space that you can use internally , you can define that namespace as well .
If you have a variable , or an inner class , for instance , that you only want to be accessed from , say , just two other classes , then you can create a custom namespace and use that namespace in just those two classes .
That gives you more flexibility in how you can structure your code .
You can apply private , public , protected , or any other name space you create , on your class or a variable or a function .
It 's a bit different from how you 'd do that in Java , but once you get the hang of it , you can get used to it and find it quite useful .
The Flex framework uses this technique pretty heavily .
We have an mx_internal namespace that we use for variables that we think could change in the future and that you should n't rely on .
But if you did want to get access to one of these variables , you could import the mx_internal namespace , and then have access to the variables in that namespace .
By default , users do n't see those variables .
Function
: What are some features Java has that ActionScript does n't offer ? :
A lot of the new features that were added in Java 5 are n't available in ActionScript yet : generics and annotations , for instance .
Other than those , just about all the normal object - oriented Java features that you 'd expect are there .
And ActionScript 3 has features that Java might have in the future .
For all intents and purposes , for example , ActionScript 3 has a closures - like mechanism . : Does ActionScript 3 support JavaScript 's functional language features ? :
The functional aspects of ActionScript 3 are very similar to JavaScript's .
We do have a top - level object called .
You can define functions inline , for instance , for callbacks .
When you specify functions , a lot of times you may want to pull them out and use them as closure functions , and that 's also available .
Often , when you specify a listener in ActionScript 3 , you would pass a function as the listener , which , in turn , will pass a reference to that function .
In ActionScript 3 , you can do prototype - based classes , just as you can in JavaScript .
In Flex , we hide that because we prefer the other style of object - orientedness : creating classes and extending them in the typical Java - like way .
If you wanted to , you could get to the prototype stuff , and still do things through the prototype , though .
Other than the optional static typing , the only major difference between JavaScript in the browser and Flex 's ActionScript 3 , is the DOM that each language is implemented against .
In the browser , the DOM is the browser 's DOM , while Flex makes a different DOM available to you , that of the Flash Player .
If you take the DOM differences out of the equation , then the languages are almost completely portable .
I actually have taken a JavaScript library , a few thousand lines of JavaScript , and copied and pasted that into Flex .
With a few minor changes , I was able to get that API running as an ActionScript 3 Flex API .
Optional Static Typing
String
: I thought that static typing was an either / or proposition :
You either had it , or you did n't .
How does optional static typing work in practice ? :
Optional static typing means you can just mix and match :
You can have a variable that is of type , and the next variable can be dynamically typed .
The Flex compiler will give you a warning , but the code will still compile and run just fine .
There are also keywords like is and as that allow you to do casting on objects .
If you wanted to find out what type an object really was , you can do that through those keywords .
In a function call , for instance , you may not want to require a specific type , but inside the function implementation you may want different logic based on what type you were getting .
In that case , you can find out the object 's specific type .
One of the places where you see the benefits of optional static typing is when you start pulling in Web services data that is n't SOAP , but come from RESTful or JSON - style Web services .
You could go through all the work to type the whole response and convert everything into typed objects .
But a lot of times the interfaces of the Web services that you 're talking to are n't themselves very statically typed .
Those interfaces do n't necessarily follow a consistent object model .
That 's one place where I typically do n't force my objects into being statically typed .
When you talk to the Flikr API , for instance , and you decided to define a bunch of objects that represent their API , if Flikr changes the data their API exposes , you would have to change your object model , too .
Static typing may not buy you much in that case .
With dynamic typing , as long as they used the same names , everything would continue to work .
Flex takes advantage of optional static tying in a couple of places .
Flex defines an HTTP Service , for instance .
[ Editor 's note : The HTTP Service is an object - oriented client - side HTTP API . ]
You can get back your response from the HTTP Service in a couple of different ways .
The default way is to take all the XML you get back from a RESTful service call , and deserialize that response into basic objects : not typed objects , but objects that are basically just hashmaps or name - value pairs .
You can also have the HTTP service give you back E4X objects , which is ActionScript 's XML API .
You can then execute XPath - style queries on that response , for instance .
And you can also write your own custom deserializer to go through the XML tree and deserialize that into typed ActionScript objects .
One way to think about optional static typing is by comparing it to untyped Java collections .
You can stick any type object into a collection , and then cast that object back into its type when you need to know the specific object type .
In Flex , if you define a variable to be of type Object , then you can set any property you want on that object .
You do n't have to specify in advance the properties of that object , but can , instead , go in and arbitrarily set properties on the object .
If you create an instance of an object foo , you can just say , foo . name = " a new String " .
That would set the name property on that object , even though you never defined a name property for that object before .
You can also add functions to an object in a similar way :
You can just say , foo .
doSomething = something , where something is a specification of a function .
XML as a Native Type
Frank Sommers : You mentioned E4X , ActionScript 's native XML support .
What advantages does E4X provide over other XML processing APIs ?
James Ward : XML is a native data type in ActionScript 3 .
One way we support XML is through E4X , which is an ECMA standard , and is part of the ECMAScript language .
We chose to follow the standard instead of creating our own XML support in the language .
E4X is an XQuery - and XPath - like language for manipulating XML structures .
The query language built into E4X makes it easy to find elements , or collections of elements , in your XML tree , pull elements out , or set and add elements to XML structures .
ActionScript , and Flex , also have facilities to take ActionScript objects and serialize them into XML and back .
While E4X is very powerful and convenient for many XML - related tasks , you have the choice of whether to deal with XML objects , or whether to serialize XML objects into your ActionScript objects , and then use those ActionScript objects in your code .
Those with a Java background may find the latter more natural .
But once you get used to E4X , you may find it very convenient , too .
The Flex API
: I 'd like to turn from core language features to the ActionScript and Flex APIs .
What similarities and differences will a Java developer find when working with the Flex APIs ? :
To give you a bit of a background , the Flex framework is a bunch of classes that help you build rich - client applications on top of the underlying ActionScript implementations .
Flex allows you to use those ActionScript classes , and it compiles the ActionScript into bytecode that then runs within the Flash Virtual Machine .
The Flex framework classes define the containers , layouts , and controls , and are all implemented in ActionScript .
The source code for the whole Flex framework is shipped with the Flex SDK .
You can go in and see how all of those components are built , and you can extend those components as well with ActionScript code .
It 's also possible to not use anything that Flex provides , and just build from scratch your own ActionScript rich - client framework .
You could conceivably build anything you 'd want on top of the Flash Player DOM , using Flash Player 's ability to draw lines , do vector graphics , and use all the things that the Flash VM can do .
All the Flash animations you see people do on the Web are built to run on the Flash VM , so you can conceivably go in and use the low - level drawing APIs to create animations , draw lines with nice anti-aliasing , display and record video , and so on .
But you do n't have to do that , because Flex gives you all the components built for you , including very rich UI controls , such as a data grid .
In your application , you can just create an instance of the data grid , for example , and then you can override any of the methods in that component , including default styles and properties .
The Flex components use the low - level Flash API to draw lines , and basically take advantage of the rich media capabilities of the Flash VM .
With the Flex API , you 're programming at a higher level , and do n't have to learn the low - level details of how the components and effects are actually implemented .
At the same time , one difference from Swing , for instance , is that with Flex you could go really low - level , if you wanted to , because those low - level Flash API calls are available to any Flex application .
You could even mix high - level Flex API calls with low - level Flash API calls .
If you did n't like how something looked in Flex , you could go in and do some lower - level graphics calls to change how a component looked .
You could also use that technique to set custom item renderers , too .
In practice , you will very rarely , if ever , need to do that because Flex exposes a very rich set of component properties .
The other differences from Java come from the media - handling capabilities of the Flash VM , such as video and audio playback capabilities .
Media support has been built into the Flash player for a long time now , and that 's one of the areas where the Flash VM really shines .
Flash was built with the idea to allow people to create multimedia experiences on the Web .
Flex applications can easily take advantage of all those rich - media capabilities .
Video and audio integration with the Flex API is very simple and straightforward .
If you wanted to have your Web cam record some video and broadcast that video out to other computers , that takes only a few lines of code to accomplish in Flex .
You just find the Camera object in the API , and call a few methods on that object .
Playing back video is similarly simple :
You can use the VideoDisplay object , and point that to a URL .
Out of the box , we support the FLV format , which is Flash Video , the SWF format , which is the regular Flash format ,

RIO BRANCO , Brazil — Perhaps it is nothing more than a legend , as skeptics say .
Or maybe it is real , as those who claim to have seen it avow .
But the mere mention of the mapinguary , the giant slothlike monster of the Amazon , is enough to send shivers down the spines of almost all who dwell in the world ’s largest rain forest .
The folklore here is full of tales of encounters with the creature , and nearly every Indian tribe in the Amazon , including those that have had no contact with one another , have a word for the mapinguary ( pronounced ma- ping - wahr - EE ) .
The name is usually translated as “ the roaring animal ” or “ the fetid beast . ”
So widespread and so consistent are such accounts that in recent years a few scientists have organized expeditions to try to find the creature .
They have not succeeded , but at least one says he can explain the beast and its origins .
“ It is quite clear to me that the legend of the mapinguary is based on human contact with the last of the ground sloths , ” thousands of years ago , said David Oren , a former director of research at the Goeldi Institute in Belém , at the mouth of the Amazon River .
“ We know that extinct species can survive as legends for hundreds of years .
But whether such an animal still exists or not is another question , one we ca n’t answer yet . ”

WASHINGTON -- News that Al Gore 's 24 - year - old son , Al Gore III , was busted for pot and assorted prescription pills last week unleashed a torrent of mirth in certain quarters .
Gore - phobes on the Internet apparently view the son's arrest and incarceration as comeuppance for the father 's shortcomings .
Especially rich was the fact that young
Al was driving a Toyota Prius when he was pulled over for going 100 mph - just as Papa Gore was set to preside over concerts during a seven - continent Live Earth celebration to raise awareness about global warming .
Whatever one may feel about the former vice president 's environmental obsessions , his son's problems are no one 's cause for celebration .
The younger Mr. Gore 's high - profile arrest does , however , offer Americans an opportunity to get real about drug prohibition , and especially about marijuana laws .
For the record , I have no interest in marijuana except as a public policy matter .
My personal drug of choice is a heavenly elixir made from crushed grapes .
Tasty , attractive and highly ritualized in our culture , wine and other alcoholic beverages are approved for responsible use despite the fact that alcoholism and attendant problems are a plague , while responsible use of a weed that , at worst , makes people boring and hungry is criminal .
Pot smokers might revolt if they were n't so mellow .
Efforts over the past few decades to relax marijuana laws have been moderately successful .
Twelve states have decriminalized marijuana , which usually means no prison or criminal record for first - time possession of small amounts for personal use .
Yet even now , federal law enforcement agents raid the homes of terminally ill patients who use marijuana for relief from suffering in states where medical marijuana use is permitted .
Beyond the medical issue is the practical question of criminalizing otherwise good citizens for consuming a nontoxic substance - described by the British medical journal Lancet as less harmful to health than alcohol or tobacco - at great economic and social cost .
Each year , more than 700,000 people are arrested for marijuana - related offenses at a cost of more than $ 7 billion , according to the Marijuana Policy Project .
If marijuana were legalized , regulated and taxed at the rates applied to alcohol and tobacco , revenues would reach about $ 6.2 billion annually , according to an open letter signed by 500 economists who urged President Bush and other public officials to debate marijuana prohibition .
Among those economists were three Nobel Prize winners , including the late Milton Friedman of Stanford 's Hoover Institution .
Mr. Friedman and others were acting in response to a 2005 report on the budgetary implications of marijuana prohibition by Jeffrey Miron , visiting professor of economics at Harvard .
By Mr. Miron 's estimate , regulating marijuana would save about $ 7.7 billion annually in government prohibition enforcement - $ 2.4 billion at the federal level and $ 5.3 billion at the state and local levels .
Add to that amount income taxes that would have to be paid by marijuana producers .
Drug dealers do n't pay taxes , after all .
Nor do they concern themselves much with rules of the workplace and worker welfare .
Mr. Miron argues that legalizing marijuana would not increase use because decriminalization has n't increased use .
But , he says , legalization would reduce crime by neutralizing dealers and eliminating the violent black market .
Legalizing marijuana is n't an endorsement of underage or irresponsible use .
Best would be that everyone deal with life unmedicated , but adults arguably have a right to amuse themselves in ways that do n't harm others .
While some may balk at the idea of legalized pot , it seems clear that some remedy is in order .
At the very least , a fresh debate free of politics and bureaucratic self - interest is overdue .
Maybe Al Gore could moderate .

Drinking as little as one can of soda a day -- regular or diet -- is associated with a 48 % increased risk of metabolic syndrome , a key predecessor of heart disease and diabetes , according to results released Monday .
Researchers knew that drinking regular sodas contributed to the risk of metabolic syndrome , but this is the first finding implicating diet sodas , according to results published online in Circulation : Journal of the American Heart Assn .
The researchers were uncertain why diet soda seemed to have such a large effect .
The study ’s lead author , Dr. Ramachandran S. Vasan of the Boston University School of Medicine , said it was unlikely that an ingredient in soda caused the effect .
More likely is that consuming sweet sodas changes dietary patterns or that soda was simply a marker for participants ’ poor eating habits , he said .
Advertisement
Dr. Meir Stampfer of the Harvard School of Public Health , who was not involved in the study , said the findings were not unexpected , although he added , “ I ’m surprised by the magnitude of the association . ”
Stampfer has previously reported that diet sodas increase the risk of obesity and high blood pressure .
Soda makers rejected the study .
“ The assertions defy the existing body of scientific evidence , as well as common sense , ” said Susan K. Neely , president and chief executive of the American Beverage Assn .
She continued : “ It is scientifically implausible to suggest that diet soft drinks -- a beverage that is 99 % water -- cause weight gain or elevated blood pressure . ”

Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of symptoms including excessive abdominal fat , high blood - glucose levels , high blood pressure , high blood triglycerides and low levels of high - density lipoprotein , the so - called good cholesterol .
People with three or more of these symptoms have double the normal risk of heart disease and diabetes .
In the study , sponsored by the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute , Vasan and his colleagues studied more than 2,400 middle - age white residents of Framingham , Mass .
At the beginning of the study , those who had consumed more than one soda per day -- either regular or diet -- had a 48 % higher risk of having metabolic syndrome .
Advertisement
The team then focused on the more than 1,600 people who did not have metabolic syndrome at the start of the study and followed them for at least four years .
Those who drank at least one soda a day had a 44 % higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome during the four years of the study .
Those who drank at least one soda per day also had :
* a 31 % greater risk of becoming obese ;
Advertisement
* a 30 % higher risk of having a larger waist line ;
* a 25 % higher risk of developing high blood triglycerides or high blood sugar ;
* a 32 % greater risk of having low levels of good cholesterol ;
* a trend toward an increased risk of high blood pressure .
Advertisement
The percentages were the same whether subjects drank regular or diet soda .
Vasan said a great deal of research had shown that people who drank sodas also tended to have diets higher in calories , saturated fats and trans fats and lower in fiber .
They are also more sedentary .
The authors tried to control for all those factors in the diet , but “ even after all that , we still found an increased risk , ” he said .
“ Maybe it is very difficult to adjust for lifestyle . ”
Another possibility is that drinking soda with a meal reduces the feeling of satiety , so that the person eats more at the next meal , he said .
Advertisement
Alternatively , drinking sweet sodas may get people used to a sweet taste and “ into the snacking mode , ” Stampfer said .
“ It ’s not the artificial sweetener , but what goes along with it . ”
None of those theories , however , has been confirmed by experiments .
“ Our task is to report associations , ” Vasan said .
“ We do not claim that this is a causal link .
It is up to scientists to help us understand this better . ”
In a statement on Monday , the American Heart Assn. said that diet soda remained “ a good option to replace caloric beverages that do not contain important vitamins and minerals . ”

Water , diet soft drinks and fat - free or low - fat milk remain better choices than full - calorie soft drinks , the group said .

Christian Boot Camp Officials Drag 15 yo Girl Behind Van Posted by Pile ( 78907 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Mean People ]
Arrest warrants have been issued for two officials at a Christian boot camp , Love Demonstrated Ministries , accused of dragging a 15 - year - old girl behind a van after she fell behind the group during a morning run , authorities said .
Charles Eugene Flowers and Stephanie Bassitt of San Antonio - based Love Demonstrated Ministries , a 32 - day boot camp , are facing aggravated assault charges for the alleged June 12 incident .
The two were accused of tying the girl to the van with a rope then dragging her , according to an arrest affidavit filed Wednesday by the Nueces County Sheriff 's Department .
Arrest affidavits for Flowers and Bassitt list a $ 100,000 bond .
Flowers , the camp 's director , allegedly ordered Bassitt to run alongside the girl after she fell behind , the affidavit said .
When the girl stopped running , Bassitt allegedly yelled at her and pinned her to the ground while Flowers tied the rope to her , according to the affidavit .

I sent my daughter to this bootcamp 8 years ago and would gladly do it again with no hesitation .
This camp has been operating for 13 years straight with no complaints and GREAT results .
This man has helped thousands of youth ( mostly at his own expense ) and it's hard to sit and read all these people pointing fingers who I 'll bet mostly sit on their butts and do nothing to help the youth .

Posted by Andy ( Andrew ) Smith on 2007-08- 11 11:14:10 Sending impressionable children to be indoctrinated at a religion camp is much worse than physically abusing them by hauling them behind a vehicle .
At least the child will recover from the effects of physical abuse - they might never recover from the sick abuse of religious indoctrination .
Forcing religion on a minor is a crime worse than child molestation - thoroughly sick .

She 's in the cult only because her parents brainwashed her to be in it .

How it works .
1. ' Christian ' boot camp is set up using large sum of taxpayer money , because politically influencial people believe all christians to be Good People .
2. Camp staff let power influence them , grow corrupt and abusive , eventually there is a scandle .
3a . Either : Coverup is initiated , no charges pressed , a few people fired , everyone tries to forget until the next incident goes public .
3b . Or : Camp loses its funding , but its supportors announce that no ' true Christian ' could be so harmful , and therefore this was n't * really * a Christian camp .
Thus , a * real * Christian camp can still be trusted .
Return to step one .
4. Regardless of 3 , the camp continues to operate because it can offload responsibility onto one or two individuals .
If it loses government funding , may reposition itsself as an agressive camp for restoring the faith to children who wander ( See camp Love in Action , where parents can send their
Oh , and I know of at least two other Christian camps that have been caught physically abusing occupents sent there against their will .
The aforementioned Love in Action , and a camp in Argentina whose name I dont recall .
Both of them perfectly legal , because those suffering are minors , and all abuse occurs with parential permission .

Think about that for a minute ... divide by 10 ... if they had only 10 employees they would each be getting paid just under 28 k I dunno about you but for me I would consider that a sucky salary ...
And if the camp was already established there wouldnt ' be huge costs associated with it .
General maintenance , food , supplies , etc. $ 36,124 plus profit should probably cover that .

Wow !
Your authority for that remark is " what " ?
" You are condeming this camp and dont have a clue what your talking about . "
If the charges they allege are true , then everyone who is posting that the defendants are scum is absolutely dead on .
" Just let the kid go and maybe they can kill someone and be a drain on society by spending tax dollars on them . "
Your point is completely inane .
Your justification is that these righteous people somehow * deserve * to abuse children as long as the outcome is that they " might not " commit crimes in the future .
What is missing from your justification is 1 ) documented evidence that the methods are successful , and 2 ) that other means might have worked better .
In short , your justification ( more of a rationalization , really ) is that the ends justify the means .
Sound like the line we heard from Communists for decades .
No thanks .
" There has to be some order in this world and it wont be long until you will see what I mean . "
Yeah , just like the Communists promised us order .
" God is going to put an end to this world as we know it . "

" You do realize that this story is based on the allegations made by the person filing the suit . "
While VoR is correct that everyone has the right to the presumption of innocence , the police have taken action in this case .
Read the stories .
Each of these individuals are being held in jail on $ 100 k bail .
That means this is more than just a civil suit , this is a criminal action .
" Does anyone ever make false charges ? "
Yes , they do .
And I would assume that the police investigate the facts to determine whether the allegations are supported by the facts .
They evaluated the witness statements ( independent of the victim ) , examined the photographic evidence ( the photos taken at the hospital by attending physicians and nursing staff ) , and took statements from other members of the Love Demonstrated Ministries .
All of this was probably done between June 12th and this week when the arrests were made .
That is nearly two months .
I do n't consider that a rush to judgment .
I think the police did their jobs .
" It is way too early to be making all of these judgements . "
As to their guilt ?
You 're right .
But our ability to comment on the alleged behavior of the councilor and director is not only timely but justified based on the severity of the abuse .
" We have n't heard from any other witnesses either for or against . "
We have n't , but the police have .
" Wait to make your pronouncements until all of the facts are in . "
No thanks .
I 've heard so many religious people weigh in that the problem with society is that no one expresses their outrage at egregious behavior anymore , and now when that behavior exhibits itself someone is telling me that we should withhold our judgment ?
Bottom line

I found this site by googling " san antonio pastor arrested " .
One poster is right in that I have no right to accuse those who are bashing Pastor Chas .
before due process of not doing their part in helping youth , I have no way of knowing that !
Of course , at issue here is a 15 year old who is claiming abuse .
Due process will straighten all that out .
Last night was the graduation banquet for the entire CBC " flight " .
It was very inspiring to hear the young people tell how the camp has helped them .
Awesome .
Bottom line , Christian boot camp is an organization that has helped thousands of youth get their lives on track and those who serve in the leadership have sacrificed much to do so .
No , I do not work for CBC but know personally many people who have been through the program .
Many desribe it as the best thing that ever happened to them .
I am aware that some boot camp type organzations have issues .
This one however is long established , respected and has proven to be a great asset to the youth of San Antonio and the surrounding area .
I am looking forward to how these proceedings go ( and to getting my Pastor back ! )

If this camp is closed you can send your childer to my place for the summer .
I will teach them about my GOD ( SATIN BE HAILED !!! ) .
They will learn about drugs ; and I dont mean just using either .
While CBC was a good place for pot connections I feal that todays youth should learn about the wholesale and retail distribution of narcotics as well .
Allways a good trade to fall back on in hard times .
Sex education .
It sould be taught as early as possiable .
While this nation might have been founded under GOD it never states just which GOD .
My God ,
You god , his god or her god .
Just shake off the haters ..... shake shake shake
shake that booty , shake that booty ...

I am f*cking sick of these ignorant foreigners lumping Americans in to one pot , the ugly spoiled American destroying the free world .
First off I cant stand our foreign policies right now , I say pull all of our resources back to the home front and watch as the rest off the world self destructs and it will why , because you need us .
Something you do n't see , or you inane f*cktards do n't acknowledge is , that we as Americans have huge harts and are financially in a position to help in a time of need as we have for decades knowing god dam good and well there will be no return on our money .
So I ask all these American hating sand sniffing ass holes , what have you done lately to better the free world ( burning the US flag does not count ) .
So why dont you go look in the mirror and ask what have I done lately and when you cat think of a f*cking thing , punch your self in the throat and SHUT THE f*ck UP you jealous pricks .
Way the f*ck of topic , all I can say is where the f*ck has god been the last 100 years rubbing one out over his mass creation no , you see he to sold his sole to the devil , for a piece o ass a bottle of jack and bag o grass stfu

Why , because it is generally accepted in the BLACK community to have sex with a minor you guys have no morals .
We as Anglo Saxons ( that means white people ) find it rather appalling or maybe , it is a racist deal and mass Media does not give tow shits about the African American community but what ever it is we defiantly should have the great REV .
Jessy Jackson maybe Al Sharpten or the NAACP look in to it umm k .
You know if you guys would shut the f*ck up about racism and not not bring up , right that will be the day , that poor dead horse has been trampled .

Dragging someone behind a car is inhuman and sick , period .
Stop with the racist bullsh*t , because skin colour is about as important as hair colour .
Get it in your head , uall , that America also depends on the rest of the world for EVERYTHING , is not self - sufficient , and maybe learn a few things about other cultures and avoid the stereotyping .
And lastly , to the idiot that keeps spamming " Fresh Prince " lyrics : how original , now please waste time doing something constructive .

this isnt a laughing matter dumbass .

now can you please cite your references ?
you know , where you found the name of the christian based boot camp that claims to change the lives of youth over a summer but acutally beat and rape the trainees ....
COME ON !!
theres absolutely no credibility to anything your saying .
Go back to english class you dumbass !

no one knows what youre talking about

Satans going to take people like you to the fires of hell first ... sorry man ... you still have time though ...
come on guys .
from now on can please try and speak like intelligent human beings by thinking things over thoroughly before writing them ?
you people previously mentioned are giving Americans a bad wrap ... how about nobody says anything until the 15 year old girl and her parents speak out publicly ?
then maybe we can see the OTHER side of the story ...
Posted by KNOW THE CAMP on 2007-08-17 00:45:06
My brother has gone to this camp 2 years in a row .
I do n't believe these allegations for a second .
The mom turned in the photos to the police .
Anyone ever check to see if the mom put these marks on her in an attempt to get money .
I know I believe that more than Pastor Charles putting the marks on her .
If the girl could n't handle the camp then she should have quit and gone home like the little baby she is , instead of lying and ruining a man 's career .
And to the person who said he went to the camp and was raped , you wish you were a graduate from the camp , but you could n't handle it , and do n't flatter yourself and make us all believe that they wanted you .

Flowers has not admitted whether or not he and / or Bassitt were involved nor has he EVER denied that this happened .
Those who are coming to his defense forget that there was a witness independent from the girl and her mother who filed a police report .
His followers also seem to be overlooking the fact that both the camp employees were INDICTED .
The Grand Jury does not take allegations like this lightly or without FACTS to back up the charges .
If you listen to the news reports , Flowers and his attorneys are trying to paint ALL of the kids who have participated in this boot camp as CRIMINALS , troubled youth who will lie when confronted with an authoritative figure -- EVEN THE ONES WHO ARE COMING TO HIS DEFENSE !
Hello !!??!!
How 's that for blind faith ?
Why do people think that just because a person has no history of doing something bad , they are n't capable of it ?
That 's just ignorant .
They probably still think OJ 's innocent , too .

Every time some religious zealot tells me I am going to Hell because I do n't believe in his / her version of the fairy tale , I get more cynical about organized religion .
You finger - suckers are so far away from God , you will never get to Heaven , let alone bring other souls with you .
Satan is so deep in your churches that you think he is God.
Would Jesus send you to boot camp ?
HELL NO !
He 'd lead you around Galilee helping the sick and feeding the poor , and making you watch until you could n't stand it .
Then
He would say , " Go where thou wilt . "
You would then be inclined to help others on your own , living by His example .
Forcing your kids to believe in fairy tales , and torturing them to condition them , is disgusting , inhumane , and NOT Christ - like .
You should all be ashamed of yourselves .
If you were one of their victims and you enjoyed it , I am so , so sorry for you that you could n't protect yourself from their brainwashing as a young and impressionable child .

I do not like your Christians .

Posted by chad on 2007-09 - 24 03:35:42
Helping troubled teenagers with boot camps is useful in many cases .
Boot camp can help parents and families in trouble .
To find good boot camps , parents must search for boot camps on internet .
I totally believe he did it
Posted by My Mom worked for CBC and I know the man on 2007-10-01 20:07:07 I did tons of research into this case ...
First , the ammount of money reported to have been donated IS , in fact , CORRECT .
My mother was a head councelor for the girls ...
She recieved $ 1000.00 for 3 months worth of work .
The school they held CBC at [ before the current location ] donated the property to the organization .
They did n't have to pay for it .
So , we 're expected to believe they spent 250,000.00 on food and sleeping bags ???
Also , the kids being treated , vandalized the entire facility , including defecation inside the buildings and on the walls .
No money was paid for the repairs ... instead , those responsible were forced to clean it up .
So , my question is where is all this money ?
Can you say , FRAUD ???
I also have witnessed Charles when he is upset or angry ... not a pretty sight .
Also , I have witnessed Charles ' public exposure of other people 's " sins " against the congregation ... everything from pre-marital sex to public atonement and requests [ from the pulpit ] from the guilty parties to the entire church on Sunday mornings .
In Charles own words , " What transpired publicly must be rectified publicly . "
When has Charles spoken to the News Media or anyone outside the church about this issue ?
To my knowledge he has n't .
Also , I happen to know the other people posting on this site and have to say , at best , they are not the most educated or logical of people .
For example ...
Byron Spears is the praise and worship leader of the church and has spent the last 20 years of his life ducking all personal responsibility to his family by sitting on his fat ass in his " studio " , trying to finish a " masterpiece " known as the Last Adam .
Weird how this musical genius can't get anything produced or better yet , get a real job and stop trying to follow " God 's path for his life in the ministry " .
If God knows all and sees all and , in fact , wants his people to be blessed ...
Why are all the people supporting Charles living below His Own Financial Tax Bracket ???
This is not the first time that Faith Outreach has been in the news .
It 's just the first time , since Bud left , that they have ducked the media and tried to keep quiet on the issue .
Charles is just another bogus individual trying to be " Above " the human condition by denying the fact that he is , in fact , human and makes mistakes .
I would have had tons of respect for him if he had lived by his own judgemental words and been upfront about the situation .
As it is ...
He 's just another one in the long line of people who spout BS at people but do n't believe it applies to themselves .
Now Charles can sit back and join the " club " of people who have been in a position of power in that church to hang their heads in shame .
So , Charles , tell Bud , Doug and Nevile I said Hello ...
As the scripture says , " Let everything hidden be seen . "
This is God 's way of revealing to people what is really going on in FOCI ... unfortunately , God loves everyone , including people who are too stupid to see the truth when it sits right in front of them .
All due to simple blind loyalty and deification of their leaders .
In other words ...
Get a clue and grow up .
If you really believe in what you speak , then do n't be one of the ones Christ looks at and says , " Depart from me , I never knew you . "
Sincerly , " The One That Got Away " [ I guess God loves me more than you ...]

Well , I did manage to finish Charles ' new album in my ' studio ' - and it's pretty nice , mostly cover songs - but He does a very good job vocally .
And , fat ?
Whose fat ?
Fat is a relative term .
I think I 'm more " pleasingly plump " than fat .
BTW - if you have something to say to Chas .
why do n't you call him and tell him instead of bashing him / us anonymously here ?

FEDERAL CHARGES DROPPED

Hate to say I told ya' so , but .... I did .
The judge dropped the federal charges today ( which could have been a 20 year sentence if found guilty ) .
Now we 'll see what happens with the simple assault charge ... ( 1 year max if found guilty )
This man has been wrongly accused and wrongly judged by the world ( who does n't know him ) .
Please learn something from this ...

We know our pastor and all that he stands for .
Helping the wayward youth is one of his priorities .
These kids are sent to boot camp with the parents ' permission .
They have a choice of going to boot camp or a facility for delinquent teens .
They elect boot camp , thinking it will be easy and fun .
They are there because their own parents are having problems disciplining them , have gotten in trouble with the law , skip school , etc. , etc .
The end result : he instills in them to be respectful to their parents , God and themselves .
To have a better outlook of their God - given life
and future .
Not all , but the majority leave boot camp feeling better about themselves and appreciate having gotten a second chance to do better .

Posted by byron spears on 2008 -05 - 02 21:20:09 10 jurors said Pastor innocent
11 jurors said Stephanie innocent What can Pastor Flowers Learn ?
Posted by Hey Byron on 2008-05-06 10:47:59 Hey Byron :
What can Pastor Flowers learn about holding other Pastors accountable to false accusations brought against them ?
He sure is quick to bring judgment against them , even holding meetings about them where other Pastors from the community attempt to decide their fate even when there is not enough evidence to bring them to a trial .
I fully agree with you .
Pastor Flowers is a very Godly and good man that has done a lot for the community and the Kingdom , people forget those things and rush to judgment and sentencing .
My family , church and Pastor have stood with him and behind him , his family , ministry and church through this whole ordeal .
Hopefully , Pastor Flowers can learn something from this , seeing the results of false accusations and how quickly the secular community and unfortunately a lot of Christians want to jump in and ruin the reputation and influence of men of God such as him .
This blog is just one of many that is full of animosity , gossip and slander ; not only about Pastor Flowers but other men and women of God .
The origination of most of the subject matter is due to the perception of those that viewed the presentation of the material .
Most of the presentation was brought forth by the secular media .
Unfortunately with the internet and ' guilty until they can prove their innocence ' mindset of people ( including the church ) , most everyone buys right into the media 's hyped presentation and agenda ( that 's a subject matter all on its own ) .
Most people feel that the church should be above reproach , however , with human beings being involved there will always be the potential for failure even if it is only perceived failure .
My prayer is that we grow and mature from these situations and not be our own enemy .
The Kingdom of darkness is formidable enough ...
Hmmmmm .....

Posted by Wisely , anonymous on 2008-06- 23 12:57:53 Byron :
Spout off ?
When on ' spouts off ' they are usually someone who talks about something tediously and at great length , usually with no regard for the listener / reader 's interest .
My post was not lengthy , maybe a bit tedious and directed towards you ; you responded so evidently you were interested but you might have me on the tedious part so I 'll let it slide .
Why would I post my name ?
The topic at hand was the media coverage of Pastor Flowers , more specifically the title of this blog - " Christian Boot Camp Officials Drag 15 yo Girl Behind Van " .
The title alone proves my point about passing judgment due to media spin , gossip , slander , etc. and the damage that this has caused to the Body of Christ , most of it self - inflicted by fellow believers buying into and participating in the hype .
Again , post my name ?
It would not serve any purpose in validating my point .
On the contrary , it would allow opportunity for others to change the subject by attacking me , my family , and others connected to me .
If you need proof , they did the same to you on this blog and wrongfully so I might add .
Brave of you ?
Yes , but needlessly so .
I 'm not the type of individual to ask someone to punch me in the gut to prove how tough I am .
I am truly glad that this ordeal has passed and I pray that Pastor Flowers , CBC , LDM and Faith Outreach continue to make a positive impact in this community .
Please forgive me if I have ' spouted off ' again ;-)... for my mom worked at cbc

yeah and a father that didnt rape his first child , isnt capable of raping his second ?
a man that didnt beat his first wife , isnt capable of beating the second ?
the woman that did n't murder her son , couldnt possibly murder her daughter ?
and we all know a kid who didnt do drugs as a teen , is n't possibly able to do drugs as a young adult .
that 's bullsh ** whoever u are , i assume you went to that camp for drug abuse ?

Posted by Liz on 2016-05-31 16:29:18
I attended this boot camp myself when I was 15 and as much as I hated the authority I ended up learning discipline in the end .
Yes Flowers was stern however he was never abusive .
They did pin you down if you got in their face or in another trainees but its no different than a restraint an officer would put on someone who is a threat .
It was very tough love but never abusive .
Most of the kids had never experienced someone putting them in their place .
A lot of us learned its not okay to challenge our parents and elders .
It was a great learning experience .
We learned teamwork and we grew with each other .

No End in Sight movie review
by Roger Ebert
Remember the scene in “ A Clockwork Orange ” where Alex has his eyes clamped open and is forced to watch a movie ?
I imagine a similar experience for the architects of our catastrophe in Iraq .
I would like them to see “ No End in Sight , ” the story of how we were led into that war , and more than 3,000 American lives and hundreds of thousands of other lives were destroyed .
[ …] Although Bush and the war continue to sink in the polls , I know from some readers that they still support both .
That is their right .
And if they are so sure they are right , let more young men and women die or be maimed .
I doubt if they will be willing to see this film , which further documents an administration playing its private war games .
No , I am distinctly not comparing anyone to Hitler , but I cannot help being reminded of the stories of him in his Berlin bunker , moving nonexistent troops on a map , and issuing orders to dead generals .

SANTIAGO ( Reuters ) - Scientists said that a lake in southern
Chile that mysteriously disappeared last month developed a crack which allowed the water to drain away .
A buildup of water opened a crack in an ice wall along one side of the lake .
Water flowed through the crack into a nearby fjord and from there into the sea , leaving behind a dry lake - bed littered with icebergs , scientists told Chilean state television on Tuesday .
“ It looks like it ’s slowly filling up with water again , ” said Andres Rivera , a glacier expert who headed a team which recently flew over the lake in a bid to solve the mystery .
The lake is situated in the Magallanes region in Patagonia and is fed by melt - water from glaciers .
Earlier this year it had a surface area of 4 to 5 hectares ( 10 - 12 acres ) -- about the size of 10 soccer fields .
Scientists noticed it had disappeared during a routine patrol of the area in May .
Rivera said the incident was evidence of the effects of global warming .

Two young , shirtless men in low - slung jeans greet you at the door .
Disco music pounds out , the air is full of a sickly sweet scent and it is so dark , customers get lost and panic .
This is shopping Abercrombie & Fitch style .
Savile Row will never be the same .
I 've been working undercover there after I took a job as an in - store model at the multi-billion dollar U.S. clothing company 's new London store - their first venture into Europe .
My aim was to report from the inside .
It happened by chance .
You do n't see many Canadian woman in turquoise wellies on public transport in London , so I had already noticed the store 's talent scout when she noticed me , at a London Tube station .
I was curious .
So was she .
Scroll down for more ...
" You 've got just the right look to come and work for Abercrombie & Fitch " she told me .
I was taken aback , flattered , but had no idea what she meant .
" Fantastic " I replied .
Abercrombie & Fitch ?
The name rang a bell .
Shortbread ?
Why would a biscuit firm want to employ me ?
She explained that Abercrombie & Fitch was a clothing store and that they were hiring " models "
to " just hang out " around the shop , wearing the company 's clothing .
The penny dropped .
I 'd seen those risque ; posters of a muscular man with a builder 's bottom adorning London buses .
I knew this homoerotic campaign has caused a stir .
This , I realised , was the American chain whose use of blatant sex to market their U.S. preppy style has attracted critics as well as custom .
They promise a store full of " gorgeous kids " .
And this woman was asking me to be one of them .
Was this her job , then - hanging around Tube stations offering jobs to anyone she fancied the look of ?
I wondered if I looked particularly unemployed .
She asked what I did .
I told her I was a freelance writer but had some time to spare .
She gave me a number and told me to call .
The interview room at the Abercrombie & Fitch headquarters was packed .
The woman interrogator asked which three words I 'd use to describe myself .
I repeated what the girl before me had said " I'm approachable and friendly " .
My interviewer smiled and wrote this down .
She informed us that the company had a
" tagline " which we would have to use when greeting customers .
She explained , very seriously , that it was , " Hello , how are you ? "
" How did you come up with that ? " I asked .
She said a company of marketing consultants had worked intensively at developing it .
They wanted to audition me to see if I could deliver the line - this was make or break .
" Hello , how are you ? ! "
I said clearly .
" Very good " she reassured me .
I had cleared my first hurdle and said four words in the right order , a test that floored some of my fellow - would - be- models - honestly .
The interviewer then asked the assembled clutch of giggly , naive , underfed boys and girls - the bony and the beautiful - what they knew about Abercrombie & Fitch .
Nobody mentioned the story that A&F supposedly sold Ernest Hemmingway the gun he used to shoot himself .
And no one mentioned the homoerotic nature of the ad campaign or the $ 40 million outofcourt settlement in a racial and ethnic discrimination case bought by 10,000 litigants in the U.S .
One girl said she thought the store was a bit like GAP .
That was the end of her .
A week later the phone rang .
I 'd got the job .
Would I come to an orientation day ?
This turned out to be a crash - course in the way to hang about .
We should be friendly , outgoing and portray a sexy image , they said .
Next came a lecture from a member on how to prevent clothes being stolen .
" Be vigilant " suggested one of my colleagues .
" No .
You must never touch the customers , " he said , alarmed .
I think he thought vigilant was like vigilante .
We were instructed how to spot a shoplifter .
Rather than confront him we should try to persuade him to buy the item as opposed to stealing it .
" I could n't help noticing you 've put a pair of jeans down your jacket , they would go very well with our new range of shirts , would you like a look ? "
While I was lining up to collect the jeans - so tight I could n't use the pockets - polo shirt and flipflops that all A&F workers wear on duty , I saw the Canadian woman who had recruited me .
" Glad you came .
I thought you might write about this " .
" No " , I lied .
A date was fixed for training .
But then I got a call to work next day .
I arrive at 9 am , untrained but undaunted , entering the store for the first time .
It is a Grade II listed building , just off London 's Savile Row .
The doors are not yet open for business and I face a sea of preciselyplaced and neatly - folded merchandise .
Outside the sun shines , but in here it is so dark I keep tripping over my flip - flops .
The shop presents itself as if it were the coolest clothes shop on the planet .
Aimed at 20 - year - olds , the store offers polo shirts , hoodies and tight jeans .
David Cameron would shop here if he thought he could get away with it .
My eyes accustom to the gloom .
I confront tacky paintings of teenage boys stripped to the waist in frames that aspire to the look of a grand country house .
The theme of male near - nudity is pursued throughout .
It has caused trouble .
One edition of the company 's catalogue had to be recalled after a storm over the explicitly naked photographs of young models .
And now I was joining the team .
The in - store dance music reached a crescendo as the manager came over to talk to me .
" What ? " I shouted desperately trying to lip -read .
" You 're working on the cash register , " she shouted back .
" But I do n't know how . "
" Have n't you been trained ? " " No .
Not at tills .
I 'm a model . "
" All models may be required to work the tills . "
It was becoming clear what " model " actually amounted to - meant " shop assistant with come - hither looks " .
My first customer , a mother with two teenage kids , purchased more than £ 500 of T - shirts .
But by the time I had scanned and de-tagged all the items , removed the coat hangers , totalled the cost and figured out how to charge the credit card , 25 minutes had elapsed .
It was not long before I was relieved of my post at the till .
Now I could " model " full time .
This meant greeting people and refolding the clothes disturbed by customers .
I tried out the tagline .
" Hello , how are you , " I said to a stressed looking middle - aged man .
He looked at me suspiciously .
More customers came into view and I repeated the line .
Then a manager told me to keep " interacting " .
" I am , I 've spoken to everyone here " .
" Yeah , but if you 've said it once to someone , follow it up when you see them again .
Say ' Hi , are you still all right ? ' "
This was mad .
I did n't want to pester people .
I also had no idea where things were , what we actually sold , what to do if we ran out of stock - or anything else of any use to the customer .
A woman asked if there were sizes available other than those on the shelves .
" Probably " was the best I could come up with .
Next I really did get the promised training .
I learned that David Beckham had come into the store .
If I recognised a celebrity I was not to follow them around or ask for an autograph .
" What if I see Keith Chegwin ? " I asked .
The manager looked at me blankly .
They clearly do n't do jokes at Abercrombie & Fitch .
I threw myself even more furiously into my only practical function : pursuing customers zealously and refolding the moment they ruffled anything .
Soon I could n't stop .
I was heading for an obsessive compulsive disorder .
One model told me he'd been instructed to smile till his jaw ached .
The room was empty at the time : " What do they want me to smile at : the clothes ? " he muttered .
The company told us it was an equal opportunity employer .
Funny , because all its visible staff are young and beautiful .
The unattractive , the overweight and the disabled just do n't seem to make it on to the shop floor .
In fact , there is no lift and therefore no way for wheelchair users to work or shop upstairs .
As far as age goes , at 29 I was probably the oldest there .
I thought that if the law permitted it , managers would have exercised quality - control over the customers , too , and I might be assigned to blow a whistle if anyone old or fat ventured in .
But employees who are not on public view are allowed to be slightly less attractive .
The
" impact team " is a group of workers who replenish the dwindling stock .
They are often on the shop floor but do n't have to interact with customers in the same way .
A manager told me : " The impact team do n't need to show the visual image of the store . "
She meant they could be a bit uglier .
There were also the " overnighters " - nocturnal shelfstackers .
Presumably it does n't matter what they look like .
I do n't get out of bed for less than £ 6.50 .
Fortunately this was A& F 's hourly rate .
They trade on the inexhaustable supply of beautiful dimwits for whom the excitement of being hired as " model " matters more than the pay scale .
I got the impression that , ideally , they 'd like us to pay them , rather than the other way round .
The men who stood semi-clothed at the entrance earned an extra £ 1 an hour .
But they had the required A& F six - pack .
The new way of selling clothes seems to be not wearing them .
Then there was the little clutch of dancers who have to jig around endlessly on a sort - of platform .
Some of the customers thought this was cruel .
More importantly , customers quickly became frustrated when encountering a 45 - minute queue for the changing rooms , and one shopper said the last thing she wanted when searching for her size was to have to ask a size zero model if she could try on a Large .
A & F is unlike other foreign stores that arrive in the UK and try to fit in .
It is brash and all - American .
But they do want to be posh .
Association with the quality tailoring of Savile Row , the listed building and the statues and art work , rub uneasily against the overt use of sex to sell clothes .
There 's nothing tasteful in halfnaked boys hanging around the store door .
Or are we just too oldfashioned for this fusion of softcore porn and high - class pose ?
As for me , I 'm finished as an A& F store - boy , now I 've gone to print .
I can't say I mind .
You try placing a pair of blue jeans back on the right shelf among 20 other only slightly different jeans .
Then try doing it in the dark , while looking sexy with an ever - ready " Hello , how are you ? "
If there ’s one thing that continues to perplex me within the application development space , it ’s the fact that there are few audiences for whom distributed source code management ( DSCM [ 1 ] ) systems is a subject of interest .
Before you ask : yes , I ’ve gone beyond the immediate circle of family and friends .
Enterprisey types consider the systems too immature , too different and , yes , too “ new ” to be in any way useful , while for the open source folks I talk to they ’re more or less taken for granted – just another part of the landscape .
The explanation for this otherwise inexplicable lack of attention is , to my way of thinking , pretty simple : source code management tools are n’t sexy .
They ’re not going to get ( most ) people excited in the way that , say , a web application framework like Rails is .
Many developers , in fact , have probably spent a good deal of their careers cursing such tools , whether they be the longtime standard of CVS or the primitive , bastardized BIM - EDIT based version control system I was compelled to build for a client years ago as part of a CMM certification process ( do n’t ask ) .
But I ’m a believer that those reactions bely the importance of the tools , and it ’s something I ’ve been meaning to write up for some time .
Ergo , it ’s time for another Q&A .
Q : Before proceeding , any relationships to disclose in this space ?
A : The only one I can think of is that IBM , whose Rational division is a significant player in the source code management space , is a customer .
I ca n’t think of any other client relationships that bear on the subject matter directly , although it ’s perhaps worth mentioning that Sun – a recent adopter of DSCM – is a client .
That ’s it , off the top of my head .
Q : For the non-developers in the audience , can you explain briefly what a DSCM tool is and how it differs from the alternatives ?
A : Sure .
Wikipedia ’s got a great definition for you here , but in layman ’s terms it ’s just a system that manages source code in a non-centralized fashion .
Primitive source code management tools demanded that developers work online , checking out each segment of code they wanted to work on , during which time it ’s typically not available for writes by other developers .
After their changes are completed , the code would be checked back in , at which point it would be available for others .
Decentralized tools operate according to different principals .
With DSCMs , multiple parties can check out the same code , work on it offline , and submit their changes back .
Conflicts between the individual changes are managed on a peer to peer basis , by the tool .
There is no centralized control , in other words – hence the decentralized description .
Q : What are the advantages to this approach ?
A : There are many .
Generally speaking , it ’s far more flexible for developers – particularly those working in distributed ( geographically or otherwise ) fashion .
See , for example , Sam Ruby ’s comments on Bazaar ( bzr ) :
Just when I was just starting to get comfortable with svn , along comes bzr .
svn has a lot of benefits over cvs .
For me , the biggest benefit is the increased ability to work on a plane I can do an svn delete or an svn diff while disconnected .
When I land , I can simply do an svn update and an svn commit .
It looks like bzr intends to take this to the next level , I can work on multiple changes , create branches , and query the version history while offline …
This is where it gets mind - blowing .
After I am done development on my laptop , I can then simply scp/rsync my entire directory structure up to intertwingly .
I can then run from my directory .
That ’s not the surprising part .
That ’s entirely to be expected .
What ’s cool is that I — or anybody else — can then do a bzr get against that directory to retrieve everything – including the version history .
And I had to install nothing to make this work .
It is all HTTP GET of statically served files .
Sweet .
In lieu of posting patches to the development list , I can simply post a pointer to my repository , perhaps with some prose indicating why anybody might care .
Maintainers of other repositories may chose to merge in a portion of my changes , or they may not .
This style of development , with a low barrier to entry , is not for everyone .
In fact , I ’m not yet sure that it is for me .
But it certainly has got me thinking .
Those are the kind of comments you ’ll see frequently from developers exposed to DSCMs .
Q : So DSCM ’s are popular with the development crowd , and have a low barrier to entry – great .
It ’s still just a source code management tool , correct ?
A : Well , with the caveat that they ’re not popular with all developers , I ’d say no – they have considerably more profound implications than just as an SCM .
Much as the success or failure of an open source project can depend as much on the goverance structure as it can on the actual code , so too is the choice of a source code management tool far more important than many realize .
DSCM ’s , in fact , can have implications on goverance and vice versa , but that ’s neither here nor there .
If you ’re still skeptical that the SCM selection process plays an important role in the life of a project , Bill de hÓra ’s thoughts might be of interest :
The conclusion I draw from this and my own experience having migrating my fair share of source trees is that the version control system is a first order effect on software , along with two others – the build system and the bugtracker .
Those choices impact absolutely everything else .
Things like IDEs , by comparison , do n’t matter at all .
Even choice of methodology might matter less .
Q : What is your personal experience with the tools ?
A : Project - wise , nill .
My coding days ended before these tools became popular ; I was stuck using CVS or SourceSafe instead .
From an evaluation perspective , I ’ve used Bazaar and Mercurial , and Subversion is currently used to maintain all of our WordPress instances .
I ’m considering using one of the DSCMs to maintain my desktop after I migrate to the new machine , but that ’s not decided yet .
Q : What kind of developer does n’t go for these DSCM tools ?
What is the rationale for not caring for them ?
A : Havoc ’s probably as good a candidate to carry the centralized tool standard as any .
One of his objections has to do with the rapid proliferation of different tools , each with its own syntax , which while a legitimate objection is non-specific to the subject matter .
The more substantive issue is contained here :
I think what I do n’t get yet is why you ’d want to maintain a bunch of local changesets for very long .
The Linux - kernel - style fork - fest seems just nuts for anything I ’m working on .
Usually there are less than 10 people , often less than 5 , that are really doing much work , and any other contributors are sending a one - liner every few months .
There ’s just no problem that I see here that distributed version control would solve .
As Sam says above , the style of development permitted by DSCM ’s is not for everyone – nor every project – and Havoc helps explain why .
He also links to some other developers thoughts pro and con .
Here are two bonus links comparing Mercurial to Subversion .
Q : So why are they a big deal ?
If it ’s a niche trend amongst a couple of open source projects , why should mainstream developers care ?
A : Mostly because it ’s not a niche trend , it ’s increasingly mainstream .
I have yet to see accurate metrics polling developers for their preferences one way or another , but the increasing adoption of DSCM tools indicates to me that more developers prefer decentralized development than do not .
With all due respect to Havoc , of course .
Q : What adoption are you referring to ?
Who is using these DSCMs today ?
A : A couple of projects you may have heard of .
Ubuntu , for example , leverages Bazaar .
Linux and X.org are on Git. And Mercurial , an emerging center of gravity in the DSCM space , counts among its users the Mozilla project , IcedTea , OpenJDK , and OpenSolaris .
The sheer weight and variety of these projects would be enough to convince me to pay attention , even absent some of the nice things developers say about them .
Q : So because these major projects are either using them or running them in tandem with centralized systems , everyone should just cut over , right ?
A : Hardly .
Migrating from one version control system to another is a decidedly non-trivial task , and the anticipated benefits need to be weighed against the expected costs – as always .
For an idea of the complexity involved , listen to what some of the Mozilla folks have to say about the prospect of switching .
Q : If I ’m starting a project , or have an existing project in which I think the benefits might potentially outweigh the costs , what tools should I consider ?
A : There are a host of tools available to solve these needs , as Wikipedia can tell you .
The ones that I hear the most chatter about are the three already mentioned : Bazaar , Git , and Mercurial .
darcs and Monotone come up occasionally , but not frequently .
If you ’re interested , the folks from OpenSolaris kindly made available documentation from their detailed review : the background for the choice , the project ’s requirements , and reports ( note , however , the differing architectures measured on ) on Bazaar ( it ’s worth nothing that performance , the number one complaint about bzr , is apparently being addressed ) , Git and Mercurial .
Q : Anything else to add ?
A : Just that I think DSCMs should be on the radar of software projects both internal and external , closed or open source .
They may not be appropriate for your project or codebase , but it ’s difficult to tell if they are n’t being evaluated .
[ 1 ] DSCMs may also be referred to as Distributed Version Control Systems , or DVCS .

I spent my whole life , up until 2008 , being allergic to eggs .
When I was like 4 , I took an egg in my hand , crushed it – obviously just for fun – and got a rash all over my hand .
When I was 8 , my older brother was into raw egg shakes for some weird reason , and like an idiot he let me have some and I broke into a huge rash all over my torso .
My mom was always super careful about possible allergens because I had skin problems so at various times she would n’t let me eat seafood , dairy , peanuts , dogs , cats , you name it .
But she would never believe me when I complained that mayonnaise would bother my throat .
She just wrote me off like a bratty kid whining about something I did n’t want to eat .
It was only much later , after at least a decade of stunted growth , crippling digestive problems and massacred brain cells that I learned that the mayo I kept eating indeed has eggs in it , so ha , Mom , it looks like I got the last laugh .
Fast forward to November 2008 … it was the morning after Barack Obama was elected President of the United States , I was celebrating with breakfast at IHOP .
Instead of my usual pancakes that I always get , I was in the mood for some hope and change , so I just decided to order a big-ass THREE - EGG OMELETTE .
It was the most delicious thing I ’d ever had , and I did n’t die .
Barack Obama cured my allergy to eggs .
Praise the Kenyan gods !
And so now I ’ve got a lifetime of artery - clogging eggy goodness to catch up on .
Mmmmmmmm
Yeah I know that pancakes have eggs in them , shut up .
Hope you enjoyed today ’s comic , see you next week , egg willing !!
As a reminder , as I said last week : I ’ll be cooling it on the big time - traveling storyline for now , and going old school random for a while in order to get back on the comic horse .
The storyline was obviously getting a bit too ambitious on both the plotting and art fronts for my own good , and was ( not surprisingly ) a major reason why I got all messed up and had to take a break again .
In retrospect I should n’t have tried it in the first place , given my time constraints and my update schedule .
But I hope to continue and finish it one day – hope hope – so those of you who were into it , sorry for now , but I ’m willing to bet y’all will be happy with whatever has me making comics regularly again .
Indian news service Rediff.com is reporting that Indian telecom carriers Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Essar are in negotiations with Google over the search giant ’s plans to go head - to - head with Apple ’s iPhone with its own search - centric mobile device .
The report claims that Google is two weeks away from launch , and that it will occur simultaneously in Europe and America–claims that should probably be taken with a large chunk of sodium chloride .
A Google spokesperson would n’t deny the report , stating in its noncommital way that “ Google is committed to providing users with access to the world ’s information , and mobile becomes more important to those efforts every day . ”
But the company also said they had nothing to announce at present .
ZDNet ’s Russel Shaw makes the point that Google has not applied for the GPhone copyright and that a geological equipment company has .
Speculation on the GPhone has been appearing for months at sites like Engadget , GigaOM , ZDNet , and the Register .
It ’s thought that the device will be 3G and WiFi capable , and Google has admitted that the company intends to bid in the FCC ’s 700M Hz wireless spectrum auction .
Preschoolers are more introspective than we give them credit for , according to new research by Simona Ghetti , assistant professor of psychology at UC Davis .
Ghetti and her co-investigator , Kristen Lyons , a graduate student in psychology at UC Davis , will present their findings Friday morning , Aug. 17 , at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in San Francisco .
Scientists have demonstrated that dolphins , monkeys and even rats can engage in some form of " metacognition , " or an awareness of their own thought processes .
But developmental psychologists have assumed that human children do not develop this capability before about age 5 .
Lyons and Ghetti have toppled that assumption by teaching 3 - and 4 - year - olds to communicate their awareness of their thought processes using pictures rather than words .
" We 've shown that even very young children can think about their thinking , " Ghetti said .
" The reason we have n't appreciated it before now is that the studies that have been used to test for it have been too verbally demanding . "
The UC Davis researchers devised a novel method to investigate metacognition in early childhood .
They taught their preschool subjects to point to a photo of a confident - looking face when they felt confident they had the right answer to a question , and to a photo of a doubtful - looking child when they were not confident they had the right answer .
The tests showed that young children are aware of their uncertainty in the moment .
Even 3 - year - olds pointed to the confident face when they correctly identified , for example , a drawing of a monkey that had some features removed to make it harder to recognize .
They pointed to the doubtful face if they could not come up with a correct answer .
" Even 3 - year - olds are more confident when they 're right than when they 're wrong , " Ghetti said .
How children develop the ability to experience , recognize and understand their thoughts and emotions is a topic of increasing scientific interest , since self - awareness is a prerequisite for the development of a wide range of important human traits , from a conscience to healthy relationships .

The Washington Post reports on a “ controversial ” meaure that would :
increase funding for family planning clinics , expand Medicaid and private health insurance coverage of contraceptives , require hospitals to make emergency contraception available to rape victims , and allocate money for comprehensive sex education programs that teach youths about birth control as well as abstinence .
Here ’s the money quote .
You might have to read it several times to believe what you ’ve read :
“ There ’s a utopian view that women ought to be able to have sex any time they want to without consequences _ that ’s the bottom line of all these bills , ” said Janice Crouse of Concerned Women for America , a conservative group which opposes the measures .
Now let ’s see . . . whose body is it ?
There are many people in power who believe that the government has a right to keep citizens from seeking private consensual pleasure in a way that they choose .
Conservatives often attack Roe v.
Wade on the alleged basis that Roe has no basis in the Constitution .
On this issue of access to birth control I would respond : where in the constitution does it say that consenting adults do n’t have a right to seek pleasure , where many of them are adults in their 20’s , 30 ’s 40 ’s and up , and especially where many of them are married to each other ?
For more on conservatives and their arrogant attitudes toward controlling the harmless sexual impulses of others , see here and here and here and here .
For some of the real - life health benefits of having sex often , see this list , based on an article from Forbes Magazine .
Parting thought :
Would n’t we be better off as a society if people had babies only when they intentionally had babies ?
I ca n’t believe that we ’ve gotten to the point where such a position has become “ controversial . ”
Since JotForm has been released one of remarks I received often has been why we do n’t have a regular homepage .
You know , the common wisdom supposed to say a homepage should give some introduction .
It is supposed to talk about what is the service is all about , why do you need it , how great it is .
Things like that .
Well , I do n’t think there is much truth about this assumption .
In fact , I think this is one of the biggest misunderstandings about the web users .
I see this mistake all over web all the time .
Long registration forms to try some basic functionality , software products with no screenshots , community forums you ca n’t even read without registration .
You expect the web users to trust you and invest their time .
But , why should they do that ?
They just met you , and they are in rush .
They are always in rush because they have been burned many times before by spending hours on sites like yours without getting anything accomplished .
They are one second away from clicking that back button and you are expecting them to read your long mumbo jumbo and fill up that required occupation question and figure out those messed up CAPTCHA characters .
Thank you very much !
If we look at the most successful sites today , there is something very common on all of them .
They let you accomplish things .
Why people come to your site ?
Think about it for a minute .
If your main landing page is your homepage , why do n’t you make things as easy to as possible for them .
In fact , give them the meat .
Turn your homepage into your application .
Here are some good examples to “ Homepage is The Application ” :
Google :
Do you remember the 90s ?
It was hard work to just find the search form on a search engine inside all those banners dumped on your screen .
By making their homepage uncluttered Google gained the attention and love of their users .
Last.fm : I go to last .fm to listen some music or find out similar music to something I liked .
I can do both of these things without ever leaving the homepage .
Their site is actually filled with lots of text , but it does n’t bother me , since I can accomplish my goals without leaving the homepage .
Firefox :
Have you ever been to a site to download something and spend half an hour of browsing and typing .
Well , Firefox homepage has just a large “ Download Firefox – Free ” button that even knows you are an OS X user .
I understand there will some cases in which you cannot turn your homepage into an application .
For instance , if you have a content site .
Then your application is your content .
You should simply provide the content on your homepage .
Slashotdot did this best and became a huge success .
Homepage Strategies for your site :
If you have a web application , give them the meat .
Do n’t ask for registration or login .
Let them use your application right on your homepage .
If you are a content site , give them the most popular and recent content .
Slashdot became a success using this formula and now Digg and Reddit are following the path .
If you have a subscription site give them screenshot or movie tour .
But that ’s not enough , you should still provide some meat on your homepage .
Depending on the type of content you are providing , you must still provide some meat on your homepage .
If you are a matchmaking site , let them search profiles without registration .
If you are selling software , give them the free version right there up front .
If you are selling books , give them excerpts to read .
If you are an online radio , let them listen from your homepage .
I can hear some people saying “ OK , let ’s say I cut out all the text from my homepage .
Then what ?
How will Google find out about my site ” .
That was also one of my worries at the beginning , because for couple of months , the homepage of JotForm did not have a PageRank while the internal pages were ranked 3 .
However , this only took couple of months .
Then the whole site including the homepage jumped at PageRank 5 .
In any case , I do n’t think it is a good idea to build your site for Google .
Make it good for your users and do n’t worry , if people love your site , there will be plenty linking to it .
If you do n’t believe me , look at the Google homepage .
Does it talk about what they do and how great they are ?
On a response to a comment on this blog , I explained how our site uses Homepage is the Application principle .
1. JOTFORM .COM IS THE APPLICATION .
If you are a web designer and would like to just design a form , I want you to type “ jotform.com ” instead of firing up DreamWeaver or FrontPage .
Or if you are like me vim .
2. JOTFORM .COM IS THE DEMO .
If you are interested in finding a form builder / processor , I want you to have a chance to try it before committing .
I do n’t want to waste your time with registration .
Last couple of days I am trying to submit JotForm on some webmaster sites .
It is a big pain .
All of them first want me to create an account .
Then want me to verify my email to go to my gmail account and clicking on a link .
And couple of them actually did not even work .
I have spent like 10 minutes on a site and was unsuccessful at signing up and gave up .
Come - on , all I am trying to do is to submit a listing to your database so that you can better serve your visitors and earn money from banners .
3. GOOGLE EFFECT : Google did not put a gazillion links on their homepage like all other search engines at the time and users loved it .
Google ’s homepage keeps the attention at the task .
Google respects the users and not try to trick them into doing something else .
I just like that attitude .
During last six months we have been hard at work on the new version of JotForm .
I am very excited about it because while adding many new features I believe we were able to keep its simplicity .
It has been hard work and we had to spend some time inventing couple of things that were never been done with JavaScript just to make it better at Homepage - is - the - Application , but I think it has been worth the effort .
Keep watching us in the coming weeks .
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales resigned today because of the relentless pressure that our people - powered Democratic Majority brought to bear .
We could not have done it without you .
But there is no time to rest - we need to ratchet up the same kind of pressure on those Republicans who continue to obstruct our efforts to change the direction on the war in Iraq .
Duncan has an interesting perspective on raising money for progressive candidates online over at Atrios today .
" One problem that the ' netroots , ' whatever that is , has is that there 's tendency by Democrats to see it as just another player in the interest group checklist politics game .
So , sometimes ' this will piss off the blogs ' is a consideration , and a similar one to ' this might piss of NARAL ' or ' this might piss off the Sierra Club . '
We 're a noisy somewhat influential group to be placated somehow .
Now that 's not how I see things as I think blogs should be seen more as an opportunity to influence media coverage and narratives , as well as helping to stitch together a broader - based political movement .
" The DCCC had a less interesting perspective this morning .
They sent out a fundraising e-mail -- big picture of Abu Gonzo and Bush embedded -- claiming House Democrats hold Republicans accountable .
And then they ask for money so they can fight " more than a dozen Republicans for voting in lockstep " with Bush .
If you donate to the DCCC , how do they divvy up the money ?
Well , it makes sense that they give a good deal of it to endangered incumbents .
I mean take a guy like John Hall in New York .
He represents a pretty Republican district and he's got a very wealthy Republican opponent and Hall has voted his conscience every step of the way since being elected last year .
His voting record is one of the best in the entire House and he never sells out Democratic values or principles to curry favor with right - wingers .
If the DCCC was giving their donations to true blue Democrats like John Hall , Carol Shea - Porter ( NH ) , Yvette Clark ( NY ) , Mazie Hirono ( HI ) , Peter Welch ( VT ) , John Sarbanes ( MD ) , Keith Ellison ( MN ) , Hank Johnson ( GA ) , Paul Hodes ( NH ) , Dave Loebsack ( IA ) , Steve Cohen ( TN ) , and Betty Sutton ( OH ) , I 'd be urging you to donate .
But if you look at the DCCC's Front Line Page what do you find ?
Well , not a dozen Republicans voting in lockstep with Bush , of course -- but more than a dozen Democrats who do !
The DCCC says they want money to elect candidates who will help end the war and who will fight against the abuses of Bush Regime hacks like Alberto Gonzales .
But the donations are going to Democrats who vote with the Republicans to prolong the war and to pass execrable legislation like the FISA law .
The Frontline List , which is far too embarrassing for the DCCC to include in their e-mail ( in case anyone is paying attention ) includes these treacherous Democrats who vote with Republicans over and over and over on the most crucial issues and against basic Democratic principles and values ( the guys ' n ' gals with stars next to their names voted with the GOP on giving Alberto Gonzales wiretapping powers ) : Jason Altmire ( PA ) * John Barrow ( GA ) * Melissa Bean ( IL ) * Leonard Boswell ( IA ) * Chris Carney ( PA ) * Joe Donnelly ( IN ) * Brad Ellsworth ( IN ) * Baron Hill ( IN ) * Nick Lampson ( TX ) * Tim Mahoney ( FL ) Jim Marshall ( GA ) * Heath Shuler ( NC ) * Zack Space ( OH ) * If you 're sick and tired of the DCCC taking your donations and giving it to incumbents like Jim Marshall and John Barrow in George and like Jason Altmire and Chris Carney in Pennsylvania , all four of whom vote to enshrine the Republican agenda , donate to real progressives at Blue America .
Especially crucial right now are progressives facing reactionaries in Democratic primaries .
Good bets are Darcy Burner ( WA ) , Steve Cohen ( TN ) , Donna Edwards ( MD ) , John Laesch ( IL ) , Rick Noriega ( TX ) , Angie Paccione ( CO ) , and Victoria Wulsin ( OH ) .
Now for an update on the Darcy Burner fundraising effort .
She barreled through her $ 100,000 goal right on schedule .
Over at Blue America , aside from shooting past $ 6,000 for Darcy today , almost half of the folks who came in to contribute to her also contributed to the Blue America PAC or to another one or more of the Blue America candidates .
Every single Blue America candidate , in fact , gained from this funder , some significantly .
Darcy donors gave the most to Victoria Wulsin , Rick Noriega , Donna Edwards , Angie Paccione , Tom Allen , and Steve Cohen .

I do n’t see the point of further discussion of the Republican War in Iraq .
The president is stubborn and only repeats himself .
The war will go on .
The country will bleed blood and treasure .
In the end , Iraq will end up with a dictator of one sort or another , which is what it had before the war .
Hopefully , a new president will end it , though I would wait a few months before placing any bets .
War , as it is being fought in Iraq , is a highly profitable operation for the war service industry , which Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld created .
They called it " outsourcing . "
I call it " mercenaries , " and there are now almost as many of them in Iraq as there are uniformed soldiers .
As always in war , it is highly unprofitable to the young men and women who have to fight it on military pay .
Unlike the military - industrial complex , which likes to build weapons whether they are ever used or not , the war service industry requires an on - going war and occupation to keep the cash flowing .
The biggest mouth swallowing all of this government cash belongs to Cheney ’s old outfit , Halliburton , and its subsidiaries .
It has a lot of influence .
Unfortunately , nobody seems to have figured out how to make a dime out of peace .
I easily predict that until somebody does , there will always be more war than peace .
There is a new book out that delves into this privatization of war .
It ’s called Betraying Our Troops : The Destructive Results of Privatizing War .
The authors are Robert Bauman and Dina Rasor .
What they uncovered is enough to make you throw up .
We should all pause from time to time to give thanks for nuclear weapons .
The military - industrial complex made a big mistake when it came up with those .
They are so destructive that nobody knows how to survive a nuclear war , much less profit from one .
Hence , we ’ve never had one and probably never will .
Limited wars with conventional weapons , however , hit the spot .
They keep the money flowing while the profiteers and their assets remain safe and sound , far from the sound of the guns .
Only the paid peons and innocent civilians die .
There are always the flap jaws who will stand up , wave the flag and scream , " These boys are dying for freedom , " when they are really dying for Halliburton or some other corporation .
An old Marine , Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler , called it right decades ago when he said war is a racket .
The racketeers get rich on war while the poor boys die in them .
If we look at war in its proper perspective , as the common defense of the country , then we can plainly see that when it becomes necessary , it becomes the common duty of all citizens .
Therefore , no one should profit from it .
There is no reason except corporate greed and political corruption why weapons and other materials of war should not be supplied at cost .
There is no sane reason why some should become millionaires while others become corpses or mutilated wrecks .
If all we are interested in is freedom for the Iraqi people , then why are we insisting that they pass an oil law that meets our approval ?
It is n’t our country .
It is n’t our oil .
Why should we care how they dispose of their oil in their country ?
If , of course , our mission is merely freedom .
What a laugh that is .
It ’s sad to say it , but we ’ve become a nation that boasts some of the best liars in the world .
They work full time duping the American people into supporting policies and actions that are not in the interests of this country .
Maybe one day we will all wise up .
It takes time .
Nobody likes to admit he ’s been scammed .

The iPhone 5 c debuted in 2013 at a lower price point that the iPhone 5s .

In January 2007 , Steve Jobs introduced the Apple iPhone during his keynote address at the Macworld Conference and Expo .
In its first appearance onscreen and in Jobs 's hand , the phone looked like a sleek but inanimate black rectangle .
Then , Jobs touched the screen .
Suddenly , the featureless rectangle became an interactive surface .
Jobs placed a fingertip on an on - screen arrow and slid it from left to right .
When his finger moved , the arrow moved with it , unlocking the phone .
To some people , this interaction between a human finger and an on - screen image -- and its effect on the iPhone 's behavior -- was more amazing than all of its other features combined .

And those features are plentiful .
In some ways , the iPhone is more like a palmtop computer than a cellular phone .
As with many smartphones , you can use it to make and receive calls , watch movies , listen to music , browse the Web , and send and receive e-mail and text messages .
You can also take pictures and video ( using an iPhone 3GS or later model ) with a built - in camera , import photos from your computer and organize them all using the iPhone 's software .
In 2008 , Apple introduced the second generation iPhone .
This iPhone operates on third - generation ( 3G ) cellular networks and has a GPS receiver .
It also lets you view map and satellite data from Google Maps , including overlays of nearby businesses .
Owners of the original iPhone got the opportunity to upgrade the software on their phones .
The 2.0 software gave the old phones new functions , but without the GPS receiver or 3G network capability .
2009 was the year that Apple launched the iPhone 3GS .
The 3GS iPhone models have more storage capacity than earlier iPhones .
They also have a better camera that 's capable of taking still shots and video at 30 frames per second .
Another added feature is a compass , which comes in handy when you need to find your way through unfamiliar territory .
Also in 2009 came iPhone OS 3.0 , which offered many improvements , such as the ability to cut and paste .
In 2010 , Steve Jobs took the stage to announce a new generation of Apple 's runaway success : the iPhone 4 .
The iPhone 4 sports two cameras -- one on the front and one on the back .
The iPhone 4 has a retina display with a better resolution than earlier phones .
It also marked a departure from the basic iPhone design -- the phone does n't have a slightly curved back so it lays flat on surfaces .
Jobs also announced a new name for the iPhone operating system : iOS , a modified version of the Macintosh OS X operating system used on Apple desktop and laptop computers .
In June 2011 , Apple announced iOS 5 for iPhone 3GS and later , which includes data syncing to the iCloud service , as well as iMessage , Twitter integration and a convenient new sliding notification screen .
In October 2011 , Apple unveiled the iPhone 4S , with the faster A5 processor and a much improved camera that shoots 8 megapixel images and 1080 p high - definition video .
The 4S was also the first phone that could take advantage of a major addition to Apple 's iOS , which debuted with iOS 5 : the Siri voice - activated personal assistant .
The iPhone 5 made its debut in the third quarter of 2013 , and offered consumers two product lines to choose from .
The iPhone 5s includes an A7 64 - bit chip , and added a security enhancement in the form of a fingerprint identity sensor ( though just how secure this feature is has been hotly debated ) .
The iPhone 5 c provides a lower price point option , and comes in plastic casings with a variety of color options .
Apple 's iOS lets you interact with all of the applications on your iPhone .
It displays icons for each application on the iPhone 's screen .
It also manages battery power and system security .
The operating system synchs the phone with your computer on older iPhones and iOS versions , a process that requires a connector much like the one used to synch an iPod , but since iOS 5 , most synching of data across Apple devices can take place via the new iCloud service .
The OS also lets you multitask and move through multiple open applications , just like you can on a laptop or desktop computer .
But instead of using a mouse or a physical keyboard , the iPhone uses virtual buttons and controls that appear on its screen .
This is n't really a new phenomenon -- touch screens have been part of everything from self - checkout kiosks to smartphones for years .
But the iPhone 's touch screen is a little different from many of the others currently on the market .
When you touch the screen on a PDA or a Nintendo DS , you typically use a slender , pointed stylus .
The iPhone , on the other hand , requires you to use your fingers or a conductive stylus .
It can also detect multiple touch points simultaneously .
This article will explore exactly how the iPhone 's touch screen carries instructions from your fingertips to the phone 's internal circuitry .
We 'll also look at the features in Apple 's latest and greatest , the iPhone 5c and 5s , and the 2013 update to its operating system : iOS 7 .
Cats Boiled Alive : Popular Chinese Cuisine
Recently some restaurants in Guangdong , China , have been promoting a popular dish called â€œwater boiled live catâ€ .
The way the restaurants kill the cats is very cruel and inhumane .
One of the chefs even says â€ œthe more torture the cats receive , the better they taste.â€ 
They use a bat and beat the cats until they pass out ; then throw them into hot water and boil them alive , then de-skin and cook them again .
One restaurant in Pan Yu district , even has a cat â€œshelterâ€ in their back yard .
Customers go out back and pick which cat they want to eat and the chef will beat the chosen cat half to dead and boil it alive .
Not just wild cats end up on the dinner table , some high class cats like Persians will end up a meal as well .
The Menu offers the following choices and prices :
Cat meatï¿ ¥10 ( $ 1.25 ) /lb
Cat ’s brain ï¿ ¥30 ( $ 3.5 ) /lb
Cat ’s intestine ï¿ ¥50 ( $ 6.4 ) /lb
Lets just hope this is not another prelude to a SARS breakout like before .

Three UK soldiers died in " friendly fire " in Afghanistan last week
The MoD has sent written guidance to coroners across England and Wales over the holding of military inquests .
According to the Times , its letter says the US " confirms categorically " it will not provide witnesses for inquests .
It comes six days after three British soldiers were killed by US " friendly fire " in southern Afghanistan .
The Times reports that the letter to coroners states : " The US have confirmed categorically that they will not provide witnesses to attend UK inquests .
' FRIENDLY FIRE ' DEATHS Pte Aaron McClure and Pte Robert Foster , both 19 , and Pte John Thrumble , 21 , killed on 24 August in Helmand US fighter plane dropped a 500 lb ( 227kg ) bomb on their patrol
The only other suspected " friendly fire " death of British service personnel in Afghanistan still under investigation Since 2001 73 UK troops have been killed on operations in Afghanistan
" While coroners may continue to ask for US witnesses to attend ... they should be aware that there will in all cases be a refusal . "
Fighter planes
The three soldiers who died on Thursday were Privates Aaron McClure and Robert Foster , both 19 , and John Thrumble , 21 , of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment .
They had been on patrol in Helmand province when US fighter planes dropped a 500 lb bomb , killing them and injuring two other soldiers .
The US State Department is investigating the deaths .
In March , Oxfordshire assistant deputy coroner Andrew Walker was critical of the failure of the US authorities to co-operate at the inquest of Lance Corporal of Horse Matty Hull .
L/ Cpl Hull , 25 , died when a US pilot fired on his convoy in Iraq in 2003 .
No American witnesses gave evidence at the inquest .
L/CPL MATTY HULL L/ Cpl Matty Hull , 25 , was killed in Iraq on 28 March 2003 , when he came under fire from US A - 10 " Tank Buster " plane Oxfordshire assistant deputy coroner Andrew Walker concluded in March 2007 the attack on Hull 's tank was criminal American authorities criticised for lack of cooperation with inquest Sun newspaper published a transcript of a cockpit video it obtained of the attack in February
At the start of the attack , pilot notices orange panels on the vehicles Pilot asks if " friendly " units are in area
He is assured are no coalition forces in area
Pilots open fire but soon the error is realised
The coroner said at the time : " I find the decision of the US authorities not to allow the relevant persons to attend to give evidence , or to themselves provide full transcripts of questions those people were asked during the Friendly Fire Investigation Board , hard to understand . "
The Ministry of Defence said the letter to coroners did not mark a change of position .
A spokesman said : " The MoD remains committed to supporting the work of every UK coroner .
Indeed the Wiltshire coroner praised the level of support he received from us .
" Both the US and UK work together to investigate the circumstances surrounding friendly fire incidents and their findings are made available to the coroner , as national and operational security and data protection allow .
" The MoD does all that it can to assist the coroner during inquests and liaises with the US government to facilitate requests for information . "

Smoking cannabis can cause severe lung damage
There is no cure for her illness and if it continues to get worse it will eventually kill her .
Samantha is 37 and has emphysema , a progressive condition normally associated with older people who have smoked tobacco regularly throughout their lives .
Samantha 's doctor , Dr Onn Min Kon , a consultant physician of respiratory medicine at St Mary 's Hospital in London , believes her cannabis smoking may be to blame for her condition .
Dr Kon said he had several other young patients who smoke cannabis and have lung diseases normally seen only in older tobacco smokers .
He said : " I 've got a collection of young people who have lungs that look like they 're 65 - year - olds . "
Such case studies have prompted Dr Kon to plan a study comparing the lungs of patients who smoke cannabis with those who smoke only tobacco .
If I do n't stop smoking I wo n't be around much longer ... there should be adverts showing people like me
Samantha Wilson
When Samantha , of Maida Vale , London , was diagnosed with emphysema at the age of 34 she had been smoking cannabis for 20 years .
She had begun by smoking two joints a day , but was eventually smoking up to 10 a day .
According to the latest figures from charity Action on Smoking and Health , the average tobacco smoker smokes between 13 and 14 cigarettes every day .
Samantha believes she is living proof of the effects cannabis can have on lungs .
She said : " If I do n't stop smoking I wo n't be around much longer - there is no cure for emphysema , the holes in my lungs are getting bigger .
" There should be adverts showing people like me . "
Dr Kon uses images of his patients ' lungs to assess damage
When smoked , cannabis produces many of the same chemicals as a tobacco cigarette , but may damage the airways to a greater extent .
In a 2002 report , the British Lung Foundation estimated that three to four cannabis cigarettes a day were associated with the same amount of damage to the lungs as 20 or more tobacco cigarettes a day .
So far though , it has been difficult to separate the effects of cannabis smoking from those of tobacco smoking in patients , as many users smoke both .
In his study , Dr Kon will use lung function tests and CT scan pictures to look for lung damage .
Such a study using CT scans has not been done before and Dr Kon said even people with apparently normal lung function could have problems , such as holes in their lungs , which would show up on these scans .
He said these people may have no symptoms but could still have respiratory diseases .
EMPHYSEMA
Emphysema is a normal feature of ageing
The alveoli , or small lung cells , become damaged
The condition develops progressively , causing " holes " in the lungs
The lungs lose their elasticity and breathing is difficult Smoking accelerates the ageing process in lungs
In some people the damage becomes noticeable in their lifetime
Previously the link between emphysema and cannabis smoking has been difficult to prove , and the risks are often overlooked by people , who are generally concerned only about lung cancer .
Samantha said : " I 'd never even heard of emphysema when I was diagnosed , and I do n't think people know there is a risk of getting it . "
The British Lung Foundation also called for more awareness of the issue .
A spokesperson said : " Research carried out by the British Lung Foundation found that smoking cannabis alone can cause severe lung damage .
" It is vital that people are fully aware of the dangers so they can make an educated choice and know the risks fully . "
The former president 's pool boy

The former president 's pool boy 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
Pool boys are supposed to conduct torrid affairs with lonely pool owners .
James Razsa has passionate feelings about his client , but not the kind likely to turn romantic .
Razsa cleans former President George H.W. Bush 's pool , in Kennebunkport , Maine .
An enduring American figure , the pool boy has long stood for one lowly half of the nation 's class gulf .
When the pool owner happens to have been the most powerful man on the planet , and the pool boy happens to be one of the planet 's great despisers of power , the metaphor explodes into 1,000 points of light .
" If every American had to pool - boy for these people for a day , you 'd have a revolution on your hands , " is how he sees things .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
The 23 - year - old from rural Maine says he cleans several pools in the area , not just the Bushes ' , for a large pool - cleaning company .
He works about 45 hours a week , and calls it the easiest job he ever had .
He 's paid $ 9 an hour -- " pennies thrown at my feet , " relative to the wealth all around him , he says .
Maybe his education about " the ignorant rich " is worth a few additional pennies : " I did n't know places like this existed in Maine .
Half an hour from the trailer where I live , there are places with multiple Ferraris , and guest houses five times larger than my trailer , " he says .
Granted , the stakes are high at that level .
Razsa recalls one day when former first lady Barbara Bush was on her way over , and it looked like there would n't be time to bring the pool 's temperature up to her desired 82 degrees in time .
The family 's caretaker was in a panic , he says .
" He kept shouting , ' Barbara will go crazy !
Barbara will go crazy ! ' "
Razsa recalls .
" This is the same woman who after Hurricane Katrina said ( of the Houston Astrodome refugees ) , ' You know , they 're underprivileged anyway , so this -- this is working very well for them . ' "
I 've known Razsa for a while now .
I first got to know him in 2006 , when I was living in Slovenia .
One of his brothers , an old friend of mine , had been living in Ljubljana , and James had come for his wedding and to earn some money working at a bar .
Ironically , given his feelings about our government , America could n't have dispatched a better ambassador : thoughtful , warm and courteous .
When the bar job ended , Razsa returned to Maine to find more work .
That proved nearly impossible .
For a couple months he applied everywhere , fast food restaurants included .
Finally , a buddy told him of a pool - cleaning business that was hiring .
He got the job , and at length his boss asked if he'd ever committed a felony .
He had n't , and soon he and his pool net were inside the famed Kennebunkport compound .
" Seeing so much power accumulated in the hands of one person was just so weird , " he says of his first time inside , about five months ago .
" These people were just concepts in my head before this . "
As for actual sightings , the Bushes have been elusive .
At one point Barbara zipped by on a golf cart ; at another , George indicated from afar that the pool looked terrific .
( Note to communications staff : Would be funny if he said , " Read my lips " when communicating at a distance . )
Otherwise the ex-president and his family have kept out of sight .
For Razsa , his job -- the only one he could find -- put him directly in touch with the very sort of power he holds partly responsible for his , and other people 's , hard times .
" I look at the biggest middle finger in the world all day , " is his more succinct explanation .
I ask Razsa if he has a monologue loaded up , in the event that his next encounter was at closer range .
To my surprise , the idea does n't appeal .
" What do you say ?
' Thanks for School of the Americas , and Iran - Contra , and NAFTA , and shipping all those jobs overseas , and arming Saddam , and funding the Taliban ? '
What do you say -- ' You 're a jerk ? '
There 's nothing that can be put into a sentence that would capture the lives these people have taken , and the way of life that 's been taken . "
That way of life is a common thread in my conversations with Razsa .
It 's something that 's perhaps less abstract for him than for the pool owner .
" My brother was on hard times , pumping gas for Exxon from midnight till 8 a.m. to support his daughter , " he mentions at one point .
" Exxon is one of the richest companies in the world and he was making $ 7 an hour .
My brother had to go on welfare to support his daughter , even though he was working 40 - 50 hours a week .
Instead of making Exxon pay a living wage , they make the lower and middle classes pay for him . "
Meanwhile Razsa himself has been having a hard time , his $ 9 an hour notwithstanding .
A dentist recently told him his teeth are falling apart , and to repair them would cost $ 3,000 .
Razsa has no idea where to get the money .
( An enterprising friend , meanwhile , has set up a Web site in the hopes that some kind souls might narrow the wealth gap enough for some fixed choppers . )
When I first started talking to Razsa about his job , I hoped for some inside look at the machinations of the super - elite .
Turns out a leaf - skimmer does n't have tremendous access .
In fact , the most insider -y stuff came from outside the gates , at a recent war protest aimed at the Bush compound .
( For the record , Razsa felt obliged to attend in honor of a friend who was departing for Iraq ; in fact he was as scornful of the " hippie protest kids " as he was of the pro-war element that showed up . )
Leaving the demonstration , he stopped at a lemonade stand where a young girl and her mother had set up shop .
They got to talking , and it turned out they were family of George Herbert Walker III , former ambassador to Hungary and first cousin of the ex-president up the road .
Ever respectful , Razsa kept his politics to himself and enjoyed the lemonade .
It was the young girl who turned to him and held forth : " Just because we 're related to them , does n't mean we vote for them or believe in what they do . "
" What did she say ? " the mother asked .
Shocked , Razsa repeated the girl 's declaration .
The mother nodded in approval .
Razsa 's time in this strange universe will come to an end when the weather turns -- pool - cleaning is seasonal , hence his willingness to talk openly .
He hopes for a fresh start after this .
" There are two things I wanted to do since I was a little kid .
The first was join the Marines and then transfer to the Navy Seals , " he says .
When he got older , that dream unraveled .
" I tried to talk myself into it being okay , but I could n't get past the possibility of the government misusing our service . "
The second dream remains :
He wants to make films .
Over the last few years , he 's learned a fair amount , and he hopes to make it to Los Angeles in the months ahead .
I do n't doubt he has the skills and conviction to break into the industry , but I wonder aloud if Hollywood would n't be just a bigger , and possibly corrupting , Kennebunkport in his eyes .
" Gray ( Maine ) , where I grew up , was a tough , working - class place .
I know what 's retarded and what 's not , " Razsa replies .
" Anyway , I do n't romanticize staying poor .
Living in terrible poverty , and having no time for anything because you 're always working -- that sucks , too .
I 've got a giant hole in my tooth that I can't afford to fill .
I 've got to do something . "
Fortunately , wiser souls have covered this terrain , and reported back : " The fact is , prosperity has a purpose .
It 's to allow us to pursue ' the better angels , ' to give us time to think and grow . "
In the 19 years since Razsa 's client spoke those words , in his Republican National Convention acceptance address , the amount he 's thought and grown -- well , it could probably fill a good - sized pool .
Which , fortunately , someone 's been on hand to clean .

A recovering heroin addict walked out of an open prison to escape the culture of drug - taking among inmates .
Shaun Melfah claimed he was so worried he might succumb to the temptation of freely available drugs that he decided to leave halfway through his sentence .
Police found the burglar living at his home address five days later .
He was returned to a higher security jail to serve the rest of his sentence .
The case brought scathing criticism from a judge for Leyhill Prison in Gloucestershire for failing to tackle its drug culture .
Recorder Michael Parroy QC spoke out at Gloucester Crown Court after Melfah appeared before him to admit absconding .
" I take into account your plea of guilty to the escape charge and I accept that regrettably this open prison has a serious drug problem , " he told Melfah .
" You did n't want to be part of it and went home .
" I remember that not long ago a number of other prisoners did the same thing . "
The prison - from which more than 500 inmates have absconded in the past ten years - is one of 13 open prisons in the UK .
Melfah , 24 , who says he is still clean of drugs , was sentenced to an extra two months imprisonment on top of the 14 - month sentence he must complete after he was convicted of three counts of theft .
Steve Young , defending , said his client had initially been placed in traditional prisons , Gloucester Prison and Erlestoke in Wiltshire , where drug - taking was stamped on .
But Melfah was later transferred to Leyhill .
Mr Young said his client had weaned himself off heroin and did not want to go there .
" He expressed a strong wish not to go to Leyhill because he had a history of drug misuse , had dealt with it and was drug - free , " said Mr Young .
" But he heard that drugs were more rife there than in traditional jails .
When he got to Leyhill he found that was true .
Drugs were being used frequently and he was coerced and tempted .
" He asked to be moved back to Erlestoke but was refused .
He felt that unless he did something , he would lapse back .
He voted with his feet and went home .
" During all that time he never gave into the temptation to take drugs again .
He is still clean .
" This is not the first time that prisoners have left Leyhill for similar reasons . "
Last year , a former inmate of Leyhill - said drug and alcohol abuse were rife .
" It 's like a holiday camp , " he said .
" The only thing it does n't have is a swimming pool .
" You can get any drugs .
It 's easier to get them inside than it is outside .
I saw lads who did n't do drugs become addicted to heroin and all sorts while they were there .
" You have day release , which many people just do n't come back from , and a key to let yourself in and out of your room . "
Figures released showed that 393 offenders have escaped from Leyhill since Labour came to power in 1997 , with 25 still not detained .
Earlier this year , Cotswolds MP Geoffrey Clifton - Brown called for an urgent review of security at the jail , after it was revealed that 50 of its current inmates were classed as being " high risk " or " very high risk " offenders .
DURHAM , N.H. — Thanks to a $ 5 million gift , the University of New Hampshire will transform and expand its existing open ocean aquaculture site into the UNH Sustainable Seafood Field Laboratory .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) --
The new Democratic - led House Thursday passed legislation aimed at " Big Oil " that would roll back some industry tax breaks and force energy companies to pay more drilling royalties , valued at $ 14 billion over 10 years .
Passage of the bill by a vote of 264- 163 capped House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's 100 - hour agenda , which also included measures to raise the minimum wage , lower student loan interest rates and bolster homeland security .
The $ 14 billion raised from the additional royalties and repealed tax breaks would fund research for renewable energy sources .
The measure still must be approved by the Senate and the president before it becomes law .
Going after major integrated U.S. oil firms like Exxon Mobil Corp. , Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips has been a top priority for the House Democratic leadership , which says they have earned record profits at the expense of U.S. motorists paying high gasoline prices .
" The oil and gas industry is extraordinarily well established and well off , " said House Democratic leader Steny Hoyer .
" It does not need the American taxpayer 's help to be successful or to make a dollar . "
About half of the bill 's savings comes from eliminating a lower tax rate on oil companies , which will bring in about $ 6.5 billion from 2007 to 2016 , according to a congressional estimate .
The lower tax rate had been given to all U.S. manufacturers in 2004 , including oil companies .
The rest of money would come from a " conservation fee " on oil and gas production that the bill would impose on energy companies that refused to renegotiate faulty leases signed in 1998 - 99 , which would raise about $ 7.6 billion .
Shares of oil majors , including ExxonMobil ( Charts ) , ConocoPhillips ( Charts ) , Chevron ( Charts ) and Royal Dutch Shell ( Charts ) ended Thursday 's trading session lower except for BP ( Charts ) which edged slightly higher .
Why gasoline follows oil up but not down
WASHINGTON , Aug. 4 — If the idea was to shame lawmakers into restraint , it did not work .
Eight months after Democrats vowed to shine light on the dark art of “ earmarking ” money for pet projects , many lawmakers say the new visibility has only intensified the competition for projects by letting each member see exactly how many everyone else is receiving .
So far this year , House lawmakers have put together spending bills that include almost 6,500 earmarks for almost $ 11 billion in local projects , only half of which the Bush administration supported .
The earmark frenzy hit fever pitch in recent days , even as the Senate passed new rules that allow more public scrutiny of them .
Far from causing embarrassment , the new transparency has raised the value of earmarks as a measure of members ’ clout .
Indeed , lawmakers have often competed to have their names attached to individual earmarks and rushed to put out press releases claiming credit for the money they bring home .

First Google Health Screenshots
Google Health , codename “ Weaver ” , is Google ’s planned health information storage program .
Google ’s Vice President of Engineering Adam Bosworth lobbies for the program for quite a while now .
Adam said the current US health care system is challenged when it comes to “ supporting caregivers and communicating between different medical organizations . ”
Adam went on to say that people “ need the medical information that is out there and available to be organized and made accessible to all ...
Health information should be easier to access and organize , especially in ways that make it as simple as possible to find the information that is most relevant to a specific patient ’s needs . ”
Adam adds that this – making information accessible – happens to be along Google ’s mission .
The New York Times today writes that “ about 20 percent of the [ US ] patient population have computerized records – rather than paper ones – and the Bush administration has pushed the health care industry to speed up the switch to electronic formats .
But these records still tend to be controlled by doctors , hospitals or insurers .
A patient moves to another state , for example , but the record usually stays . ”
But , the NYT continues , initiatives like the one by Google “ would give much more control to individuals , a trend many health experts see as inevitable . ”
A prototype of Google Health has now been shown “ to health professionals and advisers , ” the NYT reports .
To find out just what you might be able to see in a future Google Health service , take a look at these screenshots from Google ’s prototype which have been sent in here .
As prototypes go , certain approaches of the program may change , and the specific interface may or may not be kept like this in a final release .
“ We ’ll make mistakes and it will be a long - range march , ” the NYT quotes Adam Bosworth .
There are two tabs to be seen in Google Health : Profiles and Medical Contacts .
The profiles tab has several sub-sections , including “ Services and health guide , ” “ Conditions & symptoms , ” “ Medications , ” “ Age , sex , height ... ” and “ Family history . ”
A privacy policy at the bottom disclaims that “ Any information you enter will remain private .
Google will not share it with anyone without your permission . ”
This “ Conditions & symptoms ” dialog includes an auto - completion feature , just like other input boxes in Google Health .
You enter “ head ” , and Google suggests “ Head and Neck Angioedema ” , “ Head Injury ” , “ Head Pain ” and more .
The “ Services and health guide ” section reads : “ Get the most out of Google Health - If your medical providers or pharmacy offer secure downloading of medical records , you can find and add your records to a profile .
You can also browse for websites that connect securely to Google Health and provide services for managing your health care . ”
Under the headline “ Google health guide ” this explanation follows : “ When you add some information to your profile , Google Health will search trusted medical sources and create a health guide targeted for you .
... Google Health will check for relevant updates to your guide whenever you add new information to the profile . ”
You can use the health guide , Google writes , to learn about drug interactions , treatments , tests and preventive measures .
A side box warns , “ Be sure to discuss questions about your medical care with your doctor or medical provider before making changes , ” and a footnote reads , “ Built in collaboration with www.safe-med.com”.
The “ Allergies ” tab .
The “ Add an Allergy ” box suggests “ e.g. penicillin . ”
You can add a procedure or surgery on this page .
As an example , Google provides “ appendectomy . ”
The “ Test results ” section .
You can add e.g. “ cholesterol LDL ” .
The “ Add an immunication ” interface does not allow free - style text input , but restricts you to a selection box instead .
Available entries include “ Diphtheria , tetanus toxoids , acellular pertussis vaccine ( DTaP ) ” or “ Hepatitis A vaccine . ”
The “ Age , sex , height ... ” page collects various personal information such as date of birth , gender , ethnicity , blood type , weight , or smoking habits .
One of the questions asked is , “ Do you drink alcoholic beverages ? ”
Another question is , “ Have you smoked more than 20 cigarettes in your lifetime ? ”
Google explains that they ask for your date of birth to “ keep your age up to date and show the most relevant guidance . ”
The “ Family history ” dialog lets you add a relative and their respective conditions .
The selection box includes entries like “ Husband ” , “ Wife ” , “ Mother ” , “ Father ” , “ Son ” , and Google provides the condition example “ diabetes . ”
On this page , you can “ add a doctor ” .
Our current unnamed sample patient has no medical contacts .
You can search the “ Google Doctor Directory ” to find contacts .

Richard Dawkins said it was statistically improbable ; Louis Dollo , a French paleontologist , famously developed a hypothesis stating that it could never happen .
But a tiny soil mite smaller than a pinhead has reevolved the ability to mate , according to a study by evolutionary geneticists Katja Domes of the Technical University of Darmstadt , Germany , and Roy Norton of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse .
After analyzing various mites ’
DNA , the duo concluded that the sexually reproducing Crotoniidae mite is a descendant of Camisiidae mites , which have reproduced asexually for hundreds of millions of years since they themselves evolved from a sexually reproducing ancestor .
Through a process called parthenogenesis , Camisiidae females typically lay eggs that are exact copies of themselves .
Although males are born every once in a while , they are always sterile .
Or so it was thought .
“ Those rare males may have enabled Crotoniidae to reevolve sex , ” says Domes .
Usually when traits fall into disuse , their corresponding genes quickly mutate to code for something else .
So when something as complex as the ability to produce sex gametes is lost , it ’s likely never to be developed again .
Oddly , the Camisiidae mites seem to have retained that ability , despite surviving millions of years without using it .
The case came to light when a mother could not find her six - month - old daughter after leaving her asleep at a school in Musahari village .
After a police search the child 's body was found buried nearby .
A few hours later , Amarjeet Sada , who police claim suffers from psychiatric disorders , apparently admitted that he had strangled her and led villagers to the spot where he had disposed of the body .
NDTV , a news channel , showed pictures of Amarjeet outside the local police station .
The child allegedly crushed the little girl to death with a stone and buried her body .
He was arrested and appeared in court earlier this week .
" She was sleeping in the school .
I took her a little away , and killed her with a stone and buried her , " he reportedly told police .
Villagers claim Amarjeet is also responsible for the deaths of his sister and cousin but that the matter was hushed up .
The boy has been placed in a remand home in the nearby town of Munger .
Under Indian law , a child cannot be sentenced to death or sent to prison , but can be detained at a children 's home until they turn 18 .
The frenzied reporting of the case highlights the growing trend in Indian media to focus on gruesome killings .
Earlier this week the newspapers were filled with stories about a serial killer who dumped the headless bodies of his victims outside the main jail in Delhi .
The man , reports said , had been arrested in a murder case in 1998 but acquitted four years later .
Shoe Lacing Methods
An extensive selection of 62 × shoe lacing tutorials , including traditional and alternative lacing methods that are either widely used , have a particular feature or benefit , or that I just like the look of .
62 × Different Ways to Lace Shoes
Sort by : Default A - Z Date Rating
Filter by : All Decorative Practical Military
Criss Cross Lacing
Probably the most common method of lacing normal shoes & boots , the laces simply criss - cross as they work their way up the shoe .
Over Under Lacing
This method reduces friction , making the lacing easier to tighten and loosen plus reducing wear and tear .
The laces alternate between crossing Over and Under .
Gap Lacing
This simple variation of Criss Cross Lacing skips a crossover to create a gap in the middle of the lacing , either to bypass a sensitive area on the instep or to increase ankle flexibility .
Lock Lacing Vertical segments with the opposite ends passing underneath form “ pulleys ” for extra tightening , locking the heels for less slippage in running or climbing shoes .
Straight European Lacing
This traditional method of straight lacing appears to be more common in Europe .
The laces run straight across on the outside and diagonally on the inside .
Straight Bar Lacing
Also referred to as “ Lydiard Lacing ” , this variation of straight lacing eliminates the underlying diagonals , which looks neater plus relieves pressure on the top ridge of the foot .
Hidden Knot Lacing
By hiding the knot underneath , the result is an uninterrupted series of straight “ bars ” that looks particularly distinctive on dress shoes or sneakers alike .
Straight Easy Lacing
This is a simplified variation of Straight Bar Lacing where one end runs straight from bottom to top while the other end steps through the eyelets .
End Shortening Lacing
A variation of Straight Bar Lacing with a convoluted path on the inside that invisibly consumes more shoelace , effectively “ shortening ” the ends .
Commando Lacing
Used by various military to lace tall combat boots .
One end is anchored at the bottom and the other end is used for tying off at the top .
Hiking / Biking Lacing
An inside - out version of Straight Bar Lacing , which distributes pressure evenly plus keeps the knots & ends to the side , away from either snagging undergrowth or from bicycle chains & cranks .
Quick Tight Lacing
A straight lacing method that is split into two sections for quick and even tightening .
Pulling one loose end tightens the top section , the other loose end tightens the bottom section .
Gippo Lacing
A blend of Quick Tight Lacing and Corset Lacing , this complex method combines split sections plus closed loops at top for quick tightening of tall boots .
Ukrainian Lacing Named by its Ukrainian inventor , this method has permanently - anchored loose ends plus a “ captive ” Starting Knot , which saves having to re-tie that first knot each time .
Corset Lacing Traditional lacing for corsets , in which the laces can be gripped and pulled very tightly via the middle loops .
Useful for lacing boots extra tight or just for a different look .
Sawtooth Lacing
This method has all of the underlying sections pulling at a steep angle , which shifts the alignment of the sides and may correct an otherwise ill - fitting shoe .
Lightning Lacing
So named because the angled sections look a bit like a lightning bolt , plus it is lightning fast to lace .
The laces run diagonally on the outside and vertically on the inside .
Shoe Shop Lacing Previously common in shoe shops because many shoes came pre-laced this way from the factory .
One end runs from bottom to top while the other end zig -zags through the remaining eyelets .
Display Shoe Lacing
Shoe stores and photographers often use this inside - out version of Criss Cross Lacing on their display shoes in order to finish with the ends neatly hidden inside the shoe .
CAF Combat Boot Lacing
This subtle variation of Display Shoe Lacing is the official method prescribed by the Canadian Armed Forces for lacing combat boots , safety boots and lineman boots .
Chevron Lacing Separate sections of Criss Cross Lacing and Display Shoe Lacing , forming upright and inverted chevrons ( ∧ , ∨ ) similar to those on military or police uniforms .
Ladder Lacing
This distinctive lacing is worn on military boots by paratroopers and ceremonial guard units .
The laces weave horizontally and vertically , forming a secure “ ladder ” .
Quick Release Ladder Lacing
To speed up the removal of tall boots with many eyelets , this lacing only needs a couple of simple steps to release the top row , then the rest of the lacing loosens instantly .
Spider Web Lacing Like an angled version of Ladder Lacing , this decorative method is also worn on military boots .
The laces weave vertically and diagonally , forming an intricate “ web ” .
Double Back Lacing
This method looks interesting plus holds very firmly , but is terribly awkward to tighten .
The lacing first runs down the shoe , then doubles back up the shoe .
Bow Tie Lacing
This method “ lengthens ” ends because it consumes the least amount of shoelace .
The laces cross over on the outside and run vertically on the inside , forming a “ bow - tie ” outline .
Army Lacing
This inside - out version of Bow Tie Lacing is used on combat boots by various armies .
With the crossovers on the insides , the sides of the boots can flex more easily .
Train Track Lacing Like Army Lacing with the inside segments running straight across , the result looks like train tracks , and holds very tight because of the doubled laces through eyelets .
Winter Solstice Lacing
A fairly useless method , with the laces taking the shortest path through all the eyelets and with hardly any segments visible – reminiscent of the sun 's path in mid-winter .
Left Right Lacing
Having one end always emerging through eyelets while the other end always feeds in through eyelets creates a series of “ V ” symbols that point alternately left and right .
Double Helix Lacing
Also referred to as “ Spiralacing ” , this patented method has the laces angled one way on the outside and the other way on the inside .
The resulting double helix reduces friction and allows faster , tightening and loosening .
Locked Double Helix Lacing
A variation of Double Helix Lacing with inside - out crossovers , transforming it from a low - friction lacing that was fast and easy into a high - friction lacing that “ locks ” each row .
Double Cross Lacing
This lacing is created by running three steps forward ( on the inside ) , one step back ( on the outside ) .
The result is short , wide crosses overlapping tall , narrow crosses .
Two - One - Three Lacing Lacing across the ankle area in “ 2 - 1 - 3 ” sequence creates a firm Double Cross that reduces pinching and may help prevent painful “ lace bite ” in tightly laced boots or skates .
Hash Lacing Like Double Cross Lacing , this method is also created by running three steps forward , one step back .
The result resembles a diagonal series of hash “ # ” symbols .
Waffle Lacing Like a compressed Hash Lacing , this method runs two steps forward , one step back , with double - passes through eyelets .
Resembles the grid of raised squares or diamonds of a waffle .
Lattice Lacing
This very popular method forms a decorative lattice in the middle of the lacing .
The laces are crossed at a steep angle , allowing them to be woven through each other .
Zipper Lacing
This method “ locks ” the laces at each eyelet pair .
Great for lacing skates tightly because the lower sections hold while tightening .
It also looks interesting – a bit like a giant zipper .
Riding Boot Lacing
Also referred to as “ Bal - Lacing ” , this method is for riding boots ( motorbike or equestrian ) whose sides are joined at the top and loosen near the ankle .
The laces zig - zag from both ends and are tied in the middle .
One Handed Lacing
As an alternative to the One Handed Shoelace Knot , this way of lacing eliminates the need to even tie a knot by leaving one end loose .
Segmented Lacing
Also referred to as “ Zoned Lacing ” , this method divides the lacing into two or more segments , each of which can be laced up as tightly or loosely as necessary to achieve a comfortable yet secure fit for difficult shoes or feet .
Knotted Segment Lacing
A more attractive though less flexible variation of Segmented Lacing in which a knot makes the lower segment of shoelace permanently tighter or looser .
Loop Back Lacing
Each side loops back on itself down the middle , rather like when two springs become intertwined .
However , those loop - backs tend to shift off - centre .
Hill Valley Lacing Pairs of rows are looped around each other , the peaked rows forming “ hills ” and the dipped rows forming “ valleys ” .
The name is also a tribute to the “ Back to the Future ” movies .
Knotted Lacing Adding an overhand knot at each crossover increases friction and keeps the lacing much firmer .
Ideal for tightening ice skates , rollerblades , etc .
Twistie Lacing Similar to Loop Back Lacing with full twists instead of half twists , forming vertical overhand knots similar to the horizontal ones in Knotted Lacing .
Roman Lacing Alternating “ X - I - X - I ” on top of the shoe looks a little like Roman numerals .
It 's most effective on dress shoes where the sides of the shoe meet in the middle .
C.I.A. Lacing
This set of methods was taught to C.I.A. officers during the Cold War as a form of covert signalling , using straight segments interpersed with one or more visible crossovers at different positions .
Hexagram Lacing
This purely decorative lacing forms a hexagram , or six - pointed star .
This geometric symbol has been used for centuries in various cultures and religions , most notably as the Jewish “ Star of David ” .
Pentagram Lacing
This purely decorative lacing forms a pentagram , or five - pointed star .
Besides the “ magical ” associations , solid five - pointed stars are found on many flags , most notably the fifty stars on the U.S. flag .
Asterisk Lacing
Lacing sets of three eyelet pairs with a crossover plus a straight section results in a series of asterisk [ *] symbols .
Best on shoes with multiples of three eyelet pairs ( 3 , 6 , 9 , etc ) .
Starburst Lacing
With all vertical segments hidden on the inside and all diagonal segments on the outside crossing at the middle of the shoe , the result looks like a “ starburst ” .
Supernova Lacing
Like two “ starbursts ” on top of each other – one on the outside , the other on the inside .
Needs the maximum length of shoelace and is useful for “ shortening ” long laces .
Zig Zag Lacing
This twin -rail zig - zag is a bit like a winding road or marble race .
The laces alternately run vertically on the inside or wrap around the vertical sections on the opposite side .
Progressive Lacing
With crossovers running at progressively steeper angles towards the toes , this lacing should feel progressively tighter towards the ankles , plus it looks decorative .
Perspective Lacing
This decorative lacing has overlapping segments running at varying slopes similar to Progressive Lacing , forming a sideways perspective grid .
Escher Lacing Decorative lacing whose outline resembles fish swimming alternately left and right , reminiscent of the tesselated prints from Dutch artist M.C. Escher .
Cascade Lacing
A decorative lacing with each row looped under the previous row , forming a diagonal series of loops that appears to “ cascade ” down the shoe .
Cyclone Fence Lacing
Alternately looping under the left and right of previous rows forms a decorative lacing that resembles a section of the diamond pattern of cyclone fencing ( or “ chain - link ” fencing ) .
Woven Lacing
An “ extreme lacing ” for those who want a decorative method that others would never attempt .
The laces are woven up and down between adjacent rows , creating an intricate mesh .
Footbag Lacing Footbag players use this lacing to open up the front of their shoes , making it easier to catch or otherwise control the footbag ( or “ Hacky Sack ” ) .
NASA Space Boot Lacing
Used on astronaut 's boots during the early space program .
A doubled - up shoelace snakes up the shoe , passing both ways through each eyelet to lock tightly .

I almost could n't choose a lace design since there were so many cool ways to do the laces up on the website !

How Low Will Housing Go ?
That question may be the key to the future actions of the Federal Reserve .
One estimate of " How Low Will Housing Go ? " comes from Jan Hatzius , Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs :
" Our working assumption has been that US home prices are about 15 % overvalued .
This relies on a simple " affordability " measure which essentially adjusts the home price / income ratio by the level of ( nominal ) mortgage rates .
Depending on one 's assumption about income growth , the likelihood of overshooting on the downside , and the length of the adjustment process , this suggests cumulative nominal home price declines of 5 - 15 % in the next few years .
However , affordability is becoming an increasingly problematic concept because it ignores changes in credit availability and changes in nonconforming mortgage rates .
Hence , it may be better to look at simpler price / income or price / rent ratios to get a sense of house price valuation .
These paint a more dire picture .
Even if we assume that the long - term trend for price / income and price / rent is higher now than the average of the 1975 - 2000 period ( because interest rates are likely to stay lower ) , cumulative nominal price declines of 15% - 30 % are possible . "
That 's not so different from what HSBC HomePulse wrote back in January 2006 :
" We suggest that about half of the US housing market is frothy and that this ‘ bubble zone ’ may be overvalued by as much as 35 - 40 % , after taking into account low interest rates and tax advantages .
Current valuations imply a large permanent reduction in the risk premium and / or a sizable step up in future capital gains , not all of which , we think , is justified .
The ‘ bubble zone ’ accounts for 50 % of US GDP , or over USD , nearly the size of the German , French , and UK economies put together .
In other words , it ’s big .
Therefore , when these housing bubbles begin to deflate , it is likely to have substantial macroeconomic consequences .
What ’s troubling is that even a perfect ‘ soft landing ’ in the form of flat national house prices would be consistent with a 35 - 40 % collapse in existing home sales .
The gush of liquidity from mortgage equity withdrawal would dry up , resulting in a growth drag worth over 3 % of GDP .
If this adjustment can be managed over many years ( and hopefully it will ) , the economy can avoid recession and get away with soft growth .
If the process is squeezed into a shorter time frame instead , then recession is probable , forcing the Fed to once again consider unconventional policy options – a probability that would only rise if the money supply were to decline at the same time the ‘ bubble zone ’ deflates . "
Whenever I hear anyone suggest that these events were totally unforeseeable , I know that person is full of $ %#*.

– A sharp increase has been registered in the number of Israelis who choose to give up their Israeli citizenship in order to be granted German nationality .
While only 30 people contacted the Israeli embassy in Berlin with a request to concede their nationality last year , 150 have already done so in 2007 .
According to German law , applicants who wish to acquire German citizenship must give up their former nationality , except in cases of Jews who were persecuted by the Nazis , or of children of mixed couples in which one of the parents is German and the other is not .
The German authorities easily grant unlimited residency permits to Israeli immigrants who are registered as members of one of the Jewish communities in the country or who are married to German nationals .
Permit holders enjoy most of the rights given to citizens , save for the right to vote in elections , or to be elected .
A significant part of the Israelis who have give up their citizenship are immigrants from the former Soviet Union who moved to Germany .

More voltage in an electrical system makes more current flow .

So much of our daily lives runs on electricity , yet most of us do n't know the difference between a 60 - watt and 75 - watt light bulb , or how voltage from the wall socket supplies enough juice to run both a small desk lamp and a powerful microwave .
­ The­ three most basic units in electricity are voltage ( V ) , current ( I , uppercase " i " ) and resistance ( R ) .
Voltage is measured in volts , current is measured in amps and resistance is measured in ohms .

A neat analogy to help understand these terms is a system of plumbing pipes .
The voltage is equivalent to the water pressure , the current is equivalent to the flow rate , and the resistance is like the pipe size .
There is a basic equation in electrical engineering that states how the three terms relate .
It says that the current is equal to the voltage divided by the resistance or I = V/R .
This is known as Ohm 's law .
Let 's see how this relation applies to the plumbing system .
Let 's say you have a tank of pressurized water connected to a hose that you are using to water the garden .
What happens if you increase the pressure in the tank ?
You probably can guess that this makes more water come out of the hose .
The same is true of an electrical system :
Increasing the voltage will make more current flow .
Let 's say you increase the diameter of the hose and all of the fittings to the tank .
You probably guessed that this also makes more water come out of the hose .
This is like decreasing the resistance in an electrical system , which increases the current flow .
Electrical power is measured in watts .
In an electrical system power ( P ) is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current .
The water analogy still applies .
Take a hose and point it at a waterwheel like the ones that were used to turn grinding stones in watermills .
You can increase the power generated by the waterwheel in two ways .
If you increase the pressure of the water coming out of the hose , it hits the waterwheel with a lot more force and the wheel turns faster , generating more power .
If you increase the flow rate , the waterwheel turns faster because of the weight of the extra water hitting it .
On the next page , we 'll talk more about electrical efficiency .

LIKE a movie star , he is late , but that only whets his fans ' appetite to see him .
Thousands stand under the vicious midday sun in a park in Reno , Nevada .
No other presidential candidate could pull such a large , passionate or politically diverse crowd .
Reggie Willis , a medical student , voted for George Bush in 2004 but now says Barack Obama is “ the guy America is waiting for ” .
Mr Obama eventually moseys onto the stage and starts massaging the crowd with his seductive baritone .
He calls for a new , less selfish , less timid politics that “ reflects the core decency of the American people ” .
The crowd is too wound up in loving him to wonder what , in practice , that might actually involve .
Three years ago no one had heard of Mr Obama — he was just a local politician in Illinois .
Then he gave a keynote address at the Democratic Party 's convention in 2004 , when he was running for a seat in the US Senate .
He was , he told the convention , the son of a Kenyan man who grew up herding goats and went to school in a tin -roof shack .
His father got a scholarship “ to study in a magical place , America ” , where he married a white woman from Kansas .
Although they were not rich , their son went to Harvard .
“ In no other country on earth is my story even possible , ” he said .
He won his Senate race easily .
Could he go further ?
The idea that he could run for president at first seemed absurd .
But Mr Obama 's evident star power makes it seem plausible .
It probably helps that he is black ( or , at least , mixed - race ) .
A generation ago , this would have been a fatal disadvantage .
But now many white Americans would love to elect a black president , to demonstrate to the world and themselves that they are not bigots .
In a recent study by the Pew Research Centre , 92 % of Americans said they would be prepared to vote for a black candidate , up from 37 % in 1958 .
This is a big change , and Mr Obama is well - positioned to take advantage of it .
Some black Americans worry that he is not really one of them because his ancestors were not brought to America as slaves and he played no role in the civil - rights movement .
He addressed such worries , brilliantly , in a speech in Selma , Alabama , on the anniversary this year of a voting - rights march that was violently dispersed .
Without the civil - rights movement , he said , his white mother and black father might not have wed .
“ So do n't tell me ” , he said , “ I do n't have a claim on Selma , Alabama .
Do n't tell me I 'm not coming home to Selma , Alabama . ”
Can all this charisma win him the nomination ?
The polls say probably not .
He cannot match Hillary Clinton 's organisation on the ground .
He trails her by ten points or so in national polls of likely Democratic primary voters ( see chart ) , and he leads in none of the early primary states .
On the other hand , he raised more money for the primaries than Mrs Clinton in the first quarter of this year — an astonishing feat for a newcomer .
So he must be taken seriously .
What , then , does he stand for ?
On Iraq , his position is clear .
Unlike his main rivals , he opposed the war from the start .
But he is no dove .
He says that “ no president should ever hesitate to use force ” , unilaterally if necessary , when America or its vital interests are attacked or threatened .
On foreign policy more broadly , he is both ambitious and idealistic .
He would strengthen NATO , build new alliances in Asia , halt the genocide in Darfur , push for peace in the Middle East and help the world 's poorest countries build functioning market economies .
Admirable goals , but he gives only a sketchy idea as to how he would achieve any of them .
His support for free trade is tepid .
He favours trade deals only if foreigners agree to a host of labour and environmental standards and if American workers who lose their jobs are well looked after .
He favours universal health care , but his plan is both less bold and less rigorously costed than that of his Democratic rival , John Edwards .
An Obama presidency would signal to many , in and outside America , that the American dream still works .
His opposition to the two policies that have hurt America 's image most — invading Iraq and making use of torture — will convince many that he represents a fresh start .
But his inexperience is worrisome , and the source of Mrs Clinton 's greatest advantage over him .
As George Will , a conservative columnist , put it , he is asking Americans to “ treat the presidency as a nearly entry - level political office ” .
Wearied by the lack of progress in Iraq and by the steady stream of military funerals back home , a growing number of Republican lawmakers who had stood loyally with President Bush are insisting his strategy has failed and are calling on him to bring the war to an end .
In the last two weeks , three GOP senators -- including one of the party ’s leading voices on foreign affairs and one of Bush ’s strongest allies -- have urged the president to change course now so U.S. troops can start to withdraw .
And Friday , in interviews with the Los Angeles Times , two more Senate Republicans bluntly voiced disappointment with the president ’s approach and pressed for change .
“ It should be clear to the president that there needs to be a new strategy , ” said Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee .
“ Our policy in Iraq is drifting . ”

Sen . Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , who helped lead the charge earlier this year against Democratic efforts to oppose Bush ’s troop buildup , said : “ We do n’t seem to be making a lot of progress . ”
It is vital to have “ a clear blueprint for how we were going to draw down , ” he said .
None of these GOP lawmakers has embraced Democratic legislation to compel a troop withdrawal .
But nearly five years after congressional Republicans overwhelmingly answered Bush ’s call for military action against Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein , some are doing what was once unthinkable : challenging a wartime president from their own party .
By publicly branding Bush ’s buildup a failure and calling for troops to begin coming home , they are forcing a reluctant White House to reassess how long it can maintain a large military presence in Iraq .

Administration officials had hoped GOP lawmakers would stand with them at least until September , when the top generals in Iraq are scheduled to report on the effectiveness of the troop buildup .
The tide of Republican dissent began to grow two weeks ago when Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana , former chairman of the foreign relations committee , delivered an earnest plea for change from the floor of the Senate .
Sen. George V. Voinovich of Ohio expressed similar doubts in a letter he sent to the president the next day , and Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia , the former chairman of the armed services committee , openly praised Lugar for speaking out .
On Thursday , Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico joined the group of dissenters , which just a few weeks ago included only a handful of GOP lawmakers -- led by Nebraska ’s Sen. Chuck Hagel and Oregon ’s Sen. Gordon H. Smith .
Several Republican lawmakers have predicted that defections would accelerate in the weeks to come , despite repeated pleas for patience from the White House and the military .
Advertisement
“ It ’s as if the dike has burst , ” said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine , who until recently had been one of the few outspoken GOP critics of the president ’s war strategy .
Today , bills in the House and Senate to adopt the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group -- an implicit rejection of current U.S. policy in Iraq -- have the backing of 40 Republicans combined .
Though it did not set a deadline for withdrawing American troops , the bipartisan commission ’s report advocated a series of substantial policy changes , including more regional diplomacy , to set the stage for a troop pullout in the spring .
Alexander is the leading GOP co-sponsor of the Senate ’s Iraq Study Group bill , which is also sponsored by five Democrats and Republicans including Gregg , Collins , Domenici , Utah ’s Robert F. Bennett and New Hampshire ’s John E. Sununu .
House Republican co-sponsors include Californians David Dreier of San Dimas and Mary Bono of Palm Springs .

This week , another House Republican , conservative Rep. John T. Doolittle from Roseville , Calif. , labeled the Iraq war “ a quagmire ” and called for a reduced U.S. military presence , according to the Sacramento Bee .
Three other GOP senators -- including conservatives Sam Brownback of Kansas and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas , a close Bush ally -- also have signed on to legislation calling for decentralizing Iraq , a direct challenge to the Bush administration ’s official position .
Bush continues to say he will resist pressure to withdraw troops prematurely , a position he reiterated in a defiant Fourth of July speech in West Virginia , in which he said such action would “ hand the enemy a victory and put America ’s security at risk . ”
In Iraq , senior military commanders said again Friday that the 30,000 - troop “ surge ” announced by Bush in January still needed more time to control violence primarily in Baghdad and to allow the Iraqi government to bring together the country ’s sectarian communities .
Advertisement
Army Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch , commander of U.S. troops in provinces just south of Baghdad , warned that any move to withdraw the additional troops in the coming months would allow insurgents to rebuild their capabilities and plunge the Iraqi capital into even more violence .
“ It would be a mess , ” Lynch said , echoing the views of other senior commanders -- including Army Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , the day - to - day commander of U.S. operations , who has estimated that Iraqi forces would not be ready to assume security in Baghdad until spring .
Many Republican lawmakers remain wary of backing legislation that challenges the White House directly , preferring to try to persuade Bush to change course on his own to spare Republicans from having to force his hand , thus further splitting the party .
“ There ’s always the desire to support the president , ” said Sen. Olympia J. Snowe of Maine , a maverick Republican who was among the first to call for the administration to develop a withdrawal plan .
“ He is the commander in chief .
You hesitate to express a discordant voice at a time of war . ”
Advertisement
Snowe is sponsoring legislation that would require the military to begin planning a redeployment unless the Iraqi government reaches goals identified by the White House and Congress to reduce sectarian strife .
Even with the new public criticism of the White House , few congressional Republicans appear ready to back legislation that would compel a withdrawal , a centerpiece of the congressional Democratic war policy .
This spring only two Republicans in the Senate and two in the House voted for a withdrawal timeline .
But the recent outpouring of criticism signals a new level of anxiety among many Republicans about the way their president is conducting the war .
Despite the administration ’s professed faith in the current Iraqi government , politicians in Baghdad have still not passed a law to distribute oil wealth that many see as crucial to diffusing sectarian tensions there .
Advertisement
U.S. military commanders concede that despite years of effort and billions of dollars in expenditures , Iraqi security forces are still not prepared to take primary responsibility for keeping the peace .
And U.S. casualties continue to mount .
April through June was the deadliest three - month period for U.S. forces since the war began in 2003 , a tally that resonates with lawmakers , who often speak to the families of soldiers killed in Iraq .
Domenici has said that was why he decided to go public with his concerns about the White House war strategy .
Advertisement
“ You find such a strong willingness on the parts of the parents to acknowledge that their children really wanted to be in this war , ” Domenici said Friday on NPR ’s “ All Things Considered . ”
“ Only of late do I find that parents , a couple parents , saying ...
‘ Now I want you to also try to hurry up , try to get on the side of where we can get out of there a little sooner . ’ ”
At the same time , a number of Republicans up for reelection next year -- including Snowe and Sununu -- face growing voter discontent back home .
Democratic leaders and antiwar activists are pressuring Republicans to show their commitment to changing course by voting for a withdrawal .
Later this month , Democrats will again bring the issue up for a vote .
But Democratic leaders concede that the president is likely to change course only when , in the words of veteran Rep. David R. Obey ( D - Wis. ) , Republican lawmakers “ march down Pennsylvania Avenue ” like they did three decades ago when they told President Nixon that he had to resign or would very likely be impeached .
Advertisement
There are signs that at least some in the administration are reconsidering the current strategy .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has repeatedly indicated that he would prefer to see the buildup end in the fall , perhaps as early as September when the administration is due to submit its progress report to Congress .
Gates , who is sympathetic to the Iraq Study Group recommendations , also has testified on Capitol Hill that he hopes the additional forces could be home by the end of the year .
But Alexander warned Friday that the president is running out of time .
“ The parade is forming .
We hope he ’ll get to the front of it , ” he said .
“ It may not be this week or next .
But it needs to be soon . ”

Let 's with the more familiar notion : Symmetric warfare is when both sides have more or less the same weapons and tactics .
In World War II , for example , the German tanks , planes , and machine guns battled the Allied tanks , planes , and machine guns .
In the American Civil War , blue and grey alike had cannons and rifles and cavalry .
In a conventional symmetric war , armies take and hold territory , there 's a front line , and it's not too hard to tell the difference between soldiers and civilians .
Brutal and destructive as it can be , symmetric warfare has become ( to a certain extent ) civilized .
There are rules .
Soldiers wear uniforms so that you can tell who they are rather than shooting everything that moves .
When soldiers surrender , a whole set of gentlemen 's agreements come into play .
Soldiers are like chess pieces ; once captured they are removed from the board and kept safe until the end of the game .
International agreements also proscribe the use of indiscriminate weapons like poison gas or disease .
These rules developed over centuries when warfare in Europe really was a kind of game .
Wars centered on issues of little consequence to the average person : which brother would be king , whether your town sent tribute payments to Paris or to Vienna , and so on .
If you were a civilian , you kept your head down , waited for the dust to settle , and then paid your taxes to the winner .
Even soldiers were playing a kind of game .
Some were mercenaries who fought under many different flags in the course of a career .
Others ( like my Alsatian ancestors ) came from border provinces , and so owed their allegiance to whichever king had won the previous war .
You did your job , but after the outcome was clear there was no sense getting yourself killed .
When wars were fought over something that struck deeper - like the Crusades or the Catholic / Protestant wars of the 1600's - rules went out the window .
The Thirty Years War , for example , depopulated entire regions of central Europe .
When Losers Don't Quit
Asymmetric warfare happens when it's obvious who the winner of a symmetric war would be - maybe a symmetric war has already been fought and decisively won - but some core group on the losing side is not willing to give up and get on with life .
Replaying the game of civilized symmetric warfare would just get them slaughtered to no purpose , but the issues of the war are so important that they cannot simply accept defeat .
And so they fight on - outside the game , outside the rules .
Asymmetric warriors do n't wear uniforms and fight pitched battles .
Rather than defending territory , they accept that the opposing force can go where it wants , killing and destroying at will .
They hide among civilians , they hit and run , and they attack whatever targets their enemy values but has left undefended .
Often those targets are non-combatants .
To the winners of the symmetric war ( and all others who remain locked into the game mentality of symmetric warfare ) the asymmetric warriors just look like sore losers .
If the asymmetric warriors were civilized and honorable , they would wear uniforms and face their opponents ' soldiers on a battlefield - and get slaughtered like vermin .
The asymmetric tactics - attacking civilians and running away from soldiers - look cowardly , even when they lead to certain death .
And because the decisive war is already supposed to be over , an asymmetric attack looks like pointless destruction , killing for the sake of killing .
And it would be , if not for one fact : Sometimes the asymmetric warriors win .
How on Earth does that happen ?
How Insurgents Win
Asymmetric warfare works in a very specific situation :
The winner of the symmetric war wants to govern the region ( or hand it off to a local client government ) at a finite cost .
If the asymmetric warriors - in this setting let 's call them insurgents and their opponents occupiers - can make the territory ungovernable and establish themselves in such a way that they cannot be crushed within the cost parameters of the occupiers , then eventually the occupiers will have to give them at least part of what they want .
In other words , insurgents win by not losing .
If the occupiers find the status quo unacceptable , but have no acceptable way to bring the insurgency to an end , then it is only a matter of time before they realize their goals cannot be achieved .
It 's up to the occupiers to decide when to stop the bleeding and admit defeat , but they have lost .
This is the story of the Americans in Vietnam , the Soviets in Afghanistan , and white settler governments in various parts of Africa .
It is arguably the story of the Americans in Iraq as well .
( It is worth noting why this is not - at least not yet - the story of Israel in the West Bank and Gaza .
The difference is that the Israeli level of commitment very nearly matches that of its opponents .
Israel is unable to crush the Palestinian insurgency , but seems ready to bleed at this level into the indefinite future . )
Americans have a hard time grasping this basic fact :
Right up to the day the occupying power admits defeat and pulls out , it continues to wield overwhelming force .
It may never lose a pitched battle .
It may - right up to the end - be able to go where it wants , killing and destroying at will .
That does n't mean it 's not losing .
The Recruitment Pipeline
If insurgents win by not losing , then the question shifts :
How do they lose ?
They lose by wasting away .
Their numbers diminish by death , captivity , or discouragement and they are unable to replenish themselves with new recruits .
Recruiting is an essential part of any insurgency , because the occupiers will always appear to be winning the battle of attrition .
Occupying soldiers are trying to kill insurgents while insurgents are trying to avoid occupiers , so any body count will favor the occupiers - right up to the day they admit defeat and pull out .
In a successful insurgency , warriors are only the tip of a large iceberg .
Even though the number of active warriors may be small , a much larger segment of the population is at some earlier stage of recruitment .
Some sympathize with the insurgents silently ; they know who the warriors are , but chose not to tell the occupiers .
Some help in small ways , by delivering messages , holding money , or even hiding weapons .
Some harbor warriors and help them hide from the occupiers .
Some will not fight , but will act as look - outs and report the movements of occupying troops .
A successful insurgency is always losing warriors ( sometimes by intentional suicide attacks ) , but the pipeline of recruitment is full of people moving to ever greater levels of commitment .
Occupiers who continue to think in a symmetric , conventional - war mindset ( with its sharp distinctions between soldiers and civilians ) do not see these flows of sympathy and commitment .
If the insurgency has , say , ten thousand warriors , then these occupiers believe they win by removing ten thousand insurgent pieces from the board .
But they do n't win , because in the course of removing those ten thousand pieces the occupiers push some number of sympathizers further down the path of commitment to the insurgency .
Ten , twenty , thirty thousand insurgents may die or be captured , and still the war goes on .
A man who stays out of the war for fear of losing his house will join it when his house becomes " collateral damage . "
Each family that loses a member in an occupier attack - especially an innocent member like a child - will move further down the path of recruitment .
In the beginning , an insurgency is a small group of warriors moving in a large sea of people who are waiting to see what happens next .
Maybe the occupier will be gentle .
Maybe life will go on in some acceptable way .
The insurgents ' first goal is to goad the occupier into using its overwhelming force so that life cannot go on in an acceptable way .
A foolish occupier swats flies with hammers , creating disproportionate damage and forcing the previously ambivalent population to choose sides .
Once the insurgency 's pipeline of recruitment is well established , the only exclusively military solution available to the occupier is genocide , or some form of ethnic cleansing that will move the insurgent - sympathizing population somewhere else .
An occupier who is unwilling to go that far must accept the fact that overwhelming force alone is not enough .
Military force must continue to play a role , but only in support of a political solution that gives the asymmetric warriors a reason to lay down their arms .
Occupier Strategy
If a direct kill - the - insurgents strategy is doomed to failure , what can the occupier do ?
The Vietnam - era notion of " winning hearts and minds " is not just a way for guilt - ridden liberals to feel better about themselves .
It deals with the real problem : the whole pipeline of sympathy and recruitment , not just the comparatively small number of active insurgent warriors .
Every policy of the occupier - and especially any use of force - must be examined in light of its effect on insurgent recruitment .
A search - and - destroy operation may kill dozens of insurgents with only minor occupier casualties , and still be a net loss if it pushes the general population further down the recruitment pipeline .
A lawnmower may cut down dozens of dandelions , but if it scatters their seeds hundreds more will pop up .
All effective anti-insurgent strategies involve drying up the supply of recruits by isolating the insurgents from the larger population .
In the so - called " ink spot " strategies the isolation is geographic : a small area is pacified and reconstructed to the point that it becomes governable .
The population , seeing the benefits of peaceful governance , resists insurgent efforts to infiltrate .
The surrounding areas come to envy the pacified area , and the governable " ink spot " spreads .
Other kinds of isolation can also work , as long as the population comes to see a clear separation between itself and the insurgents rather than a slippery slope .
Insurgency by its nature is a low - lifespan occupation .
Lenin's line about revolutionaries - that they are dead men on furlough - applies even moreso to insurgents .
They must take action to stay relevant , and any action they take carries great risk .
Without a constant resupply of recruits ready to die , an insurgency withers .
In order to disrupt that supply , the occupier need not be loved .
It need only convince the population that ending the occupation is not worth dying for .
The Anti-Timetable Fallacy
Much current rhetoric falls apart once these basic principles are understood .
For example , consider the Bush administration 's main argument against setting a timetable for withdrawing American troops from Iraq : that the insurgents would bide their time until we had left , and then rise up again .
If only they would .
Think about it : Suppose the insurgents sat on their hands for a year while they waited for us to withdraw .
Iraq , in other words , gets a year of peaceful governance and reconstruction .
Roads and power plants are built .
Businesses are started .
Pipelines transport oil without interruption while tens of billions of petrodollars flow into the country .
People rebuild their homes , get jobs , enroll their children in school .
And most of all , old wounds recede ever farther into the past .
What happens to the insurgent recruitment pipeline during that year ?
It collapses .
In the course of that year , many people who thought they were willing to die would realize they had something to live for .
No insurgent leader could allow it .
I do n't know what actually would happen if the U.S. announced a timetable for withdrawal , and maybe there are legitimate reasons to be against such a move .
But I guarantee that the insurgents would not sit back and wait for us to leave .
Hezbollah
Finally , we come to the issue of the day : Israel and Hezbollah .
" Israel has a right to defend herself , " President Bush said at a recent news conference .
I have no argument with that statement , I just think it is completely irrelevant .
Nations and individuals have a right to do all kinds of misguided things .
And that 's what I think Israel has done .
I understand the provocation .
Israel / Lebanon / Hezbollah has some parallels with America / Afghanistan / Al Qaeda after 9 - 11 .
Israel has been attacked by Hezbollah forces in Lebanon , and the Lebanese government is either unable or unwilling to do anything to prevent future attacks .
Any responsible Israeli leader would be trying to figure out how to defend its people and territory .
But that does n't mean going in with the hammers and lawnmowers .
Israeli rhetoric about destroying Hezbollah as a fighting force is detached from reality .
At most , the Israelis can hope to kill some large number of Hezbollah fighters and capture or destroy the current supply of rockets .
But all of that is easily replaced : Iran can send more rockets , and the number of people willing to die in order to kill Israelis has surely gone up in the past few weeks .
Killing your enemies , if it 's done badly , increases their number .
War : What 's It Good For ?
Like most liberals , I am not a pacifist .
I believe military power has its uses , and it does some things very well .
If , for example , our goal in Iraq had just been to capture Saddam - well , we did that , did n't we ?
A similar operation might have captured Bin Laden .
Bosnia is far from paradise these days , but at least people are n't dying by the tens of thousands .
With similar care the genocide in Rwanda might have been stopped , and the one in Darfur still could be .
And if anyone knew a way to go into North Korea and come out a few days later with Kim Jong - il and all the North Korean nuclear weapons , I 'd be for it .
But military force is a blunt instrument , and used badly it creates more enemies than it kills .
If you 're not prepared to kill millions of people - and I 'm not - then you have to find a way to circumscribe your enemies , so their numbers are n't instantly replenished , with interest , as soon as you kill them .
In the long run , if you are n't willing to commit genocide against your enemy 's recruitment pool , then every use of force has to be carefully calibrated .
Because it might not be a pool , it might be an aquifer .

NBC News asked military analyst General Barry McCaffrey about recent statements by intelligence officials that another al Qaeda attack is on its way .
McCaffrey said the warnings should be considered credible , even if Osama bin Laden probably " has gone to ground . "
He suggested at the same time that it would be a good idea to kill bin Laden using " remote controlled vehicles " and not attempt to capture him , adding , " Thank God for the CIA 's persistence . "
" In the short run , you know , we 're doing quite well , " McCaffrey concluded .
" An awful lot of these al - Qaeda people are dead or behind bars .
...
You 've got people like the New York Police Department and domestic law enforcement hyper-alert .
...
But the attack 's coming . "
The following video is from NBC's Today Show , broadcast on August 27 .
A legislative proposal by Senator Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) that would criminalize the unauthorized disclosure or publication of classified information “ concerning efforts by the United States to identify , investigate , or prevent terrorist activity ” is drawing strong opposition even before it has been formally introduced .
The Kyl proposal ( pdf ) , which would amend the espionage statute at 18 U.S.C. 798 , is to be offered as an amendment to an unrelated bill on data mining that will be marked up by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday , March 1 .
Classified information on U.S. counterterror efforts appears in the press with some frequency and often serves as a stimulus to intense public deliberation .
Today , for example , the Washington Post reported new information on controversial and possibly illegal CIA “ black sites ” where an unknown number of prisoners are held incommunicado for interrogation .
Under the sweeping Kyl proposal , disclosure or publication of such information could be punishable by up to twenty years in prison .
“ The proposal seeks to stifle , with the threat of criminal prosecution , informed public debate about the most serious matters of the effectiveness of government counterterrorism efforts , ” wrote dozens of public interest , first amendment and civil liberties advocacy groups ( including FAS ) in a February 27 letter ( pdf ) to the Senate Judiciary Committee .
“ We strongly urge you to reject the proposed amendment , ” they wrote in a letter coordinated by the coalition OpenTheGovernment.org , directed by Patrice McDermott .
When a bill to criminalize the unauthorized disclosure of any classified information was introduced in 2000 , it passed both houses of Congress before it encountered effective opposition ( and it was subsequently vetoed by President Clinton ) .
In remarkable contrast , the present proposal by Senator Kyl has elicited organized opposition before it has even been formally introduced .
In addition to the OpenTheGovernment.org letter , a coalition of media organizations known as the Sunshine in Government Initiative , directed by Rick Blum , issued its own critique of the bill .
The Kyl proposal was previously reported by Rebecca Carr of Cox News and also by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press .
Age of Reason by Thomas Paine
Age of Reason , Part First , Section 1
IT has been my intention , for several years past , to publish my thoughts upon religion .
I am well aware of the difficulties that attend the subject , and from that consideration , had reserved it to a more advanced period of life .
I intended it to be the last offering I should make to my fellow - citizens of all nations , and that at a time when the purity of the motive that induced me to it , could not admit of a question , even by those who might disapprove the work .
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood , and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion , and compulsive articles of faith , has not only precipitated my intention , but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary , lest in the general wreck of superstition , of false systems of government , and false theology , we lose sight of morality , of humanity , and of the theology that is true .
As several of my colleagues and others of my fellow - citizens of France have given me the example of making their voluntary and individual profession of faith , I also will make mine ; and I do this with all that sincerity and frankness with which the mind of man communicates with itself .
I believe in one God , and no more ; and I hope for happiness beyond this life .
I believe in the equality of man ; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice , loving mercy , and endeavoring to make our fellow - creatures happy .
But , lest it should be supposed that I believe in many other things in addition to these , I shall , in the progress of this work , declare the things I do not believe , and my reasons for not believing them .
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church , by the Roman church , by the Greek church , by the Turkish church , by the Protestant church , nor by any church that I know of .
My own mind is my own church .
All national institutions of churches , whether Jewish , Christian or Turkish , appear to me no other than human inventions , set up to terrify and enslave mankind , and monopolize power and profit .
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise ; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine .
But it is necessary to the happiness of man , that he be mentally faithful to himself .
Infidelity does not consist in believing , or in disbelieving ; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe .
It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief , if I may so express it , that mental lying has produced in society .
When a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind , as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe , he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime .
He takes up the trade of a priest for the sake of gain , and in order to qualify himself for that trade , he begins with a perjury .
Can we conceive any thing more destructive to morality than this ?
Soon after I had published the pamphlet Common Sense , in America , I saw the exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion .
The adulterous connection of church and state , wherever it had taken place , whether Jewish , Christian , or Turkish , had so effectually prohibited by pains and penalties , every discussion upon established creeds , and upon first principles of religion , that until the system of government should be changed , those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world ; but that whenever this should be done , a revolution in the system of religion would follow .
Human inventions and priestcraft would be detected ; and man would return to the pure , unmixed and unadulterated belief of one God , and no more .
Every national church or religion has established itself by pretending some special mission from God , communicated to certain individuals .
The Jews have their Moses ; the Christians their Jesus Christ , their apostles and saints ; and the Turks their Mahomet , as if the way to God was not open to every man alike .
Each of those churches show certain books , which they call revelation , or the word of God .
The Jews say , that their word of God was given by God to Moses , face to face ; the Christians say , that their word of God came by divine inspiration : and the Turks say , that their word of God ( the Koran ) was brought by an angel from Heaven .
Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief ; and for my own part , I disbelieve them all .
As it is necessary to affix right ideas to words , I will , before I proceed further into the subject , offer some other observations on the word revelation .
Revelation , when applied to religion , means something communicated immediately from God to man .
No one will deny or dispute the power of the Almighty to make such a communication , if he pleases .
But admitting , for the sake of a case , that something has been revealed to a certain person , and not revealed to any other person , it is revelation to that person only .
When he tells it to a second person , a second to a third , a third to a fourth , and so on , it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons .
It is revelation to the first person only , and hearsay to every other , and consequently they are not obliged to believe it .
It is a contradiction in terms and ideas , to call anything a revelation that comes to us at second - hand , either verbally or in writing .
Revelation is necessarily limited to the first communication  after this , it is only an account of something which that person says was a revelation made to him ; and though he may find himself obliged to believe it , it can not be incumbent on me to believe it in the same manner ; for it was not a revelation made to me , and I have only his word for it that it was made to him .
When Moses told the children of Israel that he received the two tables of the commandments from the hands of God , they were not obliged to believe him , because they had no other authority for it than his telling them so ; and I have no other authority for it than some historian telling me so .
The commandments carry no internal evidence of divinity with them ; they contain some good moral precepts , such as any man qualified to be a lawgiver , or a legislator , could produce himself , without having recourse to supernatural intervention .
