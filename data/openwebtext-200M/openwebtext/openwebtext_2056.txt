Huckabee at Falwell 's Church : Ten Commandments better than law Michael Roston
Published : Monday February 11 , 2008

Print This Email This Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee has won electoral contests by focusing his pitch to religious conservatives around the country .
And in a Sunday visit to the church of the deceased Rev. Jerry Falwell , Huckabee threw that base some more red meat .
" We really dont need a lot of law if were people of morality , " Huckabee said at the Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg , Virginia , according to a report in the Lynchburg News Advance .
" There are only 10 basic laws that we need the reason that the law is more complicated is because we try to find clever ways around those 10 . "
Additional reports at CBS News showed Huckabee taking his statement a step farther .
" I hope you know Jesus Christ personally because the level to which he rules you and governs you , you need less and less of mans law to tell you how to live and that is what our Founding Fathers understood and we must understand , " he preached .
Huckabee also railed against what he called the " degeneration of morality " in society before playing his bass guitar with the church 's musicians .
The Baptist minister and former governor is n't new to calling for more Biblical influence on America 's system of government .
On the stump in Michigan in January , Huckabee declared that there was a need , " to amend the Constitution so it 's in God 's standards rather than try to change God 's standards so it lines up with some contemporary view . "
The late Falwell 's Liberty University has long been an important battleground for Republican presidential hopefuls .
Sen .
John McCain earned the ire of social conservatives during his 2000 run for president when he described Falwell and other Christian conservative leaders as " agents of intolerance . "
But he reconciled with Falwell in 2006 , reversing his position on the Baptist minister , and subsequently delivered a commencement address at Liberty .
It was Huckabee , however , who reportedly got the late Rev. Falwell 's endorsement .
" My father supported Huckabee before he was number two in the polls , " Jerry Falwell , Jr. announced in November , according to MSNBC .
Still , the News Advance 's Christa Desrets reported , Falwell Jr. 's brother Jonathan demurred from endorsing Huckabee .
 I would never endorse anybody from the pulpit ,  she quotes him saying , adding that he appeared undecided between McCain and Huckabee .
Huckabee continues to trail McCain in Virginia polls , even after the withdrawal of Mitt Romney from the race .
The commonwealth 's voters will select their candidates for president on Tuesday .
( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama widened his lead over Sen. Hillary Clinton in the overall delegate count by picking up delegates in Mississippi and Texas on Tuesday .
Sen . Barack Obama claimed a big victory in Mississippi's Democratic primary .
The Illinois Democrat won handily in the Mississippi Democratic primary Tuesday .
Obama beat Clinton 61 percent to 37 percent with 99 percent of the precincts reporting .
With the victory , Obama added 17 delegates to his total while Clinton picked up 11 , CNN estimates .
The Mississippi win was Obama 's second win in a row , having won the Wyoming caucuses Saturday .
CNN Tuesday also projected that Obama was the winner of the Texas Democratic caucuses that occurred March 4 .
Obama will be awarded 38 of Texas 's delegates , while Clinton will win 29 delegates as a result of the caucuses , CNN estimates .
Watch Obama talk about his win »
Clinton beat Obama 51 percent to 47 percent in the Texas primary that was also held on March 4 , but Obama was expected to win a majority of the 228 Texas delegates due to his caucus win .
Two - thirds of the state 's 193 delegates were at stake at the primary , while the remaining third were decided by the caucuses .
With the wins in Mississippi and Texas , Obama now leads Clinton 1,611 to 1,480 in the total delegate count , CNN estimates .
Neither candidate is expected to obtain the 2,025 delegates needed to win the nomination outright before the national convention in August .
" What we 've tried to do is steadily make sure that in each state we are making the case about the need for change in this country .
Obviously the people in Mississippi responded , " Obama told CNN after his win .
Clinton 's campaign issued a statement congratulating Obama on his win , and said they " look forward to campaigning in Pennsylvania and around the country as this campaign continues . "
CNN 's political team weighs in on the results »
The state 's Democratic voters were sharply divided along racial lines , exit polls indicated .
Watch what the results mean »
As has been the case in many primary states , Obama won overwhelming support from African - American voters .
They went for him over Clinton , 91 percent to 9 percent .
See the results
The state has a larger proportion of African - Americans ( 36 percent , according to the 2000 census ) than any other state in the country .
And black voters make up nearly 70 percent of registered Democrats .
But white Mississippi voters overwhelmingly backed the New York senator , supporting her over Obama , 72 percent to 21 percent .
According to The Associated Press , only two other primary states were as racially polarized -- neighboring Alabama , and Clinton 's former home state of Arkansas .
The exit polls also indicated roughly 40 percent of Mississippi Democratic voters said race was an important factor in their vote , and 90 percent of those voters supported Obama .
In Ohio , roughly one in five voters said race factored into their decision .
About 60 percent of those voters picked Clinton over Obama .
Pennsylvania is the next battleground for the Democrats .
It holds its primary April 22 and has 158 delegates at stake .

OIL PRICES ON THE RISE OIL PRICES ON THE RISE
Oil prices over 6 months .
WASHINGTON  Gasoline prices in the coming months are likely to top $ 4 a gallon in some parts of the country , and perhaps nationally , the government said Tuesday .
According to the monthly report of the Energy Information Administration , the non-partisan statistical arm of the U.S. Energy Department , the monthly nationwide average gasoline price is likely to peak at $ 3.48 a gallon in May and June .
That would be up more than a quarter a gallon from the record nationwide average price of $ 3.225 registered on Monday .
The EIA report notes , however , that " even if the national average monthly gasoline price peaks near that level , there is a significant possibility that prices during some shorter time period , or in some region or subregion , will cross the $ 4 per gallon threshold . "
HITTING HOME : Record fuel prices blow household budgets
The projection came as the Energy Department and the International Energy Agency have lowered their forecasts for energy demand growth in 2008 .
Despite that , oil prices continued to break records .
The price of a barrel of light , sweet crude for delivery in April rose 85 cents to $ 108.75 in trading Tuesday .
Oil accounts for about two - thirds of the U.S. retail gas price .
In its monthly report Tuesday , IEA , an energy policy adviser to 27 countries including the United States , warned of continuing high fuel prices .
" We are in an era of higher oil prices , and so if we look at $ 100 ( per barrel ) oil , we have to do so with an understanding that prices are unlikely to return to levels seen in the early part of this decade . "
Oil prices at the beginning of the decade were in the $ 20 - to - $ 30 - a - barrel range .
Oil prices are rising as investors rush into commodities of all kinds seeking safety amid a falling dollar , rising inflation worries and general economic concerns .
The EIA , the Energy Department unit , predicted oil prices would ease somewhat during the second half of March and continue to retreat throughout the year .
Still , the monthly average is expected to be $ 90 or higher through November , the EIA said .
That 's higher than the prediction a month ago , when the government forecast the average price would peak this year in January .
Burden on economy Retail gasoline prices now top $ 3 a gallon in every state and the District of Columbia , according to AAA and the Oil Price Information Service .
The highest statewide average price Tuesday was $ 3.61 in Hawaii ; the lowest was $ 3.01 in New Jersey .
High gasoline prices not only create headaches for businesses and consumers , but they also act as a drag on the economy as people have less money to spend on non-energy goods .
The hit is coming at a time when the economy is particularly vulnerable , given a sharp drop - off in housing , a contraction in jobs and turmoil in financial markets .
Higher prices are leading consumers to cut their demand for gasoline , which has been lower in recent weeks than the same time a year ago , when prices were 26 % lower .
The American Public Transportation Association this week said Americans took 10.3 billion trips on public transportation in 2007 , up 2.1 % from 2006 and the most in 50 years .
The group attributed the gain in ridership in part to higher gasoline costs .
Employees at Jada Management Systems , a software firm in West Linn , Ore. , are being choosier about driving to meet with potential clients .
Before gas prices got too high , workers would drive to sales calls as much as 60 miles away without too much consideration .
Now , they do an online demonstration for a potential client , then analyze how interested the customer seems to be before getting in the car , says Megan Bowes , head of sales and marketing .
" Where before we might have gone 40 or 50 miles just to introduce the product and build good will in the area , now we have to think , especially if it is a prospect on the fence , " she says .
Diesel prices have also soared to record highs , leading to higher shipping costs .
That , too , can have a crippling effect on the economy as firms are often forced to eat higher costs .
The U.S. trucking industry is expected to pay a record $ 125 billion for fuel in 2008 , up from $ 112 billion in 2007 , according to the American Trucking Associations .
" For many trucking companies , fuel now costs nearly as much as labor , " ATA chief economist Bob Costello says .
" For many small carriers , fuel has surpassed labor . "

More than 4,500 cameras in Chicago public schools are being connected to police headquarters and the city ’s 911 center in a technological upgrade designed to improve safety , officials said Thursday .
In an emergency , arriving officers also will be able to view real - time images from the cameras on screens in their squad cars .
“ The key is getting the information to the police officer in that car , ” said Mayor Richard Daley .
Cameras belonging to the Chicago Transit Authority and other public agencies have been linked to the city ’s 911 center , and devices in some public buildings also have been connected as Daley seeks to consolidate video surveillance .
The mayor , who made the announcement at a news conference Thursday at police headquarters , said that when the school camera program is completed in the next few months , Chicago “ will have a comprehensive school security system that will make it far easier for us to respond more quickly and effectively to any emergency at a school building . ”
Cameras are installed at about 200 of Chicago ’s 650 public schools , including all high schools and some administrative buildings .

Cheney : ' Damn right ' I back Bush use of waterboarding
David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Thursday February 7 , 2008

Print This Email This
The controversial interrogation technique of waterboarding was a hot topic in a House Judiciary Committee hearing today , at which Attorney General Michael Mukasey said the Justice Department would not investigate the legality of the actions of U.S. interrogators on terror detainees .
CNN 's Situation Room reports that Vice President Dick Cheney , an ardent defender of U.S. tactics in the war on terror , was " defiant " about the use of waterboarding on suspects in an appearance today at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington , D.C .
Cheney said that he supported President Bush 's national security decisions , which included the approval of waterboarding along with other harsh interrogation tactics .
" I 've been proud to stand by [ Bush ] , by the decisions he 's made , " said Cheney , who then asked aloud , " Would I support those decisions today ? "
" You 're damn right I would , " he answered himself , to loud cheers .
Bill Bullard , the former Dean of Faculty at my old high school , was scheduled to deliver the commencement address for this year ’s graduating class .
Last minute food poisoning prevented him from appearing in the flesh , but the text of his speech has been posted online ( pdf ) .
It ’s classic Bill : intellectual and serious , eminently wise .
If you ’re like me and enjoy reading commencement speeches , it ’s worth a print and read .
He closes the speech by identifying three things students should unlearn from school :
The importance of opinion .
" Schools , especially good ones … that so emphasize student voice , teach us to value opinion .
This is a great deception .
Opinion is really the lowest form of human knowledge ; it requires no accountability , no understanding .
The highest form of knowledge , according to George Eliot , is empathy , for it requires us to suspend our egos and live in another ’s world .
It requires profound , purpose ‐larger ‐than ‐the‐self kind of understanding . "
The importance of solving given problems .
" Schools teach us to be clever , great problem solvers , but not to include ourselves in the problem that ’s being solved .
This is a great delusion .
It makes us arrogant and complacent and teaches us to look at the world as a problem outside of us .
As in Oedipus , public problems – the plague on Thebes or our own pestilences , war or global warming – are private problems .
The plague is only lifted when each person sees his responsibility not in analyzing the problem , not in solving the riddle , but in changing our actions to address a public need .
Oedipus destroyed the two things that had deceived him – his eyes and his power – and in so doing saved his city . "
The importance of earning the approval of others .
" Schools teach students to seek the approval of their teachers .
Indeed , for all of our differences , this is one area that parents and teachers share ; we are wired or we are hired to believe in you , to approve you , to prevent or mitigate the experiences of disappointment …
Try to correct this in two ways .
First seek people , work for people who do n’t have to like you , people who can easily disapprove of you , people that you ca n’t easily please .
Their skepticism or indifference will define you .
Second , if you do n’t how to do so already , begin working for yourself , and let the teachers be damned .
But they wo n’t be – they ’ll just be all the more approving because that kind of integrity can only command respect .
After all , most of the work we devise is devised for students who are not working for themselves , so those that do surpass our expectations and teach us things that we ’ve never thought of . "
Bill had a big impact on me as a student .
I vividly recall sitting in an English class in which we were reading Shakespeare .
Bill was substituting that day .
In a mere 45 minutes he delivered a stunning analysis of the text at hand and ended the class with three really provocative questions for us to chew on .
I remember turning to the person next to me — neither of us said anything , but we were thinking the same thing : " That was fucking brilliant . "
From that moment forward I committed to trying to absorb through osmosis as much of his intellectual intensity and perspective as possible .
Teachers .
It ’s trite I know , but they are highly under - apprreciated in society .
None of the works in the show are weighty with metal .
A pair of pre-Columbian gold earrings - elongated diamonds hooked into half moons - are feather - light works devised about A.D. 800 by an artisan in an area in modern - day Colombia once known as Sinu .
Other earrings , a number of rings and a Peruvian necklace are made of hollow gold elements .
A Chimu necklace , made after A.D. 1000 , uses hollow gold balls - a shade smaller and dented in much the same way as worn Ping - Pong balls are .
One starkly simple ring comprises an undecorated band of gold that widens to frame an oval crystal with a frosty glow probably heightened by an unseen foil backing .
In ancient jewelry , the underside of stones are always covered - a practice that changed by the Renaissance , Mr. Merrin said .
Some other noticeable differences between the rings shown and those made today include the modest size of the emeralds , garnets or pearls employed and the unembellished settings .
Most of the time , the metal merely seems pressed down on the edges of the stone to secure it in place .
The effect is most attractive .
In this dealer 's view , elaborate decoration on the surfaces of jewelry may hide imperfections of crafting or design .
'' A ring that is perfectly simple is what it is , and there is no hiding its shape or the way it was made , '' Mr. Merrin said .
'' You ca n't make a mistake on such works .
If you put in a lot of curlicues , you can make a lot of mistakes . ''
There are several exceptions to the rule of undecorated surfaces - but none have curlicues .
The most arresting is a large pair of fifth century A.D. Persian gold earrings , hollow hoops enriched with twists of wire and granulation .
' ' I do n't know how they drew hair - fine wire like that , '' Mr. Merrin said , marveling at the detailing on the earrings as well as on a seventh century B.C. neo -Assyrian stickpin , which is a cube of the gold - and - silver alloy electrum topped by a milky quartz ball of chalcedony .
The cube , deftly wrapped with metal wire as delicate as a spider 's web , is an inch - high stack of tiny boxes crafted of electrum enhanced by bow - tie images on all four sides .
Raising troubling questions about the security of America 's government websites , more domains ending in .gov have been found hosting links that push porn and malware .
They include the Marin County Transportation Authority , which has has watched its site get hacked at least twice before .
In early October the domain forced the shutdown of all California government websites until admins could remove the links .
A week after the sites were disinfected , the rogue pointers returned .
On Friday , more than 24 hours after this post from Sunbelt Software first reported the reemergence of the links , the gov site was riddled with at least a dozen pages that , when clicked , redirected users to smut sites .
Users then got a messaging saying they had to install a special codec in order to view the content .
The codecs contain Trojans that install malware .
By Friday evening in California , the tainted pages were finally removed , and the executive director of the agency apologized for the problem .
The other site actively pushing smut and malware at the time of writing was USAid , a federally operated agency that extends aid to countries recovering from disasters .
Perhaps they should attend to their own affairs first .
Over the past several months , the poisoning of search caches belonging to Google and other search engines has emerged as a chief tactic by miscreants in inflating rankings of their malicious websites .
At the moment , Google security pros are scrambling to eradicate a flood of malicious links .
Problem is , the purveyors of smut and malware are quickly able to taint the cache with a new batch of domains .
The whack - a- mole battle finally prompted Google to issue this request for help from its users .
The infections of the gov sites , which are easily documented by these two Google searches ( safe to click if you do n't mind " porn " in your url , but you probably should n't click on any of search results ) , appear to be yet another attempt to boost the rankings of the malicious sites .
Dianne Steinhauser , executive director of the Marin County Transportation Authority , said she thought the problem was fixed in mid September , after her agency dumped its old web host , StartLogic , and contracted with a new one .
" Even though we quit any web hosting with them , they had a publicly accessible web page with our name on it , " she told The Register .
" They still had a web service under our name , and that was a complete surprise . "
Hackers were able to create the porn- and malware - infested pages by infiltrating StartLogic 's system , she said .
The pages became inaccessible after her office directed the web host to remove the web - accessible service , she said .
" I am exceptionally apologetic for anyone that was contaminated by virtue of our name , " she said .
Attempts to reach representatives of StartLogic and USAid were not successful . ®

Imagine working closely together with a colleague who complains all the time : when you have been using the mouse for five minutes he will start bitching , and when youve been sitting for half an hour he starts yelling at you .
This is the case for many people every day only the colleague is closer than you think its your own body .
If you have office work , chances are that you regularly experience one or more of the following :
Headaches Upper back and neck pain Lower back pain  Mouse arm ??
General stiffness and aching
What s this ?
You love your job so much .
You jump out of bed in the morning shouting  Yes !
Im going to work today !??
And your body starts giving you all sorts of complaints .
Why ?
Well , lets take a look at what kind of work your body was originally designed to do .
10.000 years ago , before the beginnings of any kind of civilization and through ages of natural selection , the human body ( and mind ) had become highly specialized in the art of hunting and gathering .
Life was all about finding and killing - food , and avoiding becoming food .
If food became scarce , then you moved to find it elsewhere , living a nomadic lifestyle .
Everyday , all day , nothing could be obtained without movement .
Physical activity was essential .
If you couldnt move you died .
Nowadays most of us can easily live our lives with a minimum of physical activity , thanks to cars , elevators , e-mails , pizza delivery and the like .
So why all these physical complaints and ailments ?
Your body should be happy to get off the hook , should n’t it ?
Well , it isnt , and heres why : Your body likes to move , and what ’s more , it needs to !
It is its nature , you might say .
Strapping your body behind a desk with minimum movement for 8 - 10 hours a day is going against nature , on the physical level .
And going against nature makes you well , unhappy .
Just like your mind grows dull without intellectual stimulation , your emotions wither away without love and companionship  so your body will start aching and complaining when you dont exercise it .
So , what to do , to make our closest colleague happy ?
Start moving !
Here are some suggestions :
1 : Remember : moving is fun !
If you have forgotten , then it is time to rediscover the joy of physical activity .
Play more .
Organize office chair races , or give lunch break dance lessons .
2 : Relax !
If you cultivate a relaxed and easy - going attitude , then you are more likely to avoid stress .
Without stress you will be less tense , and you are able to feel your bodily needs ; also the need to move .
3 : Use any excuse to get out of the chair .
Go see people instead of calling or e-mailing .
Deliberately move your most used files to the opposite wall in the office .
4 : Move for no reason .
For instance , decide to do phone calls balancing on one leg .
5 : Buy furniture that invites you to move about .
Like elevating desks and gym - balls to sit on .
Though apparently bean - bag chairs can go horribly wrong in the workplace :
6 : At least twice a week , do a proper work - out .
Doesnt matter what kind as long as you are sweating like a pig and having lots of fun .
If you havent found your fun work - out yet , keep looking .
It s out there !
The pay - off ?
Reducing any physical pains will of course improve your productivity and concentration .
Also , more movement increases your physical energy , which in turn makes you more motivated and more positive .
Happy moving !

What is a green smoothie and why should you add some to your diet ?
I ’ll try to answer that quickly here .
Green smoothies are fruit smoothies made with fresh fruits and greens .
By fruit I mean bananas , apples , pears , pineapple , and every other juicy fruit .
By greens I mean romaine lettuce , celery , kale , chard , and other green leaves .
Now why would you combine both in one smoothie ?
First of all , it does taste a lot better than it sounds !
A green smoothie can be delicious .
There are lots of great recipes to try .
And once you start drinking them , you ’ll be hooked .
The real benefit of green smoothies come from the added nutrition from blended leaves .
As you know , a lot of people add lots of powders to their smoothies .
I ’m talking about protein powder , bee pollen , and so on .
As nutritious as they appear to be , these powders will never beat the nutritious power of green leaves in green smoothies .
Green leaves are filled with :
– Alkaline minerals - Vitamins - Antioxidants
And other goodies !
But the real value comes when you can blend them with other fruits .
That way , the greens become much easier to digest .
And contrary to popular belief , greens combine perfectly well with fruits ( but other starchy vegetables like carrots do n’t ! ) .
The benefits of green smoothies include :
– More energy - Improved dental health - More stable blood sugar - Improved mood

A new study published in the March / April 2008 issue of the journal Child Development finds that family wealth might partly explain differences in test scores in school - age children .
The study , conducted by researchers at New York University , also found that family wealth is positively associated with parenting behavior , home environment , and children 's self - esteem .
Prior research has documented the association between children 's cognitive achievement and the socioeconomic status of their parents as measured by education level , occupation , and income .
Many of these studies focused on the effect of poverty -- defined by family income -- on children 's achievement , but household wealth ( i.e. , net worth ) has received little attention .
This new study used new methods , including data from a new national study ( the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and its Child Development Supplement ) .
It explored many functional forms and sources of wealth , looking at different mediating pathways of wealth from distinct sources , and analyzing how wealth affects children 's cognitive achievement at different stages of childhood .
The researchers found a marked disparity in family wealth between Black and White families with young children , with White families owning more than 10 times as many assets as Black families .
The study found that family wealth had a stronger association with cognitive achievement of school - aged children than that of preschoolers , and a stronger association with school - aged children 's math than with their reading scores .
Family wealth accumulated from different sources also was found to have a distinct influence on children at different developmental stages .
Liquid assets , particularly holdings in stocks or mutual funds , were positively associated with school - aged children 's test scores .
Family wealth was associated with a higher quality home environment , better parenting behavior , and children 's private school attendance .
The researchers suggest that the stronger impact of wealth on school - aged children may be because school - aged children benefit more from family wealth that is spent on educational resources that require substantial financial investment , such as private schools , extracurricular activities , and cultural experiences .
Furthermore , older children may be more conscious of differences in wealth relative to their peers as they are exhibited in the quality of the learning environment , possessions , and the type of neighborhood where children live .
These differences may influence their self - esteem and aspirations , which in turn are positively associated with their school performance .
" While wealth may help smooth consumption on a more short - term basis , the presence of wealth over time in a family ( or extended family ) may have a stronger impact of engendering a sense of economic security , future orientation , and the ability to take risks among all family members which , in turn , positively affect child development , " according to W. Jean Yeung , professor of sociology at New York University and the lead author of the study .
Despite the marked disparity in wealth between Black and White families , the study found little evidence that wealth by itself explains the test score gaps between Black and White children .
Those gaps were found to become less meaningful when child and family demographic characteristics and parents ' income , education , and occupation were held constant .
" Although wealth may not have a substantial short - term benefit in narrowing the Black - White achievement gap among young children , allowing and encouraging low - income families to accumulate wealth may improve family dynamics and foster a forward - looking attitude that may benefit children 's development in the long run , " said Yeung .
" The financial effects of wealth would likely be observed later in life when school financing becomes an issue . "

Clinton camp keeping an eye on Rezko trial Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday March 4 , 2008
|
Print This Email This May send staffer to watch trial after Obama aide spotted taking notes Hillary Clinton 's advisers sounded confident speaking to reporters Tuesday morning , and they could hardly contain their delight at the perception that Barack Obama has started facing tougher questions on the campaign trail .
Now that the trial has begun for former Obama fundraiser Tony Rezko in Chicago , the Clinton campaign is hammering their opponent with charges that he is obscuring his relationship to the real estate developer , who was indicted seventeen months ago for alleged money laundering , extortion and fraud .
" There are many , many more questions than answers from Sen. Obama on the Rezko matter , " Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson said during a conference call with reporters .
Pointing out that Obama sent a staffer to observe to the opening session of Rezko 's trial , the Clinton camp is considering sending a representative of its own to watch out for Obama dirt during the proceedings .
" Maybe the two people [ from the Clinton and Obama campaigns ] will sit together and compare notes at the end of the day , " Wolfson said .
Some reporters on the call wondered if Clinton 's sudden calls for openness were a little bit hypocritical .
The former First Lady has been criticized as too secretive for not releasing White House documents , along with her tax returns .
But Wolfson claimed there was no contradiction , and insisted that the campaign just wanted answers to fairly standard inquiries .
As to the tax returns , he said they would be released around April 15 , before Pennsylvania voters go to the polls .
" I know the kind of questions this campaign has received on matters large and small , " Wolfson said .
Wolfson demurred when asked to list specific allegations of misconduct on Obama 's part .
The Illinois Senator conducted a real estate transaction with Rezko in 2006 .
Obama has said the transaction itself was perfectly legal , but acknowledged it was a mistake to enter into any arrangement with Rezko when it was known he was under investigation .
" This is a story that has been going on for a year and a half , " Obama said on ABC's " Good Morning America " Monday .
" We have seen more than 200 articles written about it .
And we , in fact , released an email just recently from the seller of the home that confirmed that Mr. Resco had nothing to do with the price that I got for my house .
He got into trouble that was completely unrelated to me .
And that trouble that he's in right now is completely unrelated to anything that I have done . "
Host Terry Moran pushed Obama to release everything related to the transaction , but the candidate avoided making any firm commitment .
You can make a subplot and then use the print function to generate file with the plot .
RGB line colors are supported if you use gnuplot 4.2 .
Octave can still use gnuplot 4.0 , but there is no way to set arbitrary line colors with it when using the Matlab - style plot functions .
There never was any way to do this reliably with older versions of gnuplot ( whether run from Octave or not ) since it only provided a limited set to choose from , and they were terminal dependent , so choosing color 1 with the X11 terminal would be different from color 1 with the PostScript terminal .
Valid RGB colors for gnuplot 4.0 are the eight possible combinations of 0 and 1 for the R , G and B values .
Invalid values are all mapped to the same color .
This also affects patch objects used in the bar , countour , meshc and surfc functions , where the bars and contours will be monochrome .
A workaround for this is to type " colormap gmap40 " that loads a colormap that in many cases will be adequate for simple bar and contour plots .
</li >
You can control the width of lines using ( for example ) : line ( x , y , " linewidth " , 4 , " color " , [ 1 , 0 , 0.5 ] ) ; ( this also shows the color feature ) .
With gnuplot 4.2 , image data is plotted with gnuplot and may be combined with other 2 -d plot data .
Lines for contour plots are generated with an Octave function , so contour plots are now 2 - d plots instead of special 3 - d plots , and this allows you to plot additional 2 - d data on top of a contour plot .
With the gnuplot " extended " terminals the TeX interpreter is emulated .
However , this means that the TeX interpreter is only supported on the postscript terminals with gnuplot 4.0 .
Under gnuplot 4.2 the terminals aqua , dumb , png , jpeg , gif , pm , windows , wxt , svg and x11 are supported as well .
The following plot commands are now considered obsolete and will be removed from a future version of Octave : __gnuplot_set__ __gnuplot_show__ __gnuplot_plot__ __gnuplot_splot__ __gnuplot_replot__
Additionally , these functions no longer have any effect on plots created with the Matlab - style plot commands ( plot , line , mesh , semilogx , etc. ) .
Plot property values are not extensively checked .
Specifying invalid property values may produce unpredictible results .
Octave now sends data over the same pipe that is used to send commands to gnuplot .
While this avoids the problem of cluttering / tmp with data files , it is no longer possible to use the mouse to zoom in on plots .
This is a limitation of gnuplot , which is unable to zoom when the data it plots is not stored in a file .
Some work has been done to fix this problem in newer versions of gnuplot (> 4.2.2 ) .
See for example , this thread on the gnuplot development list .
</ul >
The way Octave handles search paths has changed .
Instead of setting the built - in variable LOADPATH , you must use addpath , rmpath , or path to manipulate the function search path .
These functions will maintain " . " at the head of the path , for compatibility with Matlab .
Leading , trailing or doubled colons are no longer special .
Now , all elements of the search path are explicitly included in the path when Octave starts .
To display the path , use the path function .
Path elements that end in // are no longer searched recursively .
Instead , you may use addpath and the genpath function to add an entire directory tree to the path .
For example , addpath ( genpath ( " ~/octave " ) ) ; will add ~/ octave and all directories below it to the head of the path .
</li >
Previous versions of Octave had a number of built - in variables to control warnings ( for example , warn_divide_by_zero ) .
These variables have been replaced by warning identifiers that are used with the warning function to control the state of warnings .
For example , instead of writing warn_divide_by_zero = false ; to disable divide - by - zero warnings , you should write warning ( " off " , " Octave : divide - by - zero " ) ;
You may use the same technique in your own code to control warnings .
For example , you can use warning ( " My- package : phase - of - the - moon " , " the phase of the moon could cause trouble today " ) ; to allow users to control this warning using the " My- package : phase - of - the - moon " warning identifier .
You may also enable or disable all warnings , or turn them into errors : warning ( " on " , " all " ) ; warning ( " off " , " all " ) ; warning ( " error " , " Octave : divide - by - zero " ) ; warning ( " error " , " all " ) ;
You can query the state of current warnings using warning ( " query " , ID ) warning ( " query " ) ( only those warning IDs which have been explicitly set are returned ) .
A partial list and description of warning identifiers is available using help warning_ids </ li >
All built - in variables have been converted to functions .
This change simplifies the interpreter and allows a consistent interface to internal variables for user - defined packages and the core functions distributed with Octave .
In most cases , code that simply accesses internal variables does not need to change .
Code that sets internal variables will change .
For example , instead of writing PS1 = " > > " ; you will need to write PS1 ( " > > " ) ;
If you need write code that will run in both old and new versions of Octave , you can use something like if ( exist ( " OCTAVE_VERSION " ) == 5 ) ## New : PS1 ( " > > " ) ; else ## Old : PS1 = " >> " ; endif
For compatibility with Matlab , the output order of Octave 's " system " function has changed from [ output , status ] = system ( cmd ) ; to [ status , output ] = system ( cmd ) ;
For compatibility with Matlab , normcdf , norminv , normpdf , and normrnd have been modified to compute distributions using the standard deviation instead of the variance .
For compatibility with Matlab , the output of Octave 's fsolve function has been changed from [ x , info , msg ] = fsolve (... ) ; to [ x , fval , info ] = fsolve (... ) ;
For compatibility with Matlab , normcdf , norminv , normpdf , and normrnd have been modified to compute distributions using the standard deviation instead of the variance .
Jester said the police were impressed by the bikers ' actions
CCTV of robbery
The men stormed the bar brandishing machetes and wearing balaclavas - unaware that 50 bikers were holding a meeting in an adjoining room .
Alerted to the robbery , some of the bikers chased the men as they fled .
One was caught after trying to escape through a back door .
He was later treated in hospital for minor injuries .
The other man ran off but was arrested by police in a street nearby .
Southern Cross Cruiser Club chairman " Jester " told local media that the robbers had " picked the wrong night " .
The would - be bandits had entered the bar and ordered patrons to lie on the floor while they emptied the till .
I can't believe these guys were stupid enough to come into a club with 50 bikers having a bike meeting
Jester
But someone managed to run into an adjoining room where the bikers were holding their monthly meeting .
" We were out there minding our own business and then these guys came to the bar here in the pokey ( slot machine ) area , " Jester told the Sydney Morning Herald .
" One of the guys took off ... straight through a glass window , he did n't even bother pushing the button , he just ran straight through it . "
Jester said the police were delighted when they arrived on the scene .
" They were really impressed that we caught these guys , because normally they get here and it's all over and done .
But we caught the guys , still with their weapons , still in his balaclava and everything else .
" It 's a comedy of errors , I can't believe these guys were stupid enough to come into a club with 50 bikers having a bike meeting - just crazy . "

The number of active - duty soldiers who kill themselves or attempt to is the highest it ’s been since the Army began keeping records almost 30 years ago .
Three hundred fifty soldiers attempted suicide or injured themselves in 2002 , compared with 2,100 in 2007 .
Washington Post :
The Army was unprepared for the high number of suicides and cases of post - traumatic stress disorder among its troops , as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have continued far longer than anticipated .
Many
Army posts still do not offer enough individual counseling and some soldiers suffering psychological problems complain that they are stigmatized by commanders .
Over the past year , four high - level commissions have recommended reforms and Congress has given the military hundreds of millions of dollars to improve its mental health care , but critics charge that significant progress has not been made .
The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have placed severe stress on the Army , caused in part by repeated and lengthened deployments .
Historically , suicide rates tend to decrease when soldiers are in conflicts overseas , but that trend has reversed in recent years .
From a suicide rate of 9.8 per 100,000 active - duty soldiers in 2001 — the lowest rate on record — the Army reached an all - time high of 17.5 suicides per 100,000 active - duty soldiers in 2006 .
Last year , twice as many soldier suicides occurred in the United States than in Iraq and Afghanistan .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A government laptop computer stolen last month held unencrypted medical records of 2,500 participants in a government study , Susan Shirin , deputy director of the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) told CNN Monday .
The incident prompted the NHLBI to issue a statement saying it would no longer store patient medical information on laptops .
The lack of encryption violated federal guidelines dating back to 2006 .
Shurin told CNN the stolen laptop " fell through the cracks " and should have been encrypted .
A thorough review of other laptops containing sensitive information is under way , she said .
The computer was stolen on February 23 from the trunk of a senior employee 's car , Shurin said .
It contained the names , birthdays , medical record numbers and diagnoses of patients who participated in a heart disease clinical trial study conducted by NHLBI from 2001 to 2007 .
Patients were informed last week of the breach , after an investigation determined the laptop contained sensitive information .
The theft appears to have been random , according to a statement from the institute 's director .
In the statement released Monday , NHLBI director Elizabeth G. Nabel said she deeply regretted the incident .
" When volunteers enroll in a clinical study , they place great trust in the researchers and study staff , " said Nabel .
" The incident may cause those who participated in one of our studies to feel that we have violated that trust . "
Greg Wilshusen , director of information security issues at the Government Accounting Office ( GAO ) , said the incident could be the tip of the iceberg .
" These types of incidents are not unusual .
Several government agencies have reported them , " said Wilshusen .
" The number of government security incidents has increased from 3,600 reported cases in 2005 to 13,000 in 2007 , an increase of 250 percent . "
Wilshusen said the increase is partly because a mobile workforce is requiring information to be stored on laptops and other mobile devices , placing private information at greater risk of being accessed , stolen or compromised .
NHLBI is the third largest agency within the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .
The Center for Democracy and Technology , a non-profit group promoting privacy in the digital age , called the breach " absurd " and said NIH did nothing right when it came to protecting patients in the study .
" There is not a reason patient information should be on a laptop and not on a proper server , said executive director Leslie Harris .
" NIH is focusing too much on identity theft and not enough on the personal information they were entrusted to keep private . "
Harris added that the incident could deter some patients from participating in future clinical trials .
This latest breach of government information comes after the well - publicized theft of a Veterans Affairs laptop computer in May 2006 , which contained personal data for 26.5 million veterans and military personnel .
The laptop was stolen when an employee took it to his home in violation of agency rules .
That incident prompted the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidelines requiring information on laptops across all government agencies to be encrypted .
On Friday , the NHLBI said it would install encryption software on its laptops and conduct regular security training for its employees .
" We are going to be looking at our policy going forward , " said Shurin .
Shurin said she expects the encryption process to be completed by April 4 .
Asked about further action NHLBI should take , Harris said the agency should strip computers of all personal data , use only a server to store information and do regular security audits .
As for the 2,500 patients whose data was compromised , Harris said once the information is out there , " there is no way to put the genie back in the bottle . "

All About National Institutes of Health
More than 10,580 British Columbians are homeless this winter , according to a survey of estimates compiled by the New Democratic Party .
And the ranks of the unsheltered are growing fastest not in the province 's largest cities , but in B.C. 's booming exurbs such as Abbotsford and Whistler .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
" We are sometimes fooled into thinking homelessness is a Vancouver issue , " said MLA David Chudnovsky , the opposition critic who conducted the study .
" But these numbers show that homelessness is a province - wide crisis . "
Interviews with social workers and homeless individuals in the Fraser Valley confirm the NDP 's findings .
" Smaller communities are starting to face this issue , " said Deb Lowell , a spokeswoman for The Salvation Army in Abbotsford .
" Homelessness now seems to be a problem right across the province , if not the country . "
Ken Wiede is an Abbotsford native who lived without a home in his own hometown for two years .
" There 's way more people living on the streets of Abbotsford today , " Wiede said .
" Way more .
And it 's rougher . "
Shelter staff supplied estimates
B.C. 's largest cities top the list released Friday morning .
The NDP found 2,300 people living without shelter in Vancouver , 1,550 in Victoria and 1,050 in Prince George .
But the second tier of homelessness is concentrated in fast - growing exurbs such as Abbotsford , which ranked fourth on the list .
The survey estimated there are 400 homeless people living in Abbotsford , and another 184 across the Upper Fraser Valley .
Similarly , the survey found 200 homeless in the Tri Cities , 180 in Burnaby and 100 in Langley .
Taken together , the NDP estimates suggest that there are now more homeless Canadians scattered across the Lower Mainland than concentrated in Vancouver 's notorious Downtown Eastside .
" I was particularly surprised by the large numbers of suburban homelessness , " MLA Chudnovsky said .
" These include some of the most affluent and fastest - growing parts of the province . "
Chudnovsky said he initiated the survey after Housing Minister Rich Coleman failed to respond to his request for an official province - wide homeless count .
" If we 're serious about ending homelessness , we need to know what the situation really is , " Chudnovsky said .
" Minister Coleman either did not know , or was not willing to share that information .
So we gathered it ourselves . "
Field counts were cited where available .
For communities without such counts , Chudnovsky 's team interviewed social workers with client lists -- people such as shelter operators and outreach staff -- and compiled the province - wide total from their local estimates .
' We do n't have SROs in Abbotsford '
" In Abbotsford , we have what economists would call an ideal economy : High wages .
Low unemployment .
Affordable living , " said Ron Van Wyc , program director for B.C. 's Mennonite Central Committee .
" So for a long time , I think there was a public perception that we did n't have a homeless problem here . "
That perception weakened after a 2004 field count found 226 homeless people , and cracked in 2006 after a group of local homeless people crowded into a high - profile encampment that became know as Compassion Park .
" As a community , I think we 've moved through the phase of denial , " Van Wyc said .
" Now there is a recognition that something needs to be done . "
Leading the charge across B.C. 's bible belt is The Salvation Army .
In Abbotsford , the Army 's Centre of Hope houses a 150 - meal - a- day soup kitchen , a 20 - bed shelter , a 14 - bed transitional housing facility and a provincially - funded outreach program .
Outreach worker Randy Clayton said he could house more than half of the almost 300 people on Abbotsford 's outreach rolls -- if only he could find enough affordable apartments .
" We do n't have SROs in Abbotsford , " Clayton said .
" There are a few rooming houses that let bedrooms for $ 400 or $ 500 a month .
One - bedroom basement suites start at $ 700 . "
But with the province still paying only $ 375 a month for housing , " There 's really no affordable housing to be had . "
Forest dwellers
Most of Clayton 's clients live in the woods .
Some pitch full camps complete with kitchens and fire pits .
Others nest in local parks .
One former military man dug himself a burrow ten feet underground .
Others live in their cars .
In a region with poor public transit , many of the working poor choose to give up their homes before sacrificing their wheels .
" I had a beat - up old Chevy van that I lived in for three years , " said Wiede .
He found places that tolerated parking overnight .
" They never gave me permission , " he said .
" But they never kicked me out . "
Clayton figures there are another 100 to 150 homeless individuals who remain off the Sally Ann 's rolls , bringing the Abbotsford total in line with the NDP estimate .
" This is the time of year that we find out how many more are homeless , " Clayton said .
" When it gets cold like this , people literally come out of the woods looking to get warm . "
' Too cold in 100 Mile '
There does not appear to be any single reason why homelessness has roughly doubled throughout the Lower Mainland in the past few years .
A bit more than half of Abbotsford 's homeless are locals , according to the 2004 homeless count .
Many of those were pushed into the streets by the same deinstitutionalization and addiction that have driven the homeless crisis across Canada .
" I think we are seeing the consequence of social policy decisions made 15 years ago , " Van Wyc said , " when there was a decision made to not continue funding social housing . "
The other half of Abbotsford 's burgeoning homeless appears to come from elsewhere in B.C .
Clayton Fraser is a thickly bearded young man who said he'd slept on the streets of Vancouver , beneath the power lines of Surrey , and " in the ditch " as far north as 100 Mile House .
He did not beat around the bush when asked why he prefers Abbotsford , where he 's spent most of the past year sleeping in a park .
" Too many games on Hastings Street .
Too cold in 100 Mile , " Fraser said .
' Anywhere but Vancouver '
Wiede said that many of the " new crowd " who arrived within the past year are from Vancouver .
" It 's like a wave , " Wiede said .
" It 's getting tougher in Vancouver .
And now some of those tough people are moving here . "
Randy Clayton 's phone rang during our interview .
On the other end of the line was a woman from Aldergrove seeking information about shelters .
The outreach worker pulled a photocopied list off the wall , and started reading her some place names and phone numbers .
She interrupted him to explain that she was willing to go , " anywhere but Vancouver . "
Few facilities in small cities
B.C.'s suburbs and small towns are less prepared to cope with fast - growing homeless populations than are cities such as Vancouver and Victoria , which host a continuum of services ranging from detox clinics to long - term supportive housing .
" There are few facilities here .
The infrastructure is not as well established as in a place like Vancouver , " Van Wyc said .
Similarly , the City of Abbotsford does not own any land on which to build new facilities , and is therefore unable to take advantage of funding recently offered by the province .
A new hospital is under construction , and Abbotsford housing advocates are lobbying to convert the old building into new social housing .
Van Wyc is also pondering whether some sort of a mobile home park might be pressed into service in the interim .
But while the causes and conditions of homelessness vary among urban and suburban areas , the solution appears to remain the same : provide stable homes .
Blindness of ' untrained eyes '
Wiede is among Abbotsford 's success stories .
Unable to work after a back injury , and unable to survive on a $ 600 - a- month pension , Wiede slipped into homelessness at the age of 60 .
He " wandered around this area " for two years before landing a room at Centre of Hope 's transitional housing .
" The Salvation Army really helped me out in a big way , " Wiede said .
" They took me in when there was no place I could go . "
Wiede has since found a subsidized apartment across town , and has largely re-entered mainstream society .
But his two years on the streets opened his eyes to a problem he said most of his new neighbours still can't see .
" I see things my friend does n't see , " Wiede said .
" We 'll be drivin ' along and I 'll say , ' Did you see those eight people in the field over there ? '
And he says , ' No . '
" And you see , that 's just it .
With untrained eyes , you do n't see it .
And if you do n't see it , you think the problem does n't exist . "

Tyee stories :
When it comes to parental inquiries about school , children generally respond with a shrug and , if they 're lucky , an obligatory " nothing . "
Parents , of course , know better , and will soon be able to track their kids ' abilities and smarts thanks to LeapFrog Enterprises , Inc. , the Emeryville , Calif. , manufacturer of technology - based learning aids .
LeapFrog this week announced its new " Learning Path " strategy , which includes Web - based programs designed to guide children through the company 's extensive lineup of devices for developing reading , math and other skills .
Learning Path enables parents to use the Web to follow their kids ' performance , download new games to LeapFrog devices as well as communicate with educators and even other parents through a community site .
Each time a child finishes playing with one of LeapFrog 's USB - enabled toys — including the new Tag reading device or Didj handheld gaming system — parents will be able to view the results by connecting the toy to their PC or Mac and visiting the company 's Learning Path site , set to go live in May .
The site will reveal the games that each child plays , the number of times he or she plays them , and the skills they 're designed to teach .
It will also suggest activities tailored to individual kids ' needs ( for example , having children with trouble reading pick out particular letters or words on different food packages during trips to the supermarket ) .
The Learning Path Web site , as with all of LeapFrog 's products , was designed using the company 's proprietary " scope and sequence " methodology , created by its team of curriculum designers in conjunction with the company 's 10 - member educational advisory board .
Scope and sequence , the company says , focuses on identifying what children learn as well as how and when they learn it , including their ages and stages of development .
The advisory board includes Anne Cunningham , an associate professor at the University of California , Berkeley , Graduate School of Education ; Cathie Norris , a regents professor at the University of North Texas College of Education 's Department of Learning Technologies , in Denton , Texas ; and Jeni Leta Riley , head of the School of Early Childhood and Primary Education for the Institute of Education , University of London .
As with many things these days , though , this program walks a fine line between learning and privacy .
On one hand , it enables parents to play an active role in enhancing their youngsters ' education and , also , in keeping tabs on how they are spending their time , allowing them to identify potential trouble spots .
But it also opens the door to parents becoming more like " Big Brother , " potentially irking kids and discouraging them from using the products .
( Any child who understands this reference , by the way , probably does n't need the Leapfrog learning aids . )
The Didj system resembles the PlayStation Portable ( at about half PSP's $ 170 price tag ) and is designed to appeal to kids age six to 10 .
Using LeapFrog 's Connect software and a USB cable , kids can use a computer to create their own game avatars ; parents can customize the game 's educational curriculum ( specifying an emphasis on certain math skills or a particular spelling list ) , and then load all of this information onto the handheld device .
The Didj , which hits the stores in July , runs on a 393 megahertz Arm 9 processor and features 32 megabytes of RAM , 256 megabytes of flash storage and a 3.2 - inch ( 8.1 - centimeter ) LCD screen .
The Tag reading system , which debuts in June priced at $ 50 , borrows from the company 's FLY Fusion Pentop Computer ( minus the handwriting - recognition capabilities ) to provide an exclamation point–shaped handheld device that reads when its tip is touched against words in one of LeapFrog 's children 's books .
Using an optical pattern system and digital processing techniques licensed from Sweden 's Anoto Group , AB , the Tag reader can determine the precise location in any given book and any page as well .
The device features a 32 - bit computer processor as well as LeapFrog 's proprietary operating system and software .

He was Pol Pot 's trusted henchman , the brilliant mathematician who calmly fashioned an efficient apparatus of torture and death out of a Phnom Penh high school and who oversaw , during the Khmer Rouge 's reign of terror , the interrogation and cudgelling to death of some 17,000 Cambodians .
In the West he has been called " Cambodia 's Heinrich Himmler " ; since Pol Pot himself and his lieutenant Ta Mok cheated justice by dying , he is the most vivid symbol of the Khmer Rouge left alive .
His name is Kang Khek Ieu , but he is better known by his nom de guerre , Duch ( pronounced " Doik " ) .
This spring , 28 years after fleeing Cambodia ahead of the Vietnamese army , his trial for mass murder may finally get under way .
Now , in the first interview he has given since his capture more than eight - and - a - half years ago , he talks freely about how and why he sent 17,000 Cambodians to their deaths in the killing fields .

And even as he waits to confront the proof of his crimes , it is clear that , for him , there was never any choice : anybody who was thought to pose a threat to the revolution had to be tortured and killed .
Asked whether he had any moments of uncertainty , any doubts or feelings of rebellion while he set about wiping out his country 's entire intellectual class , he answered : " There was a widespread and tacit understanding .
" I and everyone else who worked in that place knew that anyone who entered had to be psychologically demolished , eliminated by steady work , given no way out .
No answer could avoid death .
Nobody who came to us had any chance of saving himself . "
The command had come from above , he said .
" All the prisoners had to be eliminated .
We saw enemies , enemies , enemies everywhere . "
He could not have rebelled or fled , he insisted .
" If I had tried to flee , they were holding my family hostage , and my family would have suffered the same fate as the other prisoners in Tuol Sleng .
If I had fled or rebelled it would not have helped anyone . "
Between 1975 and the beginning of 1979 , under Pol Pot , two million men and women , almost a third of the Cambodian population , were brutally eliminated by the Khmer Rouge – an extreme Marxist movement that aimed to take Cambodia back to " Year Zero " , cutting it off from the outside world and imposing their leaders ' vision of an " agrarian utopia " .
Of its two million victims , more than 17,000 – party officials , diplomats , Buddhist monks , engineers , doctors , teachers , students , musicians and dancers , were brought to a former school in the heart of Phnom Penh that had been converted into a torture centre .
Only six came out of it alive .
Codenamed S - 21 , the centre was run by Duch , a former maths teacher who had become the head of the regime 's secret police .
In the former classrooms , over a period of 40 months , Duch oversaw the extermination of the entire Cambodian intellectual class with mathematical rigour .
Confessions were extracted by primitive torture : prisoners were strapped to iron beds , suspended upside down from ropes , threatened with drowning , tormented with knives and pincers , locked in tiny cells .
Then , at night , they were taken by lorry to the outskirts of Phnom Penh and killed in the rice fields .
The Khmer Rouge were obsessed with killing by night .

Now at last , after years of argument between the Cambodian government and the United Nations , the surviving members of the Khmer Rouge hierarchy are finally being brought to justice .
They will be tried under a hybrid UN - Cambodian tribunal known as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia ; the pre-trial hearings began in November and are still going on .
Pol Pot , of course , is long dead , having died under house arrest before he could be tried in 1998 .
The bloodiest of his comrades , Ta Mok , died in 1996 .
But five senior leaders including Khieu Sampan , the Khmer Rouge president , await trial .
Duch made his first appearance in court in November when his lawyer asked for him to be let out on bail because his " human rights had been violated , even if he was not beaten or tortured " .
A ripple of ironic laughter ran round the courtroom .
The request was rejected .
My quest to interview Duch had begun nearly three years ago .
I first visited S - 21 , soon after the fall of the Khmer Rouge .
Since his arrest more than eight years ago , nobody from the outside had even clapped eyes on him .
Now , finally , I was looking at this frail , 66 - year - old man with his protruding , irregular teeth , bug eyes and washed - out grey clothes .
I was confronting the mystery of the banality and the innocence of evil .
Throughout our interview , his voice was low , respectful like a mantra , a Buddhist prayer , rather than what it really was ; the soundtrack of a nightmare still freighted with questions .
His mild - mannered almost frail appearance in no way suggested the role of a mass murderer .
For the interview , conducted at the end of 2006 after six years of negotiation , the rules were strict : no tape recorder , no camera , no talking to him directly in French or English but only through a Cambodian interpreter , and no publication until the trial was imminent .
General Neang Phat , Cambodia 's Secretary of State , and other generals were sitting in the same room , listening to and scrutinising this indefinable and unfathomable man .
Some of them , too , have evil memories of the Khmer Rouge years .
But Duch was the exact picture of the banality and innocence of evil .
Duch , the nickname he assumed when he was young and joined the guerrillas , told me that the torture centre at Tuol Sleng was set up in August 1975 , four months after the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh , and began work two months later .
" I was given the task of creating it and starting it up , although I never found out why they chose me .
Before 1975 , when the Khmer Rouge lived in hiding , in the jungle , or in the liberated zones , I was the head of Office 13 , I was the chief of police in the special zone bordering on Phnom Penh . "
He described a routine of bureaucratic monotony .
" Every day I had to read and check the confessions .
I read from seven in the morning until midnight .
And every day , towards three in the afternoon , Professor Son Sen , the minister of defence , summoned me .
I had known him since my time as a high school teacher .
It was he who had asked me to join the guerrillas .
" He would ask me how my work was going .
Then a messenger would arrive , an envoy , who collected the confessions that were ready and took them to Son Sen .
These messengers were the only links between one office and another . "
I wanted to know if Duch had any moments of uncertainty , doubts , feelings of rebellion while he was wiping out his country 's entire intellectual class .
He admitted the idea had crossed his mind .
" When the work started at Tuol Sleng , I asked my bosses now and then , ' Do we really have to use all this violence ? '
Son Sen never answered .
Nuon Chea , the No 2 Brother in the power structure , who was above him , told me : ' Do n't think about these things . '
" I personally had no answer .
Then with the passing of time , I understood .
It was Ta Mok who had ordered all the prisoners to be eliminated .
We saw enemies , enemies , enemies everywhere .
" I was cornered , like everyone in that machine , I had no alternative .
Pol Pot , the No 1 Brother , said you always had to be suspicious , to fear something .
And thus the usual request came : interrogate them again , interrogate them better . "
Sometimes Duch was tempted to be merciful , he claimed – and his superiors began to mistrust him .
He recalled the time a cousin was brought to S - 21 .
" I knew him well , we had formed sincere family ties but I had to eliminate him anyway .
I knew he was a good person but I had to pretend to believe that confession extorted with violence .
So in order to protect him I did n't analyse those statements too rigorously .
And on that occasion my superiors began to lose full trust in me .
At the same time I did n't feel safe any more . "
But the moment of official doubt passed .
The interrogations and executions continued , remorselessly until the end .
" You kept your post until the end , " I said .
" Did you always carry out your orders thoroughly ? "
Duch answered : " I obeyed .
The work carried on until 7 January 1979 , when the Cambodian liberation forces , supported by the Vietnamese , conquered Phnom Penh .
There was no escape plan , no pull - out plan ... "
But , after the fall of the Khmer Rouge , the executioner blended back in among his countrymen , and disappeared , as so many did in the post - war chaos , swallowed up by the void .
Many years later he was converted to Christianity by American missionaries .
His true identity was discovered in 1998 and soon afterwards he was arrested .
He remains the most disquieting witness of the political madness planned by the Khmer Rouge , after the death of Pol Pot and Ta Mok , the one - legged " butcher " .
I asked him how he converted to Christianity and why that happened .
" I became convinced that Christians were a force , and that this force could beat Communism .
At the time of the guerrilla war , I was 25 years old , Cambodia was corrupt , Communism was full of promise and I believed in it .
But that project failed completely . "
So if Duch has repented now , what is his attitude to all those thousands of victims of his violence ?
There was no alternative for people like himself , trapped inside the machinery of the Khmer Rouge , he said .
" If someone goes looking for guilt , and the various degrees of guilt , I say that there was no way out for anyone who entered the power system conceived by Pol Pot .
Only at the top did they know the real situation in the country , but the intermediate functionaries did not know .
And then there was that obsession with secrecy .
" Of course , you are asking me whether I could have rebelled , or at least fled .
But if I had tried to flee , they were holding my family hostage , and my family would have suffered the same fate as the other prisoners in Tuol Sleng .
If I had fled or rebelled it would not have helped anyone . "
" Pizza Beer " was developed Labor Day , 2006 by Tom and Athena Seefurth in our home brewery in Campton Township , IL .
It all started with a surplus of tomatoes , a bag of garlic & an idea that started early in the spring when we planted our garden herbs .
The goal was to create a beer that would pair with a wide variety of foods , especially our favorite , Pizza !
In the end , we were pleasantly surprised that this " mess " turned out to be the best thing since the guy with chocolate that bumped into Ralph Mouth & mixed up the chocolate with the peanut butter !
Indeed , the world will love " Pizza Beer " .
Facing a difficult task , we immediately did an internet search to gather information on using the " oddball " ingredients in creating a beer .
Certainly someone had published such a recipe !
We found beer made with garlic , hemp seed , coriander , hot peppers , maple syrup , honey , citrus peels & more .
But what about tomatoes & the possibility of combining all of our favorite flavors into this beer ?
We then grabbed our favorite book written by a fellow Chicago Beer Society member , Randy Mosher .
He wrote a book called " Radical Brewing " which has been read cover to cover a few times .
Randy mentions a lot weirder stuff than pizza spices .
He talks about mushrooms , hot rocks & stuff that is really radical !
In a quandary , we called one of our best friends & creative brewmasters in the world , Kris Kalav .
We told him of our quest to make this really cool brew & wanted to know if he had any experience brewing with tomatoes .
After he stopped laughing , we bounced a few ideas around and Voila !
" Pizza Beer " was on it's way to fame .
To our knowledge , our home brewed concoction is the " World 's First Culinary Beer . "
Now , being homebrewers , we enjoy the freedom to create whatever we want .
We usually refer to a book by Ray Daniels called " Designing Great Beers " when creating a style of beer that we intend on submitting to a contest .
We usually concoct the recipe by memory & measure ingredients the way your grandmother did , pinch of this , smidgen of that .
Something happened that day .
We figured if this really turned out like we want it to , we better be able to duplicate it !
Lo and behold , the amazing " Pizza Beer " was born .
" Pizza Beer " contains NO Animal products ,
is 100 % vegetarian and has NO OILS added .
Additionally ,
There is a lot of jelly fish at the Black Sea , South of Russia .

Part A : From Writing
I used to teach a writers ’ workshop . . . and I would say at the start of every semester , “ The role model for this course is Vincent Van Gogh — who sold two paintings to his brother . ” — Kurt Vonnegut1 Ad Policy
The toughest , most fundamental question for a serious writer or artist of any kind , if you ’re not born with a silver spoon in your mouth , is how to support your habit .
2 Excerpted from Pity the Reader by Kurt Vonnegut and his former student Suzanne McConnell , just published by Seven Stories Press .
Not only must the habit be supported .
Like everyone else , the artist must first make the means to eat , clothe , and shelter him - or herself and dependents .
So the artist has two major tasks .
And one ( which may entail several ) has to bring in the bacon .
3
Asked what advice he would give to new young authors interested in pursuing a writing career , Vonnegut answered :
4
It is much harder for young writers to start now . . . it is much harder for young a lot of things to start now .
. . .
It ’s too bad there is no way for a poor person to make a beginning as a writer now.
5
Vonnegut said that in 1973 !
What has changed in over forty - five years ?
It ’s gotten even harder to earn money by writing .
And forget making a living at it .
The statistics reflect the general income disparity : there ’s a tiny group of financially successful writers , a “ 1 percent , ” and then everyone else .
This cuts across genres .6
Do a quick Internet search about writers ’ earnings , and the following headlines will pop up : “ Do n’t Quit Your Day Job — The Financial Reality of Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy , ” “ What Writers Earn : A Cultural Myth , ” “ My Amazon Bestseller Made Me Nothing : ” The last one , by Patrick Wensick , spells out the upshot most starkly :
7
Even when there ’s money in writing , there ’s not much money .
. . .
This is what it ’s like , financially , to have the indie book publicity story of the year and be near the top of the best - seller list .
Drum roll .
$ 12,000 . . . .
The book sold plus or minus 4,000 copies .
8
Why is this so ?
Vonnegut sums it up:9
There is no shortage of wonderful writers .
What we lack is a dependable mass of readers .10
According to a Pew Research Center survey , adult Americans read an average of twelve books a year , heavily weighted on either end of the age spectrum .
How many read fiction ?
God only knows .11
For perspective , consider this :
12
Bill Styron pointed out one time , in a lecture I was privileged to hear , that the great Russian novels — which were more of an influence on American writers than Hawthorne or Twain or any American writer you ’d want to name — were written for very small audiences because the literate population was very small , amid an enormous empire of illiterate people .
13
Kurt Vonnegut began writing short stories in order to make money .
Imagine doing that now !
“ I had a family and was n’t making nearly enough money to support the family so I started writing short stories on weekends and there was an enormous magazine industry at that time which paid very high prices for the stories and they needed lots of them . ” 14
October 28 , 194916 Dear Pop:17
I sold my first story to Collier ’s .
Received my check ( $ 750 minus a 10 % agent ’s commission ) yesterday noon .
It now appears that two more of my works have a good chance of being sold in the near future .
18 I think I ’m on my way .
I ’ve deposited my first check in a savings account and , as and if I sell more , will continue to do so until I have the equivalent of one year ’s pay at GE .
Four more stories will do it nicely , with cash to spare ( something we never had before ) .
I will then quit this goddamn nightmare job , and never take another one so long as I live , so help me God.19 I ’m happier than I ’ve been for a good many years .20 Love.21 K22
The equivalent of that $ 750 today : $ 7,481.23
Two years later , in 1951 , he quit his day job .
24
Writing novels paid little compared to short stories .
35
“ Doubleday wants me to expand ‘ Barnhouse ’ into a full novel .
That way , I could make another $ 750 , ” he wrote ironically to Harris .
Yet it was only in the novel form that he could be free from the strictures of the popular magazine market to have his own say .
“ I have a pitch , which I think will pay off , ” he confides in the same letter .
“ I hope to build a reputation as a science - fiction writer . ”
36
Vonnegut ’s conflict between taking the risk of doing what he wanted to do , on the one hand , and his obligation as the family breadwinner and his dislike of the corporate grind , on the other , surface in his fiction during those years , notably in the story “ Deer in the Works ” and the novel Player Piano .37
He was n’t alone with these conflicts .
Many returning World War II veterans were dismayed to find themselves in suburbia , working in corporations .
In the mid-’50s , The Organization Man by William H. Whyte and the novel The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit by Sloan Wilson , both critical of the corporate world ’s conformist mentality , were best sellers .
38
The main point : things have changed and things have stayed the same , essentially .
Yes , Vonnegut made money writing stories and cut his fiction writer ’s eyeteeth on them at the same time , impossible to do now .
But even though he quit his GE job to write full - time , basically he ’d traded one full - time job for several others .
Most of the time , though learning how to construct a darn good saleable story , he was not writing what he wanted to write .39
Today , you can learn how to write well while writing whatever you really want to write .
You just ca n’t make money at it .
In fact , it ’s likely you will pay to learn how .
But the conflict between freelancing and the reliable nine - to - five remains .
40
“ Psychologically , Kilgore Trout is what I thought I might become once I noticed how poor science fiction writers were and I was one of them at the time and I was as poor as any of them . ”
41
“ When I was ten , ” Mark Vonnegut recalls , “ Kurt asked if he could borrow the three hundred dollars I had saved up from my paper route .
” 42 Current Issue View our current issue
“ I only wish Kilgore Trout were here , ” said Eliot [ in God Bless You , Mr. Rosewater ] , “ so I could shake his hand and tell him that he is the greatest writer alive today .
I have just been told that he could not come because he could not afford to leave his job !
And what job does this society give its greatest prophet ? ”
Eliot choked up , and , for a few moments , he could n’t make himself name Trout ’s job .
“ They have made him a stock clerk in a trading stamp redemption center in Hyannis ! ” 43
The Good News:44
Vonnegut struggled .
If you are a writer , you will probably struggle financially as well .
But struggle is n’t bad .
Struggle means you ’re engaged , you ’re learning , striving .
What really sucks is listlessness , indifference , purposelessness.45
Listen to this : the toughest part of Kurt ’s life economically was also the most productive .
46
The bulk of my work was written on Cape Cod where I lived from 1950 – 1970 . . . probably was the shank of my creative life .
. . .
I would have been quite content to have created what I did by 1970 when I finally left Cape Cod .
I used to walk on the great salt marshes there and geese would fly up ahead of me and I would come home from a four - hour walk feeling healthy and happy .
47
PART B : ABOUT YOUR DAY JOB
When a child of the Great Depression loses a job , it is sort of like losing a billfold or a key to the front door .
You go get another one .
48
Sometimes going to “ get another one ” produces startling results .
“ Kurt Vonnegut once wrote that ‘ only nut cases want to be president . ’
But he helped me become a White House speechwriter , ” Robert Lehrman began an article he wrote in The New York Times .
“ In 1965 , Vonnegut was my adviser at the University of Iowa Writers ’ Workshop , where I was studying fiction .
One day , he said he could get me an assistantship , but I ’d have to teach speech .49
“ ‘ I know nothing about speech , ’ I said .50 Related Article Requiem for Zeitgeist Kurt Vonnegut
“ He said something like : ‘ Learn .
It ’s 1,800 bucks . ’” 51
So Bob did .
He discovered he loved the art of speaking .
He was , as I recall , vitally involved in the anti-war movement and was often on soapboxes .
The appeal of politics coalesced with his growing expertise at writing speeches , and eventually he landed a position as the chief speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore from 1993 to 1995 .
While working full - time as a speechwriter , he also published four novels and a hundred nonfiction articles .
Washington politics became fuel for short stories , and his lifelong “ day job ” for a well - received book about it , The Political Speechwriter ’s Companion : A Guide for Writers and Speakers , 2009 .
He still teaches speech , and continues to be in high demand as a commentator and speechwriter .
52
The ideal “ day job ” is one you enjoy , that fosters your fiction , and pays decently .
Something that satisfies other aspects of yourself than writing — the physical , for example , or the collaborative or interactive .
Better yet , one that entails unusual expertise , situations or environments that pique readers ’ curiosity , and in itself provides fodder for stories .
The practices of medicine and law have yielded up notable writers who ’ve used them as subjects .
53
If you ’re young and starting out , you might consider choosing another profession that ’s satisfying and lucrative , as your first goal toward writing .
If highly motivated and disciplined , with supportive family circumstances and abundant energy , you will write .
Perhaps you can work part - time or will delay writing until you ’ve amassed enough money to quit .
54
If the stories do n’t come , at least you ’re earning a living and having adventures doing something you value .55
On the other hand , you may not choose or want , for many reasons , to have two full - time professions .
Or you may not have available to you the “ ifs ” listed above that two professions require .
Most people do n’t .
No worries .
That ’s not who you are , or what your circumstances are , or your style .
56
The way to handle jobs you are n’t particularly partial to : find something about the job that you do care about .
57
Vonnegut cared a great deal about the guys he worked with at G.E. , for example .
Several remained friends throughout his life .58
In God Bless You , Mr. Rosewater , he writes about an insurance salesman who practices what might be called “ obligatory caring ” :59
Poor , lugubrious
Fred spent his mornings seeking insurance prospects in the drugstore , which was the coffee house of the rich , and the news store , which was the coffee house of the poor .
He was the only man in town who had coffee in both places .
. . .60 Poor Fred worked like hell for the few dollars he brought home once in a while .
He was working now , beaming at the carpenter and the two plumbers in the news store .
61
He engages them in conversation about their wives .
62 Related Article Why You Ca n’t Stop Me From Speaking Ill of Thomas Jefferson Kurt Vonnegut
“ I ’ve done what I can for [ my wife ] , ” Fred declared .
“ God knows it is n’t enough .
Nothing could be enough . ”
There was a real lump in his throat .
He knew that lump had to be there and it had to be real , or he would n’t sell any insurance [ italics mine ] .
“ [ Insurance is ] something , though , something even a poor man can do for his bride . ”
63
I discovered “ obligatory caring ” this way : Writing biographical prefaces for the Franklin Library Publishing Company freelance , I once got blocked when assigned what I considered a mediocre novel , until a veteran freelancer advised that instead of trying to fake it , I find something I cared about and latch onto that .
I admired the author , John Hersey , just not that novel .
That admiration carried me through .64
In spite of Vonnegut ’s hating the GE job , it provided him with the subject of his first novel and the passion to write it , as well as valuable instruction in public relations .
65
All jobs are gold mines for fiction .
66
Vonnegut encouraged us to write about work .
People do n’t write enough about it , he said .
Most people spend a lot of time at their jobs , and the workplace holds a wealth of potential for conflict , characterization , and societal comment .
67
Nonprofessional jobs allow you avenues into experiencing class , power , and the inner mechanisms and underbelly of the workplace , less emotionally accessible otherwise .
68
“ It ’s a tremendous advantage to be on the edge if you ’re an artist of any kind , because you can make a better commentary than someone at the center could , ” Vonnegut said .
69
He was a private in World War II , not an officer .70
Kurt told us one day about a writer friend of his who decided to paint houses , thinking that he could paint all day mechanically while his mind focused on writing .
But what happened , Vonnegut said , erupting into his wheezing laughter , is that his friend just painted all day .
71
Similarly , I waitressed at a jazz club in the ’ 70s , figuring I could both earn money and listen to music .
It turned out that most of the customers were other jazz musicians , too poor to tip well , and that you ca n’t attend to customers and listen to music simultaneously .
It was also dangerous on the subway in the middle of the night .
But that was fodder for a great bit in a short story .
72
Moral : Your job is your job .
Ya gotta be present for it .73
In a 1983 documentary , Kurt reported :74
I get up at 7:30 and work four hours a day .
Nine to twelve in the morning , five to six in the evening .
Businessmen would achieve better results if they studied human metabolism .
No one works well eight hours a day .
No one ought to work more than four hours .75
It ’s easy to resent the time your job takes , to think that only if you had more time , you could write a blue streak .
A novelist acquaintance , who worked full - time in the letters department of a weekly magazine , quit when her first novel sold successfully , and confided a few years afterward , “ You have no idea how much I resented Newsweek . ”
What she ’d discovered , though , was that having all the time in the world did not change her relationship to writing nearly as substantially as she ’d thought it would .
76
To have ample time to let your own rhythms guide you , to be free of feeling your writing squeezed between necessities is marvelous .
The gift of time is no joke .
It matters .
But the use and quality of the time matters more .
77
In fact , the pressure of that squeeze can make your writing time more sacred and productive .
78
Here ’s what Vonnegut says about the notion that hack - writing jobs cripple talent:79
That ’s romance — that work of that sort damages a writer ’s soul .
At Iowa , Dick Yates and I used to give a lecture each year on the writer and the free enterprise system .
The students hated it .
We would talk about all the hack jobs writers could take in case they found themselves starving to death , or in case they wanted to accumulate enough capital to finance the writing of a book .
Since publishers are n’t putting money into first novels anymore , and since the magazines have died , and since television is n’t buying from young freelancers anymore , and since the foundations give grants only to old poops like me , young writers are going to have to support themselves as shameless hacks .
Otherwise , we are soon going to find ourselves without a contemporary literature .
There is only one genuinely ghastly thing hack jobs do to writers , and that is to waste their precious time .
80
This student did n’t hate that lecture .
I appreciated it .
I felt as if someone , finally , was actually worried about us and our futures , in a fundamental way .
I had just begun to worry about it myself .
81
As I recall , it was Kurt who engineered that forum .
It was n’t part of the curriculum .
It was a surprise , a gift .
82
In that hard - nosed lecture , he and Yates invited us to open our mental doors to wage - earning possibilities .
Technical writing , medical writing , grant writing , industrial film writing — all kinds of avenues were proposed .
They suggested the advertising industry as a possible wage maker .
I could hardly believe my ears .
Advertising , at the heart of the heart of the establishment , was repudiated in those antiestablishment ’60s years .
83
“ When I was supporting myself as a freelance writer doing stories for the Saturday Evening Post and Collier ’s , I was scorned !
I mean , there was a time when to be a slick writer was a disgusting thing to be , as though it were prostitution .
The people who did not write for the slicks obviously did not need the money .
I would have liked very much to have been that sort of person , but I was n’t .
I was the head of a family , supporting the damn thing in what seemed — to me , at least — an honorable way .
”
85
Check out the review in Welcome to the Monkey House .
It ’s a marvel .
Vonnegut manages to be colloquial , imaginative , informative , and also to set forth his political agendas , praising writers he loves and advocating certain social and political attitudes , all in the examination of a humble dictionary .
87
Whatever writing you do increases your skill in tangling with words .
88
Another “ ghastly thing ” about hack - writing jobs : they replicate the confines of writing .
Who wants to stare at a computer screen after staring at one already for hours ?
Or play with words for yourself after arranging them for hours for your paycheck ?
89
To circumvent that duplication , you might write by hand , or in snatches of time , or in a bar — anywhere distinctly different and more playful than your day job requires .
90
Kurt concluded the lecture about jobs and how to get ahead in this way :
91
“ Use us , ” he said , bluntly .
92
Meaning the veteran writers who were our teachers .
93
I ’ve a vivid recollection of how he said it .
He looked straight at us , then dropped his eyes and let the words slide out of his mouth .
This , he seemed to me to be conveying , was necessity ’s bottom line .
94
Vonnegut ’s student Ronni Sandroff tells an anecdote about this notion :95
I wrote a story called “ The Frump Queen ” about a homecoming parade in Iowa City .
Vonnegut liked “ The Frump Queen ” and offered to send it to Redbook magazine for me , but I refused .
Please mother , I ’d rather do it myself .
The story was accepted — my first paid publication — and it was n’t until more than a decade later that I learned that Vonnegut had sent Redbook a letter asking them to keep an eye out for the story , and the editors were super - excited to have heard from him .
That was embarrassing .
For years I had been telling people I was living proof that you could sell a story from the slush pile .
It was something I wanted to believe , that the world was merit , not connection , based .96
By the time Party Party and Girlfriends , my first book of two novellas , was ready for publication I was willing to look unfairness in the face and ask Vonnegut for a quote .
“ Strong , imaginative , spookily candid , ” he wrote .
He compared me to J. D. Salinger , too , but the editor left out that part.97
Out of twenty students in a class anywhere in the country , Vonnegut told an interviewer , six will be “ startlingly talented ” and two might actually publish something .
What distinguishes the two who get published from the others equally talented ?
98 Related Article Rediscovering Nelson Algren Dan Simon
They will have something other than literature itself on their minds .
They will probably be hustlers , too .
I mean that they wo n’t want to wait passively for somebody to discover them .
They will insist on being read.99
Vonnegut admired a certain kind of chutzpah .
100
“ Winter , 1967 , ” the writer Dan Gleason recounts , “ and I was shivering in one of those flimsy old tin-roof Quontset huts . . . waiting impatiently for my first and only class with the great Kurt Vonnegut . ”
He was an undergrad journalism student , unregistered for the class , hoping to audit .
But it was standing room only .
Vonnegut told him to come see him before the next semester and he could enroll .
101
I was actually going to comply but when the class met again . . .
I swiped a chair from another hut and carried it into Vonnegut ’s class and plopped down .
. . .
When I caught his eye , he did a double take and asked if I was supposed to be in the class .
102 I said , “ Yeah , you do n’t remember me from last class ?
” 103 He shot me a puzzled look , paused a couple beats and nodded .
“ Oh , yeah . . . okay then .
” 104 Weeks later , he spotted me in the Student Union and said to sit .105 “ Did n’t you hand in a story about three teenage boys who hide out at some whorehouse ?
” 106 I said I did .107 “ I really like that story , ” he said .
“ But level with me .
You are n’t supposed to be in that class , are you ?
” 108 “ I do n’t guess I am . ” 109 A grin big as a watermelon slice creased his face .
“ Hell , I knew that .
But I let you stay because I liked your moxie .
You do n’t get far in this world without moxie .
” 110
The [ third ] most important lesson I learned from Vonnegut : Moxie will open doors .
111
Writers who think cynically that connections are the sole key to publishing are naïve .
112
Publishers are in business .
They want their business to thrive .
They are not going to publish something they do n’t think will sell or have some future promise , or that will damage their reputations .
Redbook would n’t have bought Sandroff ’s story if it were poorly written or did n’t serve their readers .
113
When connections work , it ’s because the “ project , ” as they say in the publishing industry , is a good fit .
All things being equal , the endorsement of a well - connected person may certainly boost a piece of work into being chosen over a competitor .
Same thing is true about jobs .
So yes , connections can be helpful .
Sometimes instrumental .
Sometimes detrimental .
With or without them , you have to do your best work .
114
Here are two examples from Vonnegut ’s career : Kurt met Knox Burger at Cornell , and reconnected when he submitted a story to Collier ’s magazine , where Knox worked as an assistant editor .
Knox rejected the story , commenting , “ This is a little sententious for us .
” 115
Eventually , Knox Burger became instrumental in Vonnegut ’s early publishing career as an editor and friend , publishing Vonnegut ’s first short story and as an editor at a publishing house , his first short story collection , Canary in a Cat House , and editing Mother Night .
116
The publisher Sam Lawrence was swayed by Vonnegut ’s dictionary review to pursue Kurt Vonnegut with a three - book contract .
117
Possibly it helped that Vonnegut happened to mention Bennett Cerf , Lawrence ’s former boss , in the review — though that is n’t in the realm of “ connection ” or even intention , but the Fairy Godmother ’s “ if the accident will . ”
If Kurt ’s review had been clunky , referring to Cerf would have signified nothing .
118
In the literary magazine world , the same thing holds true .
We at the Bellevue Literary Review avoid that kind of impropriety like the plague , sometimes to our detriment .
Significant prize money was withdrawn after we did not publish a piece by the famous , wealthy sponsor of it .
We have even rejected a submission by someone who had been a contest judge for us .
All that matters to us as editors is the piece of writing and the balance in the current issue under consideration .
119
Moxie has limits .
So does being well connected .
120
The playwright - narrator of Vonnegut ’s novel Mother Night is slipped a question in the prison yard from Adolf Eichmann .
121
“ Do you think a literary agent is absolutely necessary ? ”
The note was signed by Eichmann .
122
My reply was this : “ For book club and movie sales in the United States of America , absolutely . ” 123
Ten years after borrowing his paper route money , Mark Vonnegut writes , his father “ went from being poor to being famous and rich in the blink of an eye . ”
During the blink , Kurt told an interviewer , 124
I am frankly embarrassed by the money .
Success makes you feel the world has gone mad .
When you are successful , you discover that you can publish almost anything , and the response to that is to simply stop writing .
That is why I ’m looking for a new line of work .
125
Catapulting from relative obscurity to limelight ’s blinding blaze was certainly disconcerting .
Fame is destabilizing .
Kurt confided his worry about John Irving at the time Irving was becoming well known , in the early ’ 80s .
“ At least when it happened to me , I was already in my forties , ” Kurt said .
126
People confuse your personhood with your persona .
They fear you , demand things of you , project and expect .
127
At a party honoring Vonnegut after a reading at a university , no one , he told me at about the same time , came up and spoke to him or his wife Jill .
Everyone was too timid .
128
Joseph Shipley , an Indianapolis native , related this anecdote as I was assisting the Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library table at the Brooklyn Book Festival one recent September .
As a sophomore in high school , just after reading Cat ’s Cradle and Slaughterhouse - Five , he passed Kurt Vonnegut himself on the street one fall day in downtown Indianapolis .
129
“ I know you ! ” Joe blurted .
130
“ No , you do n’t , ” Kurt replied .
131
A few years later Kurt rocketed from shame - faced classroom confession about trying to be urbane to joining the company of other renowned writers invited to the White House .
132
Such a propulsion is hard on friends and family .
Your dad , husband , uncle — even your teacher — is suddenly someone else , someone exalted , someone fans think they know , someone who has much less time for you .
133
“ I grew up thinking everything would be perfect if we just had a little more money .
Instead the money just blew everything apart , ” according to Mark .
“ Once he was famous , people gathered around my father like hungry guppies around a piece of bread .
There was never enough Kurt to go around .
” 134
It took quite a bit of getting used to , by all parties .
135
Later in his life , Kurt told Mark that he was proud of restoring the family fortune .
136
In doing so , Kurt made his mother ’s biggest dream come true .
137
Success enabled Vonnegut to expand creatively .
It allowed him to participate in and influence society in ways impossible without the power of that position — giving speeches , lending his voice to social causes .
He achieved his goal of being a good citizen , and then some .
138
Do n’t worry .
You probably wo n’t have to endure the downsides of fame and fortune .
139
But you can emulate the upsides .

Why Bose Sucks Review Resources
The following is a list of resources you should read before you let anyone you know buy a Bose system .
You can get far better sound performance for a much lower price if you buy audiophile brands such as Epos , NHT , and even the more well - known B&W .
For those in the market for a pair of affordable , high fidelity " audiophile " speakers , I recommend the Usher S - 520 .
I bought a pair recently and I 'm very very satisfied .
Stereophile also has a good list of audio component reviews for under $ 1000 .
If you have questions for other smart early adopters , try our discussion forum
We turn up the volume on the Bose Acoustimass 5 Series IIIsystem ( $ 500 ) , which includes two tiny speakers — just 6.2 - inches high — and a subwoofer .
Bose is the No. 1 –selling speaker brand in the country , likely due to the company ’s hundred or so retail stores .
But it ’s certainly not this audiophile ’s speaker of choice .
A
Bose spokesperson says that the speakers are balanced and designed to reproduce low and mid-to - high frequencies “ according to the artist ’s original performance . ”
But this artist , for one , disagrees .
Still , we give the Bose another shot , this time playing hip - hop artist Mos Def , to test how the speakers handle heavy bass .
“ Oh no , oh no , ” Reed groans , sitting up to pet Lola , his Jack Russell terrier , who ’s curled up on a pillow next to him .
“ Next , ” Reed demands .
As a part of a small sect of audio enthusiasts who loathe the company Bose Corp. for its marketing deception , shortcutting in manufacturing , and shameless consumer trickery , I was recently passed on a website written by a " Bose - o - phile " , who was defending the company .
Upon reading his site , I vowed to represent our side : the TRUTH ..
Popularity of a name brand does n't equate to quality .
Bose mystique feeds off of its well - targeted audience : the ignorant , ill - informed , mass - market consumers who search for simplified hifi audio solutions in " all - in - one " chain stores ..
Audio newbies often throw out the " But I heard that Bose is good ! " defense , to which I respond " From who ? "
Was it a sound engineer , electrical engineer , materials scientist , studio engineer , sound producer , recording professional , musician , Mark Levinson ?
Ray Dolby ?
George Lucas ?
Anyone credible ?
Or was it your neighbor with the GoldStar walkman , Teac boom box , Funai mini-system , and Sylvania receiver ?
Perhaps the ubiquitous Bose
Ads that they find in completely irrelevant magazines such as Popular Science , Times , Playboy , GQ , People , Astronomy , etc , had some sort of subliminal effect against the better of their judgment ?
Bose equipment , even the flagship LifeStyle 50 , resembles the sonic performance of the 11 - year - old Aiwa minisystem in my garage .
For $ 500 , the Wave Radio is an overpriced alarm clock .
If you 're impressed by it , have a listen to a Henry Kloss radio for a fraction of the price !
For $ 1000 , the Bose 3 - 2 - 1 can not be described as anything less than a crime against sound reproduction .
The message I want everyone to take from this lengthy review is that .
If your goal is to appeal to and impress housewives , then this system gets the job done , but if your goal is high fidelity , high performance , high endurance , upgradeability , and fair market value pricing then I would very highly suggest you look elsewhere .
I ’ll close in saying that Bose is very often an emotional purchase by uninformed ( through no fault of their own ) buyers looking to buy a ‘ surround sound system ’ and more often than not the size of the Satellite Cubes is what seals the deal .
However if you ’re after genuine sonic fidelity and are n’t limited to a speaker that ’s tiny , I urge you to do your research , hear multiple systems and refrain from impulse purchases , your ears and wallet will thank you .
I currently have a Bose Lifestyle 35 System .
I thought I had the best system until I heard a friends Klipsch system .
It litteraly blew me away .
Apparently I bought advertising .
My roommate a few years back had Bose 301's .
He thought they rocked .
I picked up some Wharfedale Valdus 400's for about $ 200 less for a pair that simply made him want to cry .
He said it made him sick , that he wasted all that money on a set of speakers that he cannot even listen to anymore without getting FURIOUS .
To say the difference was night and day is a GROSS understatement .
The thing I do n't like about bose is that in almost all of their displays the speakers are right on top of you , and usually cranked up to a very high level .
This gives the consumer the idea that speakers are full and and have a good soundstage , when it 's just the opposite .
Almost any speaker will sound good , in a crouded store , when the speakers are right on top of you and cranked up so loud they are distorted .
In 1984 , Bose Corporation sued Consumer Reports for publishing a review in which Bose speakers did relatively poorly .
The review stated that the stereo image of the Bose speakers was unstable and " tended to wander about the room " , undermining the basic Direct / Reflecting concept behind Bose 's products .
The final verdict ruled that Consumer Reports had in fact libeled Bose by overstating its negative findings , which were , more precisely , that the stereo image merely " moved along the wall " behind the speakers .
This was something of a Pyrrhic victory for Bose , as since then both Bose and Consumer Reports readership in demographic areas where Bose products are targeted have became bitter enemies , and the same may hold true today .
Furthermore , the monetary award of $ 210,000 in libel damages was appealed to the Federal Supreme Court , who overturned it .
Nevertheless , the case is believed to have had a chilling effect on publication of subjective preferences in reviews , both specifically by Consumer Reports as well as in the media as a whole .
Friends Do n't Let Friends Buy Bose ..
I am really fucking sick of telling customers that the Bose speakers are really cheap cardboard and foam pieces of shit , and that Bose 's high - tech " engineering " ( if you can actually call it that ) makes no sense at all .
Also , small speakers ( especially ones that are cardboard with foam surrounds ) are not meant to handle any midrange or bass frequencies .
My point to all this mess ?
Well besides hating companies like Bose ( and sony too ) that have no shame in ripping off people who do n't know any better , I 'm hoping that newer entertainment employees or CC employees in general will stop selling these pieces of shit .

TORONTO , CDA . -
As cold and flu season hits this year amid growing debate over the necessity of vaccinations , University of Toronto researchers have uncovered widespread misinformation in related videos on YouTube .
In the first - ever study of its kind , U of T researchers Dr. Kumanan Wilson and Dr. Jennifer Keelan analyzed 153 videos about vaccination and immunization on YouTube , a popular online video - sharing site .
Researchers found that more than half of the videos portrayed childhood , HPV , flu and other vaccinations negatively or ambiguously .
Of those videos , a staggering 45 per cent contained messages that contradict the 2006 Canadian Immunization Guide , which provides national guidelines for immunization practices .
The Canadian recommendations are similar to guidelines from the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
" YouTube is increasingly a resource people consult for health information , including vaccination , " says first author Keelan , an assistant professor in U of T's Department of Public Health Sciences .
" Our study shows that a significant amount of immunization content on YouTube contradicts the best scientific evidence at large .
From a public health perspective , this is very concerning . "
The research team also found that videos skeptical of vaccinations - many of them highly provocative and powerful - received more views and better ratings by YouTube users than those videos that portray immunizations in a positive light .
" Health care professionals need to be aware that individuals critical of immunization are using YouTube to communicate their viewpoints and that patients may be obtaining information from these videos " says Wilson , senior author and an associate professor with U of T's Department of Medicine .
" You Tube users also need to be aware of this , so they can filter information from the site accordingly . "
" The findings also indicate that public health officials should consider how to effectively communicate their viewpoints through Internet video portals , " Wilson says .

Another trivial utility : accumulate
As usual , whenever I write one of these things , I wonder why it took me so long to get off my butt and put in the five minutes of work that were actually required .
I 've wanted something like this for years .
It 's called accumulate .
It reads an input of this form : k1 v1 k1 v2 k2 v3 k1 v4 k2 v5 k3 v6 and writes it out in this format : k1 v1 v2 v4 k2 v3 v5 k3 v6
I wanted it this time because I had a bunch of files that included some duplicates , and wanted to get rid of the duplicates .
So : md5 sum * | accumulate | perl - lane ' unlink @ F [ 2..$ #F ] '
( Incidentally , people sometimes argue that Perl 's .. operator should count backwards when the left operand exceeds the right one .
These people are wrong .
There is only one argument that needs to be made to refute this idea ; maybe it is the only argument that can be made .
And examples of it abound .
The code above is one such example . )
I 'm afraid of insulting you by showing the source code for accumulate , because of course it is so very trivial , and you could write it in five minutes , as I did .
But who knows ; maybe seeing the source has some value : #!/usr/bin/perl use Getopt:: Std ; my %opt = ( k => 1 , v => 2 ) ; getopts ( ' k : v :' , \ %opt ) or usage ( ) ; for ( qw ( k v ) ) { $ opt {$_} -= 1 if $ opt {$_} > 0 ; } while ( <> ) { chomp ; my @F = split ; push @ {$ K { $ F [ $ opt{k} ] }} , $ F [ $ opt{v} ] ; } for my $k ( keys %K ) { print " $k @{$ K{$k}}
" ; } It 's tempting to add a - F option to tell it that the input is not delimited by white space , or an option to change the output format , or blah blah blah , but I managed to restrain myself , mostly .
Several years ago I wrote a conference tutorial about the contents of my ~/ bin directory .
The clearest conclusion that transpired from my analysis was that the utilities I write have too many features that I do n't use .
The second - clearest was that I waste too much time writing custom argument - parsing code instead of using Getopt : : Std .
I 've tried to learn from this .
One thing I found later is that a good way to sublimate the urge to put in some feature is to put in the option to enable it , and to document it , but to leave the feature itself unimplemented .
This might work for you too if you have the same problem .
I did put in -k and - v options to control which input columns are accumulated .
These default to the first and second columns , naturally .
Maybe this was a waste of time , since it occurs to me now that accumulate -k k -v v could be replaced by cut - fk , v | accumulate , if only cut did n't suck quite so badly .
Of course one could use awk {print " $k $ v " } | accumulate to escape cut 's suckage .
And some solution of this type obviates the need for accumulate 's putative -F option also .
Well , I digress .
The accumulate program itself reminds me of a much more ambitious project I worked on for a while between 1998 and 2001 , as does the yucky line : push @ {$ K { $ F [ $ opt{k} ] }} , $ F [ $ opt{v} ] ;
The ambitious project was tentatively named " twingler " .
Beginning Perl programmers often have trouble with compound data structures because Perl 's syntax for the nested structures is so horrendous .
Suppose , for example , that you have a reference to a two - dimensional array $ aref , and you want to produce a hash , such that each value in the array appears as a key in the hash , associated with a list of strings in the form " m , n " indicating where in the array that value appeared .
Well , of course it is obviously nothing more than : for my $ a1 ( 0 .. $ # $ aref ) { for my $ a2 ( 0 .. $ # {$aref - >[ $ a1 ] } ) { push @ {$hash {$aref - > [ $ a1 ] [ $ a2 ] }} , " $ a1 , $ a2 " ; } } Obviously .
< sarcasm >
Geez , a child could see that .
</ sarcasm >
The idea of twingler was that you would specify the transformation you wanted declaratively , and it would then write the appropriate Perl code to perform the transformation .
The interesting part of this project is figuring out the language for specifying the transformation .
It must be complex enough to be able to express most of the interesting transformations that people commonly want , but if it is n't at the same time much simpler than Perl itself , it is n't worth using .
Nobody will see any point in learning a new declarative language for expressing Perl data transformations unless it is itself simpler to use than just writing the Perl would have been .
[ Addendum 20150508 : I dumped all my Twingler notes on the blog last year . ]
There are some hard problems here :
What do people need ?
What subset of this can be expressed simply ?
How can we design a simple , limited language that people can use to express their needs ?
Can the language actually be compiled to Perl ?
I had to face similar sorts of problems when I was writing linogram , but in the case of linogram I was more successful .
I tinkered with twingler for some time and made several pages of ( typed ) notes but never came up with anything I was really happy with .
[ Addendum 20150508 : I dumped all my Twingler notes on the blog last year . ]
At one point I abandoned the idea of a declarative language , in favor of just having the program take a sample input and a corresponding sample output , and deduce the appropriate transformation from there .
For example , you would put in : [ [ A , B ] , [ C , B ] , [ D , E ] ] and { B => [ A , C ] , E => [ D ] , } and it would generate : for my $ a1 ( @$input ) { my ( $ e1 , $ e2 ) = @ $ a1 ; push @{$output {$e2}} , $ e1 ; } And then presumably you could eyeball this , and if what you really wanted was @ { $ a1 } [ 0 , - 1 ] instead of @$ a1 you could tinker it into the form you needed without too much extra trouble .
This is much nicer from a user - experience point of view , but at the same time it seems more difficult to implement .
I had some ideas .
One idea was to have it generate a bunch of expressions for mapping single elements from the input to the output , and then to try to unify those expressions .
But as I said , I never did figure it out .
It 's a shame , because it would have been pretty cool if I had gotten it to work .
The MIT CS grad students ' handbook used to say something about how you always need to have several projects going on at once , because two - thirds of all research projects end in failure .
The people you see who seem to have one success after another actually have three projects going on all the time , and you only see the successes .
This is a nice example of that .

The introductions of new , widely - adopted technologies are often accompanied by fears of possible deleterious effects from the use of such devices , everything from concerns that telephones would spell the end of regional accents to parental admonitions not to sit too close to the television ( lest you ruin your eyes ! ) .
Usually these fears are largely allayed after a few years , as the technologies improve and become ubiquitous , and evidence of the feared negative effects fails to materialize .
Nonetheless , even though the microwave oven has been a standard household appliance for several decades now , rumors continue to linger that microwaves somehow “ change the molecular structure ” of consumables and therefore make food products heated in them unsafe to eat .
The sample “ experiment ” represented below is an expression of that sort of rumor , but it is pure junk science , both in its methodology and its conclusions :
Microwaved Water – See What It Does To Plants
Below is a science fair project that my granddaughter did for 2006 .
In it she took filered water and divided it into two parts ..
The first part she heated to boiling in a pan on the stove , and the second part she heated to boiling in a microwave .
Then after cooling she used the water to water two identical plants to see if there would be any difference in the growth between the normal boiled water and the water boiled in a microwave .
She was thinking that the structure or energy of the water may be compromised by microwave .
As it turned out , even she was amazed at the difference .
I have known for years that the problem with microwaved anything is not the radiation people used to worry about ,
It ’s how it corrupts the DNA in the food so the body can not recognize it .
So the body wraps it in fat cells to protect itself from the dead food or it eliminates it fast ..
Think of all the Mothers heating up milk in these “ Safe ” appliances .
What about the nurse in Canada that warmed up blood for a transfusion patient and accidently killed them when the blood went in dead .
But the makers say it ’s safe ..
Never mind then , keep using them .
Ask your Doctor I am sure they will say it ’s safe too .
Proof is in the pictures of living plants dying .
Remember
You are also Living .
Take Care .
First of all , there ’s some doubt as to whether the photographs displayed above actually depict a real experiment rather than some digital fakery , as the “ Day One ” and “ Day Five ” photos appear to be remarkably consistent in camera angle , lighting , positioning , background elements , and everything else save for the appearance of the “ dying ” plant :
Regardless , water heated in a microwave oven is no different in “ structure or energy ” than water heated with a gas flame , on an electric stove , or over a wood fire :
It ’s just water , plain and simple .
More important , though , is the awareness that drawing valid scientific conclusions from experimentation involves conducting multiple trials under carefully controlled conditions , something not in evidence here .
The extraneous factors that could have produced the exhibited results ( i.e. , one live plant and one dead plant ) exhibited above are legion .
For example :
One plant could have been compromised from the very beginning and would have died even if both plants were treated alike .
The container used to store or boil the microwaved water could have introduced a residual substance into the water that hindered plant growth .
The soil or bedding material used for one of the plants might have contained something ( either originally or introduced later ) that hindered plant growth .
The two containers of water might have been heated and / or cooled unequally , resulting in one plant ’s receiving warmer water than the other .
The plants might have been subject to differing environmental factors ( e.g. , light , heat ) due to their placement , or affected differently by external factors ( e.g. , insects , pets ) .
Since the experiment was not conducted “ blindly , ” the possibility that the experimenter in some way influenced the results cannot be ruled out .
Rather than simply speculate , though , we performed the same experiment in a more controlled manner .
We started out with three each of three different types of plants : one member of each set was given water that had been boiled on a gas stove , water that had been boiled in a microwave oven , or water that had not been boiled at all .
All the water used in the experiment came from the same source , the same vessel was used for boiling water both on the stove and in the microwave , and all three types of water were stored in identical containers .
The water given to all of the plants was at room temperature .
The plants were kept in a carefully controlled environment that protected them from our pets and equalized ( as much as possible ) their exposure to environmental factors and watered in the manner described above for a period of time identical to that of the original experiment .
As evidenced by the photos below ( taken while the plants were briefly removed from the environment in which they were tended and placed in a setting better suited to photography ) , at the end of that time period all three plants in each set were fairly thriving .
When a non-participating observer was asked to indicate ( blindly ) which plant in each set he thought had fared the best , in two cases he selected plants that had been given microwave - boiled water , and in one case he selected a plant that had been given unboiled water :
As for the coda to the example quoted at the head of this page , there have been some cases in which the use of microwave - heated blood in medical procedures has been cited as causing serious problems , but not because microwave heating “ corrupts the DNA . ”
Rather , conventional microwave ovens can heat blood too quickly and / or too unevenly ( resulting in hemolysis ) , so standard ( and slower ) blood warming procedures are generally preferred or mandated .
Chicken poop ai n’t pretty , but it ’s potential as an energy source has a number of large - scale poultry operations taking a second look at the smelly stuff .
The price tags on such projects can climb pretty high , though : Georgia ’s Green Power EMC project , for instance , was projected to cost $ 20 million when announced in early 2006 .
These costs may make such projects prohibitive in the developing world , where they could raise living standards of impoverished people while helping them “ leapfrog ” over Western development patterns based on fossil fuels .
South African farmer Shelby Tyne ( shown above ) believes he ’s hit upon the cost - benefit sweet spot for this technology : for $ 37,000 dollars , Tyne and partner Derrick Hilton have built a biogas plant that powers the entire farm … without even pushing maximum capacity .
Tyne tells the story of the biogas plant in this Facebook video ( note : you do have to be a member of Facebook to watch it ) .
His and Hilton ’s Greenways Farm had taken chicken poop off of a neighboring farmer ’s hands for a number of years to use as fertilizer , but stockpiling the litter created pollution problems .
Tyne ’s solution : put the poop into methane digesters , and use the resulting gas as fuel for both cooking stoves and a generator .
He quickly figured out that with the amount of chicken litter they normally used , the farm could create 11,000 kW h of electricity per month : more than three times what it normally consumed .
On paper , the project looked like a no - brainer .
When Shelby contacted me last week , he did n’t spend a lot of time explaining the technical details of the plant : he let the video do that ( and so will I ) .
Rather , he made the case that his model could provide an affordable power generation option for developing areas of the world , or even for farmers in the developed world struggling to make ends meet .
Given the overall simplicity of the design , it ’s hard to see how that ’s not a safe assumption .
One thing he did ask me ( and I ’ll pass on to you ) : would his design meet minimal environmental standards in places like the US ?
I could n’t say one way or the other , so I ’m interested to hear what you think .

PRISTINA ( Reuters ) - Europe ’s major powers and the United States said on Monday they recognized Kosovo ’s new independence , as Serbs reacted with anger and some states warned that its secession from Serbia set a dangerous precedent .
Serbian President Boris Tadic told the U.N. Security Council that unless it stopped Kosovo ’s independence , it would tell the world that no country ’s sovereignty and borders were safe .
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica ordered the immediate recall of Belgrade ’s ambassador from Washington .
He said envoys would be recalled from other capitals that recognized Kosovo but did not mention by name Paris , which did so first after a European Union foreign ministers ’ meeting in Brussels , nor London , Berlin and Rome , which followed .
“ The United States has today formally recognized Kosovo as a sovereign and independent state .
We congratulate the people of Kosovo on this historic occasion , ” U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said -- words Kosovo ’s 2 million ethnic Albanians had long dreamed of hearing .
“ In light of the conflicts of the 1990s , independence is the only viable option to promote stability in the region . ”
Washington led NATO allies to bomb Serbia over its treatment of Kosovo Albanians in the 1998 - 99 guerrilla uprising .
Recognition was a relief for Pristina , which had nervously awaited the West ’s expected blessing of its secession , but a black day for Serbia , which vowed never to concede the loss of a spiritual homeland steeped in myth .
“ The recognition of Kosovo is as important as the declaration of independence , ” Kosovo Albanian Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci told Reuters .
“ We are grateful . ”
In Banja Luka , capital of the Bosnian Serb Republic , protesters demanding Serb independence from Bosnia threw stones at U.S. , French and German consulates .
They chanted “ Kill , Kill Shiptars ” , a pejorative name for Albanians .
Serbs marched peacefully in Belgrade , where riot police were on alert after Western embassies were attacked on Sunday night .
A few Albanian - owned shops had their windows smashed , but there was no new rioting .
“ I appeal to citizens to stop all protests which lead to violence and unrest , because that is not the way to help either Serbia or the defense of Kosovo , ” Kostunica said , calling Serbs to a major rally on Thursday .

DISSENT
Around the globe , states with their own restless minorities are dubious or strongly critical of Kosovo ’s unilateral declaration of independence -- Spain , Azerbaijan , Georgia , Sri Lanka and China among them .
Tadic asked the Council : “ If you cast a blind eye to this illegal act , who guarantees to you that parts of your countries will not declare independence in the same illegal way ? ”
“ Who can guarantee that a blind eye will not be cast to the violation of the charter of the United Nations , which guarantees the sovereignty and integrity of each state , when your country ’s turn comes up ? ”

Russia stood by its ally Serbia in refusing recognition .
Moscow has vowed never to allow Kosovo to win a U.N. seat .
The West insists Kosovo is a “ European issue ” in which Russia should not interfere .
Turkey recognized Kosovo , a territory it ruled for 500 years in Ottoman times , and neighboring Albania -- anxious not to be first , to avoid charges that it covets Kosovo -- joined the list ready to send in their ambassadors .
Kosovo Albanians poured onto streets of the capital Pristina waving and kissing French , German , British , Italian and U.S. flags .
Britain ’s envoy in Kosovo announced an immediate upgrade to embassy status .
Spain , facing its own separatist struggles , led a minority of EU states saying “ no ” to independence , complaining the move had “ no international legal basis ” .
Italy , sensitive to Serbia ’s sense of grievance , noted that it “ recognizes Kosovo as an independent state under international supervision ” -- a reminder that Kosovo will remain under outside control , as it has been for the last nine years since NATO drove out Serb forces to protect ethnic Albanians .
“ Around 17 ( EU ) states have decided to react quickly so as to avoid creating a vacuum with indecisive behavior , ” said German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
Belgium , Luxembourg , Slovenia , Sweden , Ireland , Denmark , Finland , Bulgaria , Poland , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Austria , Hungary joined or were joining the early recognizers .
The Czech Republic , Netherlands , Portugal , Greece and Slovakia were still making up their minds .
Romania ’s parliament said outright it would not recognize Kosovo , in a reflection of fears the move will fuel separatist moves elsewhere in the Balkans .
The 57 - member Organisation of the Islamic Conference congratulated Kosovo , whose Albanians are nominally Muslim .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Kosovo ’s independence marked “ the end of the Balkan troubles ” .
In Serbia ’s capital , student Jelena had a different view .
“ This country is getting smaller and smaller , ” she said .
“ We are marching to show that we ’re against it . ”
Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine have demonstrated that living human nerve cells can be engineered into a network that could one day be used for transplants to repair damaged to the nervous system .
" We have created a three - dimensional neural network , a mini nervous system in culture , which can be transplanted en masse , " explains senior author Douglas H. Smith , MD , Professor , Department of Neurosurgery and Director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at Penn .
Although neuron transplantation to repair the nervous system has shown promise in animal models , there are few sources of viable neurons for use in the clinic and insufficient approaches to bridge extensive nerve damage in patients .
The Stretch Test
In previous work , Smith 's group showed that they could induce tracts of nerve fibers called axons to grow in response to mechanical tension .
They placed neurons from rat dorsal root ganglia ( clusters of nerves just outside the spinal cord ) on nutrient - filled plastic plates .
Axons sprouted from the neurons on each plate and connected with neurons on the other plate .
The plates were then slowly pulled apart over a series of days , aided by a precise computer - controlled motor system , creating long tracts of living axons .
These cultures were then embedded in a collagen matrix , rolled into a form resembling a jelly roll , and then implanted into a rat model of spinal cord injury .
After the four - week study period , the researchers found that the geometry of the construct was maintained and that the neurons at both ends and all the axons spanning these neurons survived transplantation .
More importantly , the axons at the ends of the construct adjacent to the host tissue extended through the collagen barrier to connect with the host tissue as a sort of nervous tissue bridge .
Next Step
Now , the researchers have taken the next step and are applying this technique to living human nerve cells .
Smith and his team obtained human dorsal root ganglia neurons ( due to their robustness in culture ) to engineer into transplantable nervous tissue .
The root ganglia neurons were harvested from 16 live patients following elective ganglionectomies , and four thoracic neurons were harvested from organ donors .
The neurons were purified and placed in a specially designed growth chamber .
Using the stretch growth technique , the axons were slowly pulled in opposite directions over a series of days until they reached a desired length .
The neurons survived at least three months in culture while maintaining the ability to generate action potentials , the electrical signals transmitted along nerve fibers .
The axons grew at about 1 millimeter per day to a length of 1 centimeter , creating the first engineered living human nervous tissue constructs .
" This study demonstrates the promise of adult neurons as an alternative transplant material due to their availability , viability , and capacity to be engineered , " says Smith .
" We 've also shown the feasibility of obtaining neurons from living patients as a source of neurons for autologous , or self , transplant as well as from organ donors for allografts . "
Researchers report their findings in the February issue of the Journal of Neurosurgery .
Penn co-authors are Jason H. Huang , Eric L. Zager , Jun Zhang , Robert G. Groff IV , Bryan J. Pfister , M. Sean Grady , and Eileen Maloney - Wilensky .
Akiva S. Cohen from The Children's ' Hospital of Philadelphia was also a co-author .

TUESDAY , Jan. 8 , 2008 ( HealthDay News ) --
People with four healthy lifestyle behaviors -- not smoking , physical activity , moderate alcohol consumption , and eating five servings of fruit or vegetables a day -- live an average of 14 years longer than people with none of those behaviors , a new British study contends .
Researchers at the University of Cambridge and the Medical Research Council looked at 20,000 men and women , aged 45 - 79 , who filled out a questionnaire about the four health behaviors .
The participants , none of whom had known cancer or heart or circulatory disease , filled out the questionnaire between 1993 and 1997 and were followed until 2006 .
For each of the four healthy lifestyle behaviors , a participant received one point .
After they factored in age , the researchers found that participants with zero points were four times more likely to have died over an average period of 11 years than those with four points .
In addition , the study authors concluded that participants with a score of zero had the same risk of dying as someone 14 years older with a score of four .
This was independent of body - mass index ( BMI ) and social class .
While the findings need to be confirmed in other populations and an analysis of how these combined health behaviors affect quality of life is needed , the researchers said the results suggest that these four healthy lifestyle behaviors could markedly improve the health of middle - aged and older people .
The study is part of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition ( EPIC ) , conducted in 10 European countries .
EPIC is the largest - ever study of diet and health .
There is strong evidence that individual lifestyle factors such as smoking , diet and physical activity influence health and longevity , but there has been little research into their combined impact , according to background information in a news release about the study .
The study was published in the journal PLoS Medicine .

The American Academy of Family Physicians has more about healthy living .
Steve Chapman takes up the cause at Reason :
Outlawing this commerce serves mainly to make things worse , not better .
It assures income to criminal organizations with long experience evading the law .
It makes prostitutes vulnerable to abuse .
It prevents measures to protect the health of providers and patrons .
It exempts an industry from the taxes and fees that legitimate businesses have to pay .
It squanders police resources that could be used to fight real crime , while clogging jails and courts with offenders who will soon be back plying their trade .
Supporters of the status quo say the sex industry is filled with victims of human trafficking — foreigners forced to work in servitude .
Whether such modern - day slaves amount to more than a tiny fraction of hookers , however , has never been proved .
Similar claims have been made about migrant farm laborers and domestic workers — which is not taken as grounds to ban fruit picking or home cleaning .
Someone whose very job is illegal , in fact , is an ideal candidate for such exploitation , since she is unlikely to go to the cops .
But all this is secondary to the priority of human freedom .
We no longer believe the government has a right to prevent homosexuals or heterosexuals from engaging in sexual practices .
In 2003 , the Supreme Court had the wisdom to strike down a Texas sodomy prosecution against two homosexuals caught in the act .

Some brilliant lawyer ought to ask the courts why the state may ban one type of sex between consenting adults but not another .
Shattering Intelligence : Implications for Education and Interventions
The concept of a general intelligence or g factor has proved enormously fruitful in two respects .
On the level of individual differences , it captures the fact that if one person outperforms another on one kind of conceptually demanding task , that advantage is likely to persist over a whole range of other cognitive tasks .
On the level of group differences , we find that the average Full Scale IQ of two groups on a good IQ test often predicts things like their occupational profiles .
Various occupations have minimum IQ thresholds .
If 50 percent of group A scores above say an IQ of 100 , while only 16 percent of Group B do , then Group A will have a three to one ratio in its favor in terms of the proportion of its members who are professionals or technicians or managers .
An example of a good IQ test is the WISC ( Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ) .
The reason it is good is that its ten subtests have enough cognitive complexity so that a high IQ person tends to beat the average person by a handy margin on all ten .
That is equivalent to saying that it is a good measure of g .
A test that included subtests of minimal cognitive complexity , let us say tying your shoes , would be a bad IQ test .
The task is so simple that unintelligent people would perform it as well as intelligent people .
Shattering general intelligence
Despite all the triumphs of the concept of general intelligence , I believe intelligence is like the atom : you have to know both why its parts cohere and why they sometimes fly apart .
Americans made massive IQ gains on the WISC between 1947 and 2002 amounting to almost 18 points of Full Scale IQ .
These gains ranged from only 2 points on the WISC subtest called Information to 24 points on the subtest called Similarites ( what do dogs and rabbits have in common ? ) , despite the fact that both have the cognitive complexity that makes them good measures of g .
A bright person tends to accumulate more general information than a dull person at any given time and also tends to better at classifying things ( will say that dogs and rabbits are both mammals ) .
But over time , we find that society can develop these conceptual skills quite independently of one another .
Children may progress a lot over time in putting on scientific spectacles , which means that many more of them will say “ both mammals ” rather than say something like “ I use my dog to hunt rabbits . ”
While thanks to the rise of a visual culture that discourages reading , the average child today may have no greater store of general information than children did 55 years ago .
Diagnosing how conceptual skills actually develop
The fact that various conceptual skills develop so independently over time has wide implications for education .
At any given time , a person that beats another at arithmetical reasoning is likely also to do better on a test called Raven ’s Progressive Matrices .
You are given a pattern of shapes that make up a square and you have to see the logical pattern across the rows and down the columns .
If row one across is X O O O. and row two across is X X O O , then you must deduce that row three should be X X X O.
Because g indicates that the skills go together , American schools since 1990 have been teaching children Matrices problems on the theory that it will develop their mathematical skills .
But cognitive gains over time second - guess g : between 1947 and 2002 , gains on the Arithmetic subtest of the WISC were only 4 points and gains on Raven ’s were about 27.5 points .
Clearly there is no functional relationship here .
After all , there is a functional relationship between having a good vocabulary and reading serious literature , so if the ability to do the latter increased over time , the former would have to increase .
Thanks to the illusion fostered by g , the schools are wasting their time .
I suspect that only for mathematicians is math a logical enterprise where all is proven and linked by logic .
For 99 percent of us , it is a strange separate world in which very different rules hold than in everyday life .
Therefore , we should try to isolate the fundamental concepts of that world , like measurement from a zero point , how numbers are created , why things are equivalent across an = sign , and so forth , and slowly get children to feel comfortable in the world of mathematics .
Once you break intelligence down into its autonomous components , many things become clear .
For example , the Nation ’s Report Card shows that today ’s children are ahead of their parents in reading at early ages and then the gains fade away by the age of 17 .
How is that possible ?
The children are doing much better on heavily g loaded IQ tests like the WISC at all ages .
Should not brighter people be able to read adult novels better ?
This mystery is solved when you look at IQ trends over time .
Since 1972 ( when the NRC began ) , the big IQ gains have been on certain subtests and not others .
There have been virtually no gains in vocabulary and information .
You cannot enjoy War and Peace very much if you have to run to the dictionary or encyclopedia every other paragraph .
We are doing a better job of teaching children the mechanics of reading at early ages .
But their parents had mastered the mechanics by age 17 and at that age , neither generation has an information or vocabulary advantage .
So we have made no progress is teaching young people how to enjoy adult literature .
A blinding obsession
The response of many g-men to IQ gains over time is to say : “ You grant that gains on various subtests do not correspond to how well each subtest measures g .
Well , that shows that the gains are hollow , that is , since they are not g gains they are not real intelligence gains and lack significance . ”
As you can see , this is just a way of saying that if all complex cognitive skills do not move together — that if they have different trends — then the trends just cannot be significant .
This is the saddest result of the obsession with g : it makes the limitations of the concept no longer a matter of evidence .
Any evidence that challenges the supremacy of g is not good evidence because it challenges the supremacy of g and that is that .
Note that we would not reason in this way in other areas .
There is a musical g in the sense that whoever is better than me on the piano will probably outdo me on the organ .
But skills could improve on one and not the other , and that would be of great significance to the world of music .
There is a moral g in the sense that good people tend to be both more tolerant and more generous than the average .
But over time , white Americans may have tended to become more tolerant of other races and no more generous in giving to charities .
No black American would say that unless all of the components of moral g moved together , the trends were not significant .
The transience of intelligence
General intelligence or g has something to do with brain quality , and good genes have a lot to do with having an above average brain .
Therefore , there was a tendency in differential psychology to think that our genes - determined brain accompanies us throughout our lives and that environment , except in extreme conditions ( living with wolves since infancy ) , merely leaves minor imprints on that brain .
After all , twin studies showed that even when identical twins were separated at birth , they had IQs at adulthood that were much more similar than the IQs of randomly selected people .
What better evidence did you need that genes / brain went though life and environment just did a bit of tinkering along the way ?
But this created a dilemma : if genes were so dominant , how could IQ gains over time be so huge ?
Unless you thought that there was a large genetic upgrading from one generation to the next , large intelligence gains should be impossible .
Yet they occurred , which implied that there were environmental factors of huge potency .
How could environment be both so feeble and so potent ?
The Dickens / Flynn model resolved this dilemma .
Two twins raised apart , thanks to having slightly better genes than average , would both get into increasingly privileged environments .
Both would get more teacher attention , would be encouraged to do more homework , would get into a top stream , and by adulthood , they would both be far above average .
Moreover , thanks to their identical genes , their environmental histories would be very similar .
Their identical genes were getting all of the credit for the combination of identical genes plus nearly identical enriching environmental factors !
The environmental factors were not feeble at all : they just tended to be similar for identical twins when raised apart , which made them look feeble .
This means a huge shift in perspective .
The g-man view was that environment made little difference throughout life because environment makes very little difference at any point in life .
The Dickens / Flynn view is that environment makes a lot of difference , which meant we had to look elsewhere for why its effects seem so transient .
Our conclusion was that present environment swamps past environment in terms of effect on your level of cognitive functioning .
Cognitive exercise
The first implication of the new perspective is the benefit of persisting in cognitive exercise throughout life .
There is the dramatic case of Richard Wetherill .
He played chess in retirement and could think eight moves ahead .
In 2001 , he was alarmed because he could only think four moves ahead but he continued an active mental life until his death in 2003 .
Autopsy showed that his brain was riddled with the plaques and tangles that are characteristic of Alzheimer ’s .
Most people would have been reduced to a state of total confusion .
This does not mean that cognitive abilities fail to decline with age .
After all , at any given age , an athlete is better off for training .
But however hard you train , your times will get slower as you age .
The brain is much more like our muscles than we had thought , even in the sense that specialized exercise affects different parts of the brain .
Autopsies show that the brains of London taxi - drivers are peculiar .
They have an enlarged hippocampus , which is the brain area used for navigating three - dimensional space .
Here we see spatial abilities being developed without comparable development of other cognitive skills .
To develop a wide variety of cognitive skills you need a wide variety of cognitive exercises .
Interventions
Interventions that may enhance IQ include the efforts of parents , programs that afford an enriched environment to children at risk , adoption , and university study .
Beginning with the family , the Dickens / Flynn model posits a tug of war between two environments : the environment parents impose , which is not directly correlated with the child ’s unique genetic endowment ; and the environment the child creates by interacting with the world , which does tend to match the child ’s unique genetic endowment .
With each passing year , a child transcends parental influence and becomes an autonomous actor .
Parents cannot prevent their child from rebelling against a teacher with whom there is little rapport or getting in with the wrong crowd .
Preschool interventions also impose an environment on children that is uncorrelated with their genes , usually a uniformly enriched one that includes stimulation through educational toys , books , contact with sub- professionals , and so forth .
If these terminate as children enter school , the intervention is likely to lose the tug of war even earlier than a child ’s parent do .
After all , the parents retain some influence after the preschool years .
Since the imposed environment was far more enriched than any available at school , the children will begin to match environments that get further and further below its quality .
The most radical form of environmental intervention is adoption into a privileged home .
Adoptive parents often wonder why the adopted child loses ground on their natural children .
If their own children inherit elite genes and the adopted child has average genes , then as parents slowly lose the ability to impose an equally enriched environment on both , the individual differences in genes begin to dominate .
Finally , note that university education is a partial attempt to impose an enriched environment on students regardless of their genetic differences – that is , it constitutes a quasi - environmental intervention on the adult level .
It too will see its effects on IQ fade unless quality of environment is maintained , for example , unless thanks to a good university education a student of average ability qualifies for a cognitively demanding profession .
Then the job takes over the university ’s role of imposing duties that foster the intellect .
Note that none of this means that interventions have no lasting effect ; it is just that their non-IQ effects are likely to be more permanent than their IQ effects .
If parents encourage persistence , honesty , and self - esteem , their children have a good start in life that may prove far more important than their gaining a few jumps on the IQ hierarchy .
Similar characterological enhancement has been claimed for intervention programs like Head Start .
Contacts made at a good university may confer an enhanced income and socioeconomic status throughout life .
These comments about interventions may seem to imply that no one can really hope to improve on his or her genetic endowment .
This pessimism is no more in order than pessimism about whether people can improve on their physical endowment for running .
To do so , you must either have good luck or make your own luck .
Either a happy chain of circumstances will force you to train throughout your life or you can develop a love for running and train without compulsion .
Training will not override genes entirely , of course .
There are runners I cannot beat even when I train more than they do .
But I can run rings around every couch potato within 20 years of my age .
There is one way in which individuals can make their own luck .
Internalize the goal of seeking challenging cognitive environments — seek intellectual challenges all the way from choosing the right leisure activities to wanting to marry someone who is intellectually stimulating .
The best chance of enjoying enhanced cognitive skills is to fall in love with ideas , or intelligent conversation , or intelligent books , or some intellectual pursuit .
If I do that , I create within my own mind a stimulating mental environment that accompanies me wherever I go .
Then I am relatively free of needing good luck to enjoy a rich cognitive environment .
I have constant and instant access to a portable gymnasium that exercises the mind .
Books and ideas and analyzing things are possessions easier to access than even the local gym .
If only we who teach could make more of our “ subjects ” fall in love with ideas .
Then we would have truly effective interventions .
Three levels and three concepts
All of this has implications for the theory of intelligence .
There is nothing really the matter with the concept of g ; it is just that we have misused it by making it the omnipresent concept in our study of cognitive abilities .
Intelligence is important on three levels , namely , brain physiology , individual differences , and social trends ( collectively , BIDS ) .
The core of a BIDS approach to intelligence is that each of those levels has its own organizing concept , and it is a mistake to impose the architectonic concept of one level on another .
We have to realize that intelligence can act like a highly correlated set of abilities on one level and act like a set of functionally independent abilities on other levels .
Take the brain .
Highly localized neural clusters are developed differentially as a result of specialized cognitive exercise , but there are also important factors that affect all neural clusters such as blood supply , dopamine as a substance that renders synapses receptive to registering experience , and the input of the stress - response system .
When we map the brain ’s structure , we find a mixture of commonality and neural decentralization .
The commonality may well give rise to g on the individual differences level , while the decentralization leads to the phenomenon of various cognitive skills developing independently over time .
As for individual differences , that is the proper kingdom of g .
There is simply no doubt that performance differences between individuals on a wide variety of cognitive tasks are correlated primarily in terms of the cognitive complexity of the task or the posited cognitive complexity of the path toward mastery .
However , we need to avoid the mistake of thinking that the interaction between genes and environment is less complex than the reality .
On the social level , it is also beyond doubt that various real - world cognitive skills show different trends over time as a result of shifting social priorities .
The appropriate dominant concept on this level is not g but something like social utility .
In closing , I want to stress that the BIDS approach does not aim at the abolition of g .
It merely endorses a separation of powers that gives each dominant construct the potency needed to rebuff the other two .
The U.S. Constitution attempts to make the President , Congress , and Supreme Court dominant in the executive , legislative , and judicial areas , respectively .
I want the same kind of separation of powers for the three levels of intelligence .

There ’s something that ’s just right about this USB hub .
The little guy strikes a near - perfect balance between design , simplicity and functionality ( although that ’s the one place it falls a little short ) .
Kikkerland ’s USB Hub Man has flexible wire arms and legs with a port at the end of each one .
His body houses all the electronics and a tiny green power indicator LED in place of a heart .
The only bummer about Hub Man is that only one of his ports runs at USB 2.0 speeds without a special adapter .
Hopefully , they ’ll make him fully high - speed compliant in the future .

Young worshipers should therefore read their holy books to decide for themselves whether they are practicing the right religion , one that they can embrace .
This is the personal responsibility of every worshiper , and the powers that be in every religion should respectfully allow their members to do some exploring of their own , on their own .
That way , they know of their own volition what brings them closer to their deity , and know that they can still turn to their houses of worship whenever they are lost .
At an early age , their religion helps define who young believers are through baptisms , bar mitzvahs , and the like , providing them with a bedrock with which to start their devotional journey .
It follows that their faith - based communities would support them in this endeavor , and not attempt to pigeonhole them when they are coming into their own relationship with God .
Otherwise , they simultaneously define the faith and lose ground .

“ Fall seven times , stand up eight . ” – Japanese proverb
By Leo Babauta
It ’s inevitable : sometimes , life just does n’t go your way .
Your schedule gets all messed up .
You fail to follow your exercise plan .
Someone is mean to you .
You feel like quitting something .
You want to curl into a little ball and cry .
Life deals out its blows , and leaves us discouraged , angry , frustrated , depressed , drained .
And once we ’re in that bad place , in a mood where we just do n’t care about anything , it ’s pretty hard to get out of it .
But let me share a little secret to happiness and self - improvement here : all that stuff ?
It ’s just in your head .
Yeah , it sure does n’t seem like it .
It seems that the slings and arrows of life are all coming at us .
It feels like we ’re a failure .
But it ’s true .
It ’s all in your mind .
How can I trivialize horrible things that happen to you like that ?
By making it seem like a simple mental problem ?
Because that ’s what it is , and once you realize that , you are liberated — you have the power to change your circumstances !
It ’s not an easy task , I ’ll give you that .
It ’s incredibly , monumentally hard .
Changing your mind and changing your life is a mental hurdle worthy of the titans .
But it can be done .
All it takes is a few mental tricks , and a lot of energy and willingness to keep an open mind .
“ Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow . ” – Swedish proverb
Let me give you an example : for the last couple years , I ’ve struggled with exercise .
I actually enjoy running and working out , but there are days when I do n’t feel like doing a thing , or when I feel under the weather , and those days can stretch out to a week and that week can stretch into a few weeks .
And then I ’ve fallen off the exercise wagon and it feels like I ca n’t get back on .
But then I use the first couple of tricks below , and my mindset changes .
I switch on the positive attitude , and realize that my failure to exercise is actually just a stepping stone to fitness success .
And looking back , I ’ve had 6 - 7 of these failures , or stepping stones , and they ’ve all led me further down the path to fitness .
Today , I exercise almost every day , and I ’m loving it .
The same is true of every other success I ’ve had .
This blog , for example , is a success in my eyes , but I ’ve had points where I was discouraged by negative comments or emails .
I flipped that discouragement around , however , and used the comments to help myself improve .
I had many failures along the way to eliminating my debt , but I made it there in the end , by not quitting .
I have faced many tests of my patience and character , and failed not a few of those too .
But through practice , I ’ve gotten better , and while I ’m not perfect , I know that I ’ll only continue to improve if I keep the same mindset .
It ’s all in your mind .
Here are 8 tricks I use to turn anything bad into something truly awesome .
The power of positive thinking .
I learned the power of positive thinking while I was quitting smoking , and I used the lessons of that challenge to help me with every other challenge I ’ve faced since .
Quitting smoking , as most smokers ( and ex-smokers ) know , is supremely difficult .
There are many times throughout each day , in the first few weeks especially , when you feel like giving up .
When you want just one cigarette ( which leads to two … ) .
When you just do n’t see the point of all this suffering .
And yet , if you realize that it ’s just negative thinking , you can squash that negative thought like a little bug .
Then replace it with a positive thought ( I CAN do this ! ) and you ’re back on the road to success .
Recognize negative thoughts , squash them , and find positive thoughts to replace them .
Works every time .
Failure is a stepping stone to success .
This is what I tell myself every time I fall .
I get up , dust myself off , and start again .
Each failure shows you an obstacle you did n’t anticipate , and you can plan to beat that obstacle next time .
Each failure brings you that much closer to winning .
And you know what ?
Every single time I ’ve told myself that , so far , it ’s been true .
I ’ve succeeded .
Getting back up is the main thing .
Practice patience .
This is what I tell myself when I get frustrated , when someone is difficult , when I begin to lose my patience .
First , I vent somehow ( talking to a friend or my wife is one of the best ways for me ) .
Then , I tell myself that this is a great way for me to practice my patience .
Sometimes , I have to repeat this to myself like a mantra , but it works nonetheless .
Learning experience .
Similar to the “ stepping stone to success ” trick above , but it can be used for anything , not just failure .
If I make a mistake , if I make the wrong choice , if I have a bad day … I just see it as an opportunity to learn .
Then I review it in my head , trying to figure out what went wrong , trying to learn from my mistakes .
If you see learning as a wonderful thing , as I do , then you can see every mistake as a blessing .
Makes you stronger .
“ That which does not kill us only makes us stronger , ” goes the famous saying .
And while that ’s not always true ( sometimes we can be left weakened and ruined ) , I ’ve found it to be true in most cases .
Something is difficult ?
I will be a stronger person for having endured it .
This has been the case for me when I went through problems as a teen - ager ( I ran away from home and slept in Golden Gate Park in S.F. ) , when I went through a divorce seven years ago , when I had stressful and trying times at various jobs .
I became a better person because of it .
Test of your character .
I like tests and challenges .
It motivates me to step up to another level , to see if I can meet the challenge .
This is the case with my first marathon , which was very difficult for me ( for various reasons ) .
It was n’t a particularly enjoyable experience for me , but I just saw it as a test .
And when I passed that test , it was a joyous thing for me .
This is true any time you go through a trying time — see it as a challenge , and try to meet that challenge .
And when you do , you ’ll feel great about yourself .
Turn the other cheek .
Jesus said that instead of taking an eye for an eye , if someone hits you , just turn the other cheek .
I do n’t know many people who can meet this monumental challenge .
I ’ve tried it .
It ’s not easy , and the desire to avenge any wrongs is hard to quash .
However , I believe that even making an effort at this will make you a better person .
It goes not just for physical wrongs to you , but anything that anyone does to you .
They call you a name ?
Thank them .
There will be some people who say that you have to meet force with force , or people will walk all over you .
To this I say , “ Where does it end ? ”
And I also say , “ You are merely stooping to their level . ”
Rise above the pettiness of others , and become a better human being .
Love your enemy .
I wrote about this recently as one of life ’s greatest challenges , and it belongs on this list .
When you have anger toward another human being , give this a try .
If you succeed , to any degree whatsoever , you will rejoice in this success .
It is a miraculous thing .
Company said to be planning new titles on the format as soon as this spring
The ICv2 retailer news website reports that ADV Films has chosen the Blu-ray Disc format and plans to release titles on the high - definition format as soon as this spring .
According to ICv2's source , the company will first concentrate on bringing out Blu-ray versions of some of its most recent licenses , rather than any back catalog titles .
Since high - definition transfers of some anime may have to be prepared , this decision may cause some release date delays .
The news comes in light of the company 's reported short - term issues with the distribution of various anime titles .
Sony , the primary backer of the Blu-ray Disc format , released Tekkonkinkreet and Paprika on the format last September .
At first , Warner Brothers committed to Blu-ray and HD DVD and will release Appleseed Ex Machina on both competing formats , but it announced before last month 's Consumer Electronics
Show that it will dedicate itself to the Blu-ray format exclusively after May .
Bandai Visual USA has released Royal Space Force : Wings of Honneamise and Freedom on HD DVD , but it also released Honneamise and SOS !
Tokyo Metro Explorers : The Next on Blu-ray Disc and plans Yukikaze on Blu-ray only .
Funimation has been releasing selected Dragon Ball Z movies on Blu-ray , starting with last November 's Broly The Legendary Super Saiyan and Broly the Second Coming .
Under the proposal Harvard would deposit finished papers in an open - access repository run by the library that would instantly make them available on the Internet .
Authors would still retain their copyright and could publish anywhere they pleased  including at a high - priced journal , if the journal would have them .
What distinguishes this plan from current practice , said Stuart Shieber , a professor of computer science who is sponsoring the faculty motion , is that it would create an “ opt - out ” system : an article would be included unless the author specifically requested it not be .
Mr. Shieber was the chairman of a committee set up by Harvard ’s provost to investigate scholarly publishing ; this proposal grew out of one of the recommendations , he said .
The publishing industry , as well as some scholarly groups , have opposed some forms of open access , contending that free distribution of scholarly articles would ultimately eat away at journals ’ value and wreck the existing business model .
Such a development would in turn damage the quality of research , they argue , by allowing articles that have not gone through a rigorous process of peer review to be broadcast on the Internet as easily as a video clip of Britney Spears ’s latest hairdo .
It would also cut into subsidies that some journals provide for educational training and professional meetings , they say .
J. Lorand Matory , a professor of anthropology and African and African American studies at Harvard , said he sympathized with the goal of bringing down the sometimes exorbitant price of scientific periodicals , but worried that a result would be to eliminate a whole range of less popular journals that are subsidized by more profitable ones .
Art history periodicals , for example , are extremely expensive to publish because of the reproduction costs , and subscriptions pay for those as well as some of the discipline ’s annual gatherings .

I ’ve had a couple conversations the past couple weeks about extending test coverage in the user interface and the necessity of writing integrated tests .
One person wished his team were doing more automated testing through the UI ( web app ) , and the other person just assumed that testing the UI ( WinForms ) itself was impossible .
For the sake of this conversation , let ’s say that it is perfectly possible to test the actual user interface .
That leaves us with the question “ is it feasible or even necessary to write automated tests against the UI ? ”
Let ’s broaden the question out to “ how do I know my unit and integration testing is good enough ? ”
Here ’s my simple , but subjective , criteria to knowing if the developer testing approach is sufficient :
Are you getting defects that seem easily preventable ?
Oddball combinations of user interactions and edge cases do n’t count .
If you ’re getting a perfectly manageable rate of defects from the testers , then I ’d say you ’re doing ok .
Unfortunately , my experience is that most of the bugs are related to screen behavior .
I actually write quite a few unit tests purely on screen to presenter wiring .
Going farther , my particular application contains so much screen behavior that I also invest in writing an extensive battery of integration tests between the MVP triad with the rest of the application services stubbed out just to get the interaction of the MVP pieces down .
It ’s turned up a lot of problems and helped stop regression bugs .
That investment would n’t pay itself off on many projects , but it does on mine .
Are you having to use the debugger quite a bit on your own code ?
This might be the key indicator of the effectiveness of your unit testing .
If you ’re still having to use the debugger to any extent , my first thought would be to start making your unit testing more granular .
Good unit tests / specifications keep that debugger collecting dust .
Since I ’d argue that the short term value proposition of doing TDD is to move more time out from the debugging column than you have to move into the unit testing column .
If you ’re still debugging , then TDD is n’t paying off .
I learned this lesson in a hard way when I was doing some of the earlier work on StructureMap .
In later releases I made changes to the architecture just to create more seams for easier unit testing .
Those seams made the feedback loop faster and finer grained so I just really did n’t need my debugger quite so much .
From a comment on programming .reddit.com :
“ The TDD fanboys are swarming to defend their dogma .
From a comment , “ If TDD hurts , it ’s because you ’re doing it wrong ” (!!! ) . ”
Sarcasm aside , this quote is dead on accurate .
Pain is a stimuli .
Pain tells us to stop doing whatever it is we ’re doing for our own good .
If your arm hurts when you bend it that way , stop bending it that way !
If doing TDD on your project hurts , then you ’re definitely doing something that is n’t right for your project .
I have yet to work in a problem domain where I could n’t effectively use TDD for most of the code I wrote , but I ’m sure that that domain is out there .
On the other hand , to make TDD go smoothly you often have to change the way you construct the code and structure responsibilities to take advantage of TDD .
In many cases that change coincides with what I would call good design anyway .
In my experience , code that makes tests difficult or laborious to setup is almost always suffering from tight coupling and low cohesion — problems that you really do n’t want regardless of using TDD .
If you have questioned your design , but still ca n’t get to a point where writing and maintaining the unit tests first is possible , then yeah , ditch TDD because it ’s doing more harm than good .
TDD is merely a means .
Working software is the goal .
If you ’re happy with your results , all ’s well .
Unless your competitors are continuing to get better …
j Query 1.2.3 : AIR , Namespacing , and UI Alpha
Posted on by
We ’re happy to announce a brand new release of jQuery .
This is primarily a bug fix release for jQuery 1.2 .
You can view the full list of what was fixed on the bug tracker .
Downloading
j Query 1.2.3 :
If you wish to checkout the full release from the Subversion repository , you can do so by following the instructions and checking out the source from the following location :
svn co http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.2.3
Important Changes
The primary purpose of this release was to fix a couple outstanding bugs from the jQuery 1.2.2 release .
Specifically , this release is now compatible with Adobe AIR , will be included in Drupal 6 , and will be the base for jQuery UI 1.5 .
Additionally , a couple minor features , for plugin developers , were included in this release .
.data( ) and .removeData ()
These methods complement the , already included , jQuery.data and jQuery.removeData methods introduced in jQuery 1.2 .
The important change , however , is that they ’ve been tailored for plugin developers .
You can now namespace data additions – like you can with event binding / unbinding .
For example :
$ ( " div " ) .data ( " test " , " original " ) ; $ ( " div " ) .data ( " test.plugin " , " new data " ) ; alert ( $ ( " div " ) .data ( " test " ) == " original " ) ; // true alert ( $ ( " div " ) .data ( " test.plugin " ) == " new data " ) ; // true
Additionally , getting or setting data values can be overridden by a plugin .
For example , the following code is from the , recently updated , draggables in jQuery UI :
$ ( element ) .bind ( " setData.draggable " , function ( event , key , value ) { self.options [key ] = value ; }).bind (" getData.draggable " , function ( event , key ) { return self.options [key ] ; } ) ;
The above makes it such that all attempts to get and set draggable - namespaced data will be intercepted and handled by the plugin directly ( rather than being bound directly to the element ) .
The result is a powerful new interface for dealing with internalized data within a plugin .
.unbind (“.namespace ” )
In jQuery 1.2 you could add and remove namespaced events , however you always had to include a name for the type of event being used .
With this addition you can now remove all bound events that match a particular namespace , for example :
$ ( " div " ) .bind ( " click.plugin " , function ( ) {} ) ; $ ( " div " ) .bind ( " mouseover.plugin " , function ( ) {} ) ; $ ( " div " ) .unbind ( " .plugin " ) ; //
All handlers removed
The above removes all bound event handlers that are within the “ plugin ” namespace .
. trigger ( “ click ! ” )
Finally , a new addition was included to allow exclusion of namespaced events from being triggered .
For example :
$ ( " div " ) . bind ( " click " , function ( ) { alert ( " hello " ) ; } ) ; $ ( " div " ) .bind ( " click.plugin " , function ( ) { alert ( " goodbye " ) ; } ) ; $ ( " div " ) . trigger ( " click ! " ) ; // alert ( " hello " ) only
The above only triggers the non-namespaced event handlers .
Alpha Release : j Query UI 1.5 and jQuery Enchant 1.0
Last , but not least , we ’re pleased to announce a new alpha release of jQuery UI .
This is an overhaul of the existing code base with tons of a bug fixes and API tweaks .
We need a ton of help testing this alpha , making sure that it ’ll be rock - solid for the upcoming release candidate .
Please participate in the discussion , helping us to get ready .
Additionally , we ’re working on a new plugin called jQuery Enchant which will bring a ton of advanced effects to the library ( like clip , shake , and explode – to name a few ) .
This is an alpha release of this plugin , as well – so please help us test it and make sure that it ’s completely up to the jQuery level of quality .

Relations between the sexes outside marriage is against the law
The men are accused of wearing indecent clothes , playing loud music and dancing in order to attract the attention of girls , the Saudi Gazette reported .
They were arrested following a request of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice .
The mutaween enforce Saudi Arabia 's conservative brand of Islam , Wahhabism .
Earlier in the month , the authorities enforced a ban on the sale of red roses and other symbols used in many countries to mark Valentine 's Day .
The ban is partly because of the connection with a " pagan Christian holiday " , and also because the festival itself is seen as encouraging relations between the sexes outside marriage , punishable by law in the kingdom .
The Prosecution and Investigation Commission said it had received reports of such " bad " behaviour by 57 young men at a number of shopping centres in the holy city of Mecca , the Saudi Gazette said .
The guardians of some of the men defended their actions , however , saying they would regularly get together at the weekend to have fun without ever violating laws governing the segregation of the sexes , it added .
Cardinal Desmond Connell who yesterday secured an interim injunction restraining Dublin Diocesan Commission of Investigation from examining sex abuse files to decide whether they attract legal privilege or a duty of confidentiality .
THE Catholic hierarchy was plunged into crisis last night as two of the country 's senior prelates clashed over the publication of confidential Church files .
Archbishop of Dublin Cardinal Desmond Connell yesterday secured a temporary injunction preventing a State inquiry from examining files relating to his handling of complaints against paedophile priests .
The unprecedented move could undermine Archbishop Diarmuid Martin 's policy of open access to Church files .
Cardinal Connell ( 81 ) has repeatedly promised victims gardai and a dedicated judicial inquiry would have full access to internal files .
Last night , he was in hospital in Rome after a fall , while a leading Canon lawyer accused him of a " cover-up " .
The legal action by Cardinal Connell centres around files handed over by Archbishop Martin to the Dublin Diocesan Commission of Investigation .
On Wednesday night , Cardinal Connell , who was urged to resign when the Dublin abuse scandal broke six years ago , contacted Archbishop Martin .
It was only then he told him he was launching judicial review proceedings against the commission .
The cardinal , whose lawyers accused the commission of seeking " omnibus discovery " and acting outside its remit , has claimed documents handed to the inquiry by Archbishop Martin are legally privileged .
The files were due to be examined by the commission to ascertain whether they are legally privileged or bound by a duty of confidentiality .
Cardinal Connell insists the legal privilege attaching to the documents belongs to him and can only be waived by him .
The legal action has taken the Church hierarchy , many of whom privately support Cardinal Connell 's stance on internal files , by surprise .
In a statement issued last night , Archbishop Martin said he hoped the legal matters would be dealt with expeditiously so that the commission can conclude its work .
" The overarching aim of all must be that of attaining a more accurate understanding of the truth concerning sexual abuse of children by clergy , " said the former Vatican diplomat , in what is being regarded as support for a full examination of the files .
Cardinal Connell fell during a service in his Titular Church of San Silvestro in Capite .
Meanwhile , leading Canon lawyer Fr Tom Doyle accused the cardinal of " a cover -up " .
Fr Doyle , a Dominican priest who drafted a report 28 years ago on clerical child sex abuse for America 's Catholic bishops , said the assertion of legal privilege by the former Archbishop of Dublin was " wrong " in Canon law .
" The only reason why Cardinal Connell would seek to prevent access to the files is because they contain incriminating evidence , " said Fr Doyle .
" He is attempting to hide behind a legal doctrine .
This is not privileged information .
Archbishop Martin is either pragmatic or convinced of the need to hand over the files so that the truth can be established . "
Clerical sex abuse victims also rounded on the cardinal for reneging on his promise to grant unfettered access to diocesan files .
Marie Collins , who brokered an historic apology from Cardinal Connell six years ago , said she was stunned by the High Court injunction .
" I just can't believe it , " said Ms Collins , who was abused by Fr Paul McGennis , a hospital chaplain , in 1960 when she was aged 13 .
" How many times has the Church promised to co-operate ?
Cardinal Connell promised that he would hand over all the files .
Archbishop Martin must be spitting feathers because he has tried to ensure full access . "
Colm O'Gorman , the former director and founder of abuse support group
One in Four , said the injunction begged the question as to what the cardinal was trying to conceal .
" One would have hoped at this late stage in the process that Cardinal Connell would be prepared to waive any legal privilege , if such privilege exists , in order to get to the truth , " said the now - executive director of Amnesty International .
One in Four said it was " deeply disturbed but sadly not surprised " by the cardinal 's move .
" The cardinal has previously stated that he would co-operate with an investigation , " said advocacy director Deirdre Fitzpatrick .
" He is now attempting to use legal argument to prevent this statutory investigation . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Airport security lines can annoy passengers , but there is no evidence that they make flying any safer , U.S. researchers reported on Thursday .

Airport security lines can annoy passengers , but there is no evidence that they make flying any safer , U.S. researchers reported on Thursday .

A team at the Harvard School of Public Health could not find any studies showing whether the time - consuming process of X - raying carry - on luggage prevents hijackings or attacks .
They also found no evidence to suggest that making passengers take off their shoes and confiscating small items prevented any incidents .
The U.S. Transportation Security Administration told research teams requesting information their need for quick new security measures trumped the usefulness of evaluating them , Eleni Linos , Elizabeth Linos , and Graham Colditz reported in the British Medical Journal .
“ We noticed that new airport screening protocols were implemented immediately after news reports of terror threats , ” they wrote .
“ Even without clear evidence of the accuracy of testing , the Transportation Security Administration defended its measures by reporting that more than 13 million prohibited items were intercepted in one year , ” the researchers added .
“ Most of these illegal items were lighters . ”
The researchers said it would be interesting to apply medical standards to airport security .
Screening programs for illnesses like cancer are usually not broadly instituted unless they have been shown to work .
“ We ’d like airport security screening to be of value .
As passengers and members of the public we ’d like to know the evidence and the reasoning behind these measures , ” Linos said in a telephone interview .
“ Can you hide anything in your shoes that you cannot hide in your underwear ? ” they asked .
TSA spokesman Christopher White said the agency has not had a chance to read the article .
“ If anyone has questions about whether our efforts have been fruitful over the past five years -- come on , ” White said in a telephone interview .
“ While we ca n’t publicize everything that we ’ve done , every event , we can say definitively that our efforts over the last five years have not been for nothing , ” White added .
With $ 5.6 billion spent globally on airport protection each year , the public should be encouraged to query some screening requirements -- such as forcing passengers to remove their shoes , the researchers said .
White said the agency has pictures of shoe bombs on its Web site at ( www.tsa.gov/) and welcomes people to examine them .
" We encourage a legitimate public dialogue .
We want passengers to understand why we do what we do , " he said .

Dr Robinski says it is normal for Polish doctors to work in two places
It is very early on a cold Friday morning and Dr Piotr Robinski 's alarm wakes him from a restless sleep .
He turns off the clock .
It is 0400 local time and he has got a very long day ahead .
Having worked from Monday to Thursday in his Polish surgery , he is already tired .
Six hours later , after a long drive to the airport , Dr Robinski is finally airborne .
" If there will be no cheap flights I could not afford to fly to Scotland ...
But for me it 's just like taking a bus to work now , " he laughs .
Dr Robinski flies to Scotland every other weekend to work for the NHS in Aberdeen .
He says he is only doing the same as most of his contemporaries .
" Doctors in the UK usually only work in one work ... doctors in Poland work in more than one work so it is completely normal for me to take another job somewhere else .
If I [ did n't ] go to Scotland , I would find [ a ] second job here in Poland . "
Shift shortages Doctors in former Eastern Bloc countries , such as Poland , can expect to earn less than the average wage , which is around £ 300 a month .
Dr Robinski can earn the same amount in one shift in the UK .
What 's more , shifts in the evenings and at weekends need filling .
In 2004 , 90 % of GPs ' surgeries opted out of providing out - of - hours care , so health trusts had to begin employing agencies to fill the shifts .
He must be a very tired man and I cannot see how he can give his full attention to patients
Dr Anthony Halperin
Patients ' Association Dr Robinski was recruited by an agency called Cherry Tree Medical , which is based in his hometown of Poznan in central Poland .
This agency provides many of the doctors who work in Grampian in the out - of - hours service covering most of northern Scotland .
We arrive in Aberdeen at 1550 GMT , just long enough to grab half a hamburger and a shower .
By 1800 GMT Dr Robinski is back at work - this time on home visits .
By the end of his shift , Dr Robinski will have been on the go for around 19 hours , but he says he 's not too tired to work .
" My journey takes around 12 hours , sometimes less , and when I get to Aberdeen I take only a few hours of work .. then I go to bed and when I wake up in the morning I am not tired . "
We showed pictures of Dr Robinski at the end of his shift to Dr Anthony Halperin , who chairs the Patients ' Association .
" He must be a very tired man and I can not see how he can give his full attention to patients after that amount of travelling , " he said .
Tiredness
So who is responsible for making sure Dr Robinski is not too tired to work ?
Alistair Stevenson runs Cherry Tree Medical .
He has 40 doctors on the books , including Dr Robinski .
" We instruct them to keep their hours down in Poland so they are well rested but it's their responsibility - but in practice its hard to police "
Dr Robinski says he will probably stop commuting when he is older NHS Grampian , which contracts Cherry Tree Medical to provide the doctors , says it is responsible for the doctor only once he starts his shift pattern .
The British Medical Association ( BMA ) says the individual doctor should be fit for work , but that the buck stops with the NHS .
" The more complex the system becomes the more chance there is that something will fall through the net , " says Dr Hamish Meldrum , chairman of the BMA .
As for Dr Robinski , he 's doing what he can to provide for his family while he is young .
" I 'm not sure that when I get older and older whether I shall have so much fun in travelling to another place all the time .
Maybe I 'll just stay here in Poland , " he says .
Ironically , British GPs say they opted out of providing out - of - hours care because they were too tired .
Now it looks like many out - of - hours doctors from overseas are also risking the same symptoms as they commute from the other side of Europe .
Rachel Wright 's report is on BBC2's Newsnight at 2230 GMT on Tuesday , 15 January .

Jean -Baptiste Elissalde returns after injury at scrum - half for France
Date : Saturday , 15 March
Kick - off : 1700 GMT
Venue : Millennium Stadium , Cardiff
BBC Coverage : Live on BBC One , BBC Sport website ( UK users only ) , Radio Wales and Radio Cymru
France coach Marc Lievremont has made six changes to his side to face Wales in Saturday 's RBS Six Nations decider .
Scrum - half Jean - Baptiste Elissalde and David Skrela replace Dimitri Yachvili and François Trinh - Duc at half - back from last week 's 25 - 13 win over Italy .
Vincent Clerc gets the nod on the wing from Aurelien Rougerie , while Damien Traille takes over at inside centre .
In the pack Julien Bonnaire and Thierry Dusautoir return to add strength and experience to the back - row .
Toulouse star Cedric Heymans was expected to return to the starting XV after being rested for the Italy game , but he cannot oust Anthony Floch at full - back and must settle for a place among the replacements .
606 : DEBATE
Yachvili and Trinh - Duc are also on the bench as Lievremont opts for a more solid kicking game from his starting half - backs .
Lievremont keeps the same front five that started against the powerful Italy scrummage , but had been expected to change his entire back row .
Montpellier youngster Fulgence Ouedraogo was expected to drop to the bench but he is retained .
That means Elvis Vermeulen - recalled to the squad after being sidelined with broken ribs since the opening win over Scotland - is named as a replacement .
Clermont - Auvergne number eight Vermeulen scored the last - gasp try that sealed the title for France , on points difference over Ireland , in the final game of last season 's Six Nations .
Centre Yann David , who started at outside centre against Italy , drops out of the squad , with Yannick Jauzion taking the 13 shirt to accommodate Traille 's return .
Rougerie , scrum - half Julien Tomas , flanker Ibrahim Diarra , number eight Louis Picamoles and Guilhem Guirado were also omitted from the match - day 22 .
To deprive Wales of the Grand Slam and win by 20 points will be difficult
France coach Marc Lievremont
" Wales are a tough assignment and we needed players that already know and understand our system so can work at fine - tuning our tactics in the short time that is left for us , " said Lievremont .
Les Bleus will retain their Six Nations crown if they beat Wales by 20 points , or by 19 points but with more tries than their opponents , with both teams currently tied on 11 tries overall .
Lievremont admitted France would need to get the basics right before they could even contemplate chasing a winning margin against Wales , unbeaten so far in this Six Nations .
" First we need to match the Welsh and we need to play our own rugby , " he said .
" There is a big points gap and to deprive them of the Grand Slam and win by 20 points will be difficult . "
France have beaten Scotland , Ireland and Italy so far this tournament , with their only defeat coming at home to England .
France : Anthony Floch ( Clermont ) ; Vincent Clerc ( Toulouse ) , Yannick Jauzion ( Toulouse ) , Damien Traille ( Biarritz ) , Julien Malzieu ( Clermont ) ; David Skrela ( Stade Français ) , Jean - Baptiste Elissalde ( Toulouse ) ; Fabien Barcella ( Auch ) , Dimitri Szarzewski ( Stade Français ) , Nicolas Mas ( Perpignan ) , Lionel Nallet ( Castres , capt ) , Jerome Thion ( Biarritz ) , Thierry Dusautoir ( Toulouse ) , Fulgence Ouedraogo ( Montpellier ) , Julien Bonnaire ( Clermont ) .
Replacements : William Servat Toulouse ) , Jean - Baptiste Poux ( Toulouse ) , Arnaud Mela ( Albi ) , Elvis Vermeulen ( Clermont ) , Dimitri Yachvili ( Biarritz ) , Francois Trinh - Duc ( Montpellier ) , Cedric Heymans ( Toulouse ) .
Starting with a fragmentary understanding of ocaml I build an ocaml version of the division algebras .
I keep the Scheme pattern where an algebra is a value bound to an identifier but in OCaml such values are called ‘ modules ’ , are static and completed upon compilation .
The mathematical ideas are in the Scheme development and not here .
An algebra is roughly what an ocaml ‘ module ’ is for .
Module names ( as in “ Xx ” from “ module Xx = struct end ; ; ” ) are in a special static space however .
The Scheme version creates the new types dynamically whereas Ocaml can create them only at compile time but that is not a practical problem in the case at hand .
I would like to see other applications of the Ocaml functor .
I try to do reals as reals from the division algebras .

According to a recent U.S. Department of Energy study , there is so much excess energy on the U.S. grid nightly that if every light - duty car and truck in America today used plug - in hybrid technology , 73 percent of them could be plugged in and “ fueled ” without constructing a single new power plant .
So much for the myth that electric vehicles will cause more emissions .
The Portland Press has a great article on the potential benefits of harnessing this excess energy and making the switch to plug - in vehicles .
Apparently , each night there is a large amount of renewable power generation capacity that sits idle .
Tapping into this source by plugging in our vehicles at night would harness a vastly unused portion of the U.S. grid .
From the article ,
“ Studies have shown that plug - in hybrids produce at least 67 percent fewer harmful emissions than a standard gasoline - powered car .
Even when accounting for emissions from the production of electricity , national studies have shown greenhouse gas production would fall by almost 40 percent if plug - in hybrids became commonplace .
Plug - in hybrids could easily be expected to get over 100 miles per gallon of gasoline , and owners would do most of their refueling at home where the equivalent cost of electricity is about $ 1 per gallon . ”
The most interesting thing about this revelation is that the infrastructure is already there .
We do n’t have to worry about supporting plug - in vehicles with refueling stations or special sources of energy .
Every home is a source of fuel .
The grid is more than happy to accommodate the extra load .
Seems like a pretty good way to reduce oil consumption , drop emissions , and save a buck .
KAPUT …. Adam Liptak has a story worth reading in the New York Times today .
Here ’s how it starts :
Steve Marshall is an English travel agent .
He lives in Spain , and he sells trips to Europeans who want to go to sunny places , including Cuba .
In October , about 80 of his Web sites stopped working , thanks to the United States government . ….
“ I came to work in the morning , and we had no reservations at all , ” Mr. Marshall said on the phone from the Canary Islands .
“ We thought it was a technical problem . ”
It turned out , though , that Mr. Marshall ’s Web sites had been put on a Treasury Department blacklist and , as a consequence , his American domain name registrar , eNom Inc. , had disabled them .
Mr. Marshall said eNom told him it did so after a call from the Treasury Department ; the company , based in Bellevue , Wash . , says it learned that the sites were on the blacklist through a blog .

The death of a Polish man at Vancouver International Airport has sparked an intense debate in Canada over the increasing use of Tasers by law - enforcement officials .
Concerns over the use of these electric shock guns has mounted in several other countries after a UN Committee on Human Rights recently labeled their impact " torture . "
Nine investigations , including one by the Polish government , have opened into the death of Robert Dziekanski , a Polish national who died Oct. 14 almost immediately after he was Tasered by Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RMCP ) at the Vancouver International Airport , reports CanWest News Service .
Polish officials said the aim of their inquiry was to verify whether Canadian police " involuntarily caused the death of a Polish citizen . "
Criticism of the incident rose after a video of the incident was posted on YouTube Nov. 14 , reports the New Statesman .
The clean - cut stereotype of a Mountie in a tomato - red uniform may linger internationally , but the RCMP 's domestic reputation has been shaken .
The officers captured on film have been removed from active duty ; others replacing them at the Vancouver airport have been verbally abused and had rubbish thrown at them .
On the Saturday after the video's release , nearly 300 people arrived at the airport for a memorial service for Dziekanski .
The incident led to one senator calling for Canadian police to stop using Tasers , while police officials defended their actions , reports The Canadian Press .
Officials claim the electric shock guns , which emit up to 50,000 volts , are not the cause of death in such deadly incidents .
A conference last week focused on such factors as " excited delirium , " reports The Globe and Mail .
However , the key issue is excited delirium , a collection of symptoms that is quickly becoming the leading explanation offered when a person dies in police custody or after a taser is used ….
Critics , who include civil - liberties groups and plaintiffs in myriad lawsuits against both Taser International and police departments , say the condition is actually a vague collection of descriptors designed to protect police officers from allegations of wrongdoing .
But there are virtually no such critics at this conference ….
Civil liberties activists are pointing to a report by the UN Committee Against Torture last week that called the use of Tasers " torture . "
The committee said it was " worried that the use of TaserX26 weapons , provoking extreme pain , constituted a form of torture , and that in certain cases it could also cause death , as shown by several reliable studies and by certain cases that had happened after practical use . "
The UN report provoked reaction in Australia , where Queensland police defended their trial use , reports The Brisbane Times .
Officials there said Tasers had been used in 93 incidents since the trial period began in July , and their use " was to resolve dangerous situations without injury . "
In New Zealand , where a one - year trial of one model of the weapon has just ended , the Green Party urged the New Zealand Superannuation Fund to withdraw the $ NZ780,000 ( about $ 594,000 ) invested in the American firm , Taser International , Radio New Zealand reported .
Taser International officals dismissed the UN comments , suggesting that the committee was " ' out of touch ' with the realities facing law enforcement agents , " reports Australian news channel ABC .
Taser has cited research that shows that the electric - shock weapons are safe .
Amnesty International , however , recently called for a suspension of Taser use pending further study , and a commitment to greater training of law - enforcement officers .
The organization 's report cites increases in Taser - related deaths , and says that Tasers continue to be used in the US as a routine force tool rather than as weapon of last resort .
According to Amnesty , more than 150 people have died in the US after being struck by Tasers since June 2001 .
In 23 cases , coroners listed the use of the Taser as a cause or contributing factor .
More than 11,000 agencies in the US deploy TASER brand technology .
Some 3,500 of these agencies give Tasers to all their patrol officers , according to the company .
In France , President Nicolas Sarkozy vowed before his election in May to buy a Taser for every policeman and gendarme in France , a market for at least 300,000 guns , reports Agence France - Presse .
There are already about 250,000 of the stun guns in use , mainly in North America , but about 70 other countries are buying or trying Tasers -- including Australia , Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Australia , Singapore and New Zealand , said [ Taser representative Antoine ] di Zazzo .
In Britain , where beat cops do n't have guns , home secretary Jacqui Smith has said that all police should have Tasers , and the weapons were " more effective for subduing suspects and caused less harm than traditional batons , " reports The Telegraph .
Mrs Smith told Police Review magazine that she " could see a day " when all officers were armed with stun guns .
" If police officers could be prevented from injury because they are able to subdue someone more quickly than with other methods , then it would be viable , " she said .
The Police Federation , which represents rank - and - file officers in England and Wales , has called for all officers to be equipped with stun guns .
Use of Tasers in Britain has risen since 2003 , according to a report in the online magazine of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers .
Smokers would have to get a licence to light up under the plan
No one would be able to buy cigarettes without the permit , under the idea proposed by Health England .
Its chairman , Professor Julian Le Grand , told BBC Radio 5
Live the scheme would make a big difference to the number of people giving up smoking .
But smokers ' rights group Forest described the idea as " outrageous " , given how much tax smokers already pay .
Professor Le Grand , a former adviser to ex-PM Tony Blair , said cash raised by the proposed scheme would go to the NHS .
He said it was the inconvenience of getting a permit - as much as the cost - that would deter people from persisting with the smoking habit .
" You 've got to get a form , a complex form - the government 's good at complex forms ; you have got to get a photograph .
" It 's a little bit of a problem to actually do it , so you have got to make a conscious decision every year to opt in to being a smoker . "
' Extra bureaucracy '
He added : " 70 % of smokers actually want to stop smoking .
" So if you just make it that little bit more difficult for them to actually re-start or even to start in the first place , yes I think it will make a big difference . "
But Forest said it would be " an extra form of taxation , while tobacco taxation is already at record levels " .
Forest spokesman Simon Clark said that when the cost of administration , extra bureaucracy and enforcement are taken into account , " the mind boggles " .
He added that the people most affected by the proposals would be " the elderly and people on low incomes " .
Mr Clark added : " The senior government advisor putting this idea forward is not only adding to the red tape and bureaucracy we already have in this country .
" He is openly bragging that he wants to make the form as complex as possible to fill in . "
A department of health spokeswoman did not rule out such a scheme as part of the next wave of tobacco regulation .
She said : " We will be consulting later this year on the next steps on tobacco control .
" Ministers are seeking input from a whole range of stakeholders . "
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Obesity can double the risk of several cancers , according to a study published on Friday that for the first time also links being overweight with a number of less common forms of the disease .

The analysis of 144 published studies incorporating some 282,000 men and women also showed that gender can make a difference in the relationship between obesity and some cancers , the researchers reported in the Lancet medical journal .
The findings come after a major report from the World Research Cancer Fund in October showed that excess body fat was likely to cause some cancers , said Andrew Renehan , a cancer specialist at the University of Manchester , who led the study .
“ This study has extended that further and reported specifically on 20 different types of cancer , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ We showed an association with less common cancers that had not been shown before . ”
These included blood cancers such as adult leukemia , multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin ’s lymphoma for both men and women , he said .
Obesity is a major issue worldwide and also raises the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart problems .
The World Health Organisation classifies around 400 million people as obese .
Renehan and his colleagues looked at what happened to people whose body mass index ( BMI ) increased from the normal range to overweight or from overweight to obese .
BMI is a calculation of height to weight , and the normal range is usually considered to be 18 to 25 , with more than 25 overweight and above 30 obese .
For men , the risk of thyroid cancer rose by a third and went up 24 percent for colon and kidney cancers , the researchers said .
In women who went from normal to overweight , the risk of gall bladder cancer rose 59 percent and kidney cancer went up 34 percent .
“ Increased BMI is associated with increased risk of common and less common malignancies , ” the researchers wrote .
“ For some cancer types , associations differed between sexes and populations of different ethnic origins . ”
The association of cancer and obesity was largely similar across Asia , Europe and North America , though the link between higher body mass index and breast cancer was higher in Asia , the researchers said .
There were also strong differences between men and women for cancers like bowel and kidney cancers .
Knowing this kind of information could help scientists focus research on what is exactly causing some of these cancers , Renehan said .
“ We suspect there are differences in changes in hormones due to the amount of fat cells in our body , and whether a person is a man or a woman , ” he said .

High Resolution Imaging in the Visible with Faint Reference Stars on Large Ground - Based Telescopes .
Abstract : A research paper has now been published which describes how to combine Lucky Imaging with low - order AO using very faint reference stars , demonstrating a radically new approach to measuring low - order wavefront errors .
After correcting for these errors , signifcant mprovements can be delivered in image resolution in the visible on telescopes in the 2.5 – 8.2 m range on good astronomical sites .
As a minimum the angular resolution may be improved by a factor of 2.5 –3 under almost any conditions and , with further correction and image selection , even sharper images may be obtained routinely .
Many of the assumptions about what may be achieved with faint reference stars has been re-examined to achieve this performance .
The paper showed how a new design of wavefront curvature sensor combined with novel wavefront - ftting routines allow this performance to become routine .
Simulations over a wide range of conditions match the performance already achieved in runs with earlier versions of the hardware described .
In order to use faint reference sources in astronomy it is important to have an approach to wavefront detection and characterization that is ﬂexible and continues to work stably even under conditions of very low light from the reference object .
The key way to handle that is to limit the number of Zernike terms that are corrected .
Most of the power in atmospheric turbulence
is in the lowest orders and so the greatest improvement is achieved by correcting for those low orders .
Correcting for too many orders simply adds noise and worsens performance .
Combining the right approach to wavefront correction with lucky imaging ( described below ) allows a trade - off between the very sharpest images achieved with a small percentage selection or a slightly less good image profle but with much higher signal - to - noise ( see figure below ) .
Figure : Typical simulation results for a 4.2 m telescope looking at a high - density star feld modelled on Baade ’s window with around 600 stars brighter than I ~25 in each feld of about 4.2 x 8.3 arcsecs .
The pixel scale here is ~ 45 milliarcsec .
It assumes 0.6 as seeing and 10 Zernike terms have been corrected .
The core resolution obtained is of the order of 45 mas and is more than twice that of the Hubble Space Telescope .
These are characteristic of the appearance of lucky plus low - order adaptive optics images .
The central near - diﬀraction limited core is surrounded by a diﬀuse halo
signifcantly narrower than the natural seeing .

GravityCam : Project Summary .
Abstract : GravityCam will allow wide - field visible surveys at high angular resolution and high time resolution for the first time .
It will detect large numbers of Earth - mass exoplanets as well as an exceptionally sensitive survey for Kuiper belt and Oort cloud objects .
It will also allow detections of bright pulses of light across wide fields of view .
GravityCam is an entirely new instrument designed to image large areas of the sky in the visible with angular resolution much better than normally possible with ground - based instruments .
It does this by taking images at high - speed , typically 25 Hz .
Each image is then shifted and added to give the output image .
This technique , known as Lucky Imaging , improves the resolution by a factor of 2.5 - 3 over that normally obtained from the ground .
Even higher resolution comes from post - processing .
​
GravityCam will detect planets that are virtually undetectable by other methods .
This figure shows the planets detected to date where we see that for planets of Earth - mass and below detections are very few though we expect there are vast numbers of them .
There are a number of scientific programs that GravityCam is particularly well - suited to .
The detection of planets the mass of the Earth and below is extremely difficult by normal radial velocity or transit methods .
GravityCam will allow up to 90 million stars in the bulge of the Galaxy to be tracked night after night looking for gravitational microlensing events .
Gravitational microlensing profile showing planet detection .
On the right are simulated profiles for an Earth - mass planet ( blue line ) and a moon - mass object ( red line ) .
Should the lensing star have a planet in orbit around it , the microlensing brightness profile is affected allowing the mass , diameter and distance of planet from the lensing star to be determined .
We predict we will detect several thousand new microlensing events over the six - month period when the bulge of the galaxy is in the sky , and expect to detect very many low mass planets in the region of 0.3–3 AU .
The sensitivity allows planets down to the mass of the moon to be detected .
Other programs use the capacity of GravityCam to build statistics on the fluctuations of each and every star in the field .
Microlensing events are selected by abnormal brightening characteristics .
They are then followed accurately for many weeks .
We will simultaneously survey for Kuiper belt and Oort cloud objects with great efficiency .
We will see stars blink off and on again for very short periods of time .
The length of the occultation indicates the size of the object .
If the occultation produces only a 20 % reduction in brightness then we know that the occultation duration was only 20 % of the frame rate or 8 ms .
These data are produced in parallel during the above microlensing survey .
The total number of star - hours of observations searching for such objects is around 1 million at present .
Within six months we expect to have approximately 100 billion star - hours and so should be able to detect very large numbers of Kuiper belt and Oort cloud objects .
Good statistical coverage of the incidence and size spectrum of such objects is key for assessing the risks of interstellar travel .
The high time resolution of GravityCam also allows parallel surveys of the sky for bright optical flashes , such as those from lasers .
The brightness produced by phased laser arrays can be extremely high and GravityCam has the capacity to detect those .
The high frame rate allows detection of pulses with high signal - to - noise even on at very great distances .
The high angular resolution means that GravityCam has application in many other imaging areas such as the detection of dark matter by the distortions of Galaxy shapes at high redshift .
GravityCam would use the New Technology Telescope 3.6 m ESO telescope on La Silla in Chile .
This is a high - performance telescope well - suited to mounting a wide area detector array in the Naysmith focal plane .
The instrument will include an atmospheric dispersion corrector to maintain angular resolution when observing well away from the zenith .
The instrument will use wide area CMOS imaging detectors with very high quantum efficiency and low read - out noise .
These are currently under development by E2V Teledyne .
They are the manufacturers of most of the visible detectors for projects such as Hubble , Gaia , the LSST and the dark energy survey .
The instrument will produce ~ 500 TB of data per night .
Real time processing reduces that data rate dramatically .
The technical challenges of building GravityCam are not particularly severe .
The detector manufacturer will probably build the main camera cryostat .
Much of the effort will be focused on software development to make an efficient and reliable data pipeline .
Our estimates are that the total project might cost in the region of $ 20 million including operations for two years after the end of commissioning .
It should take about 2.5 - 3 years to substantially complete and begin to take data .
In order to take GravityCam forward , the next step is to undertake a Phase A study to develop a more detailed and properly costed plan for the instrument .
That study should be completed in about 6 - 9 months and we estimate that it will cost about $ 200,000 .
The main costs here are travel to Chile and to ESO headquarters in Germany , outline design and costing of the optical components plus a relatively detailed plan for the software development .
The software structure must allow easy reconfiguration for a variety of future programs .
Both optical and software design would be done by well - qualified consultants .
GravityCam is a project between the Institute of Astronomy of the University of Cambridge , UK , the Open University STEM Faculty with Colin Snodgrass , the Centre for Electronic Imaging under Prof Andrew Holland , and the University of St Andrews under Dr Martin Dominik .
There is a slightly more detailed account of this project here , plus a copy of the full published paper here .
AOLI : Adaptive Optics Lucky Imager .
AOLI is an Instrument for near - diffraction limited imaging in the visible on ground - based telescopes .
The technique has already been demonstrated on the Palomar 5 m , giving 35 mas resolution in I - band ( > 3 times Hubble ) .
Our goal is to provide this performance with close to all - sky coverage , using faint reference stars ( I ~ 17 - 18 ) and reaching science targets as faint as Hubble .
AOLI achieves these faint reference star limits by using a novel low - order curvature wavefront sensor with photon - counting EMCCD detectors .
We have just completed our second commissioning run on the WHT which was very successful in that virtually all aspects of the instrument performed as intended .
However , exceptionally poor observing conditions ( seeing often worse than 3 - 4 arcseconds with high humidity and little sky time ) greatly limited the amount of data taken .
Nevertheless valuable experience was gained and the prospects are excellent for using AOLI for science measurements in a later semester .
About Lucky Imaging
Lucky Imaging is a remarkably effective technique for delivering near - diffraction - limited imaging on ground - based telescopes .
The basic principle is that the atmospheric turbulence that normally limits the resolution of ground - based observations is a statistical process .
If images are taken fast enough to freeze the motion caused by the turbulence we find that a significant number of frames are very sharp indeed where the statistical fluctuations are minimal .
By combining these sharp images we can produce a much better one than is normally possible from the ground .
We have routinely taken Hubble resolution images ( 0.15 arcsec resolution ) on the Hubble sized telescope is ( ~ 2.5 m ) .
More recently we have used the same techniques behind a low order adaptive optics system in order to give even higher resolution on telescopes that are too big to have a significant chance of conventional lucky imaging without adaptive optics assistance .
Lucky imaging is not a new idea .
The name " Lucky Imaging " came from Fried ( 1978 ) though the first calculations of the Lucky Imaging probabilities were first carried out by Hufnagel in 1966 ( see reference pages ( click here ) for copies of the Hufnagel papers that are otherwise difficult to find ) and these principles have been used really quite extensively by the amateur astronomy community who have been able to take very high quality images of bright objects such as Mars and the other planets .
There is more information about Amateur Lucky Imaging here ..
Recent Publications
A recent paper by Craig Mackay looks at ways in which the overall efficiency of Lucky Imaging might be improved .
One of its perceived disadvantages is that it does require that are relatively large percentage of the images recorded are discarded .
By changing the lucky image selection criteria to do some of the selection in the Fourier plane much higher selection percentages may be used .
The paper will be published soon in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and is entitled " High - Efficiency Lucky Imaging " .
The abstract of the paper is as follows :
" Lucky Imaging is now an established observing procedure that delivers near diffraction - limited images in the visible on ground - based telescopes up to ~ 2.5 m in diameter .
Combined with low order adaptive optics it can deliver resolution several times better than that of the Hubble Space Telescope .
Many images are taken at high speed as atmospheric turbulent effects appear static on these short timescales .
The sharpest images are selected , shifted and added to give a much higher resolution than is normally possible in ground - based long exposure time observations .
The method is relatively inefficient as a significant fraction of the frames are discarded because of their relatively poor quality .
This paper shows that a new Lucky Imaging processing method involving selection in Fourier space can substantially improve the selection percentages .
The results show that high resolution images with a large isoplanatic patch size may be obtained routinely both with conventional Lucky Imaging and with the new Lucky Fourier method .
Other methods of improving the sensitivity of the method to faint reference stars are also described . "
A copy of the paper may be found here .
A second paper has recently been published by Peter Aisher et al. , that looks at various strategies that may be used in fitting wavefronts when multiple near - pupil plane images have been recorded .
The abstract is as follows :
" Increasing interest in astronomical applications of non-linear curvature wavefront sensors for turbulence detection and correction makes it important to understand how best to handle the data they produce , particularly at low light levels .
Algorithms for wavefront phase retrieval from a four - plane CWFS are developed and compared , with a view to their use for loworder phase compensation in instruments combining adaptive optics and Lucky Imaging .
The convergence speed and quality of iterative algorithms is compared to their step - size , and techniques for phase retrieval at low photon counts are explored .
Computer simulations show that at low light levels , preprocessing by convolution of the measured signal with a Gaussian function can reduce by an order of magnitude the photon flux required for accurate phase retrieval of low - order errors .
This facilitates wavefront correction on large telescopes with very faint reference stars . "

AOLI : Adaptive Optics Lucky Imager for the WHT 4.2 M and GTC 10.5 Meter Telescopes
AOLI
Is a major collaboration between the University of Cambridge , Institute of Astronomy , the IAC in La Laguna , Tenerife , the ING in La Palma and the Universities of Cartegena and Cologne .
The acronym AOLI stands for “ Adaptive Optics Lucky Imager ” .
This project aims at building a camera able to deliver diffraction limited images in the visible range .
This instrument is first designed for the 4.2 - m William Herschel Telescope , in the island of La Palma ( Canary Islands ) , but later intended for use on the 10.4 - m Gran Telescopio de Canarias ( GTC ) .
Obtaining optical diffraction limited images is almost impossible to achieve from the ground because of the lack of efficient adaptive - optics systems for wavelength below 1.2 -1.6 microns .
The atmospheric turbulence rapidly degrades the wavefronts entering the telescope , which results in seeing - limited images with no spatial information below 0.8 - 1 ” resolution .
Until recently , optical diffraction - limited images were only delivered by the Hubble Space Telescope
By combining Lucky Imaging techniques with low order adaptive optics it is possible to obtain diffraction limited images in the visible on ground - based telescopes .
AOLI is intended to give a resolution of approximately 3 times that of the Hubble Space Telescope from the ground on the WHT 4.2 m telescope and approximately 8 times that Of the Hubble Space Telescope on the 10.5 m GTC telescope
Observing and Results
A recent observing trip ( July 2007 ) to the Palomar 200 inch telescope has been extremely successful .
The images we obtained are the highest resolution direct images , about 35 milliarcsec FWHM , ever obtained either from the ground or from space in the visible at about twice the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope .
M13
Images shown below are of the core of globular cluster M 13 .
The blinking image shows what the telescope delivers on its own , followed by what it delivers with the adaptive optic system and LuckyCam .
The images below show a direct comparison between the conventional image taken under conditions of good seeing ( 0.65 arcsec ) , the Hubble image from the ACS ( centre ) and our Lucky / AO image ( right ) .
The Hubble picture goes fainter because the exposure is longer and the wavelength shorter ( where CCDs have a much higher sensitivity ) .
The ACS image has been " drizzled " to improve its appearance .
The Lucky image is as taken .
The markedly better resolution of the Lucky image is clear .
This is exactly what is predicted purely because the Palomar 5.1 m telescope is twice the size of the 2.5 m Hubble .
Cat 's Eye Nebula ( NGC 6543 )
A planetary nebula is formed when the central star evolves from a red giant to its final white dwarf phase .
A relatively short time in the life of the star , possibly 10,000 years in total , gas is ejected from the surface of the dying star .
We can look at the expansion velocity of these filaments and sure that the age of the bright inner shells is probably only about 1000 years .
The nebula is about 3000 light years from Earth .
The image below shows the Cat ’s Eye Nebula ( NGC 6543 ) as imaged conventionally by the Palomar 200 inch telescope .
The green light is oxygen emission , the red is hydrogen emission , and the blue is near - infrared radiation , again followed by the Cat ’s Eye Nebula ( NGC7543 ) as imaged with the Lucky Camera behind an adaptive optics system on the Palomar 200 inch telescope .
The resolution in the Lucky image is lower than Hubble as the image covers four times the area of the M13 images above , but it is still a good demonstration of what can be done from the ground .
These images are all slightly lower resolution than those of the globular cluster but nevertheless show the considerable improvement over conventional ground - based imaging that the AO system produces with LuckyCam .

I ’ve learned as this market continues to unwind that many proposals issued out by our government carry a lot more bark and have very little bite .
Yet there are some proposals that flat out irritate me because they strike at the core of what is ethical and are diametrically opposed to what any sane capitalist system would stand for .
What makes many of these proposals worse is that the corporate sector has been calling for hands off approaches from the government during the boom times but now that the inevitable correction is occurring , they want handouts as if they were walking up to a shelter asking for a golden cot .
The market in the last few days has witnessed a much needed cleansing .
Think about the monoline insurers and the back and forth bailout talk that lasted for a few months .
Initially , it was thought that $ 10 to $ 15 billion would be enough to bailout these insurers but the reality is that the counterparty risk is much more profound and losses can range in the hundreds of billions .
How insane is this ?
How can a company be rated AAA and be asking for a bailout ?
Welcome to the Orwellian world of our current economic situation .
The systemic problem is n’t going to be solved by lowering Fed rates or handing out Wal - Mart vouchers to people so they can go spend on useless imported trinkets .
Trinkets that in fact got us into this problem in the first place !
Now the prospect of tighter credit is sending people running around like a chicken with its head cutoff .
You should not create policy because of panic or negotiate out of desperation .
I am actually very disappointed in the way our political leaders of both parties are handling this situation .
Think of some of the stupidity going on and the mixed messages that are being sent out .
You have some of the most idiotic grandstanding going on in the history of US economics .
Take a look at this from way atop the food chain :
“ We ’re at the very early stages of discussion , ” Bush said .
“ Anything that would be submitted to Congress … would have to be revenue - neutral . ”
A Treasury Department study , released earlier this year , showed the federal corporate tax rate could be cut from 35 percent to 27 percent with the same amount of revenue collected if a number of corporate tax breaks were eliminated , thereby broadening the tax base .
However , such a move would likely trigger a firestorm of protest as various groups would seek to protect popular tax breaks such as the research and development credit .
“ What we ’d really be talking about is a simplification of a very complex tax code that might be able to lower rates , ” the president explained .
“ However , I would readily concede to you that this is a difficult issue . ”
How in this green planet is dishing out a $ 150 billion stimulus package revenue neutral ?
The above statement was said in August of 2007 right when the credit crunch was in its infancy .
Even then , they were discussing lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 27 percent .
You mean you want to give tax break to all those companies on Wall Street that fleeced the American public during this housing bubble ?
I ’m sure that is a fantastic way to get the economy going .
Of course this revenue - neutral idea is coming from an administration that is invested in an extremely costly war yet at the same time , wants to lower taxes further and further .
Apparently the rules of economics stop at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
You would think that at a certain point , some people would be getting it but apparently they are not .
I ’m sure many of you realize that subprime mortgages make very little financial sense and that we ’d be in much better shape without them .
This is obvious .
No money down and jumbo loans for those with little income should realistically be renting a place or purchasing a lower priced home .
But guess what ?
The government through the FHA , which has a mission toward affordable housing is now talking like one of the 230 + defunct subprime lenders !
Take a look at another idiotic proposal that was on CNN today :
“ NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) —
By early April , both chambers of Congress are likely to tie the bow on a bill that would expand the reach of the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) , which aims to provide safe loan alternatives to subprime mortgages and make homeownership more accessible .
The FHA program is intended for mortgage borrowers with weak credit or little or no cash who may not be able to get an affordable mortgage elsewhere .
Permanently raise loan limits .
The economic stimulus bill passed in February temporarily increased the limit on loans eligible to be FHA - insured .
The ceiling until Dec. 31 , 2008 is now $ 729,750 , up from the normal $ 362,790 for single - family homes .
Those are the ceilings for high - cost areas .
The ceiling is lower in low - cost housing markets .
Reduce down payment requirements .
Homeowners would no longer be required to have 3 % equity or the cash equivalent to get an FHA - insured loan .
The House bill would allow borrowers to get an FHA - insured loan with 0 % down if they can show they can afford the mortgage payments .
The Senate bill requires 1.5 % .
Make it easier for borrowers in high - cost loans to refinance .
The House bill would let some homeowners in default or at risk of default refinance into an FHA - insured loan . ”
Holy crap !
Are you kidding me ?
The FHA is intended for mortgage borrowers with weak credit or little or no cash ?
They flat out sound like a 1:00 PM mortgage ad that we would see in between Judge Judy and Maury Povich .
After reading the above proposed lunancy I went straight to HUD to see what their mission stated on their website :
“ The mission of the Office of Housing is to :
– Contribute to building and preserving healthy neighborhoods and communities ;
– Maintain and expand homeownership , rental housing and healthcare opportunities ;
– Stabilize credit markets in times of economic disruption ;
– Operate with a high degree of public and fiscal accountability ; and
– Recognize and value its customers , staff , constituents and partners . ”
How from this mission they derive the mandate to raise caps in high priced areas to $ 729,750 is beyond me .
If you look at the three new major items proposed they are even considering doing 0 % down loans !
What in the world ?
The last item is flat out hallucinogenic .
How are they going to let those that are already in default refinance into an FHA mortgage ?
We already know that FHA loans are amortized over 30 years with principal and interest and by looking at the data on recent foreclosures , most people are unable to afford their payments because the price of the house was too high !
It has little to do with the mortgage .
Yes , we have our absurd subprime loans that reset but we are now seeing option ARM mortgages to prime borrowers go in to default even before they recast .
And the teaser rate is surely much lower than a fully amortized 30 year mortgage that would be offered by the government .
What the above proposal does is converts the government as a subprime insurer .
Why worry about Ambac or MBIA when our government is going to be pushing out subprime loans .
I love that “ show they can afford their payments ” caveat .
Well if they can afford their payments , then it should n’t be a problem for them to save up 10 percent for a down payment .
Such knee jerk reactions are only adding fuel to the flame .
None of our politicians have the guts to tell people that speculated or paid way too much for a home this :
“ You made a choice .
A conscious free market choice .
No one forced you to sign on the dotted line .
We do sympathize for those that lost their job and are no longer able to make their house payments .
But those of you who bought in high priced areas such as California and Florida tough .
That was a decision brought on by your own free will .
The government will not step in to help you , the lenders , or Wall Street for irresponsible lending .
See , this would encourage and reward future behavior that will once again lead us into the same predicament .
Many of you have the option of renting and this may be a more prudent economical choice for you and your family .
Homeownership is not a right .
It is an earned privilege gained by saving and managing finances wisely .
Should you wish to own in the future you can take the appropriate steps to save and purchase a home when economically it makes more sense without risky financing . ”
This may seem a bit harsh but owning a home is n’t a right .
You earn it .
This is something that is completely in your own control .
This is n’t healthcare where unfortunately sometimes you do not have the choice of becoming ill .
I ’m sure many of you can delineate between unforeseen circumstances and flat out decisions that are entered upon by your own free will .
Why is housing more of a privileged then say , owning a Ferrari ?
Why should n’t we go out and bailout those that bought high priced cars and are having trouble paying them ?
Many of you may disagree that we have yet to see any bailout .
Well I will direct you to the massive loan Countrywide receieved from the Federal Home Loan Bank .
Professor Nouriel Roubini sums up the covert bailout nicely in a testimony he gave to the Financial Services Committee on February 26 , 2008 :
“ Finally , the widespread use of the FHLB system to provide liquidity – but more clearly bail out insolvent mortgage lenders – has been outright reckless .
Countrywide alone – the poster child of the last decade of reckless and predatory lending practices – received a $ 51 billion loan from this semi-public system ; in the absence of this public bailout Countrywide would have ended up where it should , i.e. into outright bankruptcy .
And the largesse of the FHLB system does not stop at Countrywide .
A system that usually provides a lending stock of about $ 150 billion has forked out loans amounting to over $ 750 billion in the last year with very little oversight of such staggering lending .
The risk that this stealth bailout of many insolvent mortgage lenders will end up costing massive amounts of public money is now rising . ”
And of course this was done in as discreet of a fashion as possible to keep the public from panicking and running around with their underwear on the outside yelling that they can no longer survive without their HELOC .
But over the weekend , the FBI announced that it would be investigating Countrywide for securities fraud :
“ NEW YORK ( Reuters ) – Countrywide Financial Corp shares dropped 14 percent to a 13 - year low on Monday following reports the largest U.S. mortgage lender was being investigated by the FBI for possible securities fraud .
The decline in the stock came even as Bank of America Corp the No. 2 U.S. bank , indicated it will move ahead with its roughly $ 3.7 billion acquisition of Countrywide .
Investors are concerned that the bank might renegotiate or abandon the purchase , which it announced in January and has said it expects to close in the third quarter .
Scott Silvestri , a Bank of America spokesman , said Monday : “ The transaction is on track . ”
Countrywide is being investigated over whether it misrepresented its financial condition and the quality of its loans in securities filings , according to reports in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times over the weekend .
The papers cited people with knowledge of the case . ”
Money well spent FHLB !
As we discussed in a previous post digging into the numbers at Countrywide , there is so much going on here that we have now put the lunatics in charge of the mental asylum .
We are looking at a wiping out of equity to the tune of $ 4 to $ 6 trillion depending on the severity of the correction .
Since the market bottom has fallen out , we either accept the fact that a correction is needed or we keep putting on bandaids trying to mask the problem .
The magnitude of this is so large and we are in such dismal shape with our gargantuan debt , that we are running out of options .
Oil hit $ 108 today and gold is still flirting with $ 1,000 per ounce .
The 63,000 job loss number from last month does not bode well either .
How people can still think we are not in a recession is totally beyond me .
So what are some solutions ?
I ’ve had to stop and seriously think about some of the options on the table because the cowboy approach of taking your knocks is not the road we are going towards .
The OTS option of negative - equity certificates may not be such a bad option .
Here is why .
For one , if you are an owner of a home and you really want to stay in your house , you can have your lender rework your loan to current market prices and the difference between the new mortgage balance and the previous balance is now a long - term IOU to the lender .
This is done between lender and borrower .
If your main objective is not losing your home , then you get to stay in your place .
However , say prices do go up in the future and you do sell your home , the lender is entitled to that original balance .
This helps in a few ways .
First , it avoids the moral hazard of folks who were prudent and paid on time from going Lord of the Flies and foregoing to pay their mortgage simply to reduce their principal .
It also gives lenders and incentive to write down their mortgages .
Of course this probably wo n’t fly because lenders want to off load all their toxic radioactive mortgage junk onto the government books and have you and every other responsible American foot the bill .
And many current owners do n’t want to admit that they became speculators and cannot foresee a world without 20 percent annual gains on their piece of land .
So they walk away .
But that is their choice .
No need to reward this behavior .
And when we say walk away we mean people consciously choosing not to pay their mortgage and letting the entire default process work its way through .
This of course could take months and I ’m sure there will be many living rent free for awhile .
Back to putting the loans on the government books , once those loans get on the government ledger , God help us all .
If you are losing , doubling down will only compound your losses .

Out of the rumor mill comes the 16GB iPhone , now official .
Ever since the 16GB iPod touch was announced in September , we all knew it was just a matter of time until Apple could bung the same NAND capacity into their chubbier iPhone .
The surprise is a new 32 GB iPod touch for the same $ 499 .
No other changes and certainly not 3G .
Both are available immediately .
We just spoke with Apple , who told us that by available immediately , that means both US and international customers .
They should start making their way to stores over the next couple of days , too , so call ahead to check stock if you 're buying offline .
Also , Cupertino had no comment on whether there were any other under - the - hood hardware changes in these new models .

It 's far from the first Minority Report - like interface to make the rounds , but that does n't seem to have prevented the massive setup pictured above from drawing a crowd at CeBIT , which one attendee thankfully captured on video .

Dr Paul advocates free markets , low taxes and small government
But over the course of his campaign , this has changed - largely as a result of his cultivation of an online support base of a fervour unrivalled by any other candidate .
And while he is not regarded as a front - runner for the Republican nomination , Dr Paul has certainly made more of an impression at the polls than pundits ever expected .
He came second in the Nevada Republican caucuses on 19 January 2008 , with 14 % of the vote to winner Mitt Romney 's 51 % .
( The two were the only candidates seriously to campaign in the state . )
The 72 - year - old libertarian also did better than high - profile rival and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani in both Iowa and Michigan .
And , after achieving only 1 % to 2 % support in national polls through most of 2007 , he appeared to be on an upward trend going into 2008 , heading towards 5 % in mid-January .
Facebook ' friends '
Analysts attribute his rising support to his huge online presence , as well as his plain - speaking performances in televised presidential debates .
Dr Paul 's supporters have been campaigning online and on the ground
His dedicated , web - savvy supporters , who comb the internet for references to him and expend large amounts of effort trying to raise his profile , have become known as Paulites or Paulistas .
The candidate 's videos are the most watched on the internet and he can claim more supporters on popular social networking sites MySpace and Facebook than any of his Republican rivals .
Among the practical successes the Paulites can claim is collecting almost $ 6 m in 24 hours in December 2007 , in an online fundraising drive that attracted more than 50,000 donors , half of them new .
Those funds helped Dr Paul spend money on TV advertising and campaigning in early primary states that he could only have dreamed of a year earlier .
Newsletter
Dr Paul 's campaign manager , Ken Snyder , pointed out after the Michigan primary on 15 January that the Texas congressman had outperformed expectations .
" After beating Rudy Giuliani in Iowa , and Fred Thompson in New Hampshire , Ron Paul has now bested both ' national frontrunners ' in Michigan , " he said .
" If I had predicted that result when this campaign started almost 12 months ago , I would have been laughed out of the room by the so - called experts . "
One of the few hiccups in recent months has been an article in The New Republic magazine examining the publication of newsletters under Ron Paul 's name in the 1980s and 1990s in which racist , anti-Semitic and homophobic views were expressed .
Dr Paul responded with a statement saying : " The quotations ... are not mine and do not represent what I believe or have ever believed . "
He added : " For over a decade , I have publicly taken moral responsibility for not paying closer attention to what went out under my name . "
Anti-war stance
Throughout his years in Congress - first in the late 1970s and early 1980s , and more recently since 1997 - Dr Paul has been known for his adherence to strict libertarian principles .
Supporter Aaron Jones praises Dr Paul for his ideas and humility
His commitment to a limited constitutional government , low taxes and free markets has earned him the nickname Dr No , for his habit of voting against any legislation he sees as encroaching on those ideals .
He has consistently opposed the war in Iraq , on the grounds that the US should not entangle itself in the affairs of other nations or go to war without the approval of Congress .
That stance - which sets him apart from his Republican rivals for the presidency - has won him the backing of many anti-war activists , particularly among the younger generation .
Many also admire his dedication to the US Constitution and his message of personal freedom and responsibility .
Aaron Jones , a 29 - year - old supporter from Indiana who was playing the guitar and handing out pocket copies of the Constitution by a polling station in New Hampshire , said he had been impressed by Dr Paul 's selflessness .
" Ron Paul really stands against the establishment in so many issues , " he said .
" I 've never met a more humble politician . "
Delivering babies
Born and raised in Pennsylvania , Dr Paul completed medical school and served as a flight surgeon in the US Air Force during the 1960s .
He moved to Texas in 1968 and , around his political career , worked there as an obstetrician for years , delivering more than 4,000 babies before largely retiring from medical practice in 1996 .
He is opposed to abortion .
Dr Paul ran as the Libertarian Party 's candidate for the presidency in 1988 .
Having been re-elected to Congress in 1997 , he currently serves on the House Committee on Financial Services and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs .
He and his wife , Carol , have five children and 17 grandchildren .
The Tibetan capital of Lhasa was on the brink of chaos today as the fiercest anti-government protests in almost 20 years erupted into violence between Chinese security forces and protestors wielding iron bars .
Armed police used water cannons and teargas on the crowds , and witnesses say security vehicles were set on fire and Chinese drivers were carried off with bloodied faces after being beaten by a mob of young Tibetans .
The US embassy in Beijing said its citizens in Lhasa had reported gunshots being fired in the city .
The embassy emailed an advisory to Americans warning them to stay away from the city , now in its fifth day of anti-Chinese protests .
Coming just months before the start of the 2008 Olympics , the protests against Beijing rule threaten to overshadow preparations for the games .
A resident told the Guardian that he heard an explosion and around 10 shots every minute at one point , but thought it was teargas rather than bullets being fired because he saw people running from plumes of smoke and covering their mouths .
" I am too afraid to go out , " the source , who asked to remain anonymous , said .
" It is chaos out there . "
The source , who is from the Chinese Han ethnic group , said he saw Tibetans attack two fire engines .
" I saw Tibetans throwing stones at the vehicles .
They dragged drivers from vehicles , took off their uniforms and helmets , then beat them .
" The chanting mob beat up around five or six drivers who had to be carried away with blood on their faces ... then they put a motorbike under the fire engine and set fire to it so the engine was burned . "
The report was difficult to confirm .
The Chinese government has yet to make a statement , and communications with the tightly - controlled Himalayan region are difficult even during calm periods .
But a blogger who writes from Lhasa under the name Beifang gave a similar report on his blog .
" Police cars and fire engines were outside smashed and burned .
A lot of Tibetans ran towards Dazhao [ Jokhang ] temple .
I heard gunshots .
Five army police vehicles drove that way .
A large number of armed police followed .
A few people with blood on their faces were taken away . "
Tibetan support groups overseas said they were hearing reports of a fire and protests near the Tromsikhang market near the Jokhang temple in central Lhasa .
According to the Free Tibet campaign , there were also protests today in the Labrang monastery in Gansu province , where 200 monks led demonstrations on the streets .
The group said this showed the protests were gathering momentum .
Since the first protest by monks on Monday , thousands of armed police have locked down monasteries in and around Lhasa .
Witnesses said today 's protestors were mostly lay Tibetans .
China 's Xinhua news agency reported that shops had been set on fire in Lhasa but gave no other details .
The International Campaign for Tibet said two monks at the Sera monastery had stabbed themselves and others had gone on hunger strike .
About a dozen monks were reportedly detained on Monday , when several hundred from the Sera and Drepung monasteries took to the streets to mark the 49th anniversary of a failed uprising against Beijing .
Similar protests took place in the Ganden and Lutsang monasteries in Qinghai ( known in Tibetan as Amdo ) where hundreds of monks reportedly chanted slogans calling for their exiled leader , the Dalai Lama , to return .
The upsurge in activism comes amid growing frustration with the lack of progress in talks between representatives of the Dalai Lama and Beijing .
Pat Buchanan wrote an op - ed that literally made me sick to my stomach .
What is wrong with Barack 's prognosis and Barack 's cure ?
Only this .
It is the same old con , the same old shakedown that black hustlers have been running since the Kerner Commission blamed the riots in Harlem , Watts , Newark , Detroit and a hundred other cities on , as Nixon put it , " everybody but the rioters themselves . " [..]
Barack says we need to have a conversation about race in America .
Fair enough .
But this time , it has to be a two - way conversation .
White America needs to be heard from , not just lectured to .
This time , the Silent Majority needs to have its convictions , grievances and demands heard .
And among them are these :
First , America has been the best country on earth for black folks .
It was here that 600,000 black people , brought from Africa in slave ships , grew into a community of 40 million , were introduced to Christian salvation , and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known .
Wright ought to go down on his knees and thank God he is an American .
Second , no people anywhere has done more to lift up blacks than white Americans .
Untold trillions have been spent since the ' 60s on welfare , food stamps , rent supplements , Section 8 housing , Pell grants , student loans , legal services , Medicaid , Earned Income Tax Credits and poverty programs designed to bring the African - American community into the mainstream .
Hopefully , you 've been able to retain your lunch while reading .
I 've known that Pat Buchanan was a little nuts with his isolationist rhetoric , but I had no idea just how isolationist he actually was - - he really does n't want anyone who does n't look like him in this country , does he ?.
This reads like something white supremist Sam Francis would write , and as it turns out , Francis was a mentor to Buchanan .
Pam's House Blend has a response to Buchanan ( and really , should he still be getting gigs on EVERY MSNBC show with this kind of open racist attitude ? ) :
Thanks ,
Pat .
We 've gotten the old " lift up " message , all right .
How could people like Buchanan listen to the same speech and walk away with this level of vitriol in their heart and purposeful ignorance of history ?
Our country suffers an incredible sickness when it comes to race relations .
The point of Obama 's speech is that we all have work to do , and share responsibility in opening up an adult dialog .
The above does nothing to advance understanding , and shows no desire to do so either .
Pandagon and Orcinus have more ...
Even as Sprint tentatively rolls out the XOHM network here in the States , the largest Indian telecom company is planning to build a mobile WiMAX network covering three states on the subcontinent capable of serving 250 million people .
State - owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited is leaning on Soma Networks to build the broadband - speed network in response to government requirement that 20 million broadband lines be in service by 2010 .
The WiMAX rollout will first hit the largest and most - connected states , but BSNL is planning on extending the network if things go well .
Soma says it 's shipping thousands of base stations to get the network operational at full speed , and that when it 's done , 400 Indian cities will be covered , with downstream speeds of 1.5 megabits per seconds .
No word on when that might be , but the race is officially on , Sprint .

This photograph showing a starving Sudanese child being stalked by a vulture won Kevin Carter the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for feature photography .
Photographer Haunted by Horror of His Work Obituary : Kevin Carter 1960 - 1994 Johannesburg - Kevin Carter , the South African photographer whose image of a starving Sudanese toddler stalked by a vulture won him a Pulitzer Prize this year , was found dead on Wednesday night , apparently a suicide , police said yesterday .
He was 33 .
The police said Mr Carter 's body and several letters to friends and family were discovered in his pick - up truck , parked in a Johannesburg suburb .
An inquest showed that he had died of carbon monoxide poisoning .
Mr Carter started as a sports photographer in 1983 but soon moved to the front lines of South African political strife , recording images of repression , anti-apartheid protest and fratricidal violence .
A few davs after winning his Pulitzer Prize in April , Mr Carter was nearby when one of his closest friends and professional companions , Ken Oosterbroek , was shot dead photographing a gun battle in Tokoza township .
Friends said Mr Carter was a man of tumultuous emotions which brought passion to his work but also drove him to extremes of elation and depression .
Last year , saying he needed a break from South Africa 's turmoil , he paid his own way to the southern Sudan to photograph a civil war and famine that he felt the world was overlooking .
His picture of an emaciated girl collapsing on the way to a feeding centre , as a plump vulture lurked in the background , was published first in The New York Times and The Mail & Guardian , a Johannesburg weekly .
The reaction to the picture was so strong that The New York Times published an unusual editor 's note on the fate of the girl .
Mr Carter said she resumed her trek to the feeding centre .
He chased away the vulture .
Afterwards , he told an interviewer , he sat under a tree for a long time , " smoking cigarettes and crying " .
His father , Mr Jimmy Carter laid last night : " Kevin always carried around the horror of the work he did . " - The New York Times Source : Sydney Morning Herald Saturday 30 July 1994
What are the odds the little girl is alive today ?
Not very high , I 'd say .
If she is alive , what quality of life is she likely to have ?
She almost certainly has permanent damage from her period of starvation during crucial development , both before and after birth .
It is easy to criticise Kevin Carter .
Why ?
Because he took a photo of one starving child among thousands ?
Let those who send all their spare cash to the needy cast the first stone ...
The Life and Death of Kevin Carter by Scott MacLeod As Time 's Johannesburg bureau chief for the past five years , Scott MacLeod has seen more than his share of tragedy .
But nothing prepared him for the devastating news in July that a colleague , 33 - year - old South African photojournalist Kevin Carter , had killed himself .
Carter was famous in South Africa for his fearless coverage of deadly township violence , and he had become internationally known for his Pulitzer prizewinning photo of a vulture coolly eyeing an emaciated Sudanese child struggling toward a feeding station .
" Few journalists saw as much violence and trauma as he did , " says MacLeod .
Shocked by Carter 's suicide , MacLeod determined " to understand as best I could the complexities behind his tragic end . "
The result is this week 's unusual tale of a troubled man 's life and death .
In any given issue of Time , we include , of course , many stories that are driven by news headlines .
Occasionally we go back to a seemingly small event of months ago , briefly noted at the time , that strikes us as ripe with human drama and moral implications , worthy of detailed digging and sober reflection .
The suicide of Kevin Carter was such an event .
In researching the article , MacLeod interviewed Carter 's family , close friends and colleagues , as well as experts on suicide ; in the process he encountered several other journalists in pursuit of the mystery of Carter 's self - destruction .
But the subject eluded easy conclusions and assumptions .
MacLeod sees Carter 's story as representative of a darker side of middle - class white South Africa and as a warning about the lingering effects of apartheid on all of that country 's people .
" The lives of some whites too were disrupted and even destroyed by the social experiment , " he notes .
" I wanted to show that side of the apartheid story as well . "

President , Time Domestic Johannesburg - Visiting Sudan , a little - known photographer took a picture that made the world weep .
What happened afterward is a tragedy of another sort .
The image presaged no celebration : a child barely alive , a vulture so eager for carrion .
Yet the photograph that epitomised Sudan 's famine would win Kevin Carter fame - and hopes for anchoring a career spent hounding the news , free - lancing in war zones , waiting anxiously for assignments amid dire finances , staying in the line of fire for that one great picture .
On May 23 , 14 months after capturing that memorable scene , Carter walked up to the dais in the classical rotunda of Columbia University 's Low Memorial Library and received the Pulitzer Prize for feature photography .
The South African soaked up the attention .
" I swear I got the most applause of anybody , " Carter wrote back to his parents in Johannesburg .
" I can't wait to show you the trophy .
It is the most precious thing , and the highest acknowledgment of my work I could receive . "
Carter was feted at some of the most fashionable spots in New York City .
Restaurant patrons , overhearing his claim to fame , would come up and ask for his autograph .
Photo editors at the major magazines wanted to meet the new hotshot , dressed in his black jeans and T shirts , with the tribal bracelets and diamond - stud earring , with the war - weary eyes and tales from the front lines of Nelson Mandela 's new South Africa .
Carter signed with Sygma , a prestigious picture agency representing 200 of the world 's best photojournalists .
" It can be a very glamorous business , " says Sygma 's US director , Eliane Laffont .
" It 's very hard to make it , but Kevin is one of the few who really broke through .
The pretty girls were falling for him , and everybody wanted to hear what he had to say . "
There would be little time for that .
Two months after receiving his Pulitzer , Carter would be dead of carbon - monoxide poisoning in Johannesburg , a suicide at 33 .
His red pickup truck was parked near a small river where he used to play as a child ; a green garden hose attached to the vehicle 's exhaust funneled the fumes inside .
" I 'm really , really sorry , " he explained in a note left on the passenger seat beneath a knapsack .
" The pain of life overrides the joy to the point that joy does not exist . "
How could a man who had moved so many people with his work end up a suicide so soon after his great triumph ?
The brief obituaries that appeared around the world suggested a morality tale about a person undone by the curse of fame .
The details , however , show how fame was only the final , dramatic sting of a death foretold by Carter 's personality , the pressure to be first where the action is , the fear that his pictures were never good enough , the existential lucidity that came to him from surviving violence again and again - and the drugs he used to banish that lucidity .
If there is a paramount lesson to be drawn from Carter 's meteoric rise and fall , it is that tragedy does not always have heroic dimensions .
" I have always had it all at my feet , " read the last words of his suicide note , " but being me just fit up anyway . "
First , there was history .
Kevin Carter was born in 1960 , the year Nelson Mandela 's African National Congress was outlawed .
Descended from English immigrants , Carter was not part of the Afrikaner mainstream that ruled the country .
Indeed , its ideology appalled him .
Yet he was caught up in its historic misadventure .
His devoutly Roman Catholic parents , Jimmy and Roma , lived in Parkmore , a tree - lined Johannesburg suburb - and they accepted apartheid .
Kevin , however , like many of his generation , soon began to question it openly .
" The police used to go around arresting black people for not carrying their passes , " his mother recalls .
" They used to treat them very badly , and we felt unable to do anything about it .
But Kevin got very angry about it .
He used to have arguments with his father .
" Why could n't we do something about it ?
Why did n't we go shout at those police ? "
Though Carter insisted he loved his parents , he told his closest friends his childhood was unhappy .
As a teenager , he found his thrills riding motorcycles and fantasized about becoming a race - car driver .
After graduating from a Catholic boarding school in Pretoria in 1976 , Carter studied pharmacy before dropping out with bad grades a year later .
Without a student deferment , he was conscripted into the South African Defense Force ( SADF ) , where he found upholding the apartheid regime loathsome .
Once , after he took the side of a black mess - hall waiter , some Afrikaans - speaking soldiers called him a kaffir - boetie ( " nigger lover " ) and beat him up .
In 1980 Carter went absent without leave , rode a motorcycle to Durban and , calling himself David , became a disk jockey .
He longed to see his family but felt too ashamed to return .
One day after he lost his job , he swallowed scores of sleeping pills , pain - killers and rat poison .
He survived .
He returned to the SADF to finish his service and was injured in 1983 while on guard duty at air force headquarters in Pretoria .
A bomb attributed to the ANC had exploded , killing 19 people .
After leaving the service , Carter got a job at a camera supply shop and drifted into journalism , first as a weekend sports photographer for the Johannesburg Sunday Express .
When riots began sweeping the black townships in 1984 , Carter moved to the Johannesburg Star and aligned himself with the crop of young , white photojournalists who wanted to expose the brutality of apartheid - a mission that had once been the almost exclusive calling of South Africa 's black photographers .
" They put themselves in face of danger , were arrested numerous times , but never quit .
They literally were willing to sacrifice themselves for what they believed in , " says American photojournalist James Nachtwey , who frequently worked with Carter and his friends .
By 1990 , civil war was raging between Mandela 's ANC and the Zulu- supported Inkatha Freedom Party .
For whites , it became potentially fatal to work the townships alone .
To diminish the dangers , Carter hooked up with three friends - Ken Oosterbroek of the Star and free - lancers Greg Marinovich and Joao Silva - and they began moving through Soweto and Tokoza at dawn .
If a murderous gang was going to shoot up a bus , throw someone off a train or cut up somebody on the street , it was most likely to happen as township dwellers began their journeys to work in the soft , shadowy light of an African morning .
The four became so well known for capturing the violence that Living , a Johannesburg magazine , dubbed them " the Bang - Bang Club . "
Even with the teamwork , however , cruising the townships was often a perilous affair .
Well - armed government security forces used excessive firepower .
The chaotic hand - to - hand street fighting between black factions involved AK - 47s , spears and axes .
" At a funeral some mourners caught one guy , hacked him , shot him , ran over him with a car and set him on fire , " says Silva , describing a typical encounter .
" My first photo showed this guy on the ground as the crowd told him they were going to kill him .
We were lucky to get away . "
Sometimes it took more than a camera and camaraderie to get through the work .
Marijuana , known locally as dagga , is widely available in South Africa .
Carter and many other photojournalists smoked it habitually in the townships , partly to relieve tension and partly to bond with gun-toting street warriors .
Although he denied it , Carter , like many hard - core dagga users , moved on to something more dangerous : smoking the " white pipe , " a mixture of dagga and Mandrax , a banned tranquiliser containing methaqualone .
It provides an intense , immediate kick and then allows the user to mellow out for an hour or two .
By 1991 , working on the dawn patrol had paid off for one of the Bang - Bang Club .
Marinovich won a Pulitzer for his September 1990 photographs of a Zulu being stabbed to death by ANC supporters .
That prize raised the stakes for the rest of the club - especially Carter .
And for Carter other comparisons cropped up .
Though Oosterbroek was his best friend , they were , according to Nachtwey , " like the polarities of personality types .
Ken was the successful photographer with the loving wife .
His life was in order . "
Carter had bounced from romance to romance , fathering a daughter out of wedlock .
In 1993 Carter headed north of the border with Silva to photograph the rebel movement in famine - stricken Sudan .
To make the trip , Carter had taken a leave from the Weekly Mail and borrowed money for the air fare .
Immediately after their plane touched down in the village of Ayod , Carter began snapping photos of famine victims .
Seeking relief from the sight of masses of people starving to death , he wandered into the open bush .
He heard a soft , high - pitched whimpering and saw a tiny girl trying to make her way to the feeding centre .
As he crouched to photograph her , a vulture landed in view .
Careful not to disturb the bird , he positioned himself for the best possible image .
He would later say he waited about 20 minutes , hoping the vulture would spread its wings .
It did not , and after he took his photographs , he chased the bird away and watched as the little girl resumed her struggle .
Afterward he sat under a tree , lit a cigarette , talked to God and cried .
" He was depressed afterward , " Silva recalls .
" He kept saying he wanted to hug his daughter . "
After another day in Sudan , Carter returned to Johannesburg .
Coincidentally , the New York Times , which was looking for pictures of Sudan , bought his photograph and ran it on 26 March 1993 .
The picture immediately became an icon of Africa 's anguish .
Hundreds of people wrote and called the Times asking what had happened to the child ( the paper reported that it was not known whether she reached the feeding centre ) ; and papers around the world reproduced the photo .
Friends and colleagues complimented Carter on his feat .
His self - confidence climbed .
Carter quit the Weekly Mail and became a free - lance photojournalist - an alluring but financially risky way of making a living , providing no job security , no health insurance and no death benefits .
He eventually signed up with the Reuter news agency for a guarantee of roughly $ 2,000 a month and began to lay plans for covering his country 's first multiracial elections in April .
The next few weeks , however , would bring depression and self - doubt , only momentarily interrupted by triumph .
The troubles started on 11 March .
Carter was covering the unsuccessful invasion of Bophuthatswana by white right - wing vigilantes intent on propping up a black homeland , a showcase of apartheid .
Carter found himself just feet away from the summary execution of right - wingers by a black " Bop " policeman .
" Lying in the middle of the gunfight , " he said , " I was wondering about which millisecond next I was going to die , about putting something on film they could use as my last picture . "
His pictures would eventually be splashed across front pages around the world , but he came away from the scene in a funk .
First , there was the horror of having witnessed murder .
Perhaps as importantly , while a few colleagues had framed the scene perfectly , Carter was reloading his camera with film just as the executions took place .
" I knew I had missed this f--- shot , " he said subsequently .
" I drank a bottle of bourbon that night . "
At the same time , he seemed to be stepping up his drug habit , including smoking the white pipe .
A week after the Bop executions , he was seen staggering around while on assignment at a Mandela rally in Johannesburg .
Later he crashed his car into a suburban house and was thrown in jail for 10 hours on suspicion of drunken driving .
His superior at Reuter was furious at having to go to the police station to recover Carter 's film of the Mandela event .
Carter 's girlfriend , Kathy Davidson , a schoolteacher , was even more upset .
Drugs had become a growing issue in their one - year relationship .
Over Easter , she asked Carter to move out until he cleaned up his life .
With only weeks to go before the elections , Carter 's job at Reuter was shaky , his love life was in jeopardy and he was scrambling to find a new place to live .
And then , on 12 April 1994 , the New York Times phoned to tell him he had won the Pulitzer .
As jubilant Times foreign picture editor Nancy Buirski gave him the news , Carter found himself rambling on about his personal problems .
" Kevin ! " she interrupted , " You 've just won a Pulitzer !
These things are n't going to be that important now . "
Early on Monday 18 April , the Bang - Bang Club headed out to Tokoza township , 10 miles from downtown Johannesburg , to cover an outbreak of violence .
Shortly before noon , with the sun too bright for taking good pictures , Carter returned to the city .
Then on the radio he heard that his best friend , Oosterbroek , had been killed in Tokoza .
Marinovich had been gravely wounded .
Oosterbroek 's death devastated Carter , and he returned to work in Tokoza the next day , even though the violence had escalated .
He later told friends that he and not Ken " should have taken the bullet . "
New York was a respite .
By all accounts , Carter made the most of his first visit to Manhattan .
The Times flew him in and put him up at the Marriott Marquis just off Times Square .
His spirits soaring , he took to calling New York " my town . "
With the Pulitzer , however , he had to deal not only with acclaim but also with the critical focus that comes with fame .
Some journalists in South Africa called his prize a " fluke , " alleging that he had somehow set up the tableau .
Others questioned his ethics .
" The man adjusting his lens to take just the right frame of her suffering , " said theSt Petersburg ( Florida ) Times , " might just as well be a predator , another vulture on the scene . "
Even some of Carter 's friends wondered aloud why he had not helped the girl .
Carter was painfully aware of the photojournalist 's dilemma .
" I had to think visually , " he said once , describing a shoot - out .
" I am zooming in on a tight shot of the dead guy and a splash of red .
Going into his khaki uniform in a pool of blood in the sand .
The dead man 's face is slightly gray .
You are making a visual here .
But inside something is screaming , ' My God . '
But it is time to work .
Deal with the rest later .
If you can't do it , get out of the game . "
Says Nachtwey , " Every photographer who has been involved in these stories has been affected .
You become changed forever .
Nobody does this kind of work to make themselves feel good .
It is very hard to continue . "
Carter did not look forward to going home .
Summer was just beginning in New York , but late June was still winter in South Africa , and Carter became depressed almost as soon as he got off the plane .
" Jo'burg is dry and brown and cold and dead , and so damn full of bad memories and absent friends , " he wrote in a letter never mailed to a friend , Esquire picture editor Marianne Butler in New York .
Nevertheless , Carter carefully listed story ideas and faxed some of them off to Sygma .
Work did not proceed smoothly .
Though it was not his fault , Carter felt guilty when a bureaucratic foul - up caused the cancellation of an interview by a writer from Parade magazine , a Sygma client , with Mandela in Cape Town .
Then came an even more unpleasant experience .
Sygma told Carter to stay in Cape Town and cover French President Francois Mitterrand 's state visit to South Africa .
The story was spot news , but according to editors at Sygma 's Paris office , Carter shipped his film too late to be of use .
In any case , they complained , the quality of the photos was too poor to offer to Sygma 's clients .
According to friends , Carter began talking openly about suicide .
Part of his anxiety was over the Mitterrand assignment .
But mostly he seemed worried about money and making ends meet .
When an assignment in Mozambique for Time came his way , he eagerly accepted .
Despite setting three alarm clocks to make his early - morning flight on July 20 , he missed the plane .
Furthermore , after six days in Mozambique , he walked off his return flight to Johannesburg , leaving a package of undeveloped film on his seat .
He realised his mistake when he arrived at a friend 's house .
He raced back to the airport but failed to turn up anything .
Carter was distraught and returned to the friend 's house in the morning , threatening to smoke a white pipe and gas himself to death .
Carter and a friend , Judith Matloff , 36 , an American correspondent for Reuter , dined on Mozambican prawns he had brought back .
He was apparently too ashamed to tell her about the lost film .
Instead they discussed their futures .
Carter proposed forming a writer - photographer free - lance team and traveling Africa together .
On the morning of Wednesday 27July , the last day of his life , Carter appeared cheerful .
He remained in bed until nearly noon and then went to drop off a picture that had been requested by the Weekly Mail .
In the paper 's newsroom , he poured out his anguish to former colleagues , one of whom gave him the number of a therapist and urged him to phone her .
The last person to see Carter alive , it seems , was Oosterbroek 's widow , Monica .
As night fell , Carter turned up unannounced at her home to vent his troubles .
Still recovering from her husband 's death 3 months earlier , she was in little condition to offer counsel .
They parted at about 5:30 pm .
The Braamfonteinspruit is a small river that cuts southward through Johannesburg 's northern suburbs - and through Parkmore , where the Carters once lived .
At around 9 pm , Kevin Carter backed his red Nissan pickup truck against a blue gum tree at the Field and Study Centre .
He had played there often as a little boy .
The Sandton Bird Club was having its monthly meeting there , but nobody saw Carter as he used silver gaffer tape to attach a garden hose to the exhaust pipe and run it to the passenger - side window .
Wearing unwashed Lee jeans and an Esquire T shirt , he got in and switched on the engine .
Then he put music on his Walkman and lay over on his side , using the knapsack as a pillow .
The suicide note he left behind is a litany of nightmares and dark visions , a clutching attempt at autobiography , self - analysis , explanation , excuse .
After coming home from New York , he wrote , he was " depressed ... without phone ... money for rent ... money for child support ... money for debts ... money !!! ...
I am haunted by the vivid memories of killings & corpses & anger & pain ... of starving or wounded children , of trigger - happy madmen , often police , of killer executioners ... "
And then this : " I have gone to join Ken if I am that lucky . "

Suicide of a Pulitzer Winner
It is tragic that the world has lost a photographer with the talent and skill of Kevin Carter .
But it should come as no surprise that he found it difficult to reconcile the peaks and valleys of his career with the suffering and violence upon which it was built .
It disturbed him , as it should have .
By embarking on a career in photojournalism , Carter set himself apart from the lives of the people he photographed .
He chose to be an observer rather than a participant .
Carter opted for a moral detachment that most of us cannot achieve and that I would not want to have .
Though I can admire his work and courage in the face of danger , I cannot imagine witnessing such violence and human suffering without trying to intervene .
Perhaps , in the end , Kevin Carter could not either .
Andrew W Hall
Galveston , Texas AOL : Tigone As Kevin Carter 's sister , I am sad that Time has stooped to such sensationalist reporting concerning my brother 's death .
Scott MacLeod did not interview me or my sister or two of Kevin 's very close friends .
His " detailed digging " resulted in the presentation of a series of negative issues through which he attempted to explain a suicide .
Suicide is obviously the result of the negative outweighing the positive , in the victim 's mind , but this does not mean that there were not hundreds of positive aspects to the particular individual .
Kevin was a person of passion and presence ; he left his mark wherever he went .
He was an incredible father to Megan and a man who grappled deeply with issues most people just accept .
In many ways he was ahead of his time .
The pain of his mission to open the eyes of the world to so many of the issues and injustices that tore at his own soul eventually got to him .
The year 1993 was a good one for him , but at the end of it he told me he really needed a break from Africa , that it was getting to him .
He knew then that he was losing perspective .
Unfortunately , the pressure only got worse , with the increased violence leading up to the elections and , worst of all , the loss of his friend Ken Oosterbroek .
The Pulitzer Prize certainly did n't send Kevin " deeper into anguish . "
If anything , it was a confirmation that his work had all been worthwhile .
Your version of Kevin 's death seems so futile .
What is anyone going to learn or gain from reading it ?
Patricia Gird Randburg
South Africa
- It is ironic that Kevin Carter won the Pulitzer for a photograph which to me is a photograph of his own soul and epitomizes his life .
Kevin is that small child huddled against the world , and the vulture is the angel of death .
I wish someone could have chased that evil from his life .
I 'm sure that little child succumbed to death just as Kevin did .
Both must have suffered greatly .

Comments : Kevin Carter took that picture of that little Sudanese girl and walked on to under a tree to calmly have a cigarette .
Shit , I would have stomped that bird , picked up that baby , put her in my camera bag and gotten her to a hospital and then adopted her .
But her little bones are laying in the Sundan sun bleached white by now .
That photo is why I believe that man keeps deluding himself in believing in a " God " .
There is no God .
If there is and it could allow that to happen to such a sweet little innocent being it's a perverse and sick " God " .
The photo outrages me .
We keep spending money on weapons , we keep electing men to power that are weak and feeble minded , we let millions of beings both human and animals suffer horrendously daily and look the other way .
I 'm not a " nut " I 'm just tired of the cruelty that stems from mankind 's stupidity .
Claudia Claudia , I think you 'll find that it 's much easier to criticise than it is to act .
Have you adopted an orphan ?
Joined a political activist group ?
No ?
Oh .
I do n't accept the idea of God myself , but certainly not for the reason that bad things happen to people and animals .
The Atrocity Exhibition : A War Fuelled by Imagery by Charles Paul Freund
In 1993 , a photographer named Kevin Carter went to Sudan to capture images of that nation 's dismal and unending civil war .
One of the pictures he took was of a starving little girl : she had collapsed in the bush , and a vulture nearby seemed to be waiting for her to die .
The photo was reproduced all over the world , touching many thousands of people , becoming an icon of African misery , winning a Pulitzer Prize , and , a year later , apparently contributing to Carter 's own suicide .
Carter , a white South African , spent only a couple of days in Sudan .
According to Susan D Moeller , who tells Carter 's story in Compassion Fatigue : How the Media Sell Disease , Famine , War and Death , he had gone into the bush seeking relief from the terrible starvation and suffering he was documenting , when he encountered the emaciated girl .
When he saw the vulture land , Carter waited quietly , hoping the bird would spread its wings and give him an even more dramatic image .
It did n't , and he eventually chased the bird away .
The girl gathered her strength and resumed her journey toward a feeding centre .
Afterward , writes Moeller , Carter " sat by a tree , talked to God , cried , and thought about his own daughter , Megan . "
When the image of the prostrate girl and the patient vulture appeared , many people demanded to know what had happened to her .
The New York Times explained in an editors ' note that while she resumed her trek , the photographer did n't know if she had survived .
Carter stood accused ; callers in the middle of the night denounced him .
The girl began to haunt the photographer .
In June 1994 , Carter , beset by difficulties , killed himself .
His suicide note speaks of the ghosts he could not escape , the " vivid memories of killings & corpses & anger & pain , " and the " starving and wounded children " ever before his eyes .
This death of a messenger is a cautionary tale for an age of atrocity imagery .
Terrible pictures of agony and murder have come to America from Lebanon , from Somalia , from Haiti , from Rwanda , and now from Kosovo , and they have unleashed the most powerful of emotions .
Yet these emotions emerge from pictures that tell inevitably distorted versions of their awful realities .
Their concrete representations suggest a moral imperative to act , to intervene with force against evil .
Yet the resulting interventions have , one after the other , revealed the illusions of mercy : there is no such thing as military humanitarianism .
Such action , despite its moral incentive , is always political , and always results in political consequences and responsibilities .
When these assert themselves , the atrocity imagery changes : it often features Americans .
In Carter 's case , Western newspaper readers saw a little girl .
Carter , in the Sudanese village where he landed , was watching 20 people starve to death each hour .
Perhaps he might have laid aside his camera to give the victims what succor he could ( and thus never have encountered the girl in the bush ) ; perhaps his photographs could have led to greater help than he could personally give .
Should he have carried one girl to safety ?
Carter was surrounded by hundreds of starving children .
When he sat by the tree and wept , it was beneath a burden of futility .
But his was not a photo of futility , nor of mass starvation , nor of religious factionalism , nor of civil war .
Readers saw a little girl .
In part , at least , Carter died for that .
While Kevin Carter was in Sudan , American forces were not very far away : they were in Somalia .
They 'd been dispatched there by George Bush , who specifically cited the " shocking images " of starvation and violence from that collapsed nation when he announced a humanitarian intervention .
The use of America 's military power for such purposes had broad public support ; indeed , Bush was actually under pressure to act as a result of the deeply disturbing imagery .
The Cold War was over ; history had ended with the collapse of ideological challenge to liberal democratic capitalism .
America 's enormous military power could become an arsenal for decency .
But it turns out that war is fought on history 's nether side .
The post - historical urge to rescue , as it emerges from dangerously sentimentalised atrocity imagery , is considerably weaker in practice than is the historical urge to power that it confronts on the ground .
American forces , under Bill Clinton , altered their Somali mission from one of alleviating hunger to one of " nation building , " thus involving the US military in a local political struggle that policy makers did n't take seriously .
The result was that the United States , in all its might , was driven from Somalia by a local militia leader whose followers dragged the despoiled corpses of some American soldiers through the streets .
Somalia remains the " failed state " it was before American troops arrived , its people living in the continuing misery that results from total national dysfunction .
But what little imagery emerges from Somalia has seemingly lost its moral dimension ; for Americans , at least , such imagery now has political content , and is judged politically when it is displayed at all .
This intervention was itself a replay of the American misadventure in Beirut in 1982 , when , in the wake of the massacres at the Sabra and Shattila refugee camps , Ronald Reagan sent in the Marines while citing the terrible pictures of suffering .
Though seemingly engaged in a humanitarian effort aimed at policing and stabilizing the volatile situation , Americans actually found themselves enmeshed in a complex political struggle for the control of Lebanon .
The Marines were of course pulled out the next year after their barracks were bombed , killing 223 soldiers .
The perpetrators of the bombing have never been identified ; Lebanon today is controlled by Syria .
The NATO intervention under American leadership in Yugoslavia , over the issue of Kosovo , is the apotheosis of this pathos - driven moral imperative reduced immediately to political dross .
In a notoriously rambling 23 March speech intended to frame the issues involved in the Kosovo conflict and to garner support for American military involvement there , the president cited a variety of reasons to take military action , and evoked the horrible pictures of Balkan bloodshed that had appeared in the press for years .
He told the country that he wanted to create a world " where we do n't have to worry about seeing scenes every night for the next 40 years of ethnic cleansing in some part of the world . "
With likely images of dead Americans no doubt in mind , the president made it clear in advance of the bombing campaign that there were no plans to send in ground troops .
This attempt to sell a military action on humanitarian grounds , yet split the difference between the two kinds of atrocity images , has had serious consequences : a military , political , and humanitarian miscalculation of historic proportions .
NATO's air attacks provided cover for Serbian leader Slobodon Milosevic to begin an expulsion of ethnic Albanians from the Serbian province .
Hundreds of thousands of persons have been driven into the fragile countries bordering Kosovo , straining their limited resources , threatening their political stability , and submerging the entire conflict in staggering suffering .
Indeed , although the bombing campaign was originally intended to force Milosevic to sign a NATO - brokered treaty involving Kosovo , the scale of the humanitarian emergency - including reports of murders of Kosovar men - recast him as an unofficial war criminal .
That threw into doubt the air campaign 's moral underpinnings .
After all , what kind of moral victory would it be if a such a perpetrator was forced to sign a treaty , but otherwise retained political power ?
Politically , the air campaign seemed to unite Serbians behind Milosevic , although most of them had disliked him and had wanted to get rid of him .
Many Serbians felt unfairly targeted : hundreds of thousands of them had recently been driven from Croatia , suffering great hardship with little or no attention from the United States or NATO .
Indeed , many Serbians argued that during the Tito dictatorship after World War II they had been driven by the thousands from Kosovo , which they consider their sacred homeland , by the ethnic Albanians who then had power over the province .
As a result of the bombing campaign , NATO seems to have traded its relationship with Russia ( where nationalists were threatening to radicalize a fragile political situation ) for a marriage of sorts with the Kosovo Liberation Army , a group that the United States had until recently called " terrorists " and provocateurs .
The KLA 's backing is as murky as its agenda , which reportedly calls for the creation of a " Greater Albania " along the lines of the rump state created by fascist Italian occupiers during World War II .
That would appear to require the dismantling not only of Yugoslavia but of Macedonia as well .
Yet some members of Congress have called for the arming and support of the organisation .
While the bombing campaign became focused increasingly on the refugee problem it had itself seemingly exacerbated , the Clinton administration fell into visible disarray .
The White House appeared completely flummoxed , claiming to have foreseen the expulsions , though obviously failing to prepare for them .
Meanwhile , persons in the CIA , the Pentagon , and the State Department leaked stories to the press intended to pass the blame for the stunning mess .
It was a singularly dismaying performance .
Yet American public support for continued military action - and even for the introduction of ground forces - actually grew .
The power of atrocity imagery continued to assert itself .
In fact , attempting to respond to such images is entirely appropriate ; if the United States can alleviate suffering with aid , sanctions , or even military action , then it shold debate doing so , determine if it is willing to accept the foreseeable consequences , and act .
But misunderstanding and sentimentalising these images is an invitation to disaster .
For all their inherent emotional content , they remain ultimately political in nature .
They arise from political circumstances , and one cannot " stop " them without accepting the inevitable political consequences of intervention .
The United States cannot pretend that it is the Red Cross with a Pentagon , though a succession of presidents have acted as if it were .
In Haiti , American forces have become virtual prisoners of pathos .
They were sent there by Clinton in response to pitiable images of Haitian bloodshed and chaos , and in support of a reform president , and they are now reportedly unable to leave their barracks .
Haiti has made no discernible progress toward real democratic practice , and its government - made possible by this American act of militarised humanitarianism - stands accused of murdering its enemies .
It is unclear what moral purpose is served by the continued presence in the country of US troops .
They remain under close confinement , however , to ensure that they do not become yet more targets of Haiti 's endemic political violence , and the subject of more atrocity photographs featuring Americans soldiers .
In Rwanda , President Clinton took no action at all to forestall the true genocide that occurred 5 years ago , although the United States , France , and Belgium were all forewarned that many thousands of persons would soon be hacked to death by their traditional tribal enemies .
However , the pictures of piles of bloody corpses that soon emerged from Rwanda were horrifying , and a massive effort was made to care for the many refugees who soon filled camps outside the country .
There were many pitiable images to emerge from these camps as well ; these pictures seemed to portray the remnants of a targeted people who had somehow escaped slaughter , and who were now reduced to the misery of refugee camp life .
Having failed to stop the murders , the West surely had a moral obligation to give succor to the survivors .
But the details that eventually were reported from the camps were very different .
Many of the people in the camps were not survivors of the slaughter ; they were either perpetrators of the slaughter or members of the tribe that supported it .
They had crowded into the camps to escape retribution .
What appeared to be a morally necessary act of sanctuary was revealed to be - in large part , at least - aid and comfort to murderers .
And what of Kashmir ?
Tibet ?
The Kurds ?
Indeed , what of Iraq , where the deaths of many thousands of children have been attributed by the United Nations to the sanctions policy imposed by the United States ?
" Because we cannot do everything everywhere , " says Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , " does not mean we should do nothing nowhere . "
True as far as it goes .
But it also means that when we do choose to act , it should be in full appreciation not only of mercy 's limits but of its consequences .
Charles Paul Freund is a Reason senior editor Source : reason.com Reason Magazine June 1999 Inner Horror Plagues War Photographers
It is not always bullets or bombs that kill war correspondents , but the horror they keep inside .
Amy Eldon is too familiar with both causes of death .
The young documentary maker lost her older brother , a freelance photographer who worked for Reuters and others , 5 years , ago in Somalia .
Now she has learnt that television journalist Carlos Mavroleon , a subject of her new film on battle - zone reporters , died in August of a heroin overdose .
" It is job - related , " Eldon said .
" So many of these guys , after what they 've seen , they become so tormented and they do n't know where to put all this horror .
Carlos just escaped to another world . "
Mavroleon was one of several photographers and cameramen Eldon interviewed for her two - hour television documentary Dying to Tell the Story , which premiered on an American cable network .
The film was inspired by her brother Dan , beaten to death in Somalia two months short of his 23rd birthday .
After his death , she left college and fought off depression before deciding to make a film about him and other journalists who live to cover wars .
" They 're cut from a different cloth .
They 're mad , " Eldon said , " I think some go into it and then they become used to a higher threshold of pain .
They become adrenaline junkies . "
The addiction has left some of Dan 's colleagues with a lifetime of pain .
Donald McCullin , a self - described " war - a - year " man , now lives in an isolated English manor where cabinets are filled with photos of the dead and dying .
Despite quitting , McCullin was haunted by what he had witnessed .
A switch to landscape photography was no relief : his photos still look like war zones , Eldon said .
" He 'll have this beautiful picture of a sparrow that will be dead on white snow and it looks exactly like his pictures from Vietnam or Cambodia .
It 's frightening . "
But Dan
Dot only loved adventure , he saw himself performing a public service .
Having grown up in Africa , he was concerned about the famine and civil war killing the people of Somalia .
" What really motivated Dan was the fact that he was making a difference , " his sister said .
" There he was at 21 and was making the double middle - page spread of Time and Newsweek .
He was driven by the fact that he was actually galvanising people into action . "
Once Eldon believed her older brother was invincible .
Dubbed by colleagues the Mayor of Mogadishu , Somalia 's capital , Dan seemed to know everyone and fear nothing .
But Eldon saw her brother grow increasing tense after his stints in the war - ravaged country .
" I was concerned because when you 're in a war zone you 're so aware of the fragility of life .
And you 're always on the edge and it's very difficult to sustain that when you go back to normal life .
That 's why some people get into drugs . "
Despite Dan 's enthusiasm , the conflict wore on him and he said he had " had enough " just before he was killed .
He was not addicted to war coverage , she said , and had thoughts of attending film school and making movies .
Dan , whose spirit is " very much around and challenging me to take bigger risks " , also left 17 journals of his travels around the world .
He filled the pages with photos , drawings and neatly penned writings .
Parts of the colourful , complex pages appear in The Journey Is the Destination , published in 1997 .
The actual notebooks are carefully preserved by Amy and her family .
" My mother calls them her grandchildren , " Eldon said .
In her documentary , she questions veteran correspondents about why they keep returning to combat zones despite the grimness .
Seven journalists were interviewed extensively , including long - time BBC foreign correspondent Martin Bell and CNN 's chief international correspondent , Christiane Amanpour .
" There are certain people who have to do what they do and it can't be explained , " Amanpour said .
Bell takes a humble approach : " We can't be heroes because we can get out when we want , " he told Eldon .
Asked if she thinks about the moment of her brother 's murder , when a mob of enraged Somalis beat him and three other photographers to death , Eldon says no .
" His death was a teaspoon of his life .
It was such a brief thing .
And the rest was just a tremendous life filled with love and joy . "
- Reuter Source : The Dominion Thursday 17 September 1998 Trauma , Torment of War Reporters by Carlin Romano Review of the book Journalists Under Fire : The Psychological Hazards of Covering War by Anthony Feinstein , Johns Hopkins University Press .
' What makes a good newspaperman ? " New York Herald Tribune city editor Stanley Walker famously asked in 1928 .
His reply to that rhetorical question became journalistic lore .
" The answer is easy , " Walker wrote .
" He knows everything ...
His brain is the repository of the accumulated wisdom of the ages ...
He can go for nights without sleep .
He dresses well and talks with charm .
He hates lies and meanness and sham ...
When he dies , a lot of people are sorry , and some remember him for several days . "
The New York Times revived that part - heroic , part - sardonic image of the newspaperman Thursday when , without fear ( and with just a little favour ) , it devoted part of its front page and its entire inside obituary section to one of its own : " R W Apple Jr , Times Globe - Trotter Dies at 71 . "
Over more than 40 years as a correspondent and editor , the Times reported , " Johnny " Apple " wrote from more than 100 countries about war and revolution , politics and government , food and drink , and the revenge of living well ... "
By any standard of the trade , Apple deserved a salute .
He fulfilled the popular image of the American foreign correspondent as a stylish , charismatic , invulnerable character who jets in , gets the story , keeps ( in Apple 's case ) his traveling pepper mill by his side , and makes it home undamaged in time for his daughter 's wedding .
But there 's a far - less - covered side to this trade , and it's the singular feat of Toronto psychiatrist Anthony Feinstein 's Journalists Under Fire to turn his own clinician 's light on it .
Feinstein quotes from the memoir of another former Times foreign correspondent , Chris Hedges , who provides a searing foreword to this book .
In War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning , Hedges writes of his goodbye to what Feinstein describes as three " harrowing " trips to El Salvador 's civil war :
My last act was , in a frenzy of rage and anguish , to leap over the KLM counter in the airport in Costa Rica because of a perceived slight by a hapless airline clerk .
I beat him to the floor as his bewildered colleagues locked themselves in the room behind the counter .
Blood streamed down his face and mine .
I refused to wipe the dried stains off my cheeks on the flight to Madrid , and I carry a scar on my face from where he thrust his pen into my cheek .
War 's sickness had become my own .
Feinstein studs his study with such examples of war journalists falling to pieces , experiencing post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) or depression .
Among the symptoms : uncontrolled anger , distressing images and flashbacks , estrangement from others , troubled sleep , hypervigilance ( such as hitting the ground when a child pops a balloon ) .
Veteran ITN cameraman Jon Steele , at the outset of his memoir , War Junkie , drolly recalls his " emotional disintegration " one day at Heathrow 's Terminal Four : " Attention , Club World and World Traveller passengers .
British Airways is happy to announce the nervous breakdown of Jon Denis Steele at check - in counter twenty . "
London Times reporter Anthony Loyd remains haunted by a Chechen woman who brandished the bloody leg of a bombed family member .
British photographer Jon Jones still sees a particular child 's severed head under a blanket .
A witness to Rwanda 's genocide lifts a glass of champagne to his lips in London and immediately takes in the " smell of corpses ... .
That has happened a lot , the sense that the smell was all over you ... it would not go away . "
According to Feinstein , " nowhere in the countless pages of journals devoted to psychological trauma is there a single piece of research on war journalists . "
Filling that gap , he 's conducted multiple surveys and many interviews .
In one of Feinstein 's surveys that analyzed 110 male and 30 female war journalists , " 29 % of the group had met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD over the course of long careers , " compared with about 5 % of the general public .
Feinstein covers plenty of territory : the special torments of mothers and freelancers among war correspondents ; the brutal effect of war journalism on relationships with spouses ; the so - called adrenaline junkies among foreign hands ; the dysfunctional - family backgrounds of many attracted to foreign coverage ; the impact on " domestic " reporters covering incidents like 9/11 .
What sticks , though , is the flip side to the upbeat R W Apple image of foreign correspondence .
" It slowly takes away your smile , " says South African photographer João Silva of the work .
One veteran sees dead colleagues walking toward him .
Another can no longer eat meat .
" Do not delude yourself into thinking , " the BBC's Allan Little tells others , " that you can swan in and swan out of other people 's wars year after year and not be affected ... "
Feinstein believes that journalistic organizations should take more responsibility for the mental health of their foreign correspondents and that newspapers do worse in that regard than broadcasters .
What 's clear is that while some may remember a journalist for just " several days , " war journalists never forget what they 've seen on our behalf , and they 're never quite the same .

Waiting Day
Our bowls clanking
like ghost vessels ,
we stand against sun and wind ,
and death that loops over
to take our vision ;
when all else has deserted us
in the blankness of the hour
the horizon , our last scene ,
comes at us
from where no sun
will ever rise .

( NewsTarget ) A diet high in fat and in high fructose corn syrup may cause severe liver problems in people with a sedentary lifestyle , according to a study conducted by researchers from Saint Louis University and presented this year at the Digestive Diseases Week meeting in Washington , D.C.
Researchers fed mice a diet that was 40 percent fat and high in high fructose corn syrup for 16 weeks .
In contrast to other studies , where mice have been fed a regulated amount , the animals in the study were allowed to eat as much as they wanted .
They were kept sedentary and prevented from exercising .
" We wanted to mirror the kind of diet many Americans subsist on , so the high fat content is about the same you 'd find in a typical McDonald 's meal , and the high fructose corn syrup translates to about eight cans of soda a day in a human diet , which is not far off with what some people consume , " said Brent Tetri , M.D. , an associate professor of internal medicine at Saint Louis University Liver Center .
To the researchers ' shock , it took only four weeks for the first signs of serious health problems to emerge .
" We had a feeling we'd see evidence of fatty liver disease by the end of the study , " Tetri said .
" But we were surprised to find how severe the damage was and how quickly it occurred .
It took only four weeks for liver enzymes to increase and for glucose intolerance -- the beginning of Type 2 diabetes -- to begin .
" According to Tetri , preliminary research suggests that fructose actually suppresses the body 's feeling of fullness , whereas foods rich in fiber activate it .
This meant that the mice did n't know when to stop eating , even though their diet was exceptionally high in calories .
High fructose corn syrup is a widely used sweetener , particularly in the United States , where corn is cheap and sugar importation is expensive .
" A high - fat and sugar - sweetened diet compounded by a sedentary lifestyle will have severe repercussions for your liver and other vital organs , " Tetri warned .
After their victory in the 2006 Congressional elections , it seemed a given that Democrats would try to make this year ’s presidential campaign another referendum on Republican policies .
After all , the public appears fed up not just with President Bush , but with his party .
For example , a recent poll by the Pew Research Center shows Democrats are preferred on every issue except terrorism .
They even have a 10 - point advantage on “ morality . ”
Add to this the fact that perceptions about the economy are worsening week by week , and one might have expected the central theme of the Democratic campaign to be “ throw the bums out . ”
But a funny thing happened on the way to the 2008 election .
Unless Hillary Clinton wins big on Tuesday , Barack Obama will be the Democratic nominee .
And he ’s not at all the kind of candidate one might have expected to emerge out of the backlash against Republican governance .
Now , nobody would mistake Mr. Obama for a Republican  although contrary to claims by both supporters and opponents , his voting record places him , with Senator Clinton , more or less in the center of the Democratic Party , rather than in its progressive wing .
Arizona is poised to take another record .
It 's about as unwelcome as a couple of other firsts – No. 1 in the nation for most illegal immigrants crossing the border , or No. 1 in the nation for identity thefts .
This " one " directly corresponds with another No. 1 – its status as the fastest - growing state in the nation .
While news of global warming becomes as common as the wheeze of air conditioners here , Phoenix is fighting a different , if related , problem .
In part because of heavy growth – particularly in the Phoenix metro area – heat is being reflected , trapped , and absorbed in concrete , rooftops , and a maze of buildings that blocks wind .
At the same time , there 's little vegetation to absorb the heat , and high energy usage generates more .
It 's called the " urban heat - island effect , " and whatever the impact of global warming here , this phenomenon is sending the mercury rising .
On Tuesday , Phoenix tied the all - time record of 28 days at 110 degrees or greater in one summer , reached in 1979 and again in 2002 .
If the temperature rises to 110 degrees one more day this year , Phoenix will set a record .
" We 're forecasting 111 for Wednesday , 109 for Thursday , and 110 again on Friday , " says Keith Kincaid , a forecaster with the National Weather Service here .
But if the temperature does n't hit 110 on those days , he adds , " we have had 110 - degree days in September before . "
This summer is hot elsewhere , to be sure .
But in few places can you fry an egg on a sidewalk as quickly and thoroughly as you can here .
And you 'd have to fry a lot of them : Experts say the main reason the number of 110 - degree - or - higher days has risen so steadily – and steeply – is rapid growth .
In the 1950s , for example , the temperature rose to 110 or higher an average of 6.7 days per year .
In the 1960s it was 10.3 days per year ; in the 1980s it was 19 days per year , and in the 2000s ( through Aug. 21 , 2007 ) , 21.9 per year , according to the National Weather Service .
For Westerners living here , it 's about as much fun as an earthquake , a drought , or , well , a 110 - degree day .
But it does have people 's attention .
True , it 's not as difficult as this summer 's devastating floods or fires elsewhere in the US .
Many people have swimming pools , and most have air conditioning .
But that , too , adds to the problem of the heat - island effect , experts say .
" Every time you use that mechanical air conditioner , you 're throwing hot air back into the environment , " says Jay Golden , an expert on urban climate and energy at Arizona State University in Tempe .
" It 's not only the sun and the pavement , but we 're generating more heat because of human adaptation . "
And that 's where global warming comes in :
The hotter it is , the more we need to cool off ; and the more we try to cool off – with air conditioning , for instance – the more heat - trapping greenhouse gases and " waste energy " we create , feeding both phenomena .
No escape in the Phoenix nights
The lows at night are rising , too .
Three decades ago , the nighttime low here was about 30 degrees cooler than the days .
Today , it is on average only 20 degrees cooler .
That 's because cities are slower to cool off at night , retaining their heat in roads and buildings .
Dr. Golden points to differing temperatures between downtown Phoenix and a rural weather station at the Casa Grande National Monument , about 50 miles southeast .
In 1950 , he says , it was only six degrees warmer in Phoenix than at the Casa Grande Monument .
By 2000 , the temperature in Phoenix was 12 degrees higher .
Now , it is almost 14 degrees warmer in the city than in the adjacent rural areas .
That has a huge impact on water consumption and electricity generation , he says .
Researchers in his department recently calculated the correlation between nighttime temperatures and water consumption .
" A one - degree nighttime [ temperature ] increase equals 677 gallons more on average per household per year , " he says – due as much to evaporation from pools , irrigation , and agriculture as to human consumption .
Golden and his colleagues study these rises in temperatures for urban areas from here to London and Beijing .
" We are trying to do two things , " Golden says .
" One is to quantify the impacts from this national trend of climate change in the broad context … .
Then , we try to provide policymakers sound science and engineering to understand what the impacts are . "
Looking toward solutions
Here in the Phoenix area , for example , 40 percent of the heat - island effect is due to paved surfaces , according to Golden .
" We 're trying to transition to pervious pavement , which would allow for water penetration , " he says .
That , he adds , would support the growth of urban vegetation , which is typically removed for new building projects .
And urban vegetation planted at intervals , as well as the water pervious pavement retains , would lead to cooler temperatures at night .
" If we were to take all the surfaced parking lots in this city and cover them with 50 percent tree cover , " that would significantly decrease the surface temperatures , he says .
His department is also studying the survival methods of this area 's early inhabitants , such as the Hohokam with their earthen structures .
Today , two - story houses are popular , he says .
But what if policymakers were to ban future building of two - story houses – or at least upper floors – in order to make buildings shorter , and less prone to trapping heat .
Instead , housing plans could include basements , he says , which would naturally remain cooler – though the prospect of lower levels has long been considered too expensive or difficult , despite the plethora of inground pools .
The good news about these rises in temperatures , if there is any , Golden says , is that local governments are beginning to pay attention to how they design cities , how closely they space houses , and how much forestry and agriculture they plan .
Phoenix , for example , is pushing for more open - space parks with trees downtown .
And the city of Mesa is offering $ 500 rebates to residents who convert their yards from lawns to xeriscape , including desert trees that provide canopy shade .
MPs and human rights group have accused ministers of a cover - up over government knowledge of rendition flights and the use of British military bases to hold suspects after the United States launched its war on terror more than six years ago .
Now ministers have blocked an attempt by an influential parliamentary committee to secure the release of secret military papers which they believe will reveal whether the British island territory of Diego Garcia was used as a detention centre for rendition prisoners .
MPs from the All - Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition used powers under the Freedom of Information Act to request minutes of US / UK political military talks held in a Washington in September last year .

But the Government has refused to release the papers claiming that to do so " would prejudice the defence " of territory by " exposing plans to counter possible terrorist attacks " .
They also say it could damage diplomatic relations between Britain and America .
The Parliamentary Group chairman , Andrew Tyrie MP , says this is another example of government obfuscation in his committee 's attempt to get to the truth about the use of state - sanctioned kidnapping on the British island .
He has launched an appeal against the Foreign Office decision not to release the Diego Garcia documents .
" Cover - up and obfuscation by the UK government have hampered efforts to discover the truth about British involvement in the US rendition programme from day one , " he says .
" There have been repeated allegations that the US has used the British territory of Diego Garcia in its rendition programme .
Yet the Government has done next to nothing to investigate them , and continues to rely on US assurances which have been called into question by the Intelligence and Security Committee . "
The Government has been careful to say as little as possible about what it does or does n't know about US " ghost flights " in which suspects are flown from secret prisons to third party state detention centres .
In the past it has relied on US assurances that no British territory loaned to the Americans has or is being used to facilitate this illegal activity .
But the UK human rights charity Reprieve has uncovered credible evidence which it believes casts doubt on these assurances .
In its report on rendition published last year it says that Diego Garcia has been the subject of repeated , credible and concurrent claims that the island has played a major role in the US system of renditions and secret detention .
Reprieve submits that the UK's failure to conduct a prompt , independent and effective inquiry into these claims is a further clear breach of its duties under international and domestic law .
" Unlike the treatment of our clients who were apparently held there without charges or trial , we are very glad for the UK government to have a fair hearing before standing condemned of complicity in kidnapping and abuse of prisoners , " says Clive Stafford Smith , Director of Reprieve .
" But they can not simply refuse to hold a public hearing at all and expect us to believe their denials , when senior US officials have more than once admitted that Diego Garcia has been used in the illegal rendition programme . "
" It is the policy of extraordinary rendition which damages the public interest , not allowing the truth to be told about it , " says Mr Tyrie .
" That is why I am appealing against this decision , and will continue to do what I can to uncover the truth about rendition and Diego Garcia . "
In a separate move , the MPs have written to an American general asking him to give evidence about rendition on the Indian Ocean island .
General Barry McCaffrey has twice claimed in interviews with the media that detainees are being held by the US military on the island .

A lion roaring through a loop of film .
A beeping radio tower atop a spinning globe .
An art deco edifice lit by klieg lights .
A mountain peak ringed by stars .
Lady Liberty holding her torch aloft .
For some seventy years these logos or trademarks have introduced audiences to the cinematic delights to follow .
The corporate logo is symbolic of big business public relations in the twentieth century , creating instant consumer identification , and hopefully loyalty , via a brand name and an image implanted indelibly in the consumer 's mind , such as Kodak and Coca - Cola .
Early motion picture production companies were part of this trend .
The initial concept for motion picture credit titles was borrowed from live theater programmes and vaudeville , where cards identifying the current performers were displayed on an easel at the side of the proscenium .
With films , at first there was only one card which usually read : "  The Production Company  presents  Such and such  with the company logo and sometimes a copyright notice at the bottom .
If the film were an adaptation of a well known literary work , the author 's name would be included after the title .
The number of credit titles began to expand with the arrival of the Independents in 1909 and their giving credit to stars and later directors , scenarists , and cinematographers .
It was about this time that the practice of according a separate card to the production company began .
Most of these were standard artwork cards that could be photographed as needed while photographing the other cards for the production .
But according to Terry Ramsaye in A Million And One Nights ( a not totally reliable source by the way ) , some logos with motion , such as Pathe 's crowing rooster and Mutual 's clock with moving hands , also began appearing about this time .
Such logos were more complicated as any composite work had to be done in camera and therefore could not be shot anew for each of the 104 films the average company was doing each year .
As a result , a print was made of the approved composite and duplicate negatives made off this print would be spliced onto the head of the cut negative of the first reel of each release .
This has remained the standard practice for creating and duplicating film company logos ever since , though the improvement in intermediate stocks over the years has resulted in higher quality results .
In the optical sound era , approximately from 1929 to 1953 , those companies like 20th Century - Fox and RKO whose logos were accompanied by a fanfare or standard sound had a composite fine grain of the logo and track and made dupe negatives that would be spliced onto the head of the picture and track negatives of the first reel .
Where music and / or sound effects related to the specific film were also heard , or dissolved to , either a print of the logo accompaniment would be hung separately for the first reel dub session for incorporation into the dubbed negative , a practice that would be followed when magnetic dubbing became standard in the Fifties .
It is difficult to do an accurate history of American film company logos because original logos have often been replaced by more recent ones for reissue or discarded altogether when the distribution rights to a film changed hands .
Because of the loss of so many silent films or the redoing of title cards on so many of those that have survived , it 's almost impossible to write definitively on this subject as it relates to silents .
Here are overviews of the history of the logos of key American film companies of the sound era .

President Bush 's tap dance
Posted
Mar .
5 - President Bush performs a tap dance while joking with the press corps and waiting for the arrival of Sen. John McCain to the White House .
Over the last four decades , computer chips have found their way into virtually every electronic device in the world .
During that time they have become smaller , cheaper and more powerful , but , for a team of European researchers , there is still plenty of scope to push back the limits of miniaturisation .
The first generation of CMOS ( complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ) chips were based on a design process with lithographic features defining regions inside the transistors of 10 micrometres or more .
The chips in most products in use today have features more than a hundred times smaller – just 65 nanometres ( nm ) or 90nm , approximately 1,000 times less than the width of a human hair .
That may be small , but in the competitive semiconductor industry , where size is of high importance , it is not small enough .
A reduction in minimum feature size means more transistors per chip , more transistors means more computing power , and more power means electronic systems – mobile phones , PCs , satellites , vehicles , etc. – will gain in functionality and performance .
And , because the processed silicon wafers out of which chips are made are expensive ( setting up a factory to produce them costs € 3 billion ) using less of them to do more means the trend toward such devices becoming cheaper can continue .
“ The semiconductor industry is in the business of selling square millimetres of silicon .
So , by cramming more transistors into a chip you ’re delivering more capacity , more functionality and more computing power for the same price .
It ’s why things like mobile phones , LCD TVs and DVD players are coming down in price , ” notes Gilles Thomas , the director of R&D Cooperative Programs at STMicroelectronics in Crolles , France , the world ’s fifth biggest semiconductor manufacturer and Europe ’s largest semiconductor supplier .
Taking the ‘ O ’ out of CMOS
Over the last three and a half years , STMicroelectronics has coordinated two large EU - funded projects to push back the limits of miniaturisation in the semiconductor industry .
The NanoCMOS initiative , ending in June 2006 , developed the technology to create a 45nm generation ( or technology node ) of chips .

A follow - up project , called Pullnano and coordinated by Thomas , is currently working on developing nodes as small as 32nm and even 22nm .
At that diminutive size , semiconductor manufacturing is continuing to test Moore ’s Law , an assumption spelled out by Intel co-founder Gordon E Moore , in 1965 , predicting that the number of transistors that can be cost - effectively placed on a chip will double approximately every two years .
“ The work of NanoCMOS and Pullnano has moved in that direction , although there is probably 12 or 15 more years to go before we hit a practical and economical limit on how small the nodes can become , ” Thomas explains .
At the 32nm scale , in particular , quantum mechanical effects come into play in a big way .
One major problem the Pullnano researchers have solved is reducing current leakage at the logic gate by using a hafnium compound - based insulator with higher dielectric strength than traditional silicon dioxide .
“ We ’ve achieved a 100 - fold reduction in gate leakage , ” Thomas says , noting that it is the first time the oxide – the ’ O ’ in CMOS – has been replaced with a different material .
Semiconductor makers ’ “ million - dollar question ”
But as nodes keep getting smaller , a point will inevitably be reached when it is simply no longer feasible to continue to reduce the minimum feature size to make space for more transistors .
Thomas describes this point as the semiconductor industry ’s “ million - dollar question ” , although he estimates that it will probably be around the 16nm or 11nm mark .
advertisement
“ At that point it would not be economical or practical to go smaller , even though , in theory , it would be possible , ” he says .
Even so , there is still some time before that point is reached .
STMicroelectronics is due to start sampling the 45nm node semiconductors that the NanoCMOS project helped develop from next year , with a view to placing electronic systems using them in consumers ’ hands by 2009 .
By 2011 , the Switzerland - headquartered company expects to start commercialising the 32nm node semiconductors being developed in the Pullnano initiative , with a view to developing a commercially viable 22nm process a couple of years after that .
“ The 45nm process has already been validated through the production of an SRAM [ static random access memory ] chip , which we use to benchmark the performance of each generation .
We will do the same with the 32nm process , ” Thomas says .
NanoCMOS , which involved 20 partners , and Pullnano , which involves 38 partners , have helped give Europe an edge in semiconductor manufacturing , suggests Thomas , although he notes that the highly competitive sector remains dominated by American and Asian giants such as Intel and Samsung .
Nonetheless , there is plenty of room for future growth , even as chips become cheaper .
Consumers will be the biggest beneficiary of the continuation of this miniaturisation trend .
The economies of scale created within the $ 260 billion (+/- € 183 billion ) semiconductor industry have put electronics within the reach of the masses as the cost per transistor has fallen 2,500 times over the last 25 years .
This is thanks to shrinking feature sizes and to increases in transistor manufacturing capacity by a factor of some 30,000 .
“ Just look at computer memory , in the early 1970s one megabyte cost more than a house , now it costs less than a piece of candy , ” Thomas notes .

Dealing with atheists is actually easy to do .
They do n't have any evidence for their atheism , and they can't logically prove there is no God .
They can only attack the Bible and attack Christians ' ideas of God .
But , if you listen to them , you can soon find that their logic has many holes in it .
It takes practice , but you can do it .
The following statements are for copying and pasting into chat rooms .
Use them to see how atheists react .
Use them to learn how to respond better to atheists .
Please understand that these are not " stoppers . "
But , they can be challenging to atheists .
Also , see how long it takes before they become condescending .
Do not return their condescension .
Instead , ask them to give rational reasons for their positions .
In the process of interacting with them , learn how to argue with them better .

The historian J. Rufus Fears has said that one - ironic - lesson of history is that most people do not learn from history .
To the Founders of the US Constitution , history was not just a collection of past facts to be memorized - history was a blueprint to learn how to live and how government should work .
The Founder ’s application of lessons from history led to the world ’s most successful democracy and most brilliant Constitution .
If we choose to pay attention to them , these same lessons – some over 2000 years old – remain just as relevant to us today as they were to the Founders - because human nature does not change .
Tangible Lessons from History
As discussed further below , the following are some lessons from ancient Greek and Roman history that the Founders took into account when creating the Constitution :
1. People are sometimes willing to trade away individual and political freedom for food , jobs , entertainment , and / or physical security .
2. Freedom is NOT the dominant value of people throughout history ; the dominant value of people throughout history is power .
3 . As a result of 1 and 2 above , republican forms of government ( those that are run " by the people and for the people " ) are rare and they may eventually degrade into tyranny ( governments that are run by a " strong man ” emperor for himself ) .
4. A " strong man " leader may :
( a ) pit the masses of people who are poor and less educated against the political and economic elites ( elected officials , and the wealthy and more educated ) ;
( b ) use nationalism and / or war to focus the masses on external enemies ;
( c ) align with foreign powers against the traditional interests of the republic ; and
( d ) use propaganda , claim to have a monopoly on the truth , and claim to speak for " the people " .
5 . Great leaders in history have both : ( a ) the ability to rally people around their vision / world view and ( b ) they have character , virtue and a moral compass ( they follow The Golden Rule - do unto others as you would have others do unto you ) .
6 . Tyrants in history have been able to rally people around their world view , but they lack character , they lack virtue and they lack a moral compass .
Ancient Philosophers and Historians
Jefferson , Hamilton , Washington , Adams , Madison and other Founders studied the philosophers and historians of ancient Greece and Rome , including Plato , Socrates , P lutarch , Cicero , and others .
What they learned is that the Greek and Roman republics ( from approximately 700 BC to 300 AD ) , rose and then fell when the freedoms of citizens were usurped by power hungry strong men , seeking to become tyrants .
The heros of the Founders were men of virtue who valued freedom and the interests of the whole republic above their own power and interests – such as Cata , Cassius , Brutus , and Cicero .
Their villains were power - hungry and immoral demagogues , such as Caesar , Nero , Caligula and Commodus .

Their villains were power - hungry and immoral demagogues , such as Caesar , Nero , Caligula and Commodus .
Plato and Socrates
Plato and Socrates are perhaps the world ’s greatest philosophers - meaning that they have unique - and still relevant - insight and wisdom about human nature .
Plato was born in 428 BC in Athens , and he writes both in his own voice , and in dialogues with his mentor , Socrates .
In The Republic , Plato discusses the importance of morality ( " virtue " ) and how republican forms of government will eventually degrade into tyranny because of a lack of virtue .
Virtue - critical to the success of individual leaders and of republican forms of government - required 4 things : ( i ) wisdom , ( ii ) courage , ( iii ) moderation , and ( iv ) justice .
Virtuous leaders , and human beings generally , could find true happiness from truth , order and putting the interests of others before one 's own , but most people in fact live in a haze of darkness and shadows created by selfish excessive desire for money , pleasure , and honor / praise .
In a successful society , virtuous leaders have expertise ( wisdom ) ; patriots risk their lives to defend the republic ( courage ) ; the political system has specialization and balance ( moderation ) ; and there is adherence to the law ( justice ) - all of which delivers the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people .
Plato observed that elites rule for a time with virtue and put the interests of the whole republic before their own , but eventually they begin to use political power to create advantages and increase their own wealth .
The poor and those who “ work with their hands and take little part in politics ” will increasingly lose faith in the elites , and the elites will increasingly be concerned that the poor are going to revolt .
A strong man then emerges from the elite class ( oligarchy ) , but he claims to speak for the poor .
Because the poor are desperate for change , they are willing to give up their freedom for food and security , and the strong man is able to play the masses off against the elites , eventually seizing absolute power , and eliminating his enemies .
“ He also needs to constantly make war to distract people from what he is doing .
He must pander to the worst segments of society … ” The Republic by Plato
Ancient Emperors and Politicians
In Plutarch 's history - Parallel Lives - he wrote about dozens of Greek and Roman leaders , with a focus on their personal relationships and the morality of their decision making .
Lives was like a bible to the Founders because the threats to liberty that Plutarch described were directly relevant to their own experiences .
He was hated by Caesar for his integrity and for his refusal to help Caesar to usurp power .
At one point , Caesar had Cato imprisoned , but was forced to release him when the public opposed .
Cato was a Roman lawmaker born about 95 B.C.
He was a hard working , honest , thoughtful Senator , with a strong sense of justice .
He was hated by Caesar for his integrity and for his refusal to help Caesar to usurp powerAt one point , Caesar had Cato imprisoned , but was forced to release him when the public opposed .
Cato recognized Caesar for what he was , a great general who had an expansionist vision for the Roman Empire , but also an immoral person - a drunk , a womanizer , and a power - hungry politician who sought to take away freedom from the people so that he could seize absolute power for himself .
In 48 BC , there was a civil war in Rome involving Caesar and Pompey – Cato sided with Pompey .
After Caesar ’s army defeated Pompey ’s army , Caesar became emperor .
he people of Rome had a choice - they could have sided with Cato , but they chose to side with Caesar , walking away from 100s of years of freedom and self rule , largely because they wanted the food and protection .
Caesar offered Cato , Brutus and Cassius roles in his government .
Cato refused and was eventually put to death .
Brutus and Cassius joined Caesar , but later murdered him .
To the Founders , Cato was a principled martyr who stood up to a tyrant , and lost .
Cato was George Washington ’s greatest hero and he patterned his own behaviors after those of Cato .
Brutus and Cassius were also admired because , despite joining Caesar 's government , they eventually overthrew Caesar , and they were seen to have done so in an effort to restore the freedoms of the people of Rome and not for person gain .
Cicero was a brilliant philosopher , orator , and an ethical politician .
He , like Cato , stood up to the emperor in an effort to protect the freedom of the people of Rome .
For doing so , he was eventually put to death by Mark Antony - who had Cicero 's hands cut off and his tongue cut out .
Plutarch 's Parallel Lives
Other failed Roman Emperors from the first and second centuries AD , included Caligula , Commodus and Nero .
All 3 were generally uninterested in the details of the day - to - day operation of government which they left to others .
They were ruthless ( executing many around them - for example , Nero put his own mother to death ) and they were immoral ( putting their own interests , sexual perversions , and pleasures before all other concerns ) .
They used entertainment , including gladiator events , to distract the people from their loss of freedom .
They also had unrealistic views of their own abilities .
Commodus for example would publicly appear as a gladiator , but he lacked talent and surrounded himself with people who would nonetheless complement him and tell him how good he was .

Application of the Lessons of History by the Founders
From their careful study of history , the Founders concluded that immoral wealthy powerful elites are a threat to liberty , and that the people can be misled into giving up on freedom .
They had the examples of tyrants in history in mind as they constructed the checks and balances contained in the Constitution .
Founders wrote about the ancient philosophers and emperors as if they knew them .
As an example , Jefferson wrote to Adams the following : " ... [ with Rome ] steeped in corruption , vice and venality , ... what could even Cicero , Cato , Brutus have done , had it been referred to them to establish a good government for their country ?...
No government can continue good but under the control of the people ; and their people were so demoralized and depraved as to be incapable of exercising a wholesome control .
...
Their minds [ needed ] to be informed by education what is right and what wrong ; to be encouraged in habits of virtue and deterred from those of vice by the dread of punishments proportioned , indeed , but irremissible ; in all cases , to follow truth as the only safe guide ... "
I n another letter to Adams , Jefferson wrote that democracy in America encourages “ the hope that the human mind will some day get back to the freedom it enjoyed two thousand years ago . "
Jefferson Quotes on Politics and Government
In Federalist 1 , Hamilton began his justification for ratification of the Constitution , starting that " ... of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics , the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people ; commencing demagogues , and ending tyrants .

People Want Jobs and Security and They Distrust the Political Elites
The US is the richest and most powerful country in the world , but the distribution of wealth has become more unfair over time .
The country is more politically , racially and economically divided than perhaps it has been since the Civil War , and the federal government in Washington has been gridlocked and ineffective for almost 2 decades .
Some of the people who are core supporters of Trump have felt so left out , and so desperate that they just want change .
They also view the political elite class as incompetent , conflicted by international interests or just corrupt .
What Plato and others teach us about this is that people are willing to abandon their freedoms for improved economic opportunity and security .
Moreover , the friction between elites and people who are less well off can be exploited .
That does not mean that is what will happen in America today , but the lessons of history are relevant to the risk of what can happen .
Trump 's World View Does Not Appear Tyrannical
Great leaders in history have the ability to rally people around their own world view .
Trump 's world view is essentially to put " America First " by applying the " art of the deal " .
By this he means that he can negotiate more financial value to America at the expense of other countries and non-citizens .
This message - together with promises of tax cuts and fewer regulations - has gotten Trump support of the majority of Republicans , and a little less than half the overall population .
History suggests nothing especially or inherently tyrannical about this world view .
Indeed , tyrants like Hitler or Stalin had world views that were inherently evil and involved the adherence to doctrine requiring the death or domination of millions of people .
Trump has signaled intolerance of people from other cultures ( see discussion below ) , but he has not articulated or done anything close to these tyrants .
Trump seems far less motivated by his world view and far more motivated by wanting to be politically popular and to be praised and complemented .
For example , Trump does n't seem to oppose NATO because of a desire to advance a plan to dominate Europe - rather , he just seems to think that the US pays too much to NATO and that he could get a better deal .
In addition , many of his policy positions are not firmly held - he changes his mind a lot .
Trump seems more reckless and unprepared than motivated by a firmly held doctrine and world view .
( In contrast , Steve Bannon seems to have a more zealous and deeply held world view , in part based on his admiration for the Russian leader , Vladimir Lenin . )
Trump does have the ability to rally people around himself .
He 's a good marketer - " TRUMP " is literally his brand - and he's an expert at reality tv , tweeting and simple - non-elite - communications .
He can be interesting and funny - he is ( as he might say ) good for ratings .
When it comes to his world view , he seems to be more of a Nero than a Caesar .
Trump 's Tactics Do Appear Tyrannical and He Lacks a Moral Compass
Great leaders have both a vision that people rally behind and a moral compass .
President Trump puts his own interests first and he lacks a moral compass .
History teaches us that this creates the risk that his current leadership could devolve into something worse .
He has engaged in acts that mirror the behaviors of tyrants in history , including his :
( i ) mischaracterizations , lies and outright attacks on the truth ( such as claiming that millions of people committed voter fraud ) ,
( ii ) failure to disclose his tax form and address potential conflicts of interest ,
( iii ) suggestion that certain ethnic or religious groups are inherently dangerous , and promotion of immigration policies that appear more focused on fear of outsiders than legitimate security concerns ,
( iv ) lack of regard for discrimination and hate crimes that can be promoted by his rhetoric ,
( v) support of Putin - a corrupt murder and hater of freedom - such as by inviting Russia to hack the US elections , and suggesting that Putin 's Russia is American 's moral equivalent , and
( vi ) lack of respect for US democratic institutions , and attacks on the independent judiciary ( " so called judges " ) and content based attacks on independent media outlets when they do n't agree with him ( including false and cynical claims of " fake news " ) .
At his recent Press Conference , Trump stated that the people should listen to him as the source of the truth rather than assessing the truth for themselves .
" You know what it is ?
Here ’s the thing .
The public is n’t — you know , they read newspapers , they see television , they watch .
They do n’t know if it ’s true or false because they ’re not involved .
I ’m involved .
I ’ve been involved with this stuff all my life .
But I ’m involved .
So I know when you ’re telling the truth or when you ’re not .
I just see many , many untruthful things . "
Press Conference Transcript
Those statements are profoundly at odds with the underpinnings of the US system of government .
In Putin 's system , what Putin says is taken as the truth .
In America , to maintain a government by the people and for the people , it is up to every citizen to seek the truth , and be knowledgable and engaged with government policy .
Perhaps Trump has no plan to be a tyrant , but when he warms up to a tyrant like Putin , when he pits poor people against the elites ( despite being a billionaire himself ) , when he claims to speak for " the people " and to be the sole source of the truth , when he attacks the independent media as the " enemy of the people " , when he suggests that people should be feared or treated badly for being different , we know from history that he is acting like one of the oligarchs straight out of Plutarch 's Parallel Lives or Plato 's The Republic - and that those stories do n't end well for the people .
The Founders believed that self interest , pride , greed and excessive overconfidence ( what the Greeks called " hubris " ) cannot be the core characteristics of our leaders , or we will devolve into tyranny .
T o avoid tyranny , our leaders and our system of government must strive for virtue .
Trump may not be a tyrant , but he does lack wisdom , courage , justice and moderation .
Supporters and opponents tend to view President Trump as either uniquely good or uniquely bad , but in certain respects , history has seen leaders like Trump before and we can learn from that history - if we choose to pay attention to its lessons .
In this job market , you need to STAND OUT .
A Vi gives you the edge you need .
Paparazzi Pal Brokering $ 1 M Deal For Britney Spears Photos
is reporting thathas been hanging exclusively with her new found paparazzi pal and confidant , .
The British photographer made headlines when he spent a wild night with the off kilter pop star just before Christmas .
The two have been together at several hotels since that widely reported episode and have hooked up again now that Britney has sprung herself from Cedars - Sinai Medical Center .
Spears claims that Ghalib is the only person she trusts .
They were seen having an early morning breakfast with a champagne mimosa yesterday at the El Paseo Daily Grill near Palm Springs .
The cocktail is three parts champagne to one part OJ .
Ghalib is said to be trying to broker a $ 1 million deal with Spears for exclusive photos of the psychotic wreck , at their secret hideaway .
Dr. Phil ambushed Spears as she was getting ready to bolt from her hospital confinement .
He was in her face and followed closely on her heels as she departed the building through an underground tunnel .
He is reportedly trying to help her parents to bring Britney to her senses .
He clearly missed the boat on this one .
Dr. Phil is taking this a step farther this week , reporting that he has exclusive footage and information regarding Britney 's meltdown .
He is working with Spears family in putting together the show that will air on Wednesday .
This may very well further alienate the already over the edge pop star .
What will happen next is anyone 's guess .
God help the very troubled young woman .
The recession threat , credit crisis , housing market correction and weak dollar have many Americans looking for someone to blame .
Potential targets abound .
In the case of the subprime collapse — still the biggest negative influence on the economy — everyone seems to share responsibility .
Aspiring home owners took on more debt than they could handle , real estate speculators assumed home prices would rise forever , and mortgage lenders made reckless loans because they were able to sell off the risk .
Investment banks packaged the loans into complex securities that even the banks themselves were apparently unable to understand , and the rating agencies supposedly dedicated to disclosing the underlying riskiness cheerfully went along for the ride .
Aiming higher , some critics are blaming the Federal Reserve for subprime as well as the greater state of the economy .
Here are the criticisms they are likely to voice .
Interest rates too low for too long
The argument : Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan ’s tenure was marked by aggressive interest rate cuts , beginning after the stock market of 1987 .
That initial move helped to prevent wider economic consequences , but rate cuts in the late 90 ’s made startup capital too easy to come by and helped cause to the dot - com bubble .
Similarly , failing to raise rates in the past few years encouraged the wave of short - sighted , frenzied borrowing that ended so abruptly in 2007 .
Selective attention
The argument :
The Fed always keeps its eyes peeled for signs of inflation , which manifests itself primarily in the prices of goods and services .
That means the Fed is keen to deflate any " bubbles " it sees in these markets by taking money out of the economy .
It devotes a similar amount of attention to employment figures .
Bubbles developing elsewhere , such as in the prices of assets like houses , get lost in the mix .
And under Greenspan , they were knowingly disregarded .
One critic thinks , " Mr. Greenspan consistently argued that central banks have no legitimacy to intervene to prevent asset price bubbles , and to substitute their judgment for that of millions of market participants .
But central banks have no problem whatsoever intervening when they think that product prices are inflating , or when labor markets are overheating . "
Stumped by the " conundrum "
The argument :
The Fed did dramatically raise the target for its most important rate between mid-2004 and mid-2006 , but real life interest rates did n’t follow .
Greenspan called the phenomenon a " conundrum . "
One explanation is that the global spread of capitalism has increased the demand for U.S. debt and thereby made investors settle for lower returns ( i.e. , lower interest rates ) .
This external market force has " substantially weakened " the Fed , according to an economist in the Fed ’s Dallas branch .
It follows that the central bank ’s reliance on setting interest rate goals first — and following up by changing the money supply afterwards — is outdated .
The eminent economist Milton Friedman , for one , said about a year ago that he was " puzzled " by the current order of operations .
The " Greenspan put " The argument :
The Fed lowered its target for interest rates in 1998 after a major hedge fund collapse .
Some on Wall Street subsequently claimed that the Fed under Greenspan ’s leadership was artificially supporting the securities markets by manipulating monetary policy .
Taking a term from stock options trading , they called this perceived strategy a " put " because it seemed to guarantee a minimum value below which security prices would not fall , regardless of downturns in the market .
Financial market participants took excessive risks , believing the Fed would rescue them if things got too bad .
That recklessness seems to have carried over into the lending practices that created the subprime disaster .
Reward for bad behavior
The argument : Just as the Greenspan put encouraged bad behavior , Fed policy in the wake of the economic slowdown seems to reward it .
Financial stocks have been justifiably hammered in recent months , but the Fed ’s recent economic interventions are tailored to bailing them out first .
As one critic has noted , " It has not been lost on the Wall Street titans that the government is the reliable first responder to scenes of financial distress , or that there will always be enough paper dollars to go around to assist the very largest of financial institutions " ( see next link ) .
Bear markets must coexist with bull markets in a truly free market , but the Fed seems bent on eliminating all but the upside .
That might work in the short term , but not long afterwards .
Moreover , it ’s not capitalism at all , but a sort of " socialism for the rich . "
Warning signs ignored
The argument : Early subprime whistleblowers , including a senior Fed official , tried in vain to elicit a reaction from the Fed .
It ’s true that the Fed should never act as a regulator , but it could have easily called for lending reform .
Instead , it did nothing , apparently viewing the environment of deceptively easy credit as a means of propping up the economy and achieving the White House ’s much touted " ownership society . "
Too little too late
The argument :
If the Fed has committed to a strategy of lowering target interest rates , it should commit fully and make more significant cuts .
Wall Street clearly voiced this argument last month , when it drove the Dow down by almost 300 points after the Fed cut its benchmark rate by one a quarter of a percent rather than a half .
The traders ’ opinion is biased , of course , but the stock market they control is , for better or worse , the most prominent indicator of the state of the economy .
The Fed might have erred on the side of caution , given that a more drastic rate cut would fuel inflation , but critics think it simply extended its penchant for inaction .
Wrong on inflation
The argument : The Fed ’s view of inflation has two significant flaws .
First , it focuses on " core inflation , " which excludes energy and food costs , rather than " headline inflation , " which includes them .
European economists , who favor headline inflation markers — and , by extension , believe that extremely high energy prices are a long - term phenomenon — are taking the Fed to task .
Second , the Fed ’s comments on inflation seem to confuse cause and effect .
Opening the discount window
The argument :
The Fed is placing a rare emphasis on it ’s own lending capacity , known as the discount window , rather than the lending that occurs between banks in the private sector .
The central bank has decreased the rate it charges on direct loans by 1.5 percent since September , while lowering its target for loans between other banks by only one percent .
In December it also established a special mechanism , known as the Term Action Facility , for discount window auctions , and at least two auctions will occur through it in January .
The first couple auctions at the end of last year were quite successful , but a heavy reliance on discount window operations does not have any real precedent .
No one can predict whether it will be successful .
In addition , the Fed is still working out several kinks that have made this type of lending undesirable in the past .
Now might not be the best time for experimentation .
The Austrian take The argument :
No survey of criticisms directed at the Fed can be complete without mention of the seemingly radical argument that the Fed should not exist at all .
Proponents of this view , most of whom come from the " Austrian School " of economics , believe the very basis of current monetary policy is flawed .
They think all dollars should be backed by an asset like gold , as they theoretically were until as recently as the ’ 70s , or at least exist in the reserves of banks .
The " fractional reserve " system the Fed now oversees , in which only a small amount of the money supply can readily be withdrawn from banks , causes an artificial business cycle of " booms " and " busts . "
The most prominent Fed abolitionist these days is Presidential candidate Ron Paul , who squarely blames the existence of the Fed for the economic events of recent months .
Thousands of protesters converged on the Berkshire village of Aldermaston yesterday to commemorate the birth of Britain 's anti-nuclear movement in an act of mass defiance against the Government 's plans to curb protests at the headquarters of Britain 's nuclear weapons programme .
The protest was called to mark the 50 th anniversary of the first march to Aldermaston when up to 10,000 people walked from London to the Atomic Weapons Establishment to protest against nuclear testing .
The Easter 1958 march coincided with the creation of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) and was widely credited with starting the world 's first mass anti-nuclear movement .
Coaches from 50 different locations brought up to 3,000 activists from as far as Aberdeen and Penzance where they converged on six of the gates leading into the facility , where Britain 's Trident nuclear warheads are manufactured and maintained .
The protest at each gate was themed to mark a particular decade of anti-nuclear campaigning from the 1950s onwards and was visited by a moving float of speakers who included veterans from the original peace march , anti-nuclear MPs , the designer Vivienne Westwood and one of the few remaining survivors of Hiroshima .

Yoshio Sato , 77 , lost his family when the US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima , which together with the Japanese city of Nagasaki is the only place in the world to have suffered a nuclear attack .
" I lost my mother , brother and younger sister , " he said .
" My mother died one month after the bombing , my sister took six months to die .
Atomic bombs and nuclear weapons must not be allowed to survive . "
Many of those participating in yesterday 's protest were veterans of the original march to Aldermaston .
Pat Arrowsmith , now 78 and still a member of CND , was a nurse at the time of the first march and helped organise accommodation for the protesters .
" I think Aldermaston was a pivotal moment in the anti-nuclear movement , " she said .
" It might not have been as dramatic as the demonstrations that involved civil disobedience but we all knew we were partaking in something that was truly significant and historical . "
Yesterday 's protest also focused attention on government plans to ban protests at Aldermaston , a move that would outlaw the Aldermaston 's Women 's Peace Camp , one of the most famous and potent symbols of protest in British political history .
Struggling to stay warm around a fire , veterans of the camp said they would continue to defy any attempts to remove it .
" We have a right to protest and we intend to keep it , " said Rebecca Johnson , who helped found the camp 23 years ago .
" Civil society protest is one of the few ways to initiate change in this country . "
The poor weather may have deterred many people from travelling but the protest still attracted thousands of demonstrators , including a woman aged 102 .
Margaret Morton , a Quaker in her mid-seventies who travelled from her home from near Glasgow , said : " I 'm not here to celebrate the past .
I care about the present and the future .
Aldermaston is the centre of Britain 's nuclear weapons programme .
How can we hope to persuade other countries to give up their bombs when we still have ours ? "
Walter Wolfgang , the 84 - year - old Labour Party activist and CND founding member who was famously evicted from a Labour party conference for heckling Jack Straw , said he believed the world was a more dangerous place now than during the Cold War .
" On the one hand , we have made progress , but on the other hand , because of US and UK foreign policy , the danger is greater , " he said .
" At least during the Cold War we were vaguely aware of what the other side was doing . "
Health Insurance Innovation ?
By Arnold Kling
Tyler Cowen waxes romantic .
Let me also tell you my ideal world .
Insurance companies are judged by honest third party intermediaries .
Insurance companies compete like heck to make customers satisfied .
Insurance companies monitor doctors , read Robin Hanson , and require evidence - based medicine .
Insurance companies which fail at these pursuits either go bankrupt or they must abide by an ex ante contract to permit the exile of their CEOs to Greenland .
Every year prices would fall in real terms , quality would improve , and coverage would be expanded .
I doubt it .
The insurance industry may be the only private - sector institution that I trust less than government .
In auto insurance , I find that unless I change providers every few years , my premiums just get ratcheted up for no reason .
I think that life insurance is a huge rip - off , particularly considering that it starts out with a tremendous tax advantage .
I do not trust my fellow consumers to understand the concept of insurance well enough to make insurance companies offer products that make sense .
Too many consumers think that good insurance is something that provides payouts for small problems rather than protection against rare catastrophes .
In fact , as I have pointed out before , most people do not want insurance of any sort .
They get homeowners ’ insurance to satisfy the mortgage lender .
They get car insurance to satisfy the state .
They get health insurance only when they think their employers are “ giving ” it to them .
The insurance industry is heavily regulated , and it has gotten quite cozy with that arrangement .
My guess is that something like the Massachusetts health care mandate , which completely eliminates any meaningful form of competition but which leaves the private insurance companies still standing , appeals to the typical insurance company .
My wife recently sought information on long - term care insurance .
What I concluded is that we would be trading one risk for another .
Now , we face the risk that long - term care would eat up our savings .
If we had insurance , we would face the risk that the insurance company would not pay a claim , because of how it reads the fine print in the contract .
I ’d rather take the risk I understand –having my savings not accumulate –than the risk I do not understand–getting into a dispute with the insurance company over a large claim .
I think that meaningful innovation in health care is more likely to come from Wal - Mart than from Aetna .
But Wal - Mart is likely to be thwarted by the credentials lobbies .
If practice regulations and licensing were not a factor , Wal - Mart could rely less on formal schooling and more on internal training for its medical workers .
Then you would see real improvements in quality and reductions in cost .
For 30 years , Rock the Vote has revolutionized the way we use pop culture , music , art , and technology to engage young people in politics and build our collective power .
At our company - wide get together last December we decided that 2008 was going to be a year of workplace experiments .
Among other things , we discussed how we could make 37 signals one of the best places in the world to work , learn , and generally be happy .
Here ’s are a few of the things we ’ve implemented so far :
Shorter work weeks
Last summer we experimented with 4 - day work weeks .
People should enjoy the weather in the summer .
We found that just about the same amount of work gets done in four days vs. five days .
So if that ’s the case we could either push everyone to work harder during those five days or we could just skip one of those days .
We decided to skip one of those days .
So recently we ’ve instituted a four - day work week as standard .
We take Fridays off .
We ’re around for emergencies , and we still do customer service / support on Fridays , but other than that work is not required on Fridays .
Three - day weekends mean people come back extra refreshed on Monday .
Three - day weekends mean people come back happier on Monday .
Three - day weekends mean people actually work harder and more efficiently during the four - day work week .
Funding people ’s passions
We decided that 37signals would help people pay for their passions , interests , or other curiosities .
We want our people to experience new things , discover new hobbies , and generally be interesting people .
For example , Mark has recently taken up flight lessons .
37 signals is helping him pay for those .
If someone wants to take cooking lessons , we ’ll help pay for those .
If someone wants to take a woodworking class , we ’ll help pay for that .
Part of the deal is that if 37 signals helps you pay , you have to share what you ’ve learned with everyone .
Not just everyone at 37signals , but everyone who reads our blog .
So expect to see some blog posts about these experiences .
Discretionary spending accounts
We ’re in the process of giving everyone at 37 signals a credit card .
If you want a book or some software or you want to go to a conference , it ’s on us .
We just ask people to be reasonable with their spending .
If there ’s a problem , we ’ll let the person know .
We ’d rather trust people to make reasonable spending decisions than assume people will abuse the privilege by default .
We ’ll post updates if we have them
The ideas above are active experiments .
We ’ll report back if we learn anything – good or bad – about what we ’re doing and how it ’s working .

BAGHDAD , Feb 8 ( IPS ) – Now that the smoke has cleared and the rubble settled , residents of a group of bombed Iraqi villages see the raid as really a U.S. loss .
Many Iraqis view the attack Jan. 10 by bombers and F - 16 jets on a cluster of villages in the Latifiya district south of Baghdad as overkill .
“ The use of B1 bombers shows the terrible failure of the U.S. campaign in Iraq , ” Iraqi Major General Muhammad al - Azzawy , a military researcher in Baghdad , told IPS .
“ U.S. military and political tactics failed in this area , and that is why this massacre .
This kind of bombing is usually used for much bigger targets than small villages full of civilians .
This was savagery . ”
The attack on Juboor and neighbouring villages just south of Baghdad had begun a week earlier with heavy artillery and tank bombardment .
The attack followed strong resistance from members of the mainly Sunni Muslim al - Juboor tribe against groups that residents described as sectarian death squads .
“ On Jan. 10 , huge aircraft started bombing the villages , ” Ahmad Alwan from a village near Juboor told IPS .
“ We took our families and fled .
We have never seen such bombardment since the 2003 American invasion .
They were bombing everything and everybody . ”
Residents said two B1 bombers and four F - 16 fighter jets dropped at least 40,000 pounds of explosives on the villages and plantations within a span of 10 minutes .
“ The al - Qaeda name is used once more to destroy another Sunni area , ” Akram Naji , a lawyer in Baghdad who has relatives in Juboor told IPS .
“ Americans are still supporting Iranian influence in Iraq by cleansing Baghdad and surroundings of Sunnis . ”
The cluster of Sunni villages was bombed just weeks after the U.S. military encouraged families to return to their village after heavy bombing earlier in which scores of people were killed .
Many residents had fled fearing sectarian death squads , which they say were backed by the U.S .
Few people in the village now talk the language of reconciliation of U.S. President George W. Bush and of some Iraqis in the U.S. - backed government in Baghdad .
“ We have no alternative but to fight this occupation and its allies , ” a former army officer in Baghdad speaking on condition of anonymity told IPS .
“ We can see clearly now that Americans came with the idea that we , Sunni Arabs , are the enemies they have in mind no matter what we do to please them .
We will fight for our existence , and this massacre will not go unpunished . ”
“ It was a miracle that I could evacuate my family at the last minute , ” said Omar Hussein , who fled for Dora in Baghdad from the bombarded area .
“ My house and farm are on the outskirts of the village .
I took my family out the minute I saw the aircraft in the sky .
“ Apache helicopters later fired at the trucks that were carrying the families out of the area , and killed so many civilians .
They took some wounded people to their military base .
I am sure hundreds of people would have been killed .
It is just like the Fallujah crime . ”
Thousands died in prolonged attacks on Fallujah to the west of Baghdad , particularly in 2004 and 2005 .
Taha Muslih al - Joboory , his wife and three sons were among those reported killed in the bombing .
Juboory was an Iraqi journalist who lived all his life in the area .
Many families were reported buried under the rubble of their houses .
The U.S. military said that the aircraft which bombed the area targeted “ suspected militant hide - outs , storehouses and defensive positions . ”
“ We know they will get away with their crime now , but we will teach our children that America and the whole West are our enemies , so that they take revenge for these crimes , ” 35 - year - old Nada , a woman who has relatives in the village told IPS .

Scientists funded by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ( NIDCD ) have found that , when jazz musicians are engaged in the highly creative and spontaneous activity known as improvisation , a large region of the brain involved in monitoring one ’s performance is shut down , while a small region involved in organizing self - initiated thoughts and behaviors is highly activated .
The researchers propose that this and several related patterns are likely to be key indicators of a brain that is engaged in highly creative thought .
During the study , six highly trained jazz musicians played the keyboard under two scenarios while in the functional MRI scanner .
Functional MRI ( fMRI ) is an imaging tool that measures the amount of blood traveling to various regions of the brain as a means of assessing the amount of neural activity in those areas .
Three - dimensional surface projection of activations and deactivations associated with improvisation during the Jazz paradigm .
Medial prefrontal cortex activation , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex deactivation , and sensorimotor activation can be seen .
The scale bar shows the range of t- scores ; the axes demonstrate anatomic orientation .
Abbreviations : a , anterior ; p , posterior ; d , dorsal ; v , ventral ; R , right ; L , left .
“ The ability to study how the brain functions when it is thinking creatively has been difficult for scientists because of the many variables involved , ” said James F. Battey , Jr. , M.D. , Ph.D. , director of the NIDCD .
“ Through some creative thinking of their own , these researchers designed a protocol in which jazz musicians could play a keyboard while in the confines of a functional MRI scanner .
And in doing so , they were able to pinpoint differences in how the brain functions when the musicians are improvising as opposed to playing a simple melody from memory . ”
The study was conducted by researchers of NIDCD ’s Division of Intramural Research .
Authors on the study are Charles J. Limb , M.D. , who was then a research fellow with NIDCD , and Allen R. Braun , M.D. , chief of the division ’s Language Section .
Dr. Limb is now an otolaryngologist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and faculty member at the university ’s Peabody Conservatory of Music .
The first scenario , called the Scale paradigm , was based on a simple C major scale .
Using only their right hand , the volunteers first played the scale up and down in quarter notes , an activity they , as accomplished musicians , had performed many times before .
Next , they were asked to improvise , though they were limited to playing quarter notes within the C major scale .
“ Although the musicians were indeed improvising , it was a relatively low - level form of improvisation , musically speaking , ” said Limb .
The second scenario , called the Jazz paradigm , addressed higher level musical improvisation .
This paradigm was based on a novel blues melody written by Limb that the volunteers had memorized beforehand .
Again , using only their right hand , the musicians would play the tune exactly as they had memorized it , only this time accompanied through headphones by a pre-recorded jazz quartet .
When they were asked to improvise , the musicians listened to the same audio background , but they were free to spontaneously play whatever notes they wished .
All of this was accomplished while the musicians lay on their backs with their heads and torsos inside an fMRI scanner and their knees bent upward .
The plastic keyboard , which was shortened to fit inside the scanner and which had its magnetic parts removed for safety , rested on the musicians ’ knees .
A mirror placed over the volunteers ’ eyes , together with the headphones , helped the musicians see and hear what they were playing .
The resulting fMRI scans recorded the amount of change in neural activity — increases and decreases — between the improvised and memorized versions .
Turning Off ‘ the Monitor ’
One notable finding was that the brain scans were nearly identical for the low - level and high - level forms of improvisation , thus supporting the researchers ’ hypothesis that the change in neural activity was due to creativity and not the complexity of the task .
If the latter were the case , there would have been a more noticeable difference between the Scale and Jazz paradigms , since the Jazz paradigm was significantly more complex .
Moreover , the researchers found that much of the change between improvisation and memorization occurred in the prefrontal cortex , the region of the frontal lobe of the brain that helps us think and problem - solve and that provides a sense of self .
Interestingly , the large portion responsible for monitoring one ’s performance ( dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ) shuts down completely during improvisation , while the much smaller , centrally located region at the foremost part of the brain ( medial prefrontal cortex ) increases in activity .
The medial prefrontal cortex is involved in self - initiated thoughts and behaviors , and is very active when a person describes an event that has happened to him or makes up a story .
The researchers explain that , just as over - thinking a jump shot can cause a basketball player to fall out of the zone and perform poorly , the suppression of inhibitory , self - monitoring brain mechanisms helps to promote the free flow of novel ideas and impulses .
While this brain pattern is unusual , it resembles the pattern seen in people when they are dreaming .
Another unusual finding was that there was increased neural activity in each of the sensory areas during improvisation , including those responsible for touch , hearing and vision , despite the fact that there were no significant differences in what individuals were hearing , touching and seeing during both memorized and improvised conditions .
“ It ’s almost as if the brain ramps up its sensorimotor processing in order to be in a creative state , ” said Limb .
The systems that regulate emotion were also engaged during improvisation .
“ One important thing we can conclude from this study is that there is no single creative area of the brain — no focal activation of a single area , ” said Braun .
“ Rather , when you move from either of the control tasks to improvisation , you see a strong and consistent pattern of activity throughout the brain that enables creativity . ”

A friend wrote up a nice white paper explaining the other John McCain FEC scandal ( this one has nothing to do with the blond lobbyist ) .
I asked him to write up something that was 3 paragraphs long and explained in simple English what this scandal is about .
He did an excellent job , please read this , it ’s bad :
Here ’s what it means and why it ’s important .
When John McCain ’s campaign was strapped for cash John McCain opted into the campaign financing system by requesting certification that he was eligible to collect federal money .
As the New Hampshire primary approached and John McCain was broke he took material advantage of the system by using the promise of matching funds to borrow money to keep his campaign afloat .
And he took advantage of a rule that gives candidates who take public financing automatic ballot access on ballots in several states .
( Governor Dean estimated that he spent 3 million dollars in 2004 getting on ballots in states because he had opted out of the public financing system . )
Once John McCain had taken advantage of the system by gaining ballot access and securing a campaign saving loan , he won the New Hampshire primary and became the apparent nominee of the Republican Party .
He then sent a letter saying that he was opting out of the primary process and claiming that the FEC is now impotent to stop him .
If John McCain is forced to stay in the matching system he will only be allowed to spend $ 56 million dollars before the Republican convention in September .
As of the end of January John McCain had already spent $ 49 million dollars meaning that today he ’s either close to the cap or over the amount of money he can spend during the primary .
What does it mean for John McCain ?
It ’s yet another issue where John McCain tries to legislate one way and do something completely different .
In this case it has to do with campaign finance issues .
As Brad Smith , the former Republican FEC commissioner noted , if McCain drops out of the system the FEC will subpoena McCain , and his staff during and their records to determine whether they violated the law .
If they ’re found to be in violation of the law they can be fined up to $ 25,000 and they can be jailed for up to five years .
What happened today ?
Governor Dean announced that the DNC will be filing an FEC complaint against John McCain tomorrow .
The complaint will ask the FEC to investigate whether John McCain has broken campaign finance law by taking advantage of federal matching funds to secure a loan , get on the ballot automatically in states and break that commitment by trying to get around spending limits .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp Vice Chairman Bob Lutz has defended remarks he made dismissing global warming as a “ total crock of s--- , ” saying his views had no bearing on GM ’s commitment to build environmentally friendly vehicles .
General Motors Vice Chairman Bob Lutz introduces the Chevrolet VOLT concept vehicle at the 2007 North American International Auto Show in Detroit , Michigan , January 7 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Gary Cameron
Lutz , GM ’s outspoken product development chief , has been under fire from Internet bloggers since last month when he was quoted as making the remark to reporters in Texas .
In a posting on his GM blog on Thursday , Lutz said those “ spewing virtual vitriol ” at him for minimizing the threat of climate change were “ missing the big picture . ”
“ What they should be doing in earnest is forming opinions , not about me but about GM and what this company is doing that is ... hugely beneficial to the causes they so enthusiastically claim to support , ” he said in a posting titled , “ Talk About a Crock . ”
GM , the largest U.S. automaker by sales and market share , has been trying to change its image after taking years of heat for relying too much on sales of large sport-utility vehicles like the Hummer and not moving faster on fuel - saving hybrid technology .
“ My thoughts on what has or has n’t been the cause of climate change have nothing to do with the decisions I make to advance the cause of General Motors , ” he wrote .
Lutz said GM was continuing development of the battery - powered , plug - in Chevy Volt and other alternatives to traditional internal combustion engines .
GM is racing against Toyota Motor Corp to be first to market a plug - in hybrid car that can be recharged at a standard electric outlet .
Lutz has previously said GM made a mistake by allowing Toyota to seize “ the mantle of green respectability and technology leadership ” with its market - leading Prius hybrid .
A 40 - year auto industry veteran who joined GM earlier in the decade with a mandate to shake up its vehicle line - up , Lutz is no stranger to controversy .
As part of a campaign against higher fuel economy standards , Lutz wrote in a 2006 blog posting that forcing automakers to sell smaller cars would be “ like trying to address the obesity problem in this country by forcing clothing manufacturers to sell smaller , tighter sizes . ”
Automakers ended their opposition to higher fuel standards in 2007 when it became clear that proposed changes would become law with or without their support .
In December , President George W. Bush signed a law mandating a 40 percent increase in fleetwide fuel economy by 2020 , the first substantial change in three decades .
( CNN ) -- Casualties could have been reduced by half among Marines in Iraq if specially armored vehicles had been deployed more quickly in some cases , a report to the Pentagon says .
MRAP vehicles are started up and inspected in South Carolina in January before being shipped to Iraq .
Marine Corps spokesman Col. David Lapan said the Defense Department 's inspector general wants to investigate the report 's claims that bureaucratic delays undermined the program to develop the armored vehicles .
The program was designed to provide combat forces with Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles , known by the acronym MRAPs .
The Marine Corps requested an investigation last week after receiving Marine technology expert Franz Gayl 's report .
" If the mass procurement and fielding of MRAPs had begun in 2005 in response to the known and acknowledged threats at that time , as the USMC is doing today , hundreds of deaths and injuries could have been prevented , " Gayl wrote in the report .
The report concluded that bureaucratic delays plagued the program at the height of the insurgency , when U.S. troops were regularly being attacked and killed by roadside bombs .
Watch an MRAP roll with gun blazing »
Until MRAPs began arriving in Iraq in large numbers in 2007 , troops had limited protection in armored Humvees .
Mine - resistant vehicles
The U.S. military has contracts with several manufacturers for mine - resistant , ambush - protected vehicles , or MRAPs .
The vehicles come in three categories , all of which feature a V - shaped hull to deflect the force of an explosion .
Category I
- Transports four to six personnel
- Designed for operations in confined spaces
- Missions include mounted patrols , reconnaissance and communication
Category II
- Longer version of Category I
- Carries up to 10
- Missions include leading convoys , troop transport and ambulance
Category III
- Seats five or six
- Hydraulic arm can probe suspected explosives
- Missions include ordnance disposal and mine clearing

The MRAPs , which are the newest armored vehicles , have a V - shaped hull that helps deflect the blast of a roadside bomb .
Gayl wrote the January 22 report about the MRAP program , but it is not considered an official document .
" In the past , Gayl has leveled serious charges about the wartime acquisition process ; therefore his supervisors provided him an opportunity , on government time , to conduct a series of case studies to attempt to validate his arguments , " the Marine Corps said in e-mail response to a CNN query .
" If Gayl was able to provide compelling evidence of flaws or errors in the system , his supervisors would then determine how best to address his concerns with senior Marine Corps leaders in order to effect positive change . "
In the same e-mail response , the Marine Corps explained that several improvements to acquisition have been made , and officials note that Defense Secretary Robert Gates has made MRAP a top priority .
" However , because of the seriousness of the allegations , " the Marine Corps decided to ask for the investigation .

Iraq condemns Turkish incursion Pentagon : About 8,000 ' surge ' troops to remain in Iraq
In northern Iraq on Tuesday , a bomber detonated a suicide vest , killing nine Iraqis , U.S. and Iraqi officials said .
The incident took place north of Tal Afar in Nineveh province .
Police said several al Qaeda in Iraq members were aboard the bus , and one of them detonated the device after arguing with the driver before the bus reached a checkpoint .
An earlier statement from the U.S. military said the bomber detonated his vest outside the bus after the vehicle was stopped at the checkpoint .
No security forces were among the casualties , the U.S. military said .
In central Baghdad , an Iraqi soldier was killed and four people were wounded Tuesday when a roadside bomb struck an army convoy , the Interior Ministry said .
Two of the wounded were soldiers .
U.S. troops in northern Iraq killed seven insurgents on Monday in a firefight , the military said Tuesday .
The Americans were ambushed east of Khan Bani Saad in Diyala province during a raid to capture an al Qaeda in Iraq operative , the Pentagon said .
" When the soldiers closed within 30 feet of the target house , they came under attack by small arms fire and grenades " and three U.S. troops were wounded , the military said .
" The troops , shielding the wounded with their bodies , returned fire , killing three terrorists .
A scout weapons team observed several more fighters fleeing the target house and engaged them with rockets , killing four . "
The targeted militant and another were detained , and the wounded troops were in stable condition , the military said .

Metro trains are one of the prime spots for bad behaviour in Japan
Badly behaved commuters riding on Yokohama 's public transport will soon be risking a dressing - down .
Newly appointed " etiquette police " will be asking travellers to turn down their headphones and give up their seats for their elders and betters .
The move comes amid growing concern that etiquette is losing its hallowed place in Japanese society .
A recent poll found nearly nine out of 10 respondents felt standards of public behaviour had declined .
This perceived lapse included failing to offer your seat to pregnant and elderly people , chatting loudly on mobile phones , applying make - up in public , and listening to music on " leaky " headphones .
A prime hang - out for violators was identified as Japan 's jammed commuter trains .
Ways of showing respect have become rituals in Japan
So transport authorities in Yokohama - a port city south of Tokyo - have appointed a team of manners enforcers , the Smile - Manner Squadron , to try to curb some of the bad behaviour .
The team is mostly made up of over - 60s , well acquainted with the standards of conduct associated with the " old Japan " .
But many of these enforcers will be accompanied by younger bodyguards , should their etiquette advice - diplomatically given , of course - not prove welcome .
The team members , who will be identifiable by their bright green uniforms , will have no legal powers to insist that their advice is accepted by recalcitrant passengers .
But backers of the scheme hope their refined social skills mean they will be able to charm - or shame - culprits into reforming their ways .
A 3 - foot - 1 - inch tall man with no legs propelling himself along by his hands on a skateboard tends to warrant a fair share of attention .
People stare .
Sometimes they ask questions .
Sometimes they make up stories on their own .
Montana State University film student Kevin Connolly relates a story :
In a Bozeman grocery store , a young girl the same height as him asked , " Why are you on a skateboard ? "
Mr. Connolly replied , " Because I have no legs . "
" She just stared at me and had the best question I 've ever gotten , " he says .
" ' Is it a trick ? ' "
Connolly assures that it is no trick .
He was born without legs .
While the contrast between his own experience and how people see him can make him angry and frustrated , Connolly is sympathetic to people 's curiosity ; after all , he 's a curious person himself .
When someone stares , he wants to know why .
Finding the answer has become a personal quest .
As a toddler he did n't immediately grasp that he was any different from his sisters or anyone else .
When he was older , his parents enrolled him in gymnastics and wrestling , which strengthened his upper body and gave him the ability to flip up onto counters and do handstands .
At age 10 , he started skiing , using a monoski specially designed for someone like him .
Estela Allen , a photojournalist who has worked with Connolly since he was in junior high , first spotted him aggressively racing down a ski hill .
" He has amazing agility , and amazing strength , " she says , crediting Connolly 's parents for the sense of self and the confidence he gained by getting involved with his body .
Connolly rarely uses his wheelchair , preferring his skateboard .
And a pair of jeans - clad prosthetic legs stand in his apartment as a party novelty , unused since age 12 .
" People are wanting effectively to put you in stilts , " he says .
" Why ? "
Connolly feels he 's just as able - bodied as anyone .
But he never quite adjusted to people 's stares .
On a European trip last year he got tired of it .
In what he admits to being a passive - aggressive response , Connolly looked the other way , held his camera at hip - level , and snapped a starer 's photo .
" I wanted to stare back at that guy , to let him know that , ' Yeah , I catch you looking , ' " he says .
" And the way I did that was with my camera . "
Afterward when Connolly looked at the photo , blurred from both the movement of the camera and the movement of the man , he was surprised to find he liked what he saw .
And the seed was planted for a major creative project .
The following summer , bolstered by a grant and by winnings from a second - place finish in the X Games monoski-cross – a side - by - side race for disabled skiers , Connolly packed his bag with camera gear , 14 pairs of duct - tape - reinforced gloves , and his skateboard .
He then set off on a journey around the world to explore an aspect of human nature on which he held a unique perspective .
• • •
Connolly traveled to 15 countries in three months , from New Zealand to Japan , through Europe , Iceland , and then through America until he was back in Montana .
Always shooting from the hip , he would start his days heading away from the sun , rolling through villages , and shooting people as he rolled .
He would break for lunch , edit photos in his digital Nikon , and then start rolling back toward his hostel as the sun started to set .
" Because I 'm not looking through the frame , I really wanted to push the idea that this is n't me trying to frame - up a shot and get someone to stare at me ; this is just what people are doing .
To really focus on the aspect of human nature that the photos present , rather than , ' Oh , look , those are real pretty . ' "
Specifically , Connolly is interested in the seemingly instinctual reaction of staring at something that does n't fit into a person 's normal day - to - day existence .
" The thing I just loved was you had an executive - looking type guy in say New York City , someone who 's clearly wealthy enough to afford a very nice suit and a good cell phone , staring at you in the exact same way that a beggar in Ukraine would .
" The notion of leveling everyone out through that one universal reaction , I think is really interesting . "
Connolly also discovered that people invent stories for him that are closely intertwined with the places they live .
In Ukraine , for example , he was thought to be a holy man .
In Vienna and much of Eastern Europe , he was taken for a beggar , and people stuffed money into his backpack .
In his hometown of Helena , Mont. , he was mistaken for a wounded Iraq war veteran .
But the most troubling narrative for him came in Bosnia , a country still healing from its own war wounds , where Connolly was mistaken for the victim of a Serbian mortar attack .
" The stares I would get felt different than the ones I was getting elsewhere , say in Paris or London , " he says .
" There was a difficult time when I was trying to figure out if it was an ethical thing to take pictures of people staring at me , when I was basically capitalizing off of exposing their old troubles . "
• • •
Connolly returned to Montana with 32,000 photos ; he took that many photos , he says , in an attempt to show a cross-section of humanity .
He put many of the photos on his website , TheRollingExhibition.com , and he chronicled his trip in a presentation at Montana State University in October , in which he posed the question , " Is there anything wrong with looking ? "
" If every single person does it on the earth reflexively – just on reflex – I would n't even say there 's so much about it that 's right or wrong , it 's just something that exists , and needs to be examined a bit more closely .
I would n't put a right or wrong judgment on staring and curiosity . "
The show apparently touched an aspect of curiosity in people – 200 extra seats had to be added to augment ones placed for the expected crowd of 400 , and the show was punctuated by cheers and whistles – which surprised Connolly as much as anyone .
" Being born like this and raised the way I was , it 's really tough for me to even conceptualize myself as disabled .
I just do n't have legs .
So when someone says I 'm really inspirational , it 's a little strange , because I just do n't think that at all . "
But is n't the fact that he does n't see himself as disabled exactly why he 's so inspirational ?
" Yeah , and that 's always the catch , " he shrugs .
Connolly plans to head abroad again next summer , this time to visit South America , Africa , and more of Asia , and take a small documentary film crew along with him .
" I really have to go back out again , " he says .
" I am curious about the world .
I want to go see it . "
Money never stops messing with your mind .
We ’ve all heard that limiting beliefs about money can hold you back .
If you ’re going to become financially free , you have to replace those beliefs with more effective ones .
But then you ’re set , right ?
Once you ’ve adopted a “ richer mindset , ” you ’ll never have to worry about money again ?
Actually … you do .
You just get a new set of delusions .
We ’ve all seen it .
You might have a friend that is worried about everyone trying to take his money , or he thinks he ’s superior to everyone else because of his income .
Both are ways that money continues to mess with your mind .
It ’s just as important that you know about them and guard against them , not only for yourself , but also for the people you care about .
Let ’s go through the top 10 .
1. I know what I ’m doing .
I wo n’t make a mistake .
A nice income will certainly build your confidence , but it can quickly go too far .
You can start believing that you ’ve figured it all out , and it ’s impossible for you to make any mistakes .
You become overconfident .
The problem is careers , industries , and businesses evolve .
If you continue operating on old models and assumptions , you can quickly pile up some serious mistakes .
Imagine if IBM still believed that only businesses needed computers .
They would be completely out of sync .
2 . No one can do what I do
Exceptional people sometimes delude themselves into thinking they ’re irreplaceable .
They start treating others like dirt because they think no one can do anything about it , but usually , other people only put up with it for so long .
Eventually , your company , investors , or employees will abandon you , no matter how gifted you are .
3 . I ’m a better person because I ’m rich
To some people , wealth is like an elite club .
It ’s not so much your money that makes you better than everyone else , but the intelligence and skill that allow you to make that money .
You start believing your competence makes you superior .
Even if it were true ( and it ’s not ) , why would you want to go through life isolating yourself from the majority of the world ?
It can only lead to loneliness and being hated by everyone you place beneath you .
4 . People do what I tell them because I pay them
Money can give you an illusion of power over other people .
You think that , because you pay them , you can tell them what to do .
You can ’t .
You can use money to influence people , but only to the degree they want to be influenced .
Tell them to do something that they genuinely do n’t want to do , and they ’ll refuse , regardless of how much you pay .
Worse , if the people around you get used to being motivated by money , then what happens if the money disappears ?
Suddenly , no one will want to help you any more , and you ’ll be powerless .
It ’s much better to depend on the other , less manipulative methods of persuasion .
5 . The IRS is out to get me
This one may be true , but it deserves talking about anyway .
As you make more money and pay more taxes , you might start to become obsessed with the tax consequences of every business decision .
You ’ll worry about the IRS at every turn .
It only becomes a problem when you stop living the life you want out of fear of being taxed .
If you have to choose between a low taxation rate and happiness , go for the happiness .
You should never put screwing the IRS ahead of yourself .
6 . I ’ll always make this much money
Lots of wealthy people blow their money .
Why ?
Consciously or unconsciously , they believe they ’ll always be able to make more .
It ’s an especially common delusion among actors and pro athletes who spend ridiculous amounts of money and then go bankrupt when they ca n’t get another movie or play their sport anymore .
It is n’t true .
More often than not , you ’ll make money in waves .
If you want to survive the cycle , then you need to save for the down times .
That way , when something unexpected happens to your income , you can survive .
7 . As soon as I make X dollars , I ’ll be happy
Have you ever wanted to ask someone , “ So , how much is enough ? ”
Many wealthy people continue pushing to make more and more money , sure that the “ next level ” of success is going to finally make them happy .
But the correlation between money and happiness is a weak one .
Beyond providing for your basic needs , money will never make you happier .
If you ’re working because you think it will , you ’ll probably be miserable for your entire life .
8 . I could never survive being poor again
Others know they have it good , and they ’ll do anything not to lose it .
Despite their wealth , they live in fear of poverty .
Afraid of losing their precious money , they may refuse to take any risks or really enjoy their life .
This is another sure road to misery .
You can never protect against every scenario that would cause you to lose money .
Plus , you ’re probably more capable of surviving it than you think .
Knowing what you know , you could make it back fairly quickly .
9 . I have to give my money away , or I ’m selfish
If you ’re wealthy and refuse to support charities , you ’re looked down upon as selfish .
Sure , you can spend some of the money on yourself , but you have a societal obligation to give some of it away , right ?
No … not really .
The purpose of having money is to buy your freedom , spending your money on the life you ’ve always dreamed of .
For me , that includes donating money to charities , but not for everyone .
It ’s your money , and you can do what you want with it .
10 . Everybody loves me for my money
The more money you make , the harder it is to tell if people genuinely love you for who you are .
It ’s easy to become paranoid , believing that no one really cares about you and that you ’re all alone .
Sometimes it ’s true , but having both made and lost money , I can say that the majority of my friends stuck by me and even helped me back up again .
Surround yourself with the right kind of people and you wo n’t have to worry about them turning on you .
More Prevention of NoMethodErrors on nil
Geplaatst door Michiel de Mare
What a sudden interest in avoiding NoMethodErrors on nil lately !
I ’ve just thought of another method .
( Remember , you can solve any problem by adding a layer of indirection . )
Say you have Remco ’s canonical example : person.name.upcase
Both person and person .
name may be nil .
So we usually write : person && person.
name && person.name.upcase .
rrss
class
Object def rrss yield self end end
rrss
person.rrss {|p| p.name}.rrss { |n| n.upcase}
to_proc
person.rrss (&:name ).rrss (&: upcase )
person.rrss {|p| p && p.name} .
rrss { |n| n && n.upcase}
Now for the level of indirection .
Remember ?
I ’ve introduced it last month .
It stands for “ returns result , same self ” .
Its definition is beyond trivial : Withwe can rewrite the original as : Or withnotation : .
We still need to check for nil though :
Does n’t this last bit look like it ’s in need of a bit of refactoring ?
Its lack of DRY - ness jumps right out of the page .
x = lambda {|p| p && p.name} y = lambda { |n| n && n.upcase} person.rrss ( &x ) .rrss ( &y )
arr = [ lambda {|p| p && p.name} , lambda { |n| n && n.upcase} ] arr.inject ( person ) { |o , l| o.rrss ( &l ) }
arr = [ lambda { |p| p.name} , lambda { |n| n.upcase} ] arr.inject ( person ) { |o , l| o && o.rrss ( &l ) }
arr = [ lambda ( & : name ) , lambda ( & : upcase ) ] arr.inject ( person ) { |o , l| o && o.rrss ( &l ) }
to_proc
arr = [ : name , : upcase ] arr.inject( person ) { |o , l| o && o.rrss ( &l ) }
class Object def chain ( * a ) a.inject ( self ) { |o , l| o && o.rrss ( &l ) } end end
# long ago person && person.
name && person.name.upcase # now person.chain ( : name , : upcase ) # with obedient nil # ( in alternate , bugless universe ) person.name.upcase
First try : Let ’s use an array instead !
We should use the nil test to within the inject block .
Hey , ca n’t we write those lambdas a lot nicer ?
Do we even need lambdas ?
We ’re calling them with the ampersand ( & ) , sowill be called on them anyway .
Let ’s turn this into a method !
We ’ve made quite a journey .
But look , we ’ve come a long way !
Why do n’t we go a little further yet .
What if we ’re not worried about nil .
What if the want to stop a calculation as soon as it ’s zero ?
result = if value == 0 then value else tmp = calc ( value ) if tmp == 0 then tmp else more_calc ( tmp ) end end
We could write another method on object to handle just this .
But let ’s make it more generic .
Let ’s accept a block .
class Object def chain ( * arr ) arr.inject( self ) do |o , lmb| if block_given ?
yield o, lmb else o && o.rrss ( &lmb ) end end end end
Symbol#to_proc
chain = [ lambda { |v| calc ( v ) } , lambda { |v| more_calc ( v ) } ]
value.chain( * chain ) do |v , lmb| v == 0 ? v : lmb[v ]
end
How does this work in practice ?
First , we need to define the chain , andwo n’t cut it anymore .
We ’ll need lambdas .
Lambdas are ugly , but even so , that was n’t so bad .
Now , let ’s use it !
Of course , the more steps you have , the bigger the gains of this method .
With two steps , it ’s a toss up .
With three of more steps , you can go a long way in cleaning up your code .
For fifty years researchers have tried and failed to find a cure for the common cold .
But now scientists are claiming a significant breakthrough that could herald the development of new treatments and drugs to prevent the scourge of the nasal passages .
They announced yesterday that they had been able to pass on the virus to a special strain of genetically modified mice – the first time a non-primate has caught a cold .
Until now , only humans and chimpanzees were known to be susceptible to the virus that results in the common cold .
This is one of the reasons why research into possible cures has been so slow , according to Professor Sebastian Johnston , a virologist at Imperial College London who led the mouse research .
Being able to infect laboratory mice with rhinoviruses – the main group of common cold viruses – means scientists can now investigate how the virus infects an animal other than a human being , which could speed up the rate at which new drugs are developed , Professor Johnston said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
About three quarters of people with common colds , which are not to be confused with influenza , are infected with one of the more than 100 rhinoviruses .
Most people shrug off colds within a few days but in some people with respiratory problems – such as asthma – a cold can be fatal .
Colds can result in babies and small children being admitted to hospital , lead to pneumonia in people with weakened immune systems and can trigger asthma attacks .
They can also cause acute attacks of chronic bronchitis and emphysema , sometimes with fatal consequences .
In 1946 , the Medical Research Council set up the Common Cold Unit in Wiltshire where 30 human volunteers at a time were infected with cold viruses to study how their bodies responded to the infection over a period of about 10 days .
The unit was closed in 1989 after failing to find a cure .
Professor Johnston said : " Until now , it has not been possible to study rhinovirus infection in small animals .
This has been a major obstacle to developing new treatments and there is currently no effective treatment for rhinovirus infection .
" Rhinoviruses are a major cause of the common cold and if you have a small animal model , it speeds up the rate of discovering new potential treatments .
And rhinoviruses are not innocent viruses .
They kill people in large numbers from acute asthma attacks and chronic bronchitis and emphysema , " Professor Johnston added .
The scientists , who were funded by the Medical Research Council , modified the genes of the mice so that the cells lining their respiratory systems had a human version of a " receptor protein " called ICAM - 1 , which rhinoviruses use to infect the cells .
" We previously found that once inside the mouse cell a rhinovirus reproduces itself as well as it does in human cells .
But the virus could n't infect the mouse cell because the receptor – which acts like a door key – would n't let the virus into the cell .

" Now we 've modified the mouse receptor so it is more like a human one .
This means the virus can infect the cells of these modified mice .
We found that mice with the modified receptor were susceptible to infection with a rhinovirus , " he said .
The study , which is published in the journal Nature Medicine , will also prove important in the understanding of life - threatening respiratory attacks resulting from acute asthma , bronchitis and other serious lung infections .
Professor Johnston said that the genetically modified strain of mouse he and his colleagues had created could also be used to study what happens during these more dangerous infections when the function of the lung is threatened and people can die as a result .
" If combined with an allergen – such as the protein found in egg white – that could cause an allergic reaction in the lungs , the virus could make the response worse and lead to an ' asthma attack ' .
" These mouse models should provide a major boost to research efforts to develop new treatments for the common cold , as well as for more potentially fatal illnesses such as acute attacks of asthma and of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , " he said .
The research was funded by the Medical Research Council and the charity Asthma UK .
The chief executive of the Medical Research Council , Professor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz , said : " This important and fundamental discovery will enable us to understand the effects rhinoviruses and common colds have on our health .
" It will open up new paths to finding treatments which have been delayed for many years and provides us with the opportunities for further breakthroughs in the future . "
Leanne Male , assistant director of research at Asthma UK , said : '' Ninety per cent of people with asthma tell us that colds and flu trigger their asthma symptoms but as yet there is no specific treatment for virally induced asthma attacks and steroid treatments are only partially effective against them .
" We welcome this latest advancement as it will lead to a greater understanding of viral infections and their link with asthma and may help the development of a suitable treatment for virus - induced asthma attacks , thus greatly improving the lives of the 5.2 million people with the condition in the UK .

Think a coed Marines is a good idea ?
An 8 - month pregnant Marine was murdered by a blunt object after a " violent confrontation " ; a fellow Marine she had accused of rape is hiding .
* As it happens they added to it a bit today , but we 'll get to that in some other post .
** This is a somewhat unfair depiction of Conservapedia 's typical position , but only somewhat .
I was going to bitch in this post about something Conservapedia said about atheists yesterday * but in point of fact I just noticed something else that , frankly , deserves more attention .
I refer , specifically , to this :
For those who did n't click on the image , the headline reads :
Okay , Conservapeons ?
Are we seriously still having this fucking conversation ?
Do youwant to go this route ?
Because , and here 's the thing , ponder for a moment the logical chain you 're constructing here .
A pregnant American soldier was murdered after she accused a fellow soldier of a crime and , basically , you 're implying that she was the problem right from the start .
More broadly , the problem is that women are allowed to be soldiers at all - if they would n't butt - in on the " male arena " of the military , they would n't get raped and murdered .
As long as we 're at it , is this your explanation for sexual harassment ?
Sexual coercion in the workplace ?
How about if a boss rapes his female subordinate ?
Will you come out with a headline asking , " Still think a coed workplace is a good idea ? "
That 's the argument here , right ?
I suppose it must be since , really , the way you guys talk about it a woman who is raped must have been asking for it .
They 're all dirty tramps unless they 're chaste Christian women who stay home pregnant and barefoot , right ?**
Why not just put everyone with a womb in a burqa and get it over with ?
Maybe it 's just me but , really , is it possible that the problem here is the guy who raped and murdered her ?
Is it possible that the problem is a culture of excessive machismo that views women as little more than sexual organs on legs ?
Could that , just maybe , be the problem ?
And for that matter , how about the perspective you 're promulgating about men ?
I am a man and I do not like the implication that I 'm too damned stupid and brutish to control myself .
Guess what : if I 'm playing on a co-ed team I amsuddenly overcome with the irresistible urge to rape the everliving crap out of a female team member .
I know too many soldiers who are good , decent people and serve with those of the opposite sexbrutally violating them to believe the horseshit you 're spewing .
Blaming the victim is an offense to women , but absolving men of responsibility because " boys will be boys " is insulting as hell to men .
We are humans , we are capable of controlling ourselves , and we will goddamn well do so or else face the consequences imposed by the rule of law .
Period .
I 'm sure many of you , Conservapeons , are very good people but right now I am disgusted with the lot of you .
The truths about rape are difficult to face and I do n't have time for damned cowards like you .
Labels : conservapedia , Drek is Annoyed , rape , seething pit of rage
Are there ' useful ' or ' interesting ' recursive algorithms that cannot be expresses with Tail - Recursion , and do you know of any examples ?
P.S. Feel free to define the words in quotes as you see fit .

An Amazon Cruise to Determine the Longest River in the World
Which is the longest river in the world , the Nile or the Amazon ?
This is an earth shaking question for geologists , geographers , and hydrologists .
The exploration of these two rivers is full of history , mystery , and legend .
“ Dr. Livingstone I presume . ” I have a small connection to the Nile , and a large connection to the exploration of the Amazon River , so I have taken an interest in this question .
Some of my best adventure memories are the two times I white - water rafted what had been considered the source of the Nile in Uganda .
We portaged around category 8 rapids but shot the rest .
Two in our group attempted to kayak the category 8s , but capsized each time .
In the United States it is prohibited to raft any rapids above category 5 . I felt the fear .
I would never attempt a category 8 .
Recently my boat , Dawn on the Amazon III , was chartered for an Amazon cruise from Iquitos to the Triple Frontier of Brazil , Columbia and Peru , by a family of Polish adventurers on an Amazon Challenge .
Their Amazon Challenge was to trace the path established in 1996 , by the famous Polish geographer , explorer , and great self promoter , Jacek Palkiewicz .
Using high resolution satellite photos to begin with , Jacek teamed with the Lima Geographic Society to establish a new source for the “ mother of all rivers ” that temporarily made the Amazon River the longest .
His source and his calculations were later discredited by over 160 miles and the Nile regained the official designation of longest river .
From what I have read about Jacek he would never have chosen a source that would have been the second longest river .
He is a longest river type of explorer .
Because of national pride and Jacek ’s knack for promotion our Polish adventurers obtained maps and books and set off on their Amazon Challenge high into the frozen Andes , and then down into the tropical rainforest to Iquitos Peru for an Amazon cruise on to the next leg of the journey .
I studied the maps and photos while we were on our Amazon cruise and started taking more of an interest in the problem .
It is difficult to determine river length .
Not only is it difficult to pin-point the source and the point of actual discharge but big rivers constantly change their course .
There is no doubt that the Amazon River is the largest .
It ’s volume is greater than the next 8 largest rivers combined according to mongabay.com .
Because the Amazon River carries so much more water , the action of erosion is greater and the course of the river changes more .
A long horseshoe bend in the river can be cut off , become a lake , and the river can lose miles of length in one hour .
During the flood season the channel can change and pick up miles of length .
The outside bend of a river where the current is strongest is called the cut bank .
The inside bend is the slip - off slope .
Those names describe the near constant action of erosion that eventually causes the course of the river to change .
In the year 2000 National Geographic put out an expedition led ironically by a Polish - American math teacher , Andrew Pietowski .
Using GPS they established a new source , confirming the Nile to be the longest river .
In 2006 the “ true source ” of the Nile was pushed upstream into the swamps of Rwanda .
I have doubts about that story .
I wonder if they had a hydrologist on board to measure stream flow .
Part of determining the source is measuring the volume of water that flows in a given time period .
That swamp has very little stream flow .
In 2007 a Brazilian expedition claims to have established a new source proving the Amazon River to be the longest by 65 miles .
An Amazon cruise to determine which is longer , the Amazon River or the Nile River
I think it is safe to say this controversy is not over .
For now I am happy to think of the Nile as the longest and the Amazon as the largest .
If a team of cartographers want to float and measure in comfort from the upper Ucayali or the upper Marañon to the triple frontier on an Amazon cruise , please remember that I am interested .
Keep Dawn on the Amazon in mind .

Maybe we 'll never know how Comedy Central could run a show like " BattleBots " and not have it be the greatest thing ever .
Lucky for us , the concept is getting another shot at life thanks to the fine folks at ESPN 2 and ESPNU .
The new show format will have an increased emphasis on the behind - the - scenes nerdmergencies in the " pits " when the bots need tweaking or full on repairs .
They 're also going to do away with the annoying wedgebots ( similar in principle to this Microsoft bot up above , just more annoying ) , beef up the arena hazards and add a new experimental class for featuring other bot types competing in what are hopefully equally destructive forms .
The show was going to start up in June , but is being held back a bit while the 150 or so participating college teams prep entries , and the mayhem is now slated to begin in November .
is a big deal in Japan , it 's even spawned something called " White Day " a month later so the loving fun can go on and on !
Breaking up , on the other hand , can leave one depressed , miserable and in no mood to be productive at work .
What 's a caring company to do ? , CEO of Tokyo - based , obviously has been through the relationship wars and can sympathize with her employees .
Explains Hiradate , Now before we get ahead of ourselves , it should be noted that Hime & Company is a cosmetics marketing company with an all - female staff of 6 .
Even the company name reflects its feminine focus : ( pronounced ) is Japanese forHime & Company offers staffers aged under 24 one break - up recovery day each year .
Once they hit 25 they 're entitled to two days off annually and 30 - plussers get a full three days off .
CEO Hiradate says that Who knew ?
The much - publicized break - up days are not the only unique benefit Hime & Company offers , by the way .
Company staff can take two fully paid mornings off twice a year to go bargain hunting in Tokyo 's trendy shops , department stores and fashion boutiques .
Afterwards , staffers bring their shopping bags back to the office and It 's enough to make anyone forget about that messy break - up ... at least during working hours !
Japanese Innovations Writer
spoke to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce .
Even as he admitted that we are going through a challenging time , Bush had the nerve to tell the audience that his economic strategy has worked .
He set it up by saying , " I remember meeting with some right after the [ 9/11 ] attacks and we were wondering whether or not our economy could withstand a terrorist attack -- after all , a recession was in place just as I came into office , then the terrorists attacked , then we had corporate scandals . "
So , first the excuses , and now the lies :
Bush went on to say , " And a lot of folks were wondering whether or not this economy would be resilient enough to withstand those pressures .
And it turns out it was .
And I want to thank you very much for supporting the tax cuts plans that had good effect on small businesses all across the United States during that period of time .
I think when people take a look back at this moment in our economic history , they 'll recognize tax cuts work .
They have made a difference . "
Yes , George , your tax cuts have made a difference .
Your tax cuts have increased the gap between the rich and the poor in this country .
Your tax cuts have helped the rich get richer , at the expense of the poor and the working class and the middle class .
Yes , George , your tax cuts have made a difference .
Just look at the precariousness of the stock market .
Just look at the stagnant wages of the middle class , with our standard of living steadily declining due to inflation .
Just look at the housing foreclosures .
Just look at all our jobs being shipped overseas .
Just look at the growing national debt resulting from your very expensive and unnecessary war in Iraq .
Yes , George , your tax cuts have made a difference .
And yes , George , history will have something to say about it .
But by then you 'll be comfortably retired on your Texas faux - ranch , and you will no longer have to pretend to care .
And maybe you will no longer have to pretend to be a Christian , because I really do n't believe that the biblical Jesus would feel good about all this .
Please reread the Sermon on the Mount :
Your Jesus said , " Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . "
Your Jesus said , " Blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit the earth . "
And your Jesus said , " Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called sons of God . "
Amen .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
You 'd think Robert Ulrich would be warming up for his victory lap right about now .
The soon - to - retire CEO of Target Corp. should be easing into a lavish farewell tour filled with teary thank - yous , champagne - soaked sendoffs , and a book of leadership secrets .
After all , in his 23 years at Target ( almost 14 of them as CEO ) , Ulrich has transformed a Midwestern discounter into one of the most admired and imitated companies in the world .
Target now ranks 33rd on the Fortune 500 - making it bigger than Microsoft , Pfizer , and PepsiCo , and more than double the size of Cisco Systems .
There 's just one thing :
Though everyone knows Target ( TGT , Fortune 500 ) , hardly anyone 's even heard of Ulrich .
In fact , those who think his name rings a bell are most likely picturing Robert Urich , the deceased actor from television 's Vega$ and Spencer for Hire .
Even Ulrich 's own employees often do n't recognize him during his twice - monthly store walks , when he strolls the aisles dressed in Target 's standard red shirt and khakis .
Neither he nor his company has ever before graced the cover of a major magazine - highly unusual for a corporation its size .
In fact , Ulrich has deliberately stayed so far under the radar that Bob Thacker , a former Target marketing executive now at OfficeMax , dubbed him the " silent Sam Walton . "
Says
Thacker : " He has no public persona . "
Ulrich 's longtime No. 2 , Gregg Steinhafel , is equally reticent .
During a recent interview in his tidy , light - filled office at Target 's Minneapolis headquarters , Steinhafel 's Midwestern reserve fluctuates between polite and downright uncomfortable .
But then I cross the line .
The offense : asking how Steinhafel , 53 , who will take over as CEO from Ulrich on May 1 , differs from his longtime mentor .
The room grows silent .
His mouth gets thin .
Arms cross .
" This is n't about me , " he says .
Long , awkward pause .
" We 're all a little bit nervous when we are talking too much about [ ourselves ] , " he allows , finally .
" It should all be about the brand . "
Thanks to the efforts of this mysterious Minneapolis - based crew , it has been .
Target has been around since 1962 , but in the past decade its red-and - white circles have become as instantly recognizable as the swoosh or the bitten apple .
A recent survey showed that an amazing 97 % of Americans recognize Target 's target , which they see everywhere from the web to New York 's Museum of Modern Art to the company 's 1,613 stores dotted across the U.S. , thanks to the $ 1.2 billion Target spent on ads in 2007 .
Facebook is filled with groups declaring their love for the chain ( and their hope that it will build a store in Seminole , Fla. , or Davis , Calif . ) .
Even Bullseye , Target 's beloved bull terrier , is so popular that it is the only animal besides Lassie to be enshrined in Madame Tussaud 's Wax Museum .
By tweaking the discount model , " they found a niche in what was supposed to be a niche - less world , " says Richard Tedlow , the Harvard Business School professor and author of " New and Improved : The Story of Mass Marketing in America . "
That niche has certainly been an enviable one :
Over the past decade , revenues have increased at an annual rate of 12 % , to $ 63 billion .
Since 1994 , when Ulrich became CEO of what was then the parent company , Dayton Hudson , Target stores ' operating margins have jumped from 5.4 % to 8.6 % , while Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) stores ' have flattened , from 8.1 % to 7.3 % .
The stock has returned 795 % , compared with 284 % for the S&P retail index and 354 % for Wal - Mart .
Behind Target 's rise , however , is a series of intriguing inconsistencies , such as an allergy to public attention at a company for which image is the be all ( and where the longtime leader minored in journalism ) is just one .
Target is a company that is remarkably open to outside inspiration while at the same time so top - down that the CEO personally interviews candidates for the top 600 positions and can identify a misplaced screw on a gazebo .
It markets itself to the Lexus set as a designer haven , while at its core it makes money selling commodities such as bleach and cereal .
It is a big - box retailer that causes gasps of collective ecstasy when it announces a new location as competitors are vilified .
Even the company 's vision statement - " Expect more , pay less " - is somewhat contradictory .
Now those contradictions are coming to the fore as Target enters what promises to be one of the most tumultuous periods in its 46 - year history , starting with a leadership change as critical as Sam Walton 's retirement was to Wal - Mart in 1988 or Jack Welch 's departure was to General Electric in 2001 .
According to company bylaws , Ulrich must step down after he turns 65 in April .
( He will stay on as chairman until January 2009 . )
Such transitions are difficult in the best of times .
" Sam Waltons and Bobs are not replaceable at the same level of intensity , " notes Luis Padilla , a former Target and Sears executive who now runs retail trade - show operator ENK International .
Target 's changeover , however , is happening against the backdrop of a weakening economy - which favors Wal - Mart 's low - price strategy .
During the past two recessions Wal - Mart's U.S. stores bested Target 's in same - store sales by an average of 2.5 percentage points , according to estimates from Goldman Sachs 's Adrianne Shapira .
In 2007 's fourth quarter , Target 's same - store sales slipped below Wal - Mart 's for the first time in more than four years .
( To be fair , Target 's prior year comparisons were tougher to beat . )
Last July prominent activist investor William Ackman , who is best known for taking down the bond insurers , took a nearly 10 % stake in the company and is pushing management for changes .
The stock has dropped 27 % since then , vs. a 2 % rise for Wal - Mart .
Says CFO Douglas Scovanner : " It is as difficult to grow as it has been in my [ 14 - year ] history here . "
It might look bleak - until you understand that Target 's real competitive advantage is n't a logo or a line of designer purses or a catchy slogan .
It 's the team that created them .
***
The secret missives arrive via spontaneous e-mails and thoughtful reports , wending their way to Target marketing guru Michael Francis 's desk from all over the globe .
Like a CIA agent 's field documents , they provide on - the - ground intel - dissecting , for example , anime culture in Tokyo or heralding the return of a more vintage look for Christmas in London .
The dispatches come from Target 's unique " creative cabinet , " an elite , secret team composed of a dozen people of all ages , interests , and nationalities .
Selected on a rotating basis by Francis , the members are paid annual retainers and either file reports or are on call when needed to discuss a strategic plan .
" We identify them , and we cultivate the relationship , " says Francis , a stylish former Marshall Field 's buyer with bright eyes , a shock of dark hair , and such brimming enthusiasm that he looks as though he might eject out of his seat at any moment .
Cabinet members were recently asked to weigh in on such initiatives as Go International , a series of clothing lines by high - end designers sold for up to 90 - day stints , and a new , slimmed - down cereal box with a self - locking top .
One cabinet member who agreed to be named is 80 - year - old Liener Temerlin , founder of agency Temerlin McClain .
Temerlin 's qualification for membership : Francis was struck by " the way his brain worked . "
Temerlin suggested that Target become the founding sponsor of the AFI Dallas International Film Festival .
The company signed on , and the festival , now in its second year , features a Target filmmaker award , a Target documentary prize , and - natch - the Target Festival Lounge .
Target 's bull 's - eye will be on prominent display for the expected 45,000 film watchers and stars like Charlize Theron , and the festival 's 700 volunteers will be wearing red jackets with Target logos .
" Michael likes ideas that have legs , " says Temerlin .
Even Temerlin does n't know what other group members are up to , though , because unlike almost every other " cabinet " on the globe , Target 's never actually meets .
" There 's no power in bringing them together as a body , " Francis says .
" The power is in their working independently .
We 're the cross-pollinator .
We 're the integrator . "
That structure perfectly illustrates the Target approach to innovation : highly creative yet tightly controlled .
Far more than other discounters - and most companies of any kind - Target uses an enormous web of outside contacts to help it figure out what belongs on store shelves .
It is Target 's ultimate goal to walk that razor - thin line between the possible and the practical - a dichotomy you see all over its sleek , modern - art - filled downtown Minneapolis headquarters .
Welcoming you to the product design and development department is a whimsical display of metallic tote bags fashioned into shimmering daisy petals .
But hanging from the ceiling there 's a huge bank of red neon screens showing the company 's real - time in - stock levels ( the amount of product in stores relative to plan ) .
The message is clear :
There is a free spirit expressed in Target 's hopeful slogan , " Expect more , pay less , " but it is always tethered to reality .
Francis's job is to make sure everything the public sees lives up to that motto .
As such , the 1,400 - person - strong " marketing " division he oversees actually encompasses everything from the Target Foundation to publicity , strategy , Target.com , and " guest " ( i.e. , customer ) insights .
Every single thing that Target 's logo appears on - from the donation of $ 1,000 to an elementary school to the look of its private - label garbage bags - goes through Francis .
His team , naturally , put together the manual of approved looks for Bullseye , the Target mascot ( using a Jack Russell terrier rather than a bull terrier is forbidden ; black eye circles rather than red are unthinkable ! ) .
Like many people at Target , Francis , 46 , has never worked anywhere but at Target and its former parent , Dayton Hudson , which also owned Marshall Field 's and Mervyn 's until 2004 .
And although marketing executives are famously transient , not one of his top reports has left for a competitor in more than 16 years .
" The energy that flows through here is just amazing , and it 's fun , " says Karen Gershman , senior vice president of marketing and a 35 - year veteran , who started as a proofreader when there were just 42 stores .
Another key member of the group : Minda Gralnek , a voluble , stripy - haired 17 - year veteran who has headed up many of the company 's best - known campaigns , including " Design for All " and the current " Hello Goodbuy . "
Working closely with them , though he reports to Sternhafel , is Michael Alexin , a relative newbie from Eddie Bauer , who in six years has built an internal product design group of 300 .
" They never know when they walk in if they are going to be working on branded beef or the newest designer from Bergdorf , " says Francis .
Each of Francis 's reports - and , in fact , everyone at Target - is expected to constantly grow his or her own web of networks .
To spot emerging young designers , for instance , Target has for years contributed to design education projects sponsored by the Council of Fashion Designers of America ( CFDA ) .
When bag and shoe designer Jessie Randall of Loeffler Randall became a finalist for the CFDA 's Swarovski Award for Accessory Design in 2005 , a marketing executive named Sally Mueller invited her to Target to talk about a collaboration .
Randall was particularly surprised that the company was willing to accommodate her designs , even giving in to her preference for woven material that was actually - shocking for a discounter - woven .
" Everyone said it would have to be embossed , and I said , ' Please just try , ' " she recalls .
" They always said , ' We do n't want you to think about what we might like .
We came to you because we want your aesthetic ' " Randall 's collection just ended a 90 - day run in Target 's stores .
To encourage , or rather ensure , a steady stream of bold new ideas , even managers with a proven record of hits must duke it out for portions of their budgets every year .
So although the events team won a big chunk of the 2007 pie with its idea for a holographic fashion show - featuring virtual , not real , models - it had to come up with something equally compelling if it wanted funding this year .
" We hold a huge percent of our dollars back , " says Francis .
That helped generate such out - there ideas as a temporary store floating in the Hudson River and a vertical fashion show , where acrobats ' " walked " down the side of a building .
That element of surprise , it turns out , has been part of Target 's DNA for some time .
***
On a summer afternoon in 1921 , farmers attending the Minnesota State Fair were hit by a freak storm of blue , red , and yellow feathers - one million in all , dropped from a biplane .
Once they fluttered to the ground , fair - goers could see that each feather was marked " Dayton 's " after the Minneapolis department store .
The stunt was just one of many dreamed up by banker and real estate developer George Draper Dayton , who happened into retailing after he leased space in a downtown building to department store R.S. Goodfellow 's in 1902 .
The next year he bought the outfit and renamed it the Dayton Dry Goods Co. , creating a store known for high quality and great salesmanship .
There were cooking classes and concerts , and Dayton even once cleared out an entire floor to exhibit a famous biplane called the Curtiss Airship .
In 1909 he opened a discount section in the basement .
Dayton , who died in 1938 , was not a native Minnesotan but quickly took to the straightforward , ultra-polite , and nonshowy " Minnesota nice " culture that still permeates Target today .
" Buy and sell only merchandise of dependable quality and honest value at its level , " he preached .
He was succeeded by his son and grandsons , who , in addition to creating the first enclosed shopping mall , established a company mandate to give away 5 % of pretax profits every year ( a policy that continues today , with a focus on community , arts , and education ) .
Impressed by the success of the basement store , grandson Douglas Dayton decided to open a discount arm .
The first Target , whose name was chosen because it suggested value and also had visual impact , opened in Roseville , Minn. , in 1962 - amazingly , the same year both Kmart and Wal - Mart began .
It was just five years later , in 1967 , that Robert Ulrich signed on as a merchandising trainee at Dayton 's , fresh out of the University of Minnesota .
A Minneapolis native and the son of a 3 M executive who is equally conversant in African art , musical instruments , and Indy car racing , Ulrich rose quickly , becoming president of the 215 - unit Target Stores division in 1984 .
Ulrich was not - and has never been - the typical backslapping corporate leader .
So lean as to resemble a scarecrow , with a slightly red face and a predilection for cowboy boots , he abhors small talk , is n't big on golf , and is quick to make a decision - hence the handle " Bullet Bob . "
Ulrich 's words , when they come , are n't always in order , partly because his brain seems to be firing faster than his tongue - which is pretty darn fast .
" He 's just impatient , " says Thacker , the former Target marketing exec .
" He does n't suffer fools .
If somebody 's doing stupid things , he does n't tolerate it . "
Nor does he like to lose .
" He is the most competitive individual I have ever met - ever , " says George Jones , CEO and president of Borders Books and a Target executive in the 1980s , remembering casual Ping - Pong games at Ulrich 's house that became bloody battles .
" He would dive for a ball and literally run into the wall . "
That competitive streak heated up in the mid-1980s , when Wal - Mart first made inroads into Target country .
With its everyday - low - price strategy , Wal - Mart began eating into Target 's sales while spending far less on marketing than Target , which produced colorful - and costly - Sunday advertising sections .
Alarmed , Ulrich approved a test in 1985 , converting 50 Target stores in Albuquerque and Knoxville , Tenn. , to emphasize low prices .
Quickly , Target found that it did okay in new stores but abysmally in places where people were trained to expect that circular .
" We realized that we would n't ever be able to convert the entire chain , " says Jones .
" And we could n't really run a bifurcated strategy . "
Target faced a choice - one that easily might have put it in the same spot as doomed chains like Caldor or Bradlees .
" Some people tried to do the dance on both sides , " says Ulrich .
" As Wal - Mart got bigger and bigger , [ other rivals ] started emulating them more , but they were still trying to appeal to an upscale guest .
They 'd pile shit in the middle of their aisle and then throw in some merchandise that was n't the right quality for the store level .
It 's the classic mistake . "
Instead , Ulrich 's team saw an opening :
If Wal - Mart was striving to be the king of logistics , with enough muscle to force vendors to deliver on price , Target could deliver on a great store experience and a product that was exciting and unique .
" Wal - Mart 's strategy is in many ways more simple than ours , " says Ulrich .
" It 's more about price and more about mass quantities .
It 's a hell of a competition , but ours is more dependent on innovation , on design , and on quality . "
What Target did have , thanks to its department store sisters , was access to people who anticipated desires .
So Ulrich started a trend department , bringing over fashion scouts from Dayton Hudson , who started by expanding the color palette for T - shirts .
" I can remember all the skepticism , " says Jones .
" No one in mass had anything like this . "
In 1987 , Ulrich became CEO of Target Stores , and the chain 's efforts grew bolder , thanks in part to John Pellegrene , a onetime theater major who arrived in 1988 .
He set about creating a marketing message that dared to suggest that shoppers could get joy from buying a broom or a toothbrush .
Pellegrene 's imagery , in effect , helped Target spearhead a giant self - esteem program for the middle class .
No longer did people with limited budgets have to buy clothing that looked cheap or dish towels that did n't match .
They deserved - and now could afford - more .
In 1994 , Ulrich 's creative team turned that idea into a company motto that is , even today , the strategic filter through which everything must pass : " Expect more , pay less . "
Target now had an increasingly public image to keep up - both inside and outside its stores .
In 1998 the company agreed to give money to support the renovation of the Washington Monument .
But during an early visit to the site
Thacker , then vice president of marketing , was horrified :
The sacred Target logo was plastered next to rotting scaffolding and ripped plastic .
After much brainstorming , Target decided to sponsor an architectural competition to build scaffolding .
The winner was a well - known architect named Michael Graves , who proposed an elegant , lighted structure made of flexible PVC foam .
During one meeting , Thacker says Graves pulled out a stack of product designs " the size of a phone book . "
" Do you think Target would have any interest ? " he asked .
Thacker , thunderstruck , took the idea to his boss , Ron Johnson .
Johnson , who left Target in 2000 and has since rolled out Apple 's wildly successful retail store strategy , immediately saw the potential .
Later that year Graves ' iconic , affordable tea kettles and kitchen gadgets hit shelves .
" People have within themselves a paradox , " says Robyn Waters , a former Target executive who now runs consultancy RW Trend .
" Fit in and belong , and also stand out and be unique . "
With Target 's designer wares , shoppers could do both .
The company followed up with " mass / class " collections by the likes of Philippe Starck and Todd Oldham , and started to market Target as a destination for design .
These collaborations boosted Target 's brand , but its bottom line ultimately depended on people buying their basics there .
So in 1995 the company followed Wal - Mart 's Supercenter lead and opened its first SuperTarget .
The new format featured more consumable items such as food and toilet paper , to persuade customers - 80 % of whom are women - to do most of their basic shopping there .
Early results were disappointing ; most experts thought Target would never be competitive with Wal - Mart in food .
But Target persevered .
The hope was that this would smooth out economic cycles , but it was also a move into a lower - margin , more commoditized business .

I am watching from behind a two - way mirror as two people struggle to assemble a $ 299 Grill King gas grill .
Next to me is a camera crew filming the event , along with Target 's buyer for lawn and patio , Paul Bein , who is scribbling notes .
Already Bein has noticed that the screws are falling off the screwdriver and will ask the vendor to magnetize them , and he wants to have the customer service number listed more clearly on the instructions .
We 're in Target 's user - experience research center ( ULab , in Targetese ) .
And it 's here , in this windowless warren at headquarters , that Target works on the practical side of its strategy .
At the ULab , Target enlists real " guests " to test anything they interact with in the store , from free sanitizing hand wipes or gel ( wipes won ) , to the company 's latest shopping cart ( now being tested in Minneapolis and Tulsa , it has handlebars that let you push it from any side ) , to new product prototypes like ITSO , Target 's affordable storage system that hits stores in June ( the name stands for " It 's so fabulous ! " ) .
The ULab is just one of the ways Target has tried to make sure that the creativity gets results .
" It certainly is possible to overemphasize innovation , " says Ulrich .
A few years back , he says , " it was almost as though everyone in every store was like , ' Oh , I have an idea and I 'll try that . '
We had to go back and say , ' Wait a minute , we 're operators . ' "
That 's where Steinhafel comes in .
A Kellogg MBA who spent two decades at Target merchandising everything from toys to stationery , Ulrich promoted him to president in 1999 .
By his own admission Steinhafel is a bit of a wonk .
" I talk a lot about gross margin rate and the key drivers to improve our metrics and performance , " he says .
While it 's easy to cast him as a B - school suit , that 's not totally fair :
He literally grew up in retail , working at the family store , Steinhafel 's Furniture , in Milwaukee .
By all accounts , Steinhafel is well liked both inside and outside the company , and he seems to consider Target a second home .
In fact , he met his wife of 25 years there .
I 'd love to tell you I'm a swashbuckling entrepreneur like Richard Branson or Larry Ellison and have this exciting life beyond Target and my family , " he says .
But it would n't be true .
Steinhafel is also lauded for his deep understanding of vendors and store layouts .
Says Deutsche Bank Securities senior retail analyst Bill Dreher , who recently visited a store with him : " He was speaking like a real dyed - in - the - wool garmento , not just some manager . "
Having a feel for how the products are presented is essential :
Top management reviews initiatives before they launch , a process that takes place in the Status Room , a special area at headquarters that is home to a constantly rotating display of goods .
Ulrich , Steinhafel , and Troy Risch , EVP of stores , each walk with Francis through the room every ten days , checking out everything from table tents for Target 's caf� to Cherokee 's new underwear line and giving feedback .
Recently Ulrich energized a print ad featuring wine .
" Can we make this more interactive ? " he asked , suggesting the bottle pour wine rather than just sit there .
Once the trio has signed off , Francis brings in his 150 marketing managers , along with company lawyers , PR representatives , and even the training folks , to talk them through the marketing strategy behind every item .
" We microman - age and we think and sweat about every little aspect of the guest experience , " explains Steinhafel .
" We take the time to communicate to our broad organization what they do , why they 're doing it , how it fits the whole . "
***
Yet communication alone is not going to solve the problems Target is facing now .
Last fall Target , MTV , and Go International designer of the moment Erin Fetherston put out a two - minute - long " film " called " Morning , Till Night , " which showed a bevy of beautiful girls who lived in brownstones and attended parties in sleek white spaces wearing flirty , ruffly clothes .
It was aspirational , of course , and that was the point .
But on the floors , under fluorescent lighting and hanging close to busy checkout lines , Fetherston 's clothes seemed to promise a bit less .
That 's the reality of shopping at any discounter - but at image - obsessed Target , that disconnect can be jarring .
" They 've had inconsistent merchandising , and sometimes [ it ] does n't live up to the marketing , " says one former Target senior executive who walks the stores regularly .
In February , Citigroup managing director and analyst Deborah Weinswig polled shoppers and found that though Target consistently underprices supermarkets on groceries by about 10 % to 15 % , shoppers perceived the opposite : that Target 's prices were a full 20 % higher .
Moreover , though prices at Target average out to within 1 % to 3 % of those of Wal - Mart , 87 % of respondents said they shopped at Wal - Mart because it was the cheapest .
" The problem could be that some of these stores are so clean that you just assume you 're paying more , " says Weinswig .
Another issue may be that Target 's pioneering efforts , like its partnership with high - end fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi , which recently ended after five years , have become commonplace .
To wit : Stella McCartney for H&M , Vera Wang for Kohl's , Norma Kamali for Wal - Mart , and countless others .
Steinhafel says Target is making adjustments in the current environment , but radical changes are not in the works .
" A strategy is a strategy , " he insists .
" Sometimes we focus a little bit more on the ' pay less , ' sometimes on the ' expect more , ' but the guardrails are here . "
Target has revised its internal model to assume 2008 same - store sales growth of 2 % to 3 % per month rather than the 5 % of recent years .
Target also has changed the " messaging " in those famous circulars to emphasize price , particularly in food and commodities , and they 've also adjusted worker hours to reflect lower traffic .
Steinhafel has high hopes for the company 's Converse One Star partnership , which he says is " above plan . "
Every five years
Target rolls out a new store prototype , and in October it will start testing the larger 2009 iteration , which further emphasizes food , electronics , and pharmacies .
( Consumables and commodities make up 34 % of sales , up from 30 % in 2005 . )
Target continues to open about 100 stores a year , a feat made easier by the fact that it has thus far managed to avoid the barrage of bad press Wal - Mart has suffered .
In part , that 's because of Target 's very public philanthropy ( no good deed goes unpublicized here ) , but it 's mostly because Target will never be the biggest target - Wal - Mart is six times its size .
" Bentonville is a behemoth , " Ulrich says , with a wink .
" We 're just a nice , modest , little , average [ company ] trying to get to a reasonable scale so that we can take care of things for our guests and give them good value . "
Yet some have noticed that both Target 's and Wal - Mart 's average pay in Minnesota , for example , falls below the $ 12.24 - per - hour that advocacy group Jobs Now calls a living wage .
" We feel they are worse than Wal - Mart because they are masquerading as this benign employer , " says Bernie Hesse , director of special projects for Local 789 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union in St. Paul , which has unsuccessfully tried to unionize local Target employees ( no Target employees are unionized ) .
" They have gotten this pass because they have set up this foundation and have this chic look , and that 's more cruel than Wal - Mart .
Wal - Mart does n't pretend . "
The labor issues have thus far remained behind the scenes , but a more pressing issue is the emergence of William Ackman , founder of Pershing Square Capital Management .
Ackman , a very public activist investor , took a nearly 10 % stake in the company last July .
Even though his cash investment ( most of the stake is in options ) is down 15 % , he says he considers Target " the best - managed retailer " around .
Thus far he 's met with Ulrich , Steinhafel , and Scovanner to urge them to spin off part of the credit card business and boost stock buybacks .
( Target upped its buyback and on March 12 announced it is in negotiations to sell half its credit card receivables for about $ 4 billion . )
Taken all together , it 's a tough situation for any new CEO to walk into .
Certainly it 's fair to say that if successors typically fall into two categories - those representing continuity , like Steve Ballmer at Microsoft , and those representing change , like Jack Welch or even Ulrich , Steinhafel is poised to be the former .
" There are always choices for succession , " says Anne Mulcahy , CEO of Xerox and a longtime Target board member , " and I think one of the [ deciding factors ] was Gregg 's ability to carry on the collaboration .
Their ambition is about the company ; it is not about themselves as individuals . "
And that , in fact , has always been the point .
" Ulrich has done his successor a service , " notes business historian Tedlow .
" Sam Walton was an icon at Wal - Mart , and it 's much easier to succeed somebody who is n't . "
Says Ulrich : " I know there are some people who have sort of this twisted concept that they can't do it without me , but that would obviously be the worst legacy that one could possibly leave . "
Instead he has built an organization designed to outlive him - and his successor .
" We 're going to be here for 40 , 50,60 years , " says Steinhafel .
There 's a decent chance Target will still be a household name then .
But there 's an even better chance its CEO wo n't be .

Forensic expert : Impossible for handcuffed woman to strangle self in airport David Edwards
Published : Tuesday October 2 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This Dubious of the initial police report , CBS asks a forensic expert to explain if a woman who died in an airport holding cell could have strangled herself while handcuffed .
Forty - five year old Carol Anne Gotbaum , a mother of three young children , may have accidentally strangled herself while trying to get out of her handcuffs , Phoenix Police Department spokesman Sgt. Andy Hill said Saturday , CBS reports .
 According to investigators , it appeared as though Ms. Gotbaum had possibly tried to manipulate the handcuffs from behind her to the front , got tangled up in the process , and they ended up around her neck area ,  Hill said .
However , " Attorney Michael Manning , who was hired by Gotbaum 's family to monitor the police investigation , said it does n't seem possible she could have killed herself . "
" She was handcuffed behind her back and shackled to a table , " Manning said .
" It does n't make sense that she could have physically managed to strangle herself . "
According to a guest on CBS News 's The Early Show , forensic pathologist Daniel J. Spitz , " It 's really not conceivable that she would be able to use the handcuffs that are holding her hands behind her back to cause a compressive force to her neck , " but the chain running from the cuffs to the bench might conceivably have done it .
" The autopsy is going to need to be done to confirm there was a compressive force to neck and that the cause of death is asphyxiation .
It is also going to need to exclude that drugs or alcohol played a role or she had some unknown natural disease which played a role . "
The following video is from CBS 's Early Show , broadcast on October 2 .

What is it about climate change that stirs everyone up so much ?
When innovative technology is applied to cars , houses or other everyday things everyone seems to celebrate progress .
However , when articles come out about climate change the tone shifts and the skeptics come out in force .
Ecoble invariably gets the most crass , spammy and downright incorrect comments on such articles .
But why ?
Is it just too big of a concept for people to grasp ?
Too complex to know for sure and therefore it elicits negativity ?
Or could it be that we are scared it could be true and eager to believe detractors who , possibly for personal profit , resist reacting to the potential threat post by global climate change ?
Even when alternative explanations , such as volcanoes , are presented to problems such as localized ice melting .
In the face of the complex and ( of course ) global nature of the problem , it is all too easy to throw up one ’s hands and declare there ’s no point worrying about it .
But there is .
Climate change could have a series and devastating impact one the world , affecting humans in every aspect of life from temperature to agricultural production .
The debate just keeps heating up , too , as private individuals , companies and entire industries on both sides find they may have a lot to lose .
If you ’re still a doubter after combing recent related news articles , look no further than this description of what may be the sixth mass extinction on Earth .
Is it alarmest ?
Maybe .
Are species becoming extinct at a more rapid rate than at any other point in human history ?
Absolutely .
What does it mean ?
That ’s up to you .
When the customer is n’t right – for your business
One woman who frequently flew on Southwest , was constantly disappointed with every aspect of the company ’s operation .
In fact , she became known as the “ Pen Pal ” because after every flight she wrote in with a complaint .
She did n’t like the fact that the company did n’t assign seats ; she did n’t like the absence of a first - class section ; she did n’t like not having a meal in flight ; she did n’t like Southwest ’s boarding procedure ; she did n’t like the flight attendants ’ sporty uniforms and the casual atmosphere .
Her last letter , reciting a litany of complaints , momentarily stumped Southwest ’s customer relations people .
They bumped it up to Herb ’s [ Kelleher , CEO of Southwest ] desk , with a note : ‘ This one ’s yours . ’
In sixty seconds , Kelleher wrote back and said , ‘ Dear Mrs. Crabapple , We will miss you .
Love , Herb . ' ”
The phrase “ The customer is always right ” was originally coined by Harry Gordon Selfridge , the founder of Selfridge ’s department store in London in 1909 , and is typically used by businesses to :
Convince customers that they will get good service at this company Convince employees to give customers good service
Fortunately more and more businesses are abandoning this maxim – ironically because it leads to bad customer service .
Here are the top five reasons why “ The customer is always right ” is wrong .
1 : It makes employees unhappy
Gordon Bethune is a brash Texan ( as is Herb Kelleher , coincidentally ) who is best known for turning Continental Airlines around “ From Worst to First , ” a story told in his book of the same title from 1998 .
He wanted to make sure that both customers and employees liked the way Continental treated them , so he made it very clear that the maxim “ the customer is always right ” did n’t hold sway at Continental .
In conflicts between employees and unruly customers he would consistently side with his people .
Here ’s how he puts it :
When we run into customers that we can’t reel back in , our loyalty is with our employees .
They have to put up with this stuff every day .
Just because you buy a ticket does not give you the right to abuse our employees . . .
We run more than 3 million people through our books every month .
One or two of those people are going to be unreasonable , demanding jerks .
When it ’s a choice between supporting your employees , who work with you every day and make your product what it is , or some irate jerk who demands a free ticket to Paris because you ran out of peanuts , whose side are you going to be on ?
You ca n’t treat your employees like serfs .
You have to value them . . .
If they think that you wo n’t support them when a customer is out of line , even the smallest problem can cause resentment .
So Bethune trusts his people over unreasonable customers .
What I like about this attitude is that it balances employees and customers , where the “ always right ” maxim squarely favors the customer – which is not a good idea , because , as Bethune says , it causes resentment among employees .
Of course there are plenty of examples of bad employees giving lousy customer service .
But trying to solve this by declaring the customer “ always right ” is counter - productive .
2 : It gives abrasive customers an unfair advantage
Using the slogan “ The customer is always right ” abusive customers can demand just about anything – they ’re right by definition , are n’t they ?
This makes the employees ’ job that much harder , when trying to rein them in .
Also , it means that abusive people get better treatment and conditions than nice people .
That always seemed wrong to me , and it makes much more sense to be nice to the nice customers to keep them coming back .
3 : Some customers are bad for business
Most businesses think that “ the more customers the better ” .
But some customers are quite simply bad for business .
Danish IT service provider ServiceGruppen proudly tell this story :
One of our service technicians arrived at a customer ’s site for a maintenance task , and to his great shock was treated very rudely by the customer .
When he ’d finished the task and returned to the office , he told management about his experience .
They promptly cancelled the customer ’s contract .
Just like Kelleher dismissed the irate lady who kept complaining ( but somehow also kept flying on Southwest ) , ServiceGruppen fired a bad customer .
Note that it was not even a matter of a financial calculation – not a question of whether either company would make or lose money on that customer in the long run .
It was a simple matter of respect and dignity and of treating their employees right .
4 : It results in worse customer service
Rosenbluth International , a corporate travel agency , took it even further .
CEO Hal Rosenbluth wrote an excellent book about their approach called Put The Customer Second – Put your people first and watchem kick butt .
Rosenbluth argues that when you put the employees first , they put the customers first .
Put employees first , and they will be happy at work .
Employees who are happy at work give better customer service because :
They care more about other people , including customers
They have more energy
They are happy , meaning they are more fun to talk to and interact with
They are more motivated
On the other hand , when the company and management consistently side with customers instead of with employees , it sends a clear message that :
Employees are not valued
That treating employees fairly is not important
That employees have no right to respect from customers
That employees have to put up with everything from customers
When this attitude prevails , employees stop caring about service .
At that point , real good service is almost impossible – the best customers can hope for is fake good service .
You know the kind I mean : corteous on the surface only .
5 : Some customers are just plain wrong
Herb Kelleher agrees , as this passage From Nuts !
the excellent book about Southwest Airlines shows :
Herb Kelleher [ … ] makes it clear that his employees come first — even if it means dismissing customers .
But are n’t customers always right ?
“ No , they are not , ” Kelleher snaps .
“ And I think that ’s one of the biggest betrayals of employees a boss can possibly commit .
The customer is sometimes wrong .
We do n’t carry those sorts of customers .
We write to them and say , ‘ Fly somebody else .
Do n’t abuse our people . ' ”
If you still think that the customer is always right , read this story from Bethune ’s book “ From Worst to First ” :
A Continental flight attendant once was offended by a passenger ’s child wearing a hat with Nazi and KKK emblems on it .
It was pretty offensive stuff , so the attendant went to the kid ’s father and asked him to put away the hat .
“ No , ” the guy said .
“ My kid can wear what he wants , and I do n’t care who likes it . ”
The flight attendant went into the cockpit and got the first officer , who explained to the passenger the FAA regulation that makes it a crime to interfere with the duties of a crew member .
The hat was causing other passengers and the crew discomfort , and that interfered with the flight attendant ’s duties .
The guy better put away the hat .
He did , but he did n’t like it .
He wrote many nasty letters .
We made every effort to explain our policy and the federal air regulations , but he was n’t hearing it .
He even showed up in our executive suite to discuss the matter with me .
I let him sit out there .
I did n’t want to see him and I did n’t want to listen to him .
He bought a ticket on our airplane , and that means we ’ll take him where he wants to go .
But if he ’s going to be rude and offensive , he ’s welcome to fly another airline .
The fact is that some customers are just plain wrong , that businesses are better of without them , and that managers siding with unreasonable customers over employees is a very bad idea , that results in worse customer service .
So put your people first .
And watch them put the customers first .

I 've been doing a good deal of speaking recently .
And in one of my talks , I tell an anecdote about a lesson I learned from my own readers .
It was early in 2005 , and a little hackware program called PyMusique was making the rounds of the Internet .
PyMusique was written for one reason only : to strip the copy protection off of songs from the iTunes music store .
The program 's existence had triggered an online controversy about the pros , cons and implications of copy protection .
But to me , there was n't much gray area .
" To me , it 's obvious that PyMusique is designed to facilitate illegal song - swapping online , " I wrote .
And therefore , it 's wrong to use it .
Readers fired back with an amazingly intelligent array of counterexamples : situations where duplicating a CD or DVD may be illegal , but is n't necessarily * wrong . *
They led me down a garden path of exceptions , proving that what seemed so black - and - white to me is a spectrum of grays .
So the vfs-usa website , which is where one has to go to apply for a US Visa , is designed by a bunch of idiots who are living in a universe 9 years in the past .
They 've built a site that works on Internet Explorer 5.0 which was released in June 1998 , while the rest of the world has almost moved to 2008 .
Anyway , the real problems with their site ... let 's see if I have the energy to list them all .
Their server is signed with an invalid certificate .
That in itself should be very scary , but they probably do n't realise it , because they 've never used a secure browser .
Their back end cannot process individual day , month and year fields , instead they need javascript to combine this into a MM / DD / YYYY field which their back end will process .
My guess is that they used VB.NET and never once looked up the documentation on date and time processing .
Their javascript that combines the day , month and year fields into a single MM / DD / YYYY field is faulty .
They look at the .innerText property of an option list when the correct property to use is .value .
.value has been the standard way to retrieve the value of an option since Netscape introduced Javascript , and yes , it was supported in the implementation of Microsoft JScript that was used in Microsoft Internet Explorer .
The innerText property does n't exist anywhere outside of Microsoft .
They have n't got a clue about code organisation .
The hidden fields that they use to store the MM / DD / YYYY values are scattered all over the page .
It 's almost as if each input field was added by a different developer with a different project in mind .
They 've never in their lives heard of < input type = " hidden " > .
No , instead of that , they use < input type = " text " class = " HideControl " > and then use CSS to set .
HideControl { display : none ; } .
If you try to retrieve an unsaved application , they do n't tell you that no such application exists .
No , instead they give you a screen that says " Please select the specific visa class you are applying for : " , and that 's it .
There 's nothing else on the page .
Terrible Accessibility .
As if making the site accessible to users of non-Microsoft browsers was n't enough , they also , very happily , steal focus away from the current element .
Select a radio button , and the page refreshes with a new bunch of fields .
Select an option from a drop down list , and again the page refreshes .
After refreshing , of course , there 's no telling where focus has shifted .
Just imagine someone trying to iterate through the drop down list with a keyboard .
They can't spell .
They have variable names like FC_Employement and FC_Attandence .
My eyes bled while trying to debug their code .
They have a DOCTYPE , but have no idea what it 's for .
Which is probably why it is n't the first thing on their page .
Useless use of frames .
The main content is inside a frame that is part of a frameset of two frames , which in turn is in a frameset of two frames .
The content frame gets 100 % of the height , as does its parent .
The other frames have nothing useful in them .
They have n't heard of the < ol > tag
They do not know the difference between a slash / ( which is used on the web ) , and a backslash \ which is used for paths on a Windows file system , so some of their paths will work on their local windows box , and when viewed through IE , but not on the web when viewed using real web browsers .
After correcting the path , the guidelines document still returns a 404 .
is their favourite entity
They have code like this : < p ></p> all over the place .
Yes , I finally managed to submit the application using Firefox on Linux , but only after disabling the validation javascript and doing the date manipulations manually .
It was n't pretty , and for some reason greasemonkey was n't helping me rewrite the SetDate function .
Does anyone know which company built this web site ?
I 'd like to recommend against people using them to build their company websites .
Update : Another problem is with the generated PDF that they ask you to print out .
I did n't notice it before , but on closer inspection , there are a few big problems :
The state I live in is marked UNDEFINED Most multiline entries are clipped at two lines .
As a result , the office address that I 've entered ends at Street Name , and only two of my prior US visits are listed instead of all of them .
I do n't know if this could be a problem or not .
Will only know when I go for the interview .
Update 2 : I 've enabled anonymous comments for this post
Taking Inventory of the Irony Stuart Pivar v. Seed Media Group , LLC and Paul Z. Myers » The Morality of the Atheist - Same as it Ever Was A familiar pattern arises in every atheism v. religion debate ( which arises in a host of contexts , but I ’m generalizing a great deal here so I ’ll not restrict myself to one ) ; reduced to its essentials , the argument looks like this : Christian : Because atheists believe do n’t believe in God , they believe in nothing .
They owe no allegiance to a higher power and therefore do not subscribe to a universal morality .
Morality is entirely relative to the atheist — he makes his own rules .
I could go on , but it ’s a tired exercise .
The argument is easily countered a number of ways : regions where atheism predominates ( like Western Europe ) share the greatest concern for human rights ; science is beginning to strongly suggest that we each have , to varying degrees , an ingrained moral sensibility , and studies have routinely demonstrated that the outcomes of moral hypotheticals given to test subjects have no correlation to whether the test subject is religious or non-religious .
Brian Tamahana delves deeper into this subject here , but I want to extract a simple thought experiment that demonstrates his larger point more succinctly :
Imagine that your longstanding belief in God is destroyed owing to some precipitating event ( say , an inexplicable , arbitrary , unjust , tragedy happens to a family member ) .
In the dark of the night , you come to the conclusion that you no longer believe in God .
The next day , when you venture into the world , will you suddenly feel tempted to freeload off your friends , cheat strangers , stop taking care of your children , or steal from , rob , rape , or kill someone ?
Of course not .
You considered all of these things immoral the day before , and you will still see them as such .
You may well experience the throes of an existential crisis ( asking yourself what matters in life ) , but that will not of itself penetrate or dissolve your routine moral beliefs .
I bring this up because it seems insane to me that we ’re still having this debate , especially since we ’ve had this debate before .
Up until around the Civil War , most states prohibited atheists from testifying in court .
The reasoning then is remarkably similar to the present - day musings of modern Fundamentalists :
The theory held that , since they did not fear the retribution of any god at all , they could not be trusted to tell the truth .
Thus , in the early common law , the atheist was excluded because he did not fear the judgment of God , and the defendant was excluded because everyone feared the judgment of man .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States has missed its own postponed deadline to decide if polar bears need protection from climate change , and critics link the delay to an oil lease sale in a vast swath of the bear ’s icy habitat .
“ When it comes to the survival of the polar bear , the Bush administration is putting the ‘ dead ’ back into ‘ deadline , ’ ” said Rep . Ed Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat who heads a House of Representatives panel on climate change .
“ Now that the Bush administration has taken care of its clear first priority -- taking care of their friends in the oil industry -- perhaps they can finally give the polar bear , and the global warming that is causing the bear ’s demise , the attention it is due , ” Markey said in a statement .
Polar bears use sea ice as a platform for hunting seals , their main prey , and without enough ice , they are forced onto land , where they are inefficient hunters .
Warmer arctic waters mean longer distances between chunks of sea ice , and video of drowning polar bears has fueled debate over their future .
The U.S. Geological Survey , in a study conducted to aid the government ’s decision , reported last year that all polar bears in Alaska -- about 16,000 currently -- could disappear if warming trends continue .
The Interior Department ’s Fish and Wildlife Service was required by statute to decide by Jan. 9 whether the polar bear should be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act , but three days before that , the agency ’s chief told reporters the deadline would be pushed back 30 days .
The second deadline passed on Feb. 8 with no decision .
On Feb. 6 , the Interior Department ’s Minerals Management Service sold oil and gas rights across some 12.02 million hectares in the Chukchi Sea off the Alaskan coast for a record $ 2.66 billion -- about four times what the government expected to get .
Protesters , including one in a polar bear suit , demonstrated outside the auction in Anchorage .
DECISION ‘SOONER RATHER THAN LATER ’
Chris Tollefson , a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service , said the timing of the two events was “ entirely coincidental . ”
“ These two things have moved on somewhat parallel tracks , but really the driver in all of this has been the complexity of the issues and the science , ” Tollefson said on Wednesday by telephone .
He said a decision was expected “ sooner rather than later ” but declined to be more specific .
Environmental groups have notified the U.S. government they plan to sue if no decision is reached by 60 days after the original January deadline .
“ If the Fish and Wildlife Service had protected polar bears before the lease sales were finalized , there would have been additional legal safeguards to the polar bears , ” said Andrew Wetzler , an attorney and endangered species specialist at Natural Resources Defense Council , a potential plaintiff .
“ The illegal failure to protect polar bears under the Endangered Species Act gave the Minerals Management Service a pass , ” Wetzler said in a telephone interview .
He dismissed claims that another law , the Marine Mammals Protection Act , offers comparable safeguards .
This other law does not require the same kind of consultation that the Endangered Species
Act does , lacks protections for critical habitat and does not include plans for recovery , Wetzler said .
However , he doubted the Bush administration was trying to “ run out the clock ” so the polar bear problem lands on the next president ’s desk .
“ The Bush administration actually did the right thing : they formally proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act , ” Wetzler said .
“ There ’s no reason for them not to finalize that decision now . ”
Ron Paul Backs up New Ad with Straight Talk : GOP Rivals are
Fake Conservatives
ARLINGTON , VIRGINIA – On the heels of a new television campaign contrasting his fiscal conservatism against the record of his opponents , Congressman Ron Paul today sharply criticized his Republican counterparts for their record of tax hikes , deficit financing and wasteful spending .
“ A real fiscal conservative always votes for balanced budgets , lower spending and would never , ever raise taxes .
Every one of my opponents fails that litmus test .
These so - called conservatives are misleading the American people about their records , ” said Dr. Paul .
In a newly released TV ad entitled " The Only One , " airing in Super Tuesday primary states , the campaign says that Dr. Paul is the only candidate who has " Never supported a tax increase .
Never supported an unbalanced budget .
Never supported wasteful government spending . ”
To view the ad , click here .
" It is interesting to see all of these guys calling each other liberals .
The fact is they are all telling the truth .
They are all a bunch of liberals ... and Republican conservative voters know that .
This is why real conservative leaders like Barry Goldwater , Jr. have endorsed me , " continued Dr. Paul , a 10 - term Republican Congressman from Texas .
Dr. Paul strongly supported Ronald Reagan 's campaign for President in Texas in 1976 and was one of four members of Congress that year to endorse Reagan over Gerald Ford .
" When I was leading the Reagan delegation to the Republican National Convention , most of my opponents were voting for Democrats or cheering for Ford .
And now they want us to believe they are true conservatives ?
It 's all politics , it ’s a sham and everyone knows it .
That 's why they are having a hard time getting true conservative voters to support them , " concluded Dr. Paul .
Dr. Paul has consistently been named " The Taxpayers ' Best Friend " by the National Taxpayers Union for having the strongest record in “ voting for lower taxes , less spending , balanced budgets and upholding the Constitution . "

5 Christopher Walken in Ripper
In this futuristic retelling of the Jack the Ripper legend , via crappy PC game , there was no definite answer as to who the Ripper was .
The game randomly generated a new character as the killer every time you played .
Thus , every character was written much like Christopher Walken 's character , Detective Vince Magnotta : shifty , untrustworthy and ready to stab a whore at the drop of a hat .

There are half a dozen familiar faces in the game 's trailer -- watch in amazement as each tries to out - suck the other .
What becomes quickly apparent is that nobody in this game is going to chew the scenery like Walken :
In what will become video game cutscene tradition , Walken gives what may be the worst performance of his sort of illustrious career ( " sort of " refers to Balls of Fury ) .
Seriously , as much as we love the man , it appears that Walken has n't turned down an acting role in his life .
This game came out in 1996 , right between Pulp Fiction and The Suicide Kings for Walken .
He does n't care , he just really , really likes acting .

GOP sources say total lost by NRCC , other Republican committees could be as high as $ 1 million .
NRCC chairman says funds were embezzled
The National Republican Congressional Committee said Thursday that its former treasurer , Christopher J. Ward , may have embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from the committee , but GOP sources said the total lost by the NRCC and other Republican committees could be as high as $ 1 million .
The NRCC said that Ward made " several hundred thousand dollars in unauthorized transfers of NRCC funds to outside committees whose bank accounts he had access to , including joint fundraising committees in which the NRCC participated .
He also appears to have made subsequent transfers of several hundred thousand dollars in funds from those outside committees to what appear to be his personal and business bank accounts . "

These joint committees from which Ward allegedly diverted funds include special committees set up to raise money for an annual dinner with President Bush put on by the NRCC and the National Republican Senatorial Committee .
Those dinners usually meant millions of dollars for the Republican campaign committees .
One GOP insider said Ward also diverted funds from the leadership PACs and reelection campaigns for which he worked , usually in smaller amounts , although the insider said the total taken from those PACs and campaigns may actually end up being greater than the losses suffered by the NRCC itself .
NRCC Chairman Tom Cole and Rob Kelner , a lawyer with Covington & Burling retained by the NRCC to oversee its response to the accounting scandal , said the transfers go back at least until 2004 but that the NRCC is still unsure how much was diverted from committee coffers .
" The exact dollar figures are currently a moving target , and as the investigation progresses , it is entirely possible that these figures will change , either by increasing or decreasing , " the NRCC said .
" The forensic investigation has also noted numerous instances in which the unauthorized transfers were either not accurately reported , or were not reported at all , on FEC reports . "
A GOP source said that , in some cases , Ward cut checks , in small amounts , from a lawmaker ’s campaign or leadership PAC directly to his own bank account .
At other times , the sources said , Ward used a dummy company as a go - between , but the money finally ended up in his account .
The source said that Ward issued a $ 4,208 check to himself in December from Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling ’s PAC , although he returned that money in early February , after the NRCC accounting scandal became public .
Ronald C. Machen , an attorney with WilmerHale in Washington who is representing Ward , did not reply to an e-mail seeking comment .
The NRCC has brought in PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct a forensic audit .
Cole estimated that the investigation into the accounting problems has already cost the committee between $ 360,000 and $ 370,000 , and he acknowledged the internal audit was far from complete .
So far , the NRCC has decided to file a new FEC disclosure statement for January 2008 stating that it had $ 740,000 less cash on hand than previously reported .
The NRCC 's actual cash on hand at the end of January was $ 5.7 million , not the $ 6.64 million it reported to the FEC , the committee says .
While it 's possible that the committee could face FEC fines for misreporting its financial data , Cole said he did n't think such punishment was warranted .
" Our working relationship with the FEC has been very good , " Cole said .
" We were the victims here . "
Kelner , who said the committee has been cooperating fully with an FBI investigation into the matter , said he was " not aware of any reason why the NRCC should have legal exposure , particularly because the committee has been very aggressive in disclosing what it knows to the appropriate law enforcement authorities . "
The NRCC said Thursday that , after becoming treasurer in 2003 , Ward " submitted to the NRCC 's bank and to the NRCC leadership bogus audit reports for 2002 , 2003 , 2004 and 2005 .
The additional bogus audit was submitted to the NRCC 's bank for 2006 . "
The NRCC also said there was a $ 200,000 discrepancy in the NRCC 's line of credit , meaning the committee owed more than it thought it did .
It is unclear if the NRCC believes that Ward was responsible for this discrepancy .
The NRCC made disclosures to members and to the media Thursday because the committee 's new treasurer , Keith A. Davis , filed a notice alerting the FEC that auditors had discovered significant discrepancies in the funds officially registered with the FEC .
In a briefing for reporters , Kelner said the figures released Thursday do not represent the final tally of misreported funds , nor are the auditors certain that all of the missing money was misappropriated .
Some of the missing funds may be the result of real accounting errors , not malfeasance , he said .
" That number is going to vary over time , " Kelner said .
" How much of that variance is due to misappropriation and how much of it is due to accounting errors is not really something that we can say with confidence . "
Cole said in a statement that the evidence gathered to date shows that " we have been deceived and betrayed for a number of years by a highly respected and trusted individual .
From the moment we learned that bogus financial statements had been submitted to the bank on our behalf , we took decisive and speedy action by contacting the FBI , which opened a criminal investigation . "
He said that the NRCC is making " every effort ... to prevent such a fraudulent act from happening again . ”
Members say they did not suspect that Ward was doing anything out of the ordinary during his tenure as treasurer .
" I had no reason to suspect there was a problem , " said Rep. Greg Walden ( R - Ore. ) , who was chairman of the NRCC 's audit committee during some of the years when Ward allegedly produced fake audits .
" No one raised a red flag . "
Still , Walden said he tried on numerous occasions to set up a meeting with the committee 's outside accountant — he believed it was Deloitte & Touche — but that Ward repeatedly delayed .
At one point , Walden said he approached then - Chairman Tom Reynolds ( R - N.Y. ) to get Ward to set something up but that Ward called back immediately to complain that members of the accounting firm were n't returning his calls .
" There was always a reason , " Walden said about Ward 's excuses for not setting up a meeting .
NRCC officials say they discovered the allegedly " bogus " audits only after Texas Rep. Mike Conaway ( R ) , a registered certified public accountant who is chairman of the audit committee , pushed Ward repeatedly to give him a copy of an audit for 2006 .
Only then did Conaway and others start to realize the full scope of the alleged misdeeds .
Members briefed on the matter said that Ward attempted to submit a fake audit on phony letterhead , but that the ruse was quickly discovered
" This is , unfortunately , not that unusual a scenario , " Kelner said of the NRCC ’s accounting problems .
Numerous campaign committees have been the victims of embezzlement or other financial crimes over the past decade .
Ward , who had sole oversight of the committee 's bookkeeping , was apparently acting alone , Kelner said .
Since discovering the financial irregularities , the NRCC has altered its rules so that multiple people must sign off on all major expenditures .
" In hindsight , it would have been better to have better controls that might have averted this , " Kelner said .
He pointed out , however , that political committees and other nonprofits often have less rigorous internal controls than corporations and other private businesses do .
Investigators working for the NRCC have been in contact with Ward since his ties with the committee were cut , but Kelner said the former treasurer has not provided them with any major breakthroughs in the probe .
" We are seeking information from Mr. Ward , " Kelner said .
" At this point in time , we have n't learned anything from Mr. Ward that has affected the investigation in one way or another . "
Charlie McCreevy , the EU's Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services , wants to nearly double the European copyright term in sound recordings - from 50 years to an astounding 95 .
Join us and stop overextending copyright .
If you read Commissioner McCreevy 's declaration this month to bring American - style copyright terms for sound recordings to the EU , one might have thought that it was all a done deal .
He gave the impression that he had consulted with everybody who counted in the matter , balanced all the arguments , and had all the powerful players on his side .
We do n't think he has .
McCreevy still has to persuade his fellow Commissioners and the European Parliament before sound recordings are locked away in Europe for another 45 years .
And while the record labels support the government stretching their contracts far into the future , the facts stand against term extension .
Impartial studies , copyright scholars , and some of the world 's most respected economists all say that longer terms mean little new wealth for performers , yet create all the disadvantages of a creative world depleted of its valuable long - promised public domain .
And it 's not true that McCreevy and the Commission have heard from all the key figures .
They have yet to hear from you .
To help the EU 's decisionmakers understand how bad an idea for innovation and the future copyright term extension is , EFF has joined forces with Britain 's Open Rights Group to launch a grassroots - led campaign against McCreevy 's plans .

The power of Facebook , not just a social networking tool
If 2006 was the year of YouTube , 2007 has been Facebook 's year .
The growth of social media , led by Facebook , has taken the world by storm .
Since January , Facebook has added 250,000 new users each day with nearly 60 million people worldwide now using the site .
The hyper - growth does not tell the whole story , however .
Facebook has also acquired considerable attention regarding its user privacy policies , online marketing strategies and the short - sighted decision of some companies and governments to block employee access to the site .
While these issues have shone the spotlight on some of the challenges of social media , the lasting lesson of Facebook may come from a series of events that unfolded over the past two weeks in Canada .
They demonstrate that Facebook is far more than just a cool way to catch up with old friends ; rather , it is an incredibly effective and efficient tool that can be used to educate and galvanise grassroots advocacy , placing unprecedented power into the hands of individuals .
Not only had tools like Facebook had an immediate effect on the government 's legislative agenda , but the community that developed around the group also led to a " crowdsourcing " of knowledge .

On December 1st I launched the Fair Copyright for Canada Facebook group , with limited expectations .
This seemed like a good way to educate the public about the Canadian government 's plans to introduce new copyright reform within a matter of days .
I sent invitations to a hundred or so Facebook friends and seeded the group with links to a few relevant websites .
What happened next was truly remarkable .
Within hours the group started to grow , first 50 members , then 100 , and then 1000 .
One week later there were 10,000 members .
Two weeks later there were over 25,000 members with a new member joining the group every 30 seconds .
The big numbers tell only part of the story .
The group is home to over 500 wall posts , links to 150 articles of interest , over 50 discussion threads , dozens of photos and nine videos .
Ten days ago , it helped spur on an offline protest when Kempton Lam , a Calgary technologist , organized 50 group members to descend on the Canadian Industry Minister , Jim Prentice 's , local open house to express their views on copyright .
While Facebook was not the only source of action , the momentum was unquestionably built on thousands of Canadians , who were determined to have their voices heard .
Jim Prentice has delayed introducing new copyright reforms
Much to the surprise of sceptics who paint government as unable or unwilling to listen to public concerns , those voices had an immediate impact .
Ten days after the Facebook group 's launch , Jim Prentice delayed introducing the new copyright reforms , seemingly struck by the rapid formation of concerned citizens who were writing letters and raising awareness .
Not only had tools like Facebook had an immediate effect on the government 's legislative agenda , but the community that developed around the group also led to a " crowdsourcing " of knowledge .
Canadians from coast to coast shared information , posed questions , posted their letters to politicians , and started a national conversation on copyright law in Canada .
This scenario cannot be repeated for every issue .
In this instance , Canadians increasingly recognized the detrimental effect of the proposed copyright reforms on consumer rights , privacy , and free speech , and were moved to act .
Yet for similarly placed concerns , the lesson of the past two weeks is that politicians , companies , and other organizations can ill - afford to ignore a medium that is capable of mobilizing tens of thousands within a matter of days .
Those caught flatfooted may ultimately find themselves struggling to save face .

[ above : Kids fortress bed with full mini - golf room from the Propeller Island Hotel ]
Ever wonder what it would be like to be stuck in prison , live in a museum or stay in a hotel room in space ?
Art and concept hotels and hostels have begun addressing every fantasy you may have had … and some you probably have n’t .
These twenty rooms range from playfully artistic to mind - bogglingly surrealistic with everything in between .
Also be sure to check out the original 16 incredibly creative and sexy hotel rooms and see 70 +
Amazing
Theme , Castle , Jail and Art Hotels .
This room at the Propeller Island Hotel is something of a strange cross between prisoner and miner quarters .
The harsh physical environment and somewhat uncomfortably sloped sleeping arrangements are augmented by the all - or - nothing harsh overhead lighting and thin slotted windows that are the only way to see outside the rooms .
This room may look like it is merely cluttered with antiques but its interior design actually tells the history of the Propeller Island Hotel with artifacts dating back to the hotel ’s inception .
Various objects on the wall range from early fixtures to pieces of failed structural supports all reworked to fit various purposes both functional and decorative .
Want something a bit more exotic ?
This room features a suspended bed and also incorporates structural members from the hotel ’s past .
The raised bed creates an intimate ( if strange ) gathering space below it and the bed itself can be raised or lowered manually via a series of pulleys mounted in the corners of the room .
Why anyone would want to stay in a room that reminds them of their grandmother ’s house is anyone ’s guess but perhaps that home - away - from - home is just what some people are looking for in their hotel stay .
The room is fitted with antique fixtures and furniture and comes complete with an ( albeit creepy ) image of a generic grandmother .
At the quite opposite end of the spectrum from the previous room this sensual and sexy hotel room interior is decorated with nude portraits as only the sexually liberated Germans could imagine .
Part art and part erotica , the plush purple interior and other decorations clearly cater to a more romantic clientele .
For those less interested in a particular conceptual theme but enamored with a specific color ( and the mood it creates ) this series of brightly colored hotel rooms might be just the thing .
Their decorations and materiality play off the colors and reference various parts of the world and times of year with different light conditions .
The Philosopher ’s Hotel features a series of rooms that are perhaps less overtly amazing but equally compelling for the right clientele : each room revolves around the life , work and philosophy of a particularl philosopher .
The above rooms , for example , respectively play off Georges Bataille ’s concepts of sexuality and eroticism , Ludwig Wittgenstein ’s philosophies of language , ethics and mysticism and Henry David Thoreau ’s obsession with time , age and nature .
Other rooms revolve around famous thinkers such as Nihilist Friedrich Nietzsche and pseudo - Taoist Confusious .
The Hotel FOX in Copenhagen has dozens of rooms featuring the interior design work of a wide range of graphic designers , sculptors , photographers , animators and graffiti artists .
One artist describes their room as a “ flip - book in motion ” while another describes hers as “ The glorious , technicolor - dream - coat room where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies . ”
Each room reflects the personality and artistic approach of its creator who , in each case , was given free reign to design .
Bigelow Aerospace was once involved directly with NASA in developing space - based residences related to the United States space program .
Since parting ways with NASA , the company has already launched prototypes of its inflatable space hotel rooms that are slated to be open to ( at least rich members of ) the public in less than a decade .
And if that is n’t creepy and cramped enough for you , check out this crazy collection of the 7 of the Smallest Hotels and Hotel Rooms in the World !

Workers who have :
Nodded off or fallen asleep while driving : 36 %
Fallen asleep or become very sleepy at work : 29 %
Been late to work because of sleepiness : 12 %
Source : National Sleep Foundation 2008 Sleep in America
Poll telephone survey of 1,000 respondents Sept. 25 - Nov. 19 .
Margin of error +/-3.1 percentage points U.S. workers are silently suffering from a dramatic lack of sleep , costing companies billions of dollars in lost productivity , says a study out Monday .
Nearly three in 10 workers have become very sleepy , or even fallen asleep , at work in the past month , according to a first - ever study on sleep and the workplace by the non-profit National Sleep Foundation .
The late - 2007 survey was based on a random sample of 1,000 workers .
TELL US : How has your sleep affected your performance at work ?
Have you ever fallen asleep on the job ?
" It 's a very expensive issue for employers , and it can be fatal , too , " says Nilesh Dave , medical director of the Sleep and Breathing Disorders Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas .
" The 24/7 global economy means work is now around the clock . "
About 70 million Americans have a problem sleeping , according to the NSF .
Some employers , such as Union Pacific ( UNP ) railroad , are so concerned that they 're now allowing workers to nap on the job .
Employees also say it's a significant issue , causing them to drive drowsy or even fall asleep at their desks .
Ursula Forhan , 53 , of Chicago , used to fall asleep at her desk .
She was treated for sleep apnea and says she has no problems today .
" I would take a nap on the floor of my office , and my boss was so tolerant he would step over me , " says Forhan , a paralegal in Chicago .
She used to drive for work and had to roll down the windows to stay awake .
Among the survey 's findings : • Dangers on the road .
Thirty - six percent of respondents say they have nodded off or fallen asleep while driving , including 26 % who say they drive drowsy during the workday .
• Work performance .
Twelve percent of respondents have arrived late to work in the past month because of sleepiness .
Other problems cited : impatience with others , difficulty concentrating on job tasks and lower productivity .
• Work hours .
Employees with more than one job report the highest rate of dissatisfaction with sleep : 43 % say they get a good night 's sleep only a few nights per month or less .
Part - time workers report the highest rate of sleep satisfaction .
Several factors are driving the trend toward sleepier employees .
Employees are putting in longer hours , in part due to increased pressure from employers to ramp up productivity .
The study found that one - fourth of respondents have a workday that lasts between eight and nine hours , and another fourth say they work up to 10 hours a day .
Technology , which is supposed to enhance productivity , has also required employees to be available .
" You 're not disconnecting except when you hit the pillow , " says Mark Rosekind , a consultant who worked on the survey .

Dark Hope By David Shulman University Of Chicago Press , 236 pages Lords of the Land By Idith Zertal and Akiva Eldar Nation Books , 576 pages Toward an Open Tomb By Michel Warschawski Monthly Review Press , 128 pages
In opening his stunning memoir , “ Dark Hope : Working for Peace in Israel and Palestine , ” David Shulman declares : “ I am an Israeli .
I live in Jerusalem .
I have a story , not yet finished , to tell . ”
It is a very sad story , of a society gone astray with power , and of decent Israelis in despair over the failure of their efforts to save it from itself .
The story , as Shulman says , is not yet over , but he asks whether its end is not already determined .
Is tragedy inevitable ?
Can Israel right its course to achieve its once glowing promise as a refuge and as a nation ?
Shulman ’s memoir is not unique in raising these questions .
Two recent books share his foreboding : “ Lords of the Land : The War Over Israel ’s Settlements in the Occupied Territories , 1967 - 2007 , ” a careful work of scholarship by Idith Zertal and Akiva Eldar , and “ Toward an Open Tomb : The Crisis of Israeli Society , ” a stinging essay by Michel Warschawski .
Shulman and Zertal are college professors , Eldar is a journalist , Warschawski is a peace activist .
All are Israeli Jews .
Whatever the stylistic differences of their books , they are equally unforgiving of Israel for placing its future in stark jeopardy .
None of these authors , it should be emphasized , is an apologist for Arabs .
They do not deny that two peoples of vastly different cultures are engaged in a conflict of nationalisms , in which both sides have killed intemperately .
All agree it is a conflict with too many victims , in both cultures .
But these writers , good Israelis , are convinced Israel cannot resolve it by military superiority , much less by physical abuse .
Israelis such as these do not often make the news from the Middle East .
It is easier to conclude that the country is dominated by fanatic settlers supported by compliant officials and fierce warriors , a perception that is not altogether false .
They argue , in contrast , that Israel owes to its survival and to Jewish moral traditions the creation of a society living not in implacable hostility but in harmony with its neighbors .
That is the perspective from which they write .
And though their camp in this fratricidal combat is the weaker , its members have not given up the fight .
Shulman is among the Jews of diverse organizations — it is fair to call them “ human rights ” organizations — who travel to the occupied territories to stand nonviolently as a barrier against the settlers ’ avaricious takeover of land .
Their work is difficult and sometimes dangerous .
The settlers — women no less than men — shout : “ You are aiding the enemies of the Jews .
They want to kill us and you help them .
You should be ashamed . ”
Sometimes they are attacked and bloodied .
Occasionally , he and his fellow activists win small victories , slowing a land confiscation , for example , but the odds they face are huge .
In his account of weeks of struggle to save the dwellings of Arabs who for generations have lived in caves near Hebron , he calls his adversaries “ human evil . ”
“ Nothing but malice drives this campaign to uproot the few thousand cave dwellers with their babies and lambs .
They have hurt nobody .
They were never a security threat .
They led peaceful , impoverished lives until the settlers came .
Since then there has been no peace .
They are tormented , terrified , incredulous .
As am I .
What black greed , what unwilling hatred , has turned Israeli Jews into torturers of the innocent ?
The settlers come first , violent and cruel — but above them is a vast , ramified system , official Israel , that sustains them and protects them , that corrupts our minds and our language , God ’s language , with vile rationalizations .
I rage in my well - appointed kitchen ; I am inflamed , crushed , mad with pain . ”
Shulman tells of the uprooting by the settlers of thousands of olive trees , icons of the local culture and the chief source of income of the inhabitants .
He remembers when settlers washed a dog in a village well , a deliberate insult , then destroyed the well .
He writes about Nibin Jamjun , a Palestinian girl who , while standing in the doorway of her house , was shot dead , for no apparent reason , by a settler walking by with a group of his friends .
Most of his stories are confirmed by Israel ’s vigilant press .
In the case of the Palestinian girl , no effort was made to find the killer .
The authorities refused to investigate or even to open a file .
Israel ’s army and police , Shulman notes , far from acting to protect the victims of settler violence , are the force that makes it possible , by acting as passive observers and sometimes even joining in .
Shulman writes that he often carries a sign to demonstrations that says , “ So that we may end the oppression wrought by our own hands , ” a phrase taken from the Yom Kippur prayer book .
The settlers — their “ curses soar like arias in a high soprano ” — scream that he is a treacherous Israeli and self - hating Jew .
Self - hating Jew has become a universal term ; American Jewish leaders use it regularly to defame Jews who think like Shulman and dare to criticize Israeli practices .
Shulman ’s Jewishness is never in doubt .
He made aliyah to Israel to express it .
He knows Jewish guilt when he sees it .
The settlers , he writes , “ have stolen and desecrated not only olives , not only land , but the dignity that once belonged to Jewish books , the love I had for the … Jewish God of my childhood , the musical Hebrew of my early poems . …
My own grandfather , a Jewish humanist of the old school , would never have believed it possible . …
I know that I am seeing … the prelude to the vast expulsion that these Jews are planning for these people , all three million of them .
Let no one say he did not know ; let no one talk of vast historical forces , of wrongs piled on wrongs … let no one speak philosophy . ”
Zertal and Eldar , whose disciplined research complements Shulman ’s passion , lay out the process by which these wrongs were piled on .
The guns of 1967 had barely fallen silent before Israel annexed East Jerusalem and the land surrounding it , then adopted the concept of “ liberation ” to disguise the breach of international conventions that barred the transfer of population to territories occupied in war .
Within a few months the army had substituted the Old Testament names Judea and Samaria for the internationally accepted “ West Bank . ”
It was in those early days that the symbiotic relationship between army and the settlement movement was established .
The settlers spoke of “ redeeming ” the land for the Jewish people .
This was a concept venerated by Zionist thinkers , but in the occupied territories it had little legal foundation .
So the army came to the rescue by proclaiming that settlements were essential to military security , a notion to which international law was more sympathetic .
Security became the bedrock justifying not just military policies but the web of decisions by Israeli courts that rationalized the excesses in the daily behavior of the settlers .
To this day , security — whether or not the concern is valid — remains the rhetorical premise of Israel ’s ongoing confiscation of Palestinian land , and for the wave on wave of restrictions that Israel imposes on Palestinians in their pursuit of everyday life .
My own experience as a journalist in the occupied territories began in the 1970s , when Palestinians were still traumatized by the disaster of the Six - Day War of 1967 .
Having been badly bruised by the misgovernment of the Jordanians which preceded it , they imagined that Israeli rule was unlikely to be worse .
West Bank life throughout the ’70s and early ’ 80s was rather serene , and Gaza was far from the hellhole it later became .
Men earned decent wages working in Israel , and the standard of living — refrigerators and washing machine became commonplace — was rising .
Universities were absorbing young people ; travel by car and bus was easy .
The absence of danger drew Israelis to local restaurants to dine on Arab delicacies , tourists visited from abroad and émigrés often returned home to be with their families .
Except in the refugee camps and at a few guard posts at crossroads , it was rare even to see soldiers , much less to feel their intrusions .
Settlements at that time were few , but , after the Likud Party won the election of 1977 on a pro-settlement platform , that began to change .
Within a few years , settlers living in temporary trailer parks were driving through Arab villages on their way to work , stopping for groceries in street markets en route home .
At the same time , Palestinian demography was changing , with the rise to maturity of a new generation that did not know 1967 and which found the settlers ’ presence provocative .
Though serious violence was still uncommon , occasionally a teenager threw a rock and smashed a windshield .
I recall once visiting a settler family living at the end of a narrow , rutted road in the shadow of an old British police station .
Over the kitchen table , a young mother argued passionately that the army should provide settlers with more protection from the nearby Arabs .
Rather naively , I asked whether she saw any possible compromise between the settlers and their neighbors , who had lived on the land for centuries .
Her answer : “ There is no compromise .
This is our land .
The Torah says so . ”
Slowly , it became clear that these Jews were planning to stay , and the new generation of Palestinians rising to maturity sensed that patience had serious limits , and that action was required if Israel was ever to evacuate them .
Meanwhile , Israelis were growing increasingly comfortable with the spoils of their 1967 conquest .
In 1987 , a spontaneous , basically nonviolent uprising called the intifada broke out .
Since then , with only brief respites , the confrontation between the sides has grown steadily more intense , and more brutal .
Of all Israelis , Ariel Sharon was the one most responsible after 1977 for the settlements ’ relentless spread .
A sound tactician as well as a strategist , he perceived Israel ’s limits and , according to Zertal and Eldar , he warned his followers not to trespass boundaries set by the Americans , whose support for the country he considered crucial .
Throughout the administrations of Ronald Reagan , father Bush and Bill Clinton , however , the Americans rarely protested Israel ’s policies , and when Sharon became prime minister himself , the president was George W. Bush , who set no boundaries at all .
Bush , in an interview prior to his recent trip to the Middle East , reminded an Israeli journalist that Sharon , his host on his first visit to Israel , in 1998 , took him on a helicopter tour of the West Bank .
As Bush recalled it , Sharon , “ pointing to a hill , said this is where I engaged as a young tank officer in my first battle , and see how far [ near ] it is to our capital and our civilization .
His purpose was to make clear to me the strategic issues facing Israel . ”
The tour clearly made an impression .
As president , Bush publicly promoted a two - state solution but sent Sharon a letter promising that Israel need not contemplate reversing the reality of the settlements .
Israel ’s latest figures reveal that 280,000 Jews now live in 130 settlements in the West Bank , in addition to 200,000 in East Jerusalem , roughly a tenth of the country ’s population .
Though Bush proclaimed Sharon “ a man of peace , ” Sharon ’s words made clear his own agenda , belying that judgment .
Since childhood , Sharon has said , he lived “ in the shadow of security problems . ”
Warschawski grudgingly acknowledges him as one of only two strategic visionaries in Israel ’s history , the other being David Ben-Gurion .
Israelis initially came to admire Sharon as a swashbuckling general , whose greatest triumph was turning the tide in the 1973 Yom Kippur War .
Afterward , he retired to take command of the right - wing Likud , a role which proved that , politically as well , he was irrepressible .
“ The best answer for security , ” he once said , “ is settlement , ” but he might have reversed the order .
In diverse political posts Sharon remained the dominant figure over the army and the territories .
Long before becoming prime minister , he was a bulldozer in expanding the settlements , while at the same time keeping the army focused on protecting them .
In an interview in the newspaper Haaretz after he was elected prime minister in 2001 , Sharon expressed a belief that Israel ’s permanent security was an ongoing objective that might take a century to attain .
The War of Independence , he said , was just the opening chapter .
A peace treaty , he said , was no guarantee , and if a Palestinian state became unavoidable , he would permit it to cover no more than 42 per cent of the land that was envisioned for it by the international community and in U.N. resolutions .
“ It ’s not by accident , ” he said , “ that the settlements are located where they are .
They safeguard the cradle of the Jewish people ’s birth and also provide strategic depth which is vital to our existence . ”
It was Sharon ’s idea , say Zertal and Eldar , to create chains of settlements to control the West Bank ’s key aquifer and strategic hills .
“ I see no reason for evacuating any settlement , ” he told Haaretz .
Even after solemnly promising Bush to halt building in the territories , he kept pouring in funds , often selecting the construction sites himself .
By conceding the principle of a Palestinian state , he hoped to keep Arabs from ever voting in Israel ; he even had the army pull out of the Gaza Strip , though he ceded nothing in the West Bank .
Time was working in Israel ’s favor , Sharon insisted , and a hasty peace would only be a barrier to its achieving its security goals .
With help from the religious and military establishments , Sharon as prime minister saw to the transformation of the very nature of the occupied territories and of the army itself .
The officers corps , once dominated by secular Jews heavily drawn from the kibbutzim , increasingly tilted toward the settlers , many of them educated in ultranationalist yeshivas .
According to Zertal and Eldar , promotions became a function of service to settlement expansion .
Settlers themselves were put in charge of planning , infrastructure and construction in the territories .
Step by step the civilian authorities , not just the government but the courts and the police too , deferred to the army in making policy and enforcing law .
Concerned Israelis warned that the army ’s shift in orientation to population control in the territories would diminish its level of readiness and training , thereby actually subverting national security .
When Israel went to war in Lebanon in the summer of 2006 , the army ’s poor showing vindicated the warning .
Even before Sharon became prime minister , the army was tilting toward unbridled repression of the Palestinians .
Sharon ’s predecessor was Ehud Barak , a general who talked peace while also cultivating his ties to the settlers .
In 2000 , Barak stepped up the heat on the Palestinians , says Warschawski , in response to their refusal of his offer — which Barak called “ extremely generous ” — of a Palestinian state made up of a mosaic of bantustans that would leave the army in control .
The predictable result was the second intifada , more violent than the first , on which Sharon , as candidate for prime minister , deliberately poured fuel by invading the Temple Mount with a band of soldiers .
After his election , says Warschawski , Sharon embarked on a program that was “ essentially punitive … meant to teach the Palestinians a lesson for having dared to defy the occupation . ”
Six months later , the attack on New York ’s World Trade Center by suicide bombers proclaiming an extremist form of Islam had its impact on Israel .
Bush retaliated by launching the “ war on terror , ” and Sharon , seizing the opportunity to join in , received from the U.S. the legitimation of his own practices .
The focus on Israeli settlements was superseded by America ’s obsession with terror , and in the public mind the Palestinian yearning for liberation was transformed into a danger to the civilized world .
The army , spreading fear throughout the territories , became more powerful than ever , in ways more powerful than the government itself .
Claiming the right to promote security , writes Warschawski , the army has literally imprisoned a society of 4 million people .
The prison ’s perimeter is the ugly , abutting slabs of concrete , some 30 feet high , that run like a scar across the biblical terrain .
The army refers to it as the security fence , but almost everyone else calls it simply “ the wall . ”
Sharon said it was needed to protect Israelis from terrorists , and conceivably it has saved some lives .
But it does much more .
In places , it follows the old border between Israel and the West Bank .
Then , across from Jerusalem ’s Old City , it loops outward to embrace the most populated settlements , which are not the clusters of trailers that I found 30 years ago but beautifully designed and landscaped communities , well - watered and air - conditioned , at the edge of superhighways that Arabs are forbidden to use .
Elsewhere , the wall strays from the border deep into Arab land , slicing through villages , encircling towns , blocking inhabitants from their fields .
Some 10 per cent of the West Bank is on the wall ’s Israeli side .
Settlers who live to its east glide through gates under the protective eyes of soldiers , but Palestinians face huge administrative obstructions to crossing it .
Many are denied the right to cross at all .
“ I was in a ghetto , ” said a gray - haired Jewish woman demonstrating with David Shulman at the wall .
“ I was a young woman in Poland when they fenced us in .
Then I was sent to Majdanek .
I survived and came here .
I know what a ghetto is .
That ’s why I am holding this sign . ”
The wall , however , is only one part of an elaborate system of control created by the army , bringing Palestinian social life , along with the local economy , to a virtual halt .
Palestinians suspected of terrorism , along with “ collateral ” victims , are killed almost daily in a program of “ targeted assassinations . ”
Israeli prisons , which have locked up an estimated 700,000 Palestinians since 1967 , at any given moment hold some 10,000 , most of them without charges .
Over local and international protests , the army performs hundreds of home demolitions a year , a form of collective punishment usually inflicted on families whose children it has arrested .
Meanwhile , the network of settlers ’ highways , lined with barbed wire to stop pedestrian crossings , has effectively divided the West Bank into enclaves , isolating segments of the population from one another .
No family can escape the system .
In making clear that the Palestinian state it envisaged would consist of these separated cantons , Israel promised to link them with roads and tunnels for the use of Arabs alone .
Not surprisingly , the Palestinians said they were not interested .
Under Sharon , at the start of the second intifada , the army took a major step further :
It enlarged to more than 500 its web of checkpoints throughout the interior of the West Bank .
Most sit within Arab towns or between Arab villages or outside Arab schools or clinics or mosques .
Getting through them requires permits issued by the security services , reminiscent of those required of blacks under the old South African regime .
At times , the quid pro quo for these permits is collaboration with the authorities , sowing further social divisions .
Young soldiers with little supervision man the checkpoints ; if they are not actually trained to intimidate and humiliate , that is how they behave .
Passing a checkpoint may take hours ; mothers have lost sick children en route to clinics ; fathers are berated in front of their children ; complainers often wind up in detention pens after their papers are confiscated .
Conceivably checkpoints protect Jewish settlements , but almost all are too far from the border to have an impact on the security of Israel itself .
The only real function of the checkpoints , experts agree , is to disrupt Palestinian life .
Machsom ( checkpoint in Hebrew )
Watch is the best known of the monitors of the security system .
It is an organization of several hundred Israeli women , many of them elderly , who in 2001 responded to press narratives of growing violations of decency .
“ Everything we Israelis take for granted , ” says a Machsom Watch report , ” — love and family , earning a living , developing a career , education , health , community life — are luxuries [ for the Palestinians ] … contingent on the whims of the occupation . ”
Each day , women of Machsom Watch deploy at 40 or so checkpoints , where they act as observers , and sometimes as intermediaries between Palestinians and soldiers .
They try to be problem solvers , using a soft approach , the women say , and so they deny membership to men , whom they fear might be too confrontational .
Sometimes , the soldiers shout “ Go home , Grandma , ” if not some serious vilification .
The Palestinians are mystified about why these Israeli women would place themselves in jeopardy in their behalf .
The women explain that their objective is not just humane treatment for a victimized people but , as Jewish women , an end to the corrosion of conscience of the young , uniformed Israelis who are being coarsened by the occupation experience .
To explain why he and fellow activists , like the women of Machsom Watch , leave their warm homes to subject themselves to vituperation and sometimes personal peril , Shulman also conveys the thought that their concern is not just the Palestinians but Israel .
“ Our true enemy is … the one who sits , complacent , in government offices or in the army ’s high command or in the passivity of the home .
( Let our Palestinian friends deal with their own violent counterparts to such people , that is not our business . )
We will meet our foe at every point — every house he demolishes , every olive tree he uproots , every rocky field he is intent on stealing .
We will engage him over and over , without violence .
We will watch and record and bear witness and , from time to time , we will stop him .
He has guns : we have each other , determination , and some dogged convictions about what it means to be human .
That , and a certain dark hope . ”
These books reaffirm that , in Israel , hope remains alive , flickering , even dark though it may be .
But they leave in doubt how widely the convictions of their writers about what it means to be a Jew , and even what it means to be human , are spread through Israeli society .
The conflict continues , and it not clear which side will prevail .
Milton Viorst , the author of six books and many articles on the Middle East , has covered the region for 40 years .
His most recent book is “ Storm From the East : The Struggle Between the Arab World and the Christian West . ”
Mr Obama was backed by nine in 10 black voters , exit polls suggest
Mr Obama won 60.7 % of the vote to Mrs Clinton 's 37.1 % , polling strongly among African - American voters .
The result is not decisive but boosts his lead in terms of delegates at the August convention where the party will choose its White House candidate .
With the Republicans ' race settled , their presumptive nominee , John McCain has been focusing on fund - raising .
Mr McCain , who is set to secure the Republican nomination at the party 's national convention in September after winning the backing of a majority of delegates , is under pressure to build up a campaign war - chest ahead of November 's election .
Race issue
Speaking to CNN from Chicago , Mr Obama welcomed the " wonderful support " of voters in Mississippi .
The results followed a day of campaigning dominated by a row over the volatile issue of race , sparked by an interview with Clinton supporter Geraldine Ferraro in which she implied that Mr Obama has only been successful because of his ethnicity .
DEMOCRATIC DELEGATE RACE BARACK OBAMA : 1,596 Delegates won on 11 March : 17 Total states won : 26
HILLARY CLINTON : 1,484 Delegates won on 11 March : 11 Total states won : 16
Delegates needed to secure nomination : 2,025 .

Denver horse - trading ahead
In pictures : Mississippi votes Can Clinton win ?
" If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position , " said Ms Ferraro , a vice - presidential candidate for the Democrats in 1984 .
Mrs Clinton , senator for New York , said she regretted Ms Ferraro 's comments , and did not agree with them .
" It 's regrettable that any of our supporters - on both sides , because we both have this experience - say things that kind of veer off into the personal , " she told the Associated Press .
" We ought to keep this on the issues . "
One of Mr Obama 's senior advisers , David Axelrod , has called on Ms Ferraro to be removed from the Clinton campaign .
In a follow - up interview with California newspaper the Daily Breeze , which originally broke the story , Ms Ferraro refused to withdraw her remarks .
" Racism works in two different directions .
I really think they 're attacking me because I 'm white , " she said .
Asked about the apparently worsening relations between the rival camps , Mr Obama said his campaign had been " very measured " in how it talked about Mrs Clinton .
" I 've been careful to say that I think Senator Clinton is a very capable person and that should she win the nomination , obviously I would support her , " he said .
" I 'm not sure that we 've been getting that same approach from the Clinton campaign . "
Pennsylvania beckons
Exit polls of Mississippi voters conducted for AP painted a picture of an electorate divided along racial lines .
Mr Obama won support from nine out of 10 black voters in the state , while Mrs Clinton won about three - quarters of the white vote , the exit polls suggest .
Mrs Clinton did better with groups of white voters that have , in some earlier races , favoured Mr Obama .
They include college - educated men , independent voters and those aged under 45 .
Clinton campaign spokeswoman Maggie Williams congratulated Mr Obama on his win .
" Now we look forward to campaigning in Pennsylvania and around the country as this campaign continues , " she said .
Hillary Clinton has been campaigning hard in Pennsylvania
Former President Bill Clinton planned to campaign for his wife in Pennsylvania on Wednesday , reflecting the state 's importance as the next major battleground .
It is due to vote on 22 April , with 158 delegates up for grabs .
Under the Democratic Party 's system of proportional representation , Mr Obama picked up at least 17 of the 33 delegates on offer in Mississippi .
Mrs Clinton gained 11 delegates , while five more are still to be awarded .
Mr Obama currently leads the fight for delegates with 1,596 to Mrs Clinton 's 1,484 , according to AP .
The successful candidate needs 2,025 delegates to secure the Democratic nomination .
Meanwhile , Mr McCain , who has raised less in election funds than either of his Democratic opponents , is touring the country as he seeks to fill his campaign coffers .
The Arizona senator will visit Boston , Pennsylvania and Chicago this week .
A judge is expected to rule on the class action request by this summer .
Wachovia , in court filings , has denied the suit ’s allegations .
The company declined to comment on the pending litigation .
However , Wachovia ’s senior vice president for risk management , Alan Chudoba , said that the bank introduced reforms aimed at telemarketing frauds last summer .
Those changes , which came about after an article in The New York Times last May reported that thieves had used Wachovia accounts , include greater scrutiny of accounts used by telemarketers and stronger fraud protections .
In a statement , Wachovia said : “ Earning the trust of our customers is at the heart of what we do every day and we regret this situation occurred .
We took this issue very seriously , and senior management , led by C.E.O.
Ken Thompson , was actively involved in directing aggressive steps to correct the processes related to this situation .
We are confident that the changes we ’ve implemented will help protect our customers . ”
Some advocates cautiously applaud the bank ’s efforts .
“ This could be very good news for millions of consumers , ” said Kathleen Keest with the Center for Responsible Lending , a group working to eliminate abusive financial practices .
“ But reforms tend to happen quickly in the light of publicity , followed by backsliding when the spotlight fades , ” Ms. Keest added .
One of the lawyers handing the Pennsylvania suit said Wachovia should do more .
“ I do n’t understand why , like other banks , Wachovia simply does n’t have a policy to avoid any business related to telemarketers , ” said Howard Langer , of the firm Langer , Grogan and Diver .
A Wachovia spokeswoman said the bank was not currently working with any telemarketers , would review any future clients who do work with telemarketers , and would reject any client solely focused on telemarketing .
As I make presentations at various conferences regarding our battery pack , or Energy Storage System ( ESS ) , I ’m often asked the question ” Is n’t the battery pack toxic ” and whether or not it can be disposed of safely .
To reach a wider audience , I thought it best to address these questions in our blog .
Energy Storage System Energy Storage System
First , it ’s necessary to understand the contents of our ESS .
The cells in our battery are composed mainly of lithium metal oxides .
They are manufactured in Japan , a country with very strict environmental laws .
Emissions and effluents are strictly controlled and monitored .
The cells meet the requirements set forth by the Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment 2002/95 / EC ( commonly referred to as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive or RoHS ) .
In other words , they do not contain any of the following :
Lead Mercury Cadmium Hexavalent chromium ( chromium xxx or Cr6 + )
Polybrominated biphenyls ( PBB ) Polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDE )
Above and beyond RoHS , our lithium ion cells contain no heavy metals , nor any toxic materials .
In fact , our cells and ESS , by law , could be disposed of by putting them in a landfill .
However , we have no intention of landfilling our ESS .
There are some exciting potential uses for the ESS in its afterlife .
While our ESS is designed to maximize performance and life in our roadster , at some unfortunate point , the ESS will come to the end of its useful life in the application :(.
However , it might be possible to use the ESS in other applications .
For example , the ESS could be used as a power source for off - grid backup or load leveling .
The battery requirements for such an application are not as demanding as a high performance vehicle battery .
This being said , eventually the batteries will no longer hold a significant charge and will need to be disposed of .
For this reason , we have been working closely with Kinsbursky Brothers , Inc. ( KBI ) / Toxco to implement a recycling plan .
The goal of this plan is the following :
maximize the amount of materials that can be reused ; maximize the amount of materials that can be recycled ; and , minimize energy consumption utilized during the transportation and recycling process ;
To understand how we attain these goals , you first need to understand a few basics about our ESS construction .
The ESS is comprised of 11 modules .
These 4.8kWh modules are made up of plastics , aluminum , copper , some electronics and lots of other confidential stuff to improve safety and performance .
Each of the roughly 35kg modules is inserted into an aluminum enclosure as shown above .
The enclosure also contains our 12V power supply , a battery system management board and other safety stuff .
Aside from the cells , most components in our ESS are designed to last the life of the car .
If an individual ESS reaches its end of life , we plan to replace the modules , not the whole ESS .
To retrieve the used modules from the market , Tesla will set up an exchange program in which customers receive a credit when they return their modules .
The recycling process follows the below steps :
The ESS is discharged for safety reasons
The Propylene glycol in the cooling tubes is drained and recycled locally
The electronics are removed and tested to determine if they can be reused
The wires and some other metals are removed and recycled locally
The modules are stored until the quantity is large enough to justify a stop on the “ milk run ” by the KBI truck ( this semi truck makes regular runs from their facility in Los Angeles to their recycling facility in Trail , British Columbia , Canada ) .
Upon arrival at Toxco ’s facility in Trail , the excitement begins ( if you ’re into hardcore destruction ) .
The modules are frozen in liquid nitrogen to prevent further reactions of the lithium components .
The modules are put into a shredder with mammoth teeth and broken into chunks less than 2 ” long ( tiny sparks appear , but otherwise it ’s surprisingly not that exciting ) .
The small chunks are fed into the hammer mill ( do n’t you love these names ? ) as pictured below to pulverize the remaining chunks into even smaller pieces .
Hammer mill Hammer mill Screens then separate the materials into three different products : fluff copper cobalt slurry
The fluff , pictured above , is trucked back to the U.S. border and properly disposed .
This mostly contains plastic .

This mostly contains plastic .
The copper cobalt product is shown on left .
The cobalt filter cake is shown on the right .
The copper cobalt product is shown on left .
The cobalt filter cake is shown on the right .
The copper cobalt product is sold for recovery of metals such as cobalt , aluminum , nickel , and copper .
The slurry is processed into a cobalt filter cake .
This cake is then reused in appliance coatings .
Soda ash is added to resulting process solution and precipitates out as lithium carbonate ; liquid is bled off after lithium salt recovery , and is sent off as non hazardous effluent for proper disposal .
As you can see , the recycling process is mainly a mechanical and chemical one .
It does not involve any smelters ; so emissions are kept to a minimum .
The result from this process is that we are able to recycle about 60 % of the ESS materials and reuse a further 10 % ( by weight ) .
We currently plan to landfill only the benign fluff , which comprises about 25 % of the ESS , but we expect to nearly eliminate this in the future when our volumes get higher and we can justify the effort required to separate and reuse the plastic .
Keep in mind that we have only done a few trial runs with our modules .
We ’re hoping that we wo n’t need to recycle our modules for many years to come .
However , we believe it is important , before we start shipping cars , to understand and plan for the eventual disposal of these vehicles .
The Philosophy of Ruby
A Conversation with Yukihiro Matsumoto , Part I
by Bill Venners
September 29 , 2003

Summary
Yukihiro Matsumoto , the creator of the Ruby programming language , talks with Bill Venners about Ruby 's design philosophy , including design imperfection , the danger of orthogonality , and the importance of the human in computer endeavors .
Yukihiro Matsumoto , or " Matz , " as he is known online , is the creator of the Ruby programming language .
Ruby is an object - oriented language suitable for writing day to day scripts as well as full - scale applications .
Matz began work on Ruby back in 1993 , because he wanted a language that made him productive while being fun to use .
Initially popular in Japan , Ruby has been finding its way into the hearts of programmers all over the world .
On September 24 , 2003 , Bill Venners met with Yukihiro Matsumoto at the JAOO conference in Aarhus , Denmark .
In this interview , which will be published in multiple installments on Artima.com , Yukihiro Matsumoto discusses Ruby 's design philosopy , the features of the Ruby language , and becoming a better programmer .
In this initial installment , Matz waxes philosophic about design imperfection , the danger of orthogonality , granting freedom with guidance , the principle of least surprise , and the importance of the human in computer endeavors .
No Perfect Language
Bill Venners : Dave Thomas , coauthor of Programming Ruby : A Pragmatic Programmer 's Guide , told me that you do n't think a language design should be perfect .
Why not ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Language designers want to design the perfect language .
They want to be able to say , " My language is perfect .
It can do everything . "
But it 's just plain impossible to design a perfect language , because there are two ways to look at a language .
One way is by looking at what can be done with that language .
The other is by looking at how we feel using that language — how we feel while programming .
Because of the Turing completeness theory , everything one Turing - complete language can do can theoretically be done by another Turing - complete language , but at a different cost .
You can do everything in assembler , but no one wants to program in assembler anymore .
From the viewpoint of what you can do , therefore , languages do differ — but the differences are limited .
For example , Python and Ruby provide almost the same power to the programmer .
Instead of emphasizing the what , I want to emphasize the how part : how we feel while programming .
That 's Ruby 's main difference from other language designs .
I emphasize the feeling , in particular , how I feel using Ruby .
I did n't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone , because you feel differently from me .
No language can be perfect for everyone .
I tried to make Ruby perfect for me , but maybe it 's not perfect for you .
The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python .
Orthogonal versus Harmonious
Bill Venners : Dave Thomas also claimed that if I ask you to add a feature that is orthogonal , you wo n't do it .
What you want is something that 's harmonious .
What does that mean ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : I believe consistency and orthogonality are tools of design , not the primary goal in design .
Bill Venners :
What does orthogonality mean in this context ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
An example of orthogonality is allowing any combination of small features or syntax .
For example , C++ supports both default parameter values for functions and overloading of function names based on parameters .
Both are good features to have in a language , but because they are orthogonal , you can apply both at the same time .
The compiler knows how to apply both at the same time .
If it 's ambiguous , the compiler will flag an error .
But if I look at the code , I need to apply the rule with my brain too .
I need to guess how the compiler works .
If I 'm right , and I 'm smart enough , it 's no problem .
But if I 'm not smart enough , and I 'm really not , it causes confusion .
The result will be unexpected for an ordinary person .
This is an example of how orthogonality is bad .
Bill Venners :
In other words , the orthogonal features will work once the compiler writer understands them and gets them to work .
But it is hard for programmers to understand it when they look at it , because it is complicated , because I have to figure out how these two things go together .
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
The orthogonal features , when combined , can explode into complexity .
Bill Venners :
So what 's the alternative ?
What would be more harmonious ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Just pick up one of those two to put into the language .
You do n't have to do everything that you can think of .
You need to pick one of them , even though both are good .
Freedom and Comfort
Bill Venners :
One of the design philosophies in the Python community is providing one and only one way to do things .
If you provide fifty different ways to do the same thing , then you 've provided convenience for code writers .
People can write things in their favorite way .
The tradeoff is for code readers .
When I read your code , you might have written it one way .
When I read the next person 's code , they may have written it another way .
So as a reader I end up needing to be familiar with all ways to accomplish the task , not just my favorite way of writing it .
That 's the design tradeoff .
The Python community seems to prefer the one and only one way approach , but Ruby seems to provide multiple ways to do the same thing .
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do the same thing .
I inherited that philosophy from Larry Wall , who is my hero actually .
I want to make Ruby users free .
I want to give them the freedom to choose .
People are different .
People choose different criteria .
But if there is a better way among many alternatives , I want to encourage that way by making it comfortable .
So that 's what I 've tried to do .
Maybe Python code is a bit more readable .
Everyone can write the same style of Python code , so it can be easier to read , maybe .
But the difference from one person to the next is so big , providing only one way is little help even if you 're using Python , I think .
I 'd rather provide many ways if it 's possible , but encourage or guide users to choose a better way if it 's possible .
The Joy of Ruby
Bill Venners :
In an introductory article on Ruby , you wrote , " For me the purpose of life is partly to have joy .
Programmers often feel joy when they can concentrate on the creative side of programming , So Ruby is designed to make programmers happy . "
How can Ruby make programmers happy ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
You want to enjoy life , do n't you ?
If you get your job done quickly and your job is fun , that 's good is n't it ?
That 's the purpose of life , partly .
Your life is better .
I want to solve problems I meet in the daily life by using computers , so I need to write programs .
By using Ruby , I want to concentrate the things I do , not the magical rules of the language , like starting with public void something something something to say , " print hello world . "
I just want to say , " print this ! "
I do n't want all the surrounding magic keywords .
I just want to concentrate on the task .
That 's the basic idea .
So I have tried to make Ruby code concise and succinct .
Bill Venners : Allowing programmers to write code that 's concise and succinct is one way to make them happy .
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
Yes , so they can concentrate on the problem itself .
Sometimes people jot down pseudo - code on paper .
If that pseudo - code runs directly on their computers , it 's best , is n't it ?
Ruby tries to be like that , like pseudo - code that runs .
Python people say that too .
Bill Venners : Yes , Python people do say that Python is executable pseudo - code .
What else is in Ruby to make programmers happy ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
In our daily lives as programmers , we process text strings a lot .
So I tried to work hard on text processing , namely the string class and regular expressions .
Regular expressions are built into the language and are very tuned up for use .
We also need to call into the operating system a lot .
Ruby can call every system call in Unix and most of the Windows API .
This brings the power and function of the operating system to the interpretive language environment .
So you can do daily systems administration and text processing programming .
That 's the major domain of at least my life , so I worked hard on making that good .
Bill Venners :
So basically Ruby helps me enjoy my life by helping me get my job done more quickly and with more fun ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
It helps me do that .
I 'm not sure Ruby works for you , but I hope so .
The Human Factor
Bill Venners :
In an interview , you said , " Do n't underestimate the human factor .
Even thought we are in front of computers , they are media .
We are working for human , with human . "
What do you mean by that ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Imagine you are writing an email .
You are in front of the computer .
You are operating the computer , clicking a mouse and typing on a keyboard , but the message will be sent to a human over the internet .
So you are working before the computer , but with a human behind the computer .
Most of the tasks we do are for humans .
For example , a tax calculation is counting numbers so the government can pull money out from my wallet , but government consists of humans .
Most of our tasks are related to humans after all .
So in programming , either we ask the computer to work for a human , or we describe our thoughts to a computer in a very unambiguous way that even computer can execute .
In the first case , making the computer work for humans , the target is a human through the computer .
In the second case , expressing our thoughts clearly enough to be understood and executed by computers , we express intent from our human brains and as a result it is performed by the computers .
So in both cases the object here is human .
Bill Venners :
What is important about thinking that way ?
You say , " Do n't underestimate the human factor . "
Why ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
Because computers do n't mind if I must make effort to communicate with them or if it is easy to communicate with them .
They do n't care if I put the numbers of instruction byte sequences in a file and feed it to them to run , or if a very high level language generated the instructions .
The computers do n't care .
We humans care about the effort we pay .
Often people , especially computer engineers , focus on the machines .
They think , " By doing this , the machine will run faster .
By doing this , the machine will run more effectively .
By doing this , the machine will something something something . "
They are focusing on machines .
But in fact we need to focus on humans , on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines .
We are the masters .
They are the slaves .
Bill Venners :
For the time being anyway .
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
For the time being anyway , until the age of Terminator .
Principle of Least Surprise
Bill Venners :
In an interview , you said " I designed Ruby to minimize my surprise .
I was very amazed when people around the world told me that Ruby reduced their surprise and enhanced their joy of programming .
Now I 'm pretty sure that programmer 's minds are alike all over the world . "
Why the principle of least surprise ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Actually , I did n't make the claim that Ruby follows the principle of least surprise .
Someone felt the design of Ruby follows that philosophy , so they started saying that .
I did n't bring that up , actually .
I wanted to minimize my frustration during programming , so I want to minimize my effort in programming .
That was my primary goal in designing Ruby .
I want to have fun in programming myself .
After releasing Ruby and many people around the world got to know Ruby , they said they feel the way I feel .
They came up with the phrase the principle of least surprise .
But actually , it 's often misunderstood .
Bill Venners :
How is it misunderstood ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Everyone has an individual background .
Someone may come from Python , someone else may come from Perl , and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language .
Then they come up to me and say , " I was surprised by this feature of the language , so therefore Ruby violates the principle of least surprise . "
Wait .
Wait .
The principle of least surprise is not for you only .
The principle of least surprise means principle of least my surprise .
And it means the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very well .
For example , I was a C++ programmer before I started designing Ruby .
I programmed in C++ exclusively for two or three years .
And after two years of C++ programming , it still surprised me .
Next Week

Interview with Ruby Create Y. Matsumoto , by S. Ibaraki :
http://www.cips.ca/news/national/news.asp?aID=1224
The weapon that the Pentagon wants to use to shoot down a failing satellite is well - tested .
But its one weakness could pose a problem , as the military tries to take out that satellite before it hits the atmosphere .
Center for Defense Information missile specialist Victoria Samson explains ...
Today , the U.S. Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system uses the Standard Missile ( SM ) - 3 to make what are known as " direct intercepts . "
That means there 's no explosion in space .
Instead , the SM - 3 destroys its target by ramming into with lots and lots of sheer kinetic energy – more than 130 megajoules worth , or " the equivalent of a 10 ton truck traveling at 600 miles per hour , " it maker says .
The missile uses two stages to get into near - space , and a third , kinetic warhead to strike .
The interceptor finds its targets largely because its seeker has been programmed to look for a certain type of object .
( The SM - 3 Block 1B , the upgrade to the current model , is supposed to have a two - color infrared seeker which presumably would increase its discrimination capabilities . )
Right now , the SM - 3 has tested against short - and medium - range ballistic missiles , and has made twelve intercepts out of fourteen attempts during testing .
These intercepts have been made while the target is in space ( tests have been at altitudes of over 100 miles ) , which provides it with a hot target against the cold environs of space .
The most recent flight test intercept attempt by a U.S. ship occurred on Nov.6 , 2007 and was a success .
Raytheon , which makes the interceptor , explains how it 's supposed to work :
As a ballistic missile threat rises above the horizon , [ the ] ship ’s radar acquires , begins tracking , and the weapon system begins calculating the engagement solution .
Upon command from the ship ’s weapon system , the SM - 3 boosts out of the launcher and establishes radio communication with the ship .
After MK 72 booster burnout , the MK
104 Dual Thrust Rocket Motor ( DTRM ) ignites .
In - flight communications from the ship guide the missile toward the predicted intercept point .
After MK 104 burnout and separation , the MK 136 Third Stage Rocket
Motor ( TSRM ) ignites , propelling the third stage out of the atmosphere .
Throughout its flight , the missile continues to receive in - flight target updates from the ship to refine the intercept guidance solution .
The TSRM contains two separate pulses that can be initiated to optimize the engagement timeline .
During flyout , the third stage pitches over and ejects the nosecone , exposing the SM - 3 Kinetic Warhead ( KW ) .
Following TSRM burnout roughly 30 seconds before intercept , the SM - 3 KW
separates from the third stage and immediately searches for the target based on pointing data received from the ship .
The KW acquires the ballistic missile warhead with its long - wavelength imaging infrared seeker .
The KW ’s Solid Divert and Attitude Control System precisely maneuvers the KW to enable a hit - to - kill intercept .
As the KW
closes on the target , it will identify the lethal payload area and shift its guidance aimpoint to ensure a lethal hit , destroying the target with more than 130 megajoules of kinetic energy , or the equivalent of a 10 ton truck traveling at 600 miles per hour .
But things have gone wrong .
The primary cause of one of the few U.S. flight test failures is the new guidance control system , the Divert and Attitude Control System , whose ceramic components cracked during a test .
This problem has not been remedied and is not being used in its most advanced mode .
Which means that the SM - 3's maneuverability against more demanding targets may be affected .
Given how all of the tests so far have dealt with targets that we knew down to the smallest detail how they would behave in - flight , this means that it has not been tested against unknown targets that may require last - minute changes in its trajectory .
The Pentagon has , as of the end of 2007 , 21 SM - 3 interceptors .
It 's not like they have a huge inventory to draw upon .
For this proposed shoot - down , the Pentagon is claiming that it will make modifications to three SM - 3 interceptors so that they can look for the malfunctioning satellite .
The modifications involve changing the software to target a satellite rather than a missile , David Wright of the Union of
Concerned Scientists tells New Scientist .
" This interceptor is really intended for missiles traveling at 3 to 4 kilometers per second ; the satellite they 're going to be shooting at has a speed of 7 to 8 kilometers per second . "
But the change draws attention to one of the program 's biggest flaws : if it does n't know what to look for , it is unlikely to make an intercept ( situational awareness is pretty slim ) .
And since the tests to date have all been highly scripted , the system has not had any practice of on the fly ( if you 'll excuse the phrase ) intercept attempts .

ALSO :
Evangelical conservatives , it sucks to be you .
I ’m really quite astounded at the extent to which the Republican establishment loathes Huckabee .
And I ’m even more surprised by the fact that his incessant , crass Bible - thumping is part of the reason ( Huckabee would have you think that Jesus died on the cross to give him a bump in the exit polls ) .
Yes , I ’ve known for a while that not all Republicans embrace the religious right , the culture wars , the incessant gay - bashing and all the other “ social ” issues .
But they certainly tolerated and enabled these folks for decades ( that ’s why some of us left the party a long time ago ) .
I suspected and hoped that there ’d come a time when the Republicans would finally have enough of the holy - rollers in their midst , but I never thought the revolt would come on little cat feet .
Almost without notice , something changed , and establishment Republicans are now turning on Huckabee and the “ values voters ” that he represents , big time .
After the jump , the days of trying to regulate your orgasm are over …
An illustrative example : some of the top right - wing blogs .
We do n’t usually quote right - wing blogs on AMERICAblog , partly because I ’m not convinced of their relevance to the political debate .
I think conservative blogs reflect mainstream conservatism ( which is different from mainstream Republicanism by being much farther to the right ) and are thus a useful barometer of what the right - wing of the GOP is thinking , but I do n’t believe that the conservative blogosphere actually influences politics and policy ( something the left - wing blogosphere does with abandon ) .
But , they are the canary in the coal mine of conservative thought , so it ’s interesting sometimes to see what they ’re saying .
And they do n’t heart Huckabee .
The Guardian summarizes three of the top GOP blogs and their reaction to Huckabee ’s victory last night in Iowa :
Michelle Malkin says : “ Obama gave the peppiest speech of the night – and his supporters registered the loudest on the applause - o- meter . ”
She also gives Paul Mirengoff at Power Line a nod , quoting his reference to Huckabee as a “ big spending governor who does n’t know much about foreign policy but did stay at a Holiday Inn Express ” .
Who ’s side is she on , again ?
Bloggers at the NRO ’s the Corner seem to be saying anyone but Huckabee … ”
They ca n’t stand the guy .
And what I ’m hearing from my sources is that a big part of the reason is his ties to , and proselytizing for , the religious right .
Republicans never liked or embraced the religious right .
Jerry Falwell , Pat Robertson and the men at the Concerned Women for America were convenient tools , foils , for the GOP to get out the vote of the speaking - in - tongues wing of the Republican party .
But when it came to the substance of the religious right ’s message – an overwhelming desire to federally regulate your orgasm – most Republicans politely coughed and looked the other way .
Well it seems the days of polite indifference to political extremism are finally over .
Hallelujah .

* Table and Research by Celine Nahory , Giji Gya and Misaki Watanabe
Only a minority of vetoes have been cast in cases where vital international security issues were at stake .
59 vetoes have been cast to block admission of member states .
Additionally , 43 vetoes have been used to block nominees for Secretary General , although these vetoes were cast during closed sessions of the Council and are not included in the table above .
The American Civil Liberties Union called the decision " paternalism at its worst , " but the Federal Communications Commission today denied the ABC television network 's appeal of a proposed $ 1.4 million dollar fine for an NYPD Blue program that briefly showed a woman 's naked behind .
And the agency went further in categorically defining the derrière as a sexual / excretory part of the human anatomy , rejecting ABC 's argument that it has no sexual or excretory function .
" If we interpreted these terms in the narrow physiological sense advocated by ABC and the ABC Affiliates , the airwaves could be filled with naked buttocks and breasts during daytime and prime time hours because they would be outside the scope of indecency regulation , " the FCC declared .
On Friday , January 25 , the Commission proposed the penalty against 51 ABC - owned or - affiliated stations for airing a February 2003 NYPD Blue scene — broadcast at 9 PM in the Central and Mountain Time zones — in which a pre-adolescent boy accidentally walks in on an older woman undressing in the bathroom .
Viewers get a glance at the woman 's naked behind before he backs out and apologizes .
The FCC declared the scene indecent " because it depicts sexual organs and excretory organs in a lewd and titillating way — specifically an adult woman 's buttocks . "
ABC attorneys defended the show , arguing that buttocks do not constitute a sexual organ .
But the FCC declared that this defense " runs counter to both case law and common sense , " citing the agency 's " two - pronged indecency analysis " defining " sexual or excretory organs or activities " as offensive .
In its February 9 appeal , attorneys for ABC and its affiliates revisited these arguments in their appeal .
They offered the FCC medical textbooks that defined sexual organs as " biologically defined , " arguing that " [t ] he only external organs or structures of the excretory system are the penis in males , and the urethral opening in females , which appears between the walls of the labia . "
The agency today again turned down this reasoning .
" The Commission has consistently interpreted the term ' sexual or excretory organs ' in its own definition of indecency as including the buttocks , " the FCC declared , " which , though not physiologically necessary to procreation or excretion , are widely associated with sexual arousal and closely associated by most people with excretory activities . "
Not even a g - string ?
Since the late 1950s , courts have ruled that " patently offensive " material must be defined as " utterly without redeeming social value " to be classified as obscene or indecent .
ABC 's response to the FCC 's proposed fine pointed to the " outstanding artistic and social merit " of NYPD Blue , and the adult advisory and parental rating that appeared at the beginning of the episode .
The network reminded the FCC of its deference to artistic judgment in the case of the movies Schindler 's List and Saving Private Ryan , which included nudity or profane language .
ABC also argued that the " fleeting " nature of the woman 's exposure exempted the program from punishment .
But the FCC reiterated the " clear and unmistakable " visual depiction in question .
" Here , the scene in question shows a female actor naked from behind , with her buttocks fully visible at close range , " the Commission concluded .
" She is not wearing a g - string or other clothing , nor are the shots of her buttocks pixelated or obscured . "
The Commission lifted the fine on some ABC affiliates for technical reasons .
44 ABC stations must pay $ 27,500 each for airing the program , a total penalty of $ 1.211 million , by the end of this Thursday .
Shortly after the FCC's January 25th announcement , the ACLU called the move " another government attempt to trump our own good judgment and determine what we 're mature enough to see . "
" NYPD Blue aired well past the bedtime of most children–at 10:00 PM in most markets , " ACLU Policy Counsel James Tucker said .
" Only those affiliates that aired the program between the hours of 6:00 - 10:00 PM would be subject to the fine , which just goes to show the fickle nature of the FCC 's rules .
By their logic , airing a shot of a bare behind at 10:30 PM is fine , but the same shot at 9:30 PM is worth millions in fines and penalties . "

Ivory Madison , serial entrepreneur , does n't want much from her latest venture , Redroom.com .
Not much , that is , except to build it into the Internet 's premier site for authors and the discussion of books and ideas .
Redroom.com , which premiered Dec. 21 , is one of the more ambitious online communities for writers to date and perhaps the most timely , aiming to capitalize on the current potential for profitability of social - networking sites .
It features 150 authors ( with 400 more to come ) , ranging from Amy Tan and Salman Rushdie to Edinburgh Castle Pub owner Alan Black ; Graham Leggatt , executive director of the San Francisco Film Society , who moonlights as a sci- fi writer ; and local mystery writer Cara Black .
Whereas publishing houses tend to put the bulk of their promotional efforts into big - name authors , Redroom.com puts writers of varying success on an equal footing , providing each with a Web page and blog .
The site is meant to appeal to readers , authors , booksellers and publishers as a kind of one - stop shop for biographical information , book reviews , blogs , video and audio content and author appearances .
It 's a virtual place where " midlist " authors in particular , who are watching their books get knocked off store shelves with alarming speed , can network and promote themselves , much as emerging musicians do on MySpace.com .
There 's a philanthropic component as well .
Authors designate their favorite charities or nonprofits , and a portion of the revenue generated from page and ad views goes to good causes .
" I want it to be a household name , where people start when they 're looking for an author , a book or what people are saying about current ideas or events , " said Madison over lunch at Absinthe , a few doors down from Redroom 's tasteful offices in San Francisco 's Hayes Valley .
" Because we have the writers , we have the potential to be the smartest conversation on the Web . "
Overly ambitious ?
Perhaps .
But Madison is undaunted , in part because of her professional history .
As a high school dropout from Mill Valley who went on to own her own coffeehouse and restaurant , start a chapter of the National Organization for Women in New Orleans and earn a law degree , Madison is accustomed to making unlikely things happen .
While in law school five years ago , she laid the foundation for the Web site by forming a writers ' group , the Redroom Writers Society , and developing its membership from four to 400 writers .
She also works as a consultant , coaching executives in leadership and management skills .
Some 10 percent of Redroom Omnimedia Corp. is owned by private investors , whose ranks include venture capitalists and investment bankers as well as publishing industry executives such as Nion McEvoy , chairman of Chronicle Books ( not affiliated with The Chronicle ) ; Internet guru Craig Newmark , founder of Craigslist ; and writers with good fortune and the financial means to invest , such as Robert Mailer Anderson , author of the novel " Boonville . "
All writers join the Web site for free , and soon readers will be able to have their own free pages , too .
Publishers also will be invited to have free Web pages on Redroom.com , with Chronicle Books serving as the Web site 's first test case .
Madison has collected $ 1.25 million in venture capital for the business and has hired a staff of 15 , and anticipates raising $ 2 million more in the coming months .
She said she expects to break even in 2008 and make $ 15 million in gross revenue in 2009 .
Newmark , who reads 50 books a year , mostly murder mysteries with a historical bent , looked at Redroom 's business plan and was impressed , especially because he saw they were doing " something that no one else was doing , " he said .
" One way to be exposed to the world is by reading , " he added .
" Anything that can be done to promote writers and reading is a good thing . "
Anderson is drawn by Redroom 's goal , which he described as " becoming the definitive , encyclopedic reference for writers , as defined by writers , which I think is different from Amazon.com defining writers in terms of the commerce they can garner from them , or the anonymity or carelessness that goes on in Wikipedia . "
Anderson also likes the sense of community the site is trying to foster , despite its limitations .
" I prefer the four - martini lunch with writer friends , " he quipped , " but given my kids and everything I 've got to do , Redroom will suffice . "
As the Internet becomes more important to the book industry , publishing houses are increasingly focusing on viral marketing , creating book - related videos and individual author sites , doing outreach to bloggers and even releasing books for downloading on the Web .
Last year , publisher Farrar , Straus & Giroux released on the Internet all the contents of a long book on innovations in science and technology .
" I do n't know whether anyone read all of it , but there were people who subscribed to all of it , " said Jeff Seroy , the company 's senior vice president of publicity and marketing .
" We felt it enhanced sales . "
The publishing house , as part of Macmillan , will participate in a new Web plan , to go into effect later this year , under which every author published will have his or her own micro-site .
" That 's because search - engine optimization is the single most important way to promote books on the Internet , " Seroy said , referring to a computer user 's search for an author 's name , book title or subject .
Another possible advantage for Redroom is that many authors who remain attached to the printed word do not excel at online self - promotion .
" I do n't think they should be obliged to create a sort of mom-and - pop shop for themselves , " said McEvoy , of Chronicle Books .
" And I think this makes it a lot easier for them to maintain a presence without learning HTML or paying the craftiest designer they can find to come up with the trippiest page .
It 's a sort of simplification of all that that should be helpful for them . "
Biographer Brenda Webster , who lives in the East Bay , is pleased with Redroom 's author - page format and the support she 's received from its staff .
" They 're absolutely helpful , especially to older people like me who are not up to the technological challenge , " Webster said .
" I find them remarkably attentive and helpful and cheerful and nice .
In the book world , this is quite a shock .
For midlist writers , you do not find people breaking their necks to help you have a beautiful page on a Web site . "
Then there are authors such as Tan who are so well known , they do n't need Redroom but who have joined in solidarity with other writers and because of the philanthropic component of the site .
" What 's not to like ? " said Tan , who shot to fame with the 1989 novel " The Joy Luck Club " and who recently wrote her first blog on Redroom - a self - described " virgin - blogger moment " about a ski trip and the importance of word games .
" Redroom said they would maintain a free blog and give money to charity .
I just thought , ' Well , yeah , sure , I 'll do that . ' "
But will an author site full of blog posts and links to book reviews attract a sizable audience ?
Edward Mathias , managing director of the Carlyle Group , a global private - equity firm in Washington , D.C. , and an adviser to Madison , thinks it has a shot , because of her energy and vision .
" I 've been involved in hundreds of deals , and I do n't know if I 've met an entrepreneur with her background and what she 's accomplished , " he said .
" You do n't know in situations like this is , is it viral ?
Will it catch on ?
If you want a good jockey , she seems like the person . "

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 6 , 2008
ARLINGTON , VIRGINIA – With the results of many of the “ Super Tuesday ” primaries and caucuses now finalized , the Ron Paul campaign is now projecting that it has at least 42 delegates to the national convention secured .
While much of the focus in yesterday ’s Super Tuesday contests focused on preference poll numbers , Ron Paul caucus - goers were focused on securing delegates to the national convention .
With dedicated supporters and an organization focused purely on securing delegates , the campaign has secured more delegates to the national convention in Minneapolis - St .
Paul than caucus straw polls might otherwise suggest .
According to campaign projections , a minimum of 24 delegates were won in yesterday ’s contests .
When added to projected delegates coming from strong showings in Iowa ( 4 ) , Nevada ( 8 ) , Louisiana ( 3 ) and Maine ( 3 ) , that brings the total delegate count to 42 delegates or more .
" Our goal has always been to walk into the national GOP convention with as many delegates as possible , " said Ron Paul 2008 campaign manager Lew Moore .
" The number of delegates we won yesterday could very well be the difference in a Convention where no one has a first - ballot majority .
With Dr. Paul ’s home state of Texas coming up , we feel we can enter the convention with a substantial number of delegates . "
In an agreement first reported by West Virginia television station WSAZ , three Ron Paul delegates were secured through an agreement with the Mike Huckabee campaign at the West Virginia state convention early Tuesday .
Ron Paul delegates to the state convention swung their sizable support to Huckabee – putting Huckabee over the top – in exchange for the delegates .
According to campaign projections from last night ’s results at least 3 delegates were won in Alaska , 5 delegates were won in North Dakota , 9 delegates were won in Minnesota , and 4 delegates were won in Colorado .
Additionally the results of the Louisiana Caucus may still change in favor of Ron Paul , where an ongoing legal challenge may result in most of that state ’s delegates going towards Ron Paul after state GOP officials violated their own rules to improperly put delegates from other campaigns on the ballots .

Thieves have disabled about 700 streetlights in Los Angeles , making off with 370,000 feet of valuable copper wiring over the last four months .
L.A. officials said it is a twist on copper thefts that have plagued new home sites and even some office buildings in the last few years .
FOR THE RECORD :
Copper wire :
An article in Wednesday ’s California section about the theft of copper wire from city streetlights said a pound of copper sells for $ 30 as scrap , according to police .
Investigators said a pound of copper sells for $ 2 to $ 3 as scrap . —
With some lights pilfered during the summer still out , city officials Tuesday expressed concerns about the safety of passing drivers , pedestrians and bikers .
The Los Angeles Public Works Department has already spent nearly $ 1 million repairing the lights .
“ When we have to go out and replace that wire , it takes away from other city services , ” said Public Works Commissioner Cynthia Ruiz at a news conference on a downtown street corner near samples of copper streetlight wire .
“ If I had an extra million dollars I could put 10 graffiti crews on the streets . ”
Among the hardest hit areas are Boyle Heights , the east San Fernando Valley and Wilmington , as well as a three - mile stretch of the Los Angeles River Bike Path between Los Feliz Boulevard and the L.A. Zoo .
Police in other cities , including San Bernardino , Redlands , San Jose , San Francisco and Pasadena , are struggling with a similar spate of streetlight wire thefts .
Some large blocks in the Eastside have not had street lighting since August .
At the corner of 12th and Soto streets Tuesday , Mary Rivera worked in darkness loading furniture she had just bought from a warehouse store into her truck .
“ When you do n’t have light in the streets you can have an accident , especially when you have people who are drinking liquor and walking in the street , ” Rivera said .
Jose Sanchez , 34 , a production manager at AAA Glass Corp. on East 12th Street , watched Tuesday as darkness fell and the streetlight in front of his business remained off .
“ Now you can see it ’s very dark , ” he said .
“ They stole a car last week from here .
And they broke into this company Thanksgiving weekend .
I think it does make a difference . ”
There are more than 200,000 streetlights in Los Angeles , and authorities worry the thefts will continue unless they target the criminals .
The thieves pry open boxes at the base of two neighboring poles , exposing a stretch of copper wire that connects the poles underground , then snip the wire and pull it out from one end .
The wire can take hours to haul -- 10 feet weighs about a pound and sells for up to $ 30 as scrap -- which is why thieves usually target borderline industrial areas after dark , police said .
Thieves have plagued construction sites , parking lots , stadiums and vacant buildings across Southern California in recent years , scavenging for copper wires , pipes and panels .
But as copper prices climbed last summer , streetlight thefts increased , said Thomas Higgins , a Los Angeles County prosecutor .
Cities across the nation are also grappling with a rash of streetlight wire thefts and have found ways to prevent the damage .
Some in central Florida leave streetlights on all day or replace copper with aluminum wire , which has a shorter life span but is less attractive to thieves .
Others have reinforced streetlight wiring boxes , welding some shut .
“ This problem is happening all over the country , but because we are one of the largest systems , we are noticing it more , ” said Ed Ebrahimian , director of L.A. 's Bureau of Street Lighting .
Ebrahimian said city workers try to better secure the streetlight wire they replace but are often foiled by thieves .
Last month , they welded boxes shut along the L.A. River Bike Path only to see thieves break in and steal the wire again , Ebrahimian said .
Higgins said lawmakers could combat the thefts by changing the law to hold copper scrap dealers to the same standard as pawnbrokers dealing in gold , who must keep detailed records of those they buy from or face misdemeanor charges .
Police say it is difficult to charge copper thieves .
It is a felony to steal more than $ 400 in city property , but investigators say they often catch wire thieves just as they are getting started , with less than $ 400 in wire .
Councilman Jose Huizar , who receives about seven calls a week from Boyle Heights constituents complaining about broken streetlights , wants to increase enforcement and penalties for scrap dealers who buy stolen copper wire and possibly label city wire to prevent it from being stolen .
Police encourage residents to write down license plate numbers and contact them when they see people other than city crews removing streetlight wire .

Telecommuting has become all the rage over the past half decade for companies that can pull it off with some or all of their employees .
About 37 percent of US companies have adopted some kind of flexible work arrangement , and that rate is reportedly growing by 11 percent each year .
While the health , life , and work benefits for those who can telecommute are undeniable , a new study says the practice is actually having a negative effect on coworkers who still have to fight morning traffic or jostle for a seat on the subway , also known as " those left behind in the office . "
Until now , virtually all of the studies performed on telecommuting have focused on the benefits for employees and their employers .
Timothy Golden , associate professor in the Lally School of Management & Technology at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , sampled 240 professional employees from an unnamed medium - sized company to observe how telecommuting affects employees who stay in the office .
Golden found that in - office employees took less satisfaction in their jobs and felt less of a relationship and obligation to their company as the number of telecommuting coworkers grew .
In - office employees in his study became disappointed at having fewer and weaker relationships .
They also got frustrated at a perceived increase in workload and difficulties that telecommuting can present to finishing projects and building strong working relationships .
On the bright side , Golden also says that keeping a close eye on various aspects of telecommuting can potentially help stave off the negative effects on in - office employees .
Managing the amount of time coworkers telecommute , having face - to - face interaction , and giving job autonomy can all potentially improve in - office coworkers ' job satisfaction and company relationship .
Requiring at least some office time for telecommuters , especially those in a team - based environment , could help balance the freedom that traveling employees enjoy with the relationships and traditional in - office requirements many environments may still require .
In my experience telecommuting for a few publications and working in environments that had telecommuters , I 've seen a few pros and cons .
Requiring telecommuters to come into the office at least once or twice a week definitely helped with interoffice relationships and building a functional team for projects .
There are just some aspects of people and relationships that do n't translate well , if at all , to e-mail , IRC , and instant messaging .
But in some of the telecommuting positions I 've had , I still found it possible to build a fairly strong and even fun team relationship by being smart about how we communicated over e-mail lists and via group chat .
Enforcing things like specific work time and casual , personal time in the chat room did wonders for working when the time called for it , and yet joking around and getting to know each other when we were off the clock , so to speak .
That said , perhaps the most important takeaway from Golden 's initial findings is that telecommuting is n't an exact science yet .
It may work for some companies who implement face time for at least part of the week or month , while employees at another company may simply not be interested in letting their coworkers roam free .
For those of you who either telecommute or work with telecommuters , how is it working out ?
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold futures broke above the psychologically key level of $ 1,000 an ounce Thursday , propelled by ongoing dollar weakness and bleak news from the financial sector .
Early Thursday , gold for April delivery soared to a record high of $ 1,001.50 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
This was the first time that gold surpassed $ 1,000 an ounce .

Later in the session , the gold contract gave up some of its gains and ended up $ 13.30 at $ 993.80 an ounce .
" Today 's spike will likely become known as the Carlyle / Drake rally , " said Jon Nadler , senior analyst at Kitco Bullion Dealers , in a research note .
" The imminent doom of the Washington - based bond fund and probable demise of the hedge fund sent icy shivers through the financial markets that way overshadowed the cheer we witnessed following the Fed 's term facility plan the other day , " Nadler said .
On Wall Street , U.S. stocks reversed early sharp losses to end higher after Standard & Poor 's suggested that the bulk of write - downs linked to bad home loans may be behind for banks .

The statement helped to partially offset concerns about the potential collapse of a fund owned by Carlyle Group CARYF and another weak report on retail sales .
Carlyle Capital , the bond fund affiliated with private equity firm The Carlyle Group , is on the verge of collapse after failing to agree a new financing deal with lenders .
“ " This is just the start of things , and if the government continues to give away money and torpedo the dollar , gold will do nothing but move higher . " ” — Zachary Oxman , Wisdom Financial
The fund said late Wednesday that it expects lenders will soon take possession of " substantially all " its remaining assets after it was unable to meet surging margin calls on its portfolio of residential - mortgage - backed securities .

Adding to the bad news from the financial sector , Drake Management LLC , a hedge - fund firm run by Anthony Faillace and Steve Luttrell , is mulling options that include shutting its largest fund after losses and redemption requests from some investors , according to a letter sent to clients Wednesday .

Gold at $ 1,000 " will one day , and likely not too far off in the future , be looked at as a foreshadowing milestone , " said Peter Spina , an analyst at GoldSeek.com .
" The gravity of the unfolding situation is starting to sink in with investors and that leads many more of them to move capital into real money -- into gold and silver , " Spina said .
The dollar rebounded in afternoon trading Thursday from its earlier plunge against the Japanese yen , when the U.S. currency briefly fell through the psychologically key 100 - yen level for the first time in over 12 years .

The dollar also recovered from all - time lows against the euro and the Swiss franc hit earlier Thursday .
The gold market is boosted by " dollar weakness , extreme concern over the market and a continued bid by funds that are taking the Fed money they are given and speculating with it vs. lending it , " said Zachary Oxman , a senior trader at Wisdom Financial .
" This is just the start of things , and if the government continues to give away money and torpedo the dollar , gold will do nothing but move higher , " Oxman said .
On Tuesday , the Federal Reserve and other leading central banks doubled to more than $ 400 billion the amount of money they 're willing to lend to banks and bond dealers , hoping to flood dysfunctional credit markets with enough money to get them working again .
In more bleak economic news Thursday , the Commerce Department reported that consumer spending weakened again in February as U.S. retail sales fell 0.6 % .
Most kinds of retail stores reported lower seasonally adjusted sales in February even before the impact of inflation was counted .
The figures were weaker than expected by Wall Street economists , who forecast no change in retail sales .

A computer nerd from Shepherd 's Bush , West London , became al Qaeda 's top internet agent , it can be revealed today .
Younes Tsouli , 23 , an IT student at a London college , used his top - floor flat in W12 to help Islamist extremists wage a propaganda war against the West .
Under the name Irhabi 007 — combining the James Bond reference with the Arabic for terrorist — he worked with al Qaeda leaders in Iraq and came up with a way to convert often gruesome videos into a form that could be put onto the Web .
Scroll down for more ...
Videos he posted included messages from Osama bin Laden and images of the kidnapping and murder of hostages in Iraq such as American Nick Berg .
His capture led to the arrest of several Islamic terrorists around the world , including 17 men in Canada and two in the US .
Associates linked to Tsouli in the UK have also now been detained .
His 10 - year jail sentence was increased
to 16 years last month .
At first intelligence operatives who came across his activities dismissed him as a joke .
It was only when anti-terrorist detectives began trawling through files on his computer after his arrest that they realised his true significance .
When he was seized , forensic science officers found that Tsouli had been creating a website called YOUBOMBIT .
At his trial at Woolwich crown court a jury heard how the Met trawled through a “ hugely gigantic ' ' amount of
material — computers , CDs and memory sticks — to bring Tsouli and two other men to justice .
Detectives found literature urging Muslims to take up the fight against other religions .
It was the first time anyone in Britain had been prosecuted for inciting terrorist murder purely based on the internet , the court heard .
Tsouli , who set up and ran several sites over the summer of 2005 , was described as the most prominent of the three on trial .
The other two were also jailed .
One intelligence source said : “ In a network structure , if you get the right guy the whole thing goes down . ”
Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke , the head of the Met 's counterterrorism operations , said : “ It was the
first virtual conspiracy to murder that we have seen . ”
Tsouli arrived in London in 2001 with his father , a Moroccan diplomat .
He studied IT at a college in central London and was quickly radicalised by images of the war in Iraq posted on the internet .
By 2003 he had already begun posting his own material including a manual on computer hacking and a
year later had moved on to publishing extremist images and al Qaeda propaganda on the web .
It is claimed al Qaeda leaders in Iraq spotted Tsouli 's work and took the decision to recruit him , using his expertise to post their own extremist videos to a wider audience .
In 2005 , Tsouli became administrator for the web forum al - Ansat , used by 4,500 extremists to communicate with
each other , sharing such practical information as how to make explosives and how to get to Iraq to become a suicide bomber .
But the enterprise had become so huge , it began to attract the attention of cyber - trackers who monitor the
internet for extremists , leading to Tsouli 's arrest .

Investors collectively spend around $ 100 billion a year trying to beat the stock market .
That ’s the finding of a rigorous effort to measure the total costs of Americans ’ efforts to surpass the returns they would have received by simply holding a stock index fund .
The huge price tag helps explain why beating a buy - and - hold strategy is so difficult .
Here is much more , and from Felix Salmon .
You can think of this sum as the amount it costs to keep markets relatively efficient , a source of societal fraud and rent - seeking , a Nash equilibrium mixed strategy ( no one tries to beat the market on every margin ) , a donation to the broader social good , or most properly all of the above .
Interfluidity adds comment .
A pop quiz for US citizens :
The next time you want to leave the USA .
will your government let you go ?
When you want to come back , will they allow you to come home ?
Unless people assert their rights , maybe not .
And you ’ll need the government to give you papers or permission to do so .
The Department of Homeland Security has already issued regulations effective February 18th that will forbid international airlines from letting anyone on a plane to or from the US without individualized express prior permission from the DHS .
Those rules were issued in spite of our objections that they violate the US Constitution international human rights treaties .
And already the Department of Homeland Security is trying to enforce an illegal regulation that purports to require passports ( issued at the “ discretion ” and for the “ convenience ” of the government , not as a matter of right , and which take weeks to obtain if you want to travel on short notice ) for citizens to fly between the USA and Canada or Mexico .
( Again , having ignored our objections . )
The DHS has proposed to extend that rule to those crossing the land borders with Canada and Mexico , closing the last possible means of leaving the USA , or returning home from abroad , without DHS papers or permission .
Now , without even considering our objections or any others , the DHS has announced a change in “ internal ” procedures that would achieve essentially the same result as the “ pending ” rulemaking : Effective January 31st , the goons from the DHS Customs and Border Protection division will be instructed not to permit anyone to cross the US border — even US citizens — unless they present government - issued documents proving their citizenship to their satisfaction .
The burden will be on you to “ prove ” your right to travel , rather than on the government to prove you are doing something wrong if they want to prevent you .
And only government - issued documents will suffice .
If the government wo n’t give you papers , you can neither leave nor return to your own country .
Memory capacity may be linked to filtering out irrelevant information
People who are good at remembering things , even with distractions , have more activity in the basal ganglia on brain scans , the Swedish team found .
The work in Nature Neuroscience could help explain why some people are better at remembering things than others .
Clinically , it could also aid the understanding of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
The ability to hold information in the mind so that it is immediately accessible is known as working memory .
We use working memory all of the time - for example , when doing a simple maths calculation in our head or recalling a telephone number .
There will be many brain regions that filter irrelevant information , so it is too early to tell if these findings will have a bearing on conditions such as ADHD
John Duncan
Medical Research Council scientist
Its capacity is limited and seems to vary from person to person .
These variations are not just due to having a larger or smaller memory store , but also due to differences in how effectively irrelevant items are kept out of memory , the Karolinksa Institute researchers believe .
Distracters
Dr Torkel Klingberg and colleague Fiona McNab used a special brain scan called functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to track what was happening in the brains of 25 healthy volunteers .
The volunteers were asked to perform a computer - based task that required them to respond to target visual images , with or without distractions .
A noise informed subjects when an upcoming visual display would contain irrelevant distracters along with the targets .
When this cue occurred , neural activity increased in the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex before the visual display appeared , suggesting the brain was preparing to " filter out " the upcoming distracters .
Also , greater activity in a specific part of the basal ganglia - the globus pallidus - correlated with less unnecessary storage in another part of the brain , the posterior parietal cortex , which is sensitive to the amount of information held in memory .
The team is currently investigating methods of improving attention and working memory in children with ADHD and monitoring any changes with fMRI .
Medical Research Council scientist John Duncan said : " This is very interesting work and gives a window on important parts of the brain .
" The basal ganglia are very strong candidates for involvement in brain disorders where people have difficulty with attentional control .
" But there will be many brain regions that filter irrelevant information , so it is too early to tell if these findings will have a bearing on conditions such as ADHD . "
SACRAMENTO - The Army is spending $ 2.6 billion on hundreds of European - designed helicopters for homeland security and disaster relief that have a crucial flaw :
They are not safe to fly on hot days , according to an internal report obtained by the Associated Press .
While the Army scrambles to fix the problem , potentially adding millions to the taxpayer cost , at least one high - ranking lawmaker is calling for the deal to be scrapped .
During flight tests in Southern California in mild 80 - degree weather , cockpit temperatures in the UH - 72A Lakota soared above 104 degrees , the point at which the Army says the communication , navigation , and flight - control systems can overheat and shut down .
No cockpit equipment failed during the nearly 23 hours of testing , according to the report , prepared for the Army in July .
But it concluded that the aircraft " is not effective for use in hot environments . "
The Army said that to fix the problem it will take the highly unusual step of adding air conditioners to many of the 322 helicopters ordered .
The retrofitting will cost at least $ 10 million and will come out of the Army 's budget .
Kim Henry , a spokeswoman for US Army Aviation & Missile Command at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama , said that the Army began outfitting the helicopters with vents after the report was issued and that they have been effective at lowering temperatures .
The Army , however , decided it still needs to put air conditioning on many of the choppers , including all those configured for medical evacuations , said an Army spokesman , Major Tom McCuin ..
Representative Duncan Hunter of California , the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee , contends that the lightweight helicopter will still have too many weaknesses .
" In my view , we would be well advised to terminate the planned buy of 322 Lakota helicopters and purchase instead additional Blackhawk helicopters , " Hunter said in a letter this week to Army Secretary Pete Geren .
But McCuin said , " It 's certainly a concern to people out there in the field now because it 's hot in those cockpits , but it 's being fixed . "
The Army has received 12 of the Lakotas from American Eurocopter Corp. , a North American division of Germany 's European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. Testing on the first six by an independent arm of the Pentagon revealed the problems .
The rest of the choppers are scheduled for delivery over the next eight years .
The Lakota represents the Army 's first major effort to adapt commercially available helicopters for military use .
Air conditioning is standard in commercial versions of the aircraft , which have not had overheating problems .
But the military usually avoids air conditioning in military aircraft to reduce weight and increase performance .
" We do n't need air conditioning in the Blackhawks , so we did n't think it would be an issue " in the Lakota , McCuin said .
" But when we got the helicopter into the desert , we realized it was a problem . "
The Army plans to use the Lakota for search - and - rescue missions in disaster areas , evacuations of injured people , reconnaissance , disaster relief , and VIP tours for members of Congress and Army brass .
All of its missions will be in the United States or other noncombat zones .
Blackhawks , Chinooks , and other helicopters will still be available for more demanding duties , such as fighting wildfires .
Guy Hicks , a spokesman for European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. , declined to comment directly on the criticism of the aircraft .
" We 're proud of our partnership with the Army and the UH - 72A , but we defer on anything to do with aircraft requirements and performance .
It 's the Army 's program and they should address that , " he said .
The Lakota has another problem ; testers said it fails to meet the Army 's requirement that it be able to evacuate two critically injured patients at the same time .
The Lakota can hold two patients , but the cabin is too cramped for medics to work on more than one at a time , the testers said .
The report by Dr. Charles McQueary , the Defense Department 's director of operational testing , said that overall , the Lakota performs better than the Kiowa or Huey and that pilots found it easy to fly .
But the report said inadequate ventilation , heat emitted by aircraft electronics , and sunlight streaming through the large windows caused cockpit temperatures to reach 104.9 degrees during a simulated mission in California .
The aircraft 's safe operating limit is 104 degrees , according to the Army .

The rise of oxygen and the oxidation of deep oceans between 635 and 551 million years ago had an impact on the increase and spread of the earliest complex life , including animals , according to a study in PNAS .
The atmosphere had almost no oxygen until 2.5 billion years ago and it was not until about 600 million years ago that the atmospheric oxygen level rose to a fraction of modern levels .
Geologists and evolutionary biologists have speculated that the rise of the breathing gas and subsequent oxygenation of the deep oceans are intimately tied to the evolution of modern biological systems .
To test the interaction between biological evolution and environmental change , an international team of scientists from Virginia Tech , the University of Maryland , University of Nevada at Las Vegas , and Chinese Academy of Sciences , examined changes in the geochemistry and fossil distribution of 635 - to 551 - million - year old sediments preserved in the Doushantuo Formation in the Yangtze Gorges area of South China .
The photo ( field of view about 0.15 millimeter in width ) is of an exceptionally preserved eukaryotic fossil from the Doushantuo Formation ( 635 –551 million years old ) in South China .
High - resolution geochemical data from the Doushantuo Formation indicate that the early diversification of eukaryotes may have coupled with episodic oxygenation of Ediacaran oceans .

Millions of years ago , the Yangtze Gorges area was an ancient sea , said Kathleen A. McFadden , a Ph.D. candidate in geobiology at Virginia Tech and the lead author of the article .
To determine when there was enough oxygen to support animal life in the ocean , the researchers asked , “ What kind of geochemical evidence would there be in the rock record ? ” said Shuhai Xiao , associate professor of geosciences at Virginia Tech .
Scientists hypothesized that there was a lot of dissolved organic carbon in the ocean when oxygen levels were low .
If oxygen levels rose , some of this organic carbon would be oxidized into inorganic forms , some of which can be preserved as calcium carbonate in the rock record .
“ We measured the carbon isotope signatures of organic and inorganic carbon in the ancient rocks to infer oxidation events , ” said co-author Ganqing Jiang , assistant professor of geology at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas .
The layers of sediment exposed by the Three Gorges Dam represent millions of years of deposits .
“ We went through road cuts , bed by bed , measuring and describing the exposed rock , then took small rock samples every few feet or so , , ” said McFadden .
She collected about 200 samples ; hundreds of samples were taken to three labs .
The researchers cleaned and crushed the small samples to powder , which they reacted with acid to release carbon dioxide from carbonate minerals , and then burned the residue to get carbon dioxide from organic matter .
“ The CO2 that is released was measured with mass spectrometers to gives us the isotopic signature of the carbonate and organic carbon that was present in the rock , ” said McFadden .
“ The relative abundances of the carbon - 12 and carbon - 13 isotopes , which are stable and do not decay with time , provide a snapshot of the environmental processes taking place in the ocean at the different times recorded in the layers of rock , ” McFadden said .
The stratigraphic pattern of carbon isotope abundances suggested to these researchers that the ocean , which largely lacked oxygen before animals arrived on the scene , was aerated by two discrete pulses of oxygen .
“ The first pulse apparently had little impact on a large organic carbon reservoir in the deep ocean , but did spark changes in microscopic life forms , ” McFadden said .
“ The second event , which occurred around 550 million years ago , however , resulted in the reduction of the organic carbon reservoir , indicating that the ocean became fully oxidizing just before the evolution and diversification of many of Earth ’s earliest animals , ” she said .
“ The Doushantuo Formation has a wonderful fossil record , ” McFadden said .
“ It allows us to look at major fossil groups , when they appear and when they disappear , and to see a relationship between oxidation events and biological groups . ”
“ This study supports the growing view that life and environment co-evolved through this tumultuous period of Earth history , ” said geochemist Alan J. Kaufman , a co-author of the study from the University of Maryland .
The researchers analyzed the fossils in the Doushantuo Formation , from microscopic life forms of 635 million years ago to large algae around 551 million years ago .
Looking at data from four locations with very similar isotopic records , they report that the first oxygen spike resulted in a rise in microscopic organisms , some of which are thought to be the earliest animal embryos .
The second spike in oxygen coincides with a dramatic increase in species of large complex algae .
“ Both oxidation events appear to coincide with increased diversity of fossils assemblages in the Doushantuo basin , with the number of species nearly doubling , ” McFadden said .
Following this second oxidation event , between 550 and 542 million years ago , there was a worldwide increase of Ediacara organisms , complex macroscopic life forms , an event recently dubbed as the Avalon Explosion ( www.vtnews.vt.edu/story.php?relyear=2008&itemno=1).
“ This was when we see the first burrowing animals and biomineralizing animals in the fossil record , ” McFadden said .
Biomineralizing animals are the first animals to form external skeletons , or shells .
The triggers for the oxidation events remain elusive , however .
“ These events recorded in the ocean were probably related to oxygen in the atmosphere reacting with sediments on land , ” McFadden said .
“ Weathering of rocks and soils on the continents would result in the release of certain dissolved ions , such as sulfate , into rivers .
These would then be transported to the sea where they might be used by bacteria to oxidize the organic carbon pool in the deep oceans , ” she said ..

British media agreed not to report the prince 's deployment
The 23 - year - old royal , who has spent the last 10 weeks serving in Helmand Province , is flying back to the UK amid concerns for his safety .
The move follows the collapse of a news blackout deal over his tour of duty , which was broken by foreign media .
There had been fears the prince , who is third in line to the throne , could become a target for the Taleban .
In a statement , the Ministry of Defence described the reporting of Harry 's deployment by foreign media as " regrettable " but said that contingency plans for such a leak were in place .
Prince Harry , in an interview recorded in Afghanistan prior to his withdrawal , said he had enjoyed being away from the press and England .
" I do n't want to sit around Windsor , because I generally do n't like England that much and it's nice to be away from all the press and the papers ..... , " he said .
More recently he took part in a major operation to disrupt Taleban lines of communication
Brigadier Andrew Mackay
It added that while the prince should have returned " in a matter of weeks " with his Household Cavalry regiment battlegroup , the situation had now " clearly changed " .
Brigadier Andrew Mackay , Commander of Task Force Helmand , said Harry had been " deployed in the field , conducting operations against the Taleban " at the time of the decision .
He continued : " He has seen service both in the south of Helmand and in the north .
More recently he took part in a major operation to disrupt Taleban lines of communication . "
' Risks '
Chief of the Defence Staff , Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , in consultation with head of the Army , General Sir Richard Dannatt , had taken the final decision to withdraw Harry immediately , the statement said .
" This decision has been taken primarily on the basis that the worldwide media coverage of Prince Harry in Afghanistan could impact on the security of those who are deployed there , as well as the risks to him as an individual soldier , " it added .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid tribute to the prince and said Britain owed him a " debt of gratitude " for his service in Afghanistan , but he added that it was correct to bring Harry back to the UK .
HAVE YOUR SAY Prince Harry is a trained soldier .
I'm in the service too and I 'm pleased for him that he was allowed to go Deborah , Hampshire , UK
" Security considerations come first .
That has been the deciding factor which was made by our defence staff and I think that everybody will respect that is the right decision . "
He thanked Harry , a second lieutenant , for the " professionalism and dedication he has shown " , and said the decision to bring him home was a reminder of the " difficulties and challenges " the armed forces faced on active duty .
Conservative leader David Cameron agreed that it was " right " to withdraw the prince from Afghanistan , but said everyone in Britain should be " proud of what he has done " .
" It 's incredibly tough out there .
He 's obviously shown great courage and bravery as all our soldiers do out there .
" And what they do is really important , not just for the future of Afghanistan but for the safety of our country too . "
' Dangerous tasks '
A member of the Household Cavalry , Prince Harry was based in a former madrassa along with a Gurkha regiment .
Work involved calling up allied air cover in support of ground forces and going out on foot patrols .
Defence Secretary Des Browne also commended Harry , saying the prince was " an example of a generation of young people " who were " prepared to take on these very serious and dangerous tasks for our security " .
The Queen , opening the Queen 's Court Care Home in Windsor , said she believed he had done " a good job in a very difficult climate " .

A news black - out is unusual , but not unique

The prince 's deployment was subject to a news blackout deal struck between the MoD and newspapers and broadcasters in the UK and abroad .
It is understood that the news was first leaked in an Australian publication in January but only after it appeared on the influential US website , The Drudge Report , did the deal break down .
In exchange for not reporting the prince 's deployment , some media organisations were granted access to the prince in Afghanistan for interviews and filming .
The prince 's withdrawal is the second major blow to his army career .
Last year , a planned tour to Iraq had to be cancelled at the last minute because of a security risk .
The cost of petrol in the US and UK is soaring
The price of crude oil has hit an all - time high for the fifth time in six trading sessions .
New York sweet light crude touched a new high of $ 108.21 a barrel , before edging down to trade at $ 107.93 .
Analysts say traders are investing in commodities to protect themselves against the falling dollar .
Another factor pushing up prices is last week 's decision by producers ' cartel Opec to keep output unchanged , despite rising demand in China .
The dollar has been reaching new lows against the euro and other key currencies since last summer , and was hit again on Friday by a US employment report showing the labour market at its weakest in five years .
This has prompted traders to seek refuge in commodities , including oil and gold , which are more likely to sustain their value than the greenback .
In Europe , Brent crude hit $ 104.42 at one point on Monday - also a record .
Financial strain
Analysts at the International Energy Agency said that real oil prices are higher than the previous peak reached in April 1980 , which was $ 102.53 in today 's money .
But the oil price measure used then was slightly different to the one in current use and so it is difficult to make an accurate comparison .
The high oil price is making petrol and energy costs more expensive around the world , putting financial pressure on businesses and household budgets .
Last Sunday the Crown Plaza Hotel in the Medical Center area of Houston was demolished through " controlled implosion . "
Everything went as planned and the local news channels covered the demolition of the presumably " vacant " hotel .
A home video has now surfaced which casts doubts on whether the hotel was indeed completely vacant at the time it went down .
The angle from which the video was shot seems to show a shadow and a door closing on one of the hotel floors just before the building buckled and crumbled .
The Houston police department is now investigating and searching the rubble for human remains to determine if someone had sneaked into the hotel without the knowledge of the demolition crew .
The video that set the investigation rolling is here .
It is eerie .
Watch the area highlighted by the oval .
Do you see a shadow ?
Do you see a door closing just before the blast ?
Mr. Cole said Republicans believed the presidential campaign would ultimately motivate their voters and donors and help them oust Democrats who in 2006 gained seats in Republican territories .

If Senator John McCain of Arizona wins the presidential nomination , Mr. Cole said , that could help Republicans in areas with significant Hispanic populations combined a strong antispending message that appeals to the party ’s base .
Mr. McCain is also closely tied to a push for an overhaul of immigration policy that raised the prospect of permanent legal residency for some illegal immigrants .
That could dilute the anti-immigration message that House Republicans have seen as one of their most effective weapons .
Mr. Davis is a veteran of the class of 1994 that thrust the Republicans into control of the House .
He forged a reputation as an independent while he was the senior Republican on the House oversight committee , occasionally challenging the Bush administration .
He represents a suburban district that Democrats view as a seat that could most easily fall in to their hands , along with open districts in Illinois , New Jersey , New York and Ohio .
Mr. Davis said his return to life in the minority party was just one factor in deciding to leave , saying he wanted a sabbatical from politics to look into other opportunities .
The congressman , who oversaw the House Republican campaign operation in 2000 and 2002 , acknowledged that the landscape for his party was not promising .
“ There is n’t any question it is going to be a tough year , ” he said .
Four of the 28 Republicans who are so far leaving the House quit before their terms ended .
They will be replaced in special elections before November , giving the winners of those races at least the technical mantle of incumbency in the general election .
That leaves 24 open Republican seats , though leaders of both parties expect at least a few more Republican retirements as state filing deadlines arrive .
The high point for end - of - session Republican retirements is 27 in 1952 , according to Congressional records .
What does it tell us ?
The document is dated November 14 , 2003 , but this appears to be the date it was printed .
The time period covered in the chronology is limited to the first six weeks of the FBI 's investigation and its most recent source is from October 22 , 2001 .
This raises an obvious question : why did the 9/11 Commission relied heavily on such an early draft ?
And why were ties to the Saudi govt .
omitted from report ?

You may not remember the name Wafaa Bilal , but you probably remember the Iraqi - American who locked himself in a room with a paintball gun controlled by random individuals on the Internet for thirty days – that was him , and it ’s now nine months later and he ’s unable to sleep at night without medicine .
Now Bilal has a new controversial art piece that has caused the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ’s College Republicans to call the college ’s Arts department a “ terrorist safehaven ” for exhibiting it .
In 2003 , a forgettable budget first - person shooter game called “ Quest for Saddam ” was released by a programmer using the Duke Nukem 3D engine .
“ Quest for Saddam ” featured ethnic stereotypes , crude ethnic slurs , and “ humor ” characteristic of those who find Ann Coulter funny .
The developer , Jesse Petrilla went on to found the “ United American Committee , ” which is most famous for hanging Osama bin Laden in effigy outside a mosque in Culver City , California .
This game should have faded into obscurity , except that a group called the “ Global Islamic Media Front ” transformed “ Quest for Saddam ” into “ Quest for Bush ” by replacing all the textures .
Press coverage immediately slammed “ Quest for Bush ” as an Al Qaeda recruiting tool , while generally ignoring the content of the original “ Quest for Saddam . ”
Gameology has more information in a well researched article on both “ Quest for Saddam ” and “ Quest for Bush , ” as well as this line :
“ Creating a game that repeatedly portrays the killing of a specific individual or ideology and then distributing that game in a context that sincerely advocates the killing of that individual or ideology precludes any claims about that game ’s facetiousness . ”
That line should be plastered above the door of every FPS shooter game development company as a litmus test .
Bilal ’s new art installation takes the game and hacks it to create “ The Night of Bush Capturing : A Virtual Jihadi . ”
Through the game , which will be revealed this Wednesday night , March 5th , 2008 at Rensselaer , Bilal casts himself as a suicide - bomber .
Here ’s a description , from RPI ’s Arts Department :
After learning of the real - life death of his brother in the war , he is recruited by Al Qaeda to join the hunt for Bush .
This work is meant to bring attention to the vulnerability of Iraqi civilians to the travesties of the current war and racist generalizations and stereotypes as exhibited in games such as Quest for Saddam ; along with vulnerability to recruitment by violent groups like Al Qaeda because of the U.S. ’s failed strategy in securing Iraq .
The work also aims to shed light on groups that traffic in crass and hateful stereotypes of Arab culture with games like Quest for Saddam and other media .
I ’ll admit that even I was n’t comfortable with the medium and thought that the message might be lost in the controversy over Bilal casting himself as would - be assassin in work of interactive fiction .
Still , I sat down for a phone interview with Wafaa Bilal about the project – and its decidedly controversial nature .
I ’m still not sure if I ’m comfortable with the work , but at least I know more about the thought process that went into it .
You can find that interview below .
Brian Boyko , GAS / NPD : So , last time we talked you were in a room with a paintball gun pointed at you .
What ’s happened since then ?
WAFAA BILAL : Well , what ’s happened since then , I mean , I ’m still under – I ’m going through – after I left the room , it ’s just – it had a huge mental impact on me .
On a daily basis , I ’m suffering from post - traumatic [ disorder ] syndrome – a lack of sleep even seven months later , I ca n’t sleep without taking sleep medication .
GAS / NPD : I ’m sorry to hear that .
Still seven months later ?
BILAL : Yeah , it ’s more than seven – it ’s about nine months – and still impacted with vivid nightmares , so , yeah , haunted on a daily basis .
But the worst is literally lack of sleep … without medication I would not be able to sleep at all .
Yeah , so since then , it ’s been really – I never was really able to recover , and resisting the idea of getting some counseling for it , just because I think that part of the project is the aftermath of it .
Since that ’s what American soldiers are going to go through when they come back .
And I wanted to experience this – I wanted to go through it so I could talk about it to other people , and I very much describe it as , “ We are , in America now , in the eye of the storm .
We do n’t see the storm yet .
And we ’re only going to see it when the soldiers come back . ”
I ’ve been also writing about the project , and there is a book coming out in the fall , called “ Shoot an Iraqi : Life , Art , Resisting , Under the Gun . ”
GAS / NPD : I never had a chance to apologize to you in person – our [ Network Performance Daily ’s ] coverage of that ended up on Digg and that made your life a little bit worse …
BILAL : Oh , Brian , you should n’t apologize .
You – I wanted to thank you for all your writing and feedback because I think that ’s what we need – is to expose these issues , and there ’s no exposure unless we engage , and I think your writing is incredible and brought so much attention to the project – so that ’s one of the objectives here – to engage people .
GAS / NPD : So could you tell me a little bit about the new project you wrote me about ?
BILAL : Well , the new project is called “ The Night of Bush Capture : Virtual Jihadi . ”
And what happens – well , a person named Jesse Petrilla wrote a program called “ Quest for Saddam . ”
( He made one before : “ Quest for Al - Qaeda ” ) So , in 2003 , he released this game .
I ’ve seen the game , and I had played through it , and it enforces stereotypes of Iraqis as very much similar terrorists , and you could hunt them , and they only speak one word .
So , nobody made any big deal of it , but then , the Islamic Media Group , associated with Al Qaeda , took the game , and reskinned it .
They did n’t change any of the code , but they just replaced the skins of the Iraqis , which , by the way , they all look alike , they all say one word , which is absolute nonsense .
So , then after Al Qaeda took the game and switched it around by changing the skins – changing Saddam ’s skin to President Bush ’s skin , the game was labeled “ a terrorist recruiting game . ”
It was a huge deal two years ago , and so now , I wanted to bring attention to the duology of treatment , to hypocrisy and to games that are used as recruitment tools .
That ’s one side .
The other side – I wanted to show the vulnerability of Iraqis becoming involved in Al Qaeda , because there ’s no protection in Iraq , and they switch allegiances according to power switches on the ground .
BILAL : We see this even in our [ American ] inner cities , in gangs , when police do n’t protect the people – the people ally with the gang members in that community .
I wanted to show the effect on the Iraqi people through this game .
I insert my life story as a teacher at the Art Institute of Chicago , and I ’m happy here until I hear the news of the death of my brother and the death of my father , and through the game , Al Qaeda recruits me , and I become a suicide bomber , and attack President Bush .
GAS / NPD : Did your brother actually die , in Iraq ?
BILAL : Yes , that ’s how the idea of the paintball project came to life , because he was killed in my hometown of Kufa by a drone plane .
And I watched the news after a year after his death , and a soldier in Colorado controlling these planes and dropping missiles in Iraq and when they asked her whether she had any remorse over people ’s lives , she said “ no , ” because “ these people are bad people , and I have complete trust in my government . ”
GAS / NPD : What do you think people would be taking away from “ Virtual Jihadi ? ”
BILAL : Well , I think it casts a light on violence in video games , also bringing attention to the Iraq issues – things we see being slowly pushed aside .
And it casts a light on the vulnerability of the Iraqis , suffering on a daily basis .
GAS / NPD : How did you change the game ?
Did you just change the textures ?
BILAL : No .
That ’s part of it .
I did n’t just change the texture , I created a character , animated and scripted , and at the end of the game you could recruit the character of the first shooter , and he would blow himself up next to a Bush character .
It ’s hacking the game .
GAS / NPD : Why did you use “ Quest for Saddam ” instead of “ Battlefield 2 ” which also deals with war in Iraq and is better known ?
BILAL : That ’s a really good question , because this is about a specific game .
And it ’s been switched a few times .
When I learned about [ Quest for Saddam ]
I thought to myself : “ That ’s a silly game . ”
Hunting for Saddam , right ?
But then I want to the Web site of the “ United American Committee ” [ who made the Quest for Saddam game ] – and it ’s very disturbing .
There ’s a link called “ Jihad chat ” – a look at it will show how disturbing these people are .
[ Ed : No link will be provided to the United American Committee site due to the nature of the content . ]
GAS / NPD : But speaking of disturbing – a lot of people would say that – that casting essentially yourself , or a likeness of yourself in a game where your objective is to blow up the President – a lot of people would say that crosses a moral line .
BILAL : I do n’t know if it crosses a moral line , because it ’s still virtual , right ?
So , if games like “ Call of Duty ” or other games are fine , why should this be any different ?
When Jesse [ Petrilla ] made the game to go after Saddam , that ’s also crossing the line , so what ’s the difference ?
GAS / NPD : Well , I think that ’s an important point , but it seems to be like a burning in effigy .
And perhaps , if this was crossing the line to make the “ Quest for Saddam ” game – I have to ask , is this not lowering to their level ?
BILAL : No … I think it ’s a strategy of engagement .
I do n’t see it as crossing the line at all – but rather calling attention to something really disturbing , this game and the Web site , and the rhetoric as well .
GAS / NPD : Video games are a newer medium , but this is n’t the first example of political subjects being addressed in video games .
Do you think we ’ll see more of that as the media matures ?
BILAL : Yeah .
I absolutely agree with you .
We ’re going to see more and more of games as a tool to capitalize on political issues , and as people , and the medium , become more sophisticated , we ’re going to see more and more of this .
GAS / NPD : I remember before the 2004 election , there was this game called “ Bushgame.com ” which also had – at the end , you fought your way through Republicans and eventually beat George W. Bush – but that was two dimensional game play , where you ’re playing these silly characters like a fat He - Man and John Kerry as Voltron , and basically – your game , does n’t to me , ( and I may be wrong , ) sound like parody .
Do you think that there is a line there – that there ’s something to be said there ?
BILAL : I think the way we see it – we ’re leaving a comfort zone , when stereotyping “ the other ” is normal , but when the stereotype goes against our beliefs and our education –
What Islamic Media Group did was simply change the skins – and all of a sudden it becomes “ a recruiting tool . ”
But when Quest for Saddam was released , it was “ fine . ”
I ’m not trying to push buttons so much as call attention to it .
It might look like it ’s a parallel to the other games , but whatever strategy that you take overall to it – it ’s still a peaceful approach …
GAS / NPD : Because it ’s not real .
BILAL : Exactly .
I mean , that ’s the same argument that people use in the games like military games that are out – it ’s not recruitment games , it ’s very harmless , right ?
GAS / NPD : Well , I think the big difference is that when you ’re playing something like Battlefield 2 , you ’re playing a nameless soldier versus a nameless enemy .
Here [ in “ Virtual Jihadi ” ] you ’re playing as a named , real person , against another named , real person – you [ Wafaa Bilal ] versus the President .
Does the humanization make it taboo ?
BILAL : It ’s very possible .
We see that more and more these days .
When you go to Second Life , we play our fantasies , so we cast ourselves as people who live in a virtual world , but there are all indications for real life .
So this is very similar .
More and more virtual work– it is going to be dynamic and sometimes reflect reality , and sometimes placing itself in real - time .
GAS / NPD : Do you think that a lot of this has to do with the idea that video games immerse you in a way that video and text cant ?
BILAL : Oh , totally .
Overall , we are engaged by them because we are enacting fantasies .
We can participate in them – whether the game has an ability to change its direction , such as Second Life , where you can be a participant and change the narrative , and sometimes we involve in a mental interaction when we play an [ FPS ] shooter or other games , so there ’s a level of engagement beyond video and writing because video and writing are passive media .
Games are more active .
You ’re a member of the cast of the narrative .
GAS / NPD : Do you think the development of games as political speech – does that really coincide with the advent of ubiquitous broadband ?
BILAL : Yeah , I mean I ’m very positive that at some point , we ’re going to see more [ political ] games online than we do right now .
This is just the beginning of it , but we will see more political and aggressive games in this direction .
GAS / NPD : I do have to ask you this – you ’ve mentioned a couple of times the idea of games as wish fulfillment or fantasy fulfillment .
And in this game [ Virtual Jihadi ] – you have a character who looks like you , who has your name , who , for all purposes , is you .
And his main goal is to attack the President .
Is that your fantasy ?
BILAL : No , it ’s not .
It ’s a [ communications ] strategy – that ’s it .
You know from my old art project that I ’m a very peaceful person , that I advocate all the time for nonviolent resistance , and I see this as nonviolent resistance as well .
DIGG THIS
We should stop referring to the televised political side - show events as u201 Cdebates , u201D and heed the words of Thomas Pynchon , who said : u201 Cif they can get you asking the wrong questions , they do n’t have to worry about answers .
u201D
According to one of my dictionaries , a u201Cdebateu201D is u201 Ca regulated discussion of a proposition between two matched sides .
u201D Ron Paul is the only candidate offering points of view that would appeal to an intelligent mind .
But where is the u201 Cmatched sideu201D to his arguments ?
Even from those who strongly disagree with him , where is the response that matches the intellectual forcefulness of his analysis ?
Apart from desperately trying to ignore his political presence , where is there any opponent of his views who is able to rise above childish name - calling and engage the good doctor in a genuine debate ?
There is no better illustration of the dismal depths to which social and political thinking in America has sunk than in some of the opening remarks of Chris Matthews and Rudy Giuliani at the recent GOP debate in Michigan .
Early on , Matthews asked Giuliani to comment upon the prospects of New York Yankees ’ manager Joe Torre returning to the team next year !
Giuliani , of course , was more than happy to keep the discussion on such a prosaic level .
I am surprised these two did n’t then spin into a prognosis of Britney Spears ’ legal difficulties , a topic each would have preferred to those Ron Paul was to bring up .
In one of his blogs , James Ostrowski made an excellent point in saying that the mainstream media ( MSM ) u201 Cignored Ron ’s brilliant analysis because they are too shallow to understand what he said .
u201D
This is undoubtedly true for many , reflecting , perhaps , the emptiness of training in critical thought to be found in majoring in journalism .
But this provides only a partial explanation .
One must also consider the role the MSM has long been employed to play , namely , keeping Boobus Americanus entertained with the reporting of events whose import lays no burden upon the mind ; to make certain — particularly in turbulent times such as these — that fundamental questions as to the form and content of political practices are not asked .
Members of the media — responding to the demands of their employers — might , if the facts become sufficiently compelling to no longer be ignored , be willing to consider that the emperor has no clothes .
None , however , would be brazen enough to join Ron Paul in suggesting that the empire , itself , might be naked !
A major role of the MSM is to reinforce , for adults , the conditioning that is the purpose of government schools regarding children .
The truth of Ivan Illich ’s observation that u201Cschool is the advertising agency which makes you believe that you need the society as it is , u201D is confirmed by the Los Angeles County government .
Children must be taught , the County asserts , u201 Cthat we are all part of one big social system , u201D and u201 Cmust learn how to participate effectively in the system .u201D
The end to be generated is , in the words of H.L. Mencken :
To manufacture an endless corps of sound Americans .
A sound American is simply one who has put out of his mind all doubts and questionings , and who accepts instantly , and as incontrovertible gospel , the whole body of official doctrine of his day , whatever it may be and no matter how often it may change .
Any modification or redirection of that system will , of course , be made by its corporate owners , not by underlings who have the arrogance to believe that their will has any purpose to play in the grand design .
Any doctrinal or policy changes will be announced through the system ’s propagandizing agency , the MSM .
Like Pavlovian dogs who await the ringing of a bell to excite their slobbering , Boobus sits in eager anticipation of the new bromides he is to incorporate into his modified world - view .
I do n’t recall who it was who defined television as u201 Cempty space held together by commercials , u201D but no better characterization has been offered .
If this medium is to be the central source of public marching orders , how does the system assure that people will remain in rapt attention ?
The corporate world has its products to sell , while the state has its mindset to peddle , ends that conflate to a common purpose .
Under the guise of dispensing u201 Cnews , u201D television networks provide strings of superficially exciting , but meaningless , reports : freeway car - chases , problems confronting various celebrities , raging fires , the public bathroom behavior of politicians , or other u201 Ceventsu201D that are more within the journalistic standards of the National Inquirer !
The segue from our school indoctrinations to those carried out in our adult lives are easy to spot , if one only pays attention to the details .
The high - school cheerleaders who call upon the student body to u201 Csupport the team !
u201D as they go off to play Central High , are morphed into the Ann Coulters and Laura Ingrahams leaping to their television perches to urge u201 Csupport the troops !
u201D as they go off to Iraq .
It is all the same game , played for the same purposes , with only the uniforms and next week ’s opponent subject to change .
This is the Sisyphean struggle Ron Paul and his supporters are up against in trying to be heard within a system whose function is to propagandize the statist mindset .
Many of the self - styled u201Cjournalistsu201D who content themselves with playing what , in my college broadcasting days , we referred to as the u201 Crip - and - readu201D role , are too shallow to deal with ideas at any meaningful level .
But others do have intelligent minds , and could — were they of a disposition to risk losing their jobs — engage the debate Paul requests .
Ron ’s situation is not unlike that of the high - school student , Tammy , in the 1999 movie Election .
It is time for school elections to be held and Tammy , a noticeable outsider at this school , decides to run for the meaningless job of school president .
At a school assembly , each candidate encourages students to vote for them for all the vacuous reasons that have become synonymous with modern politics .
Tammy , on the other hand , tells the students : u201CThe only promise that I will make is that if I ’m elected I will immediately disband the student government so that nobody will ever have to sit through one of these stupid assemblies again !
u201D Virtually the entire student body emits a loud cheer on her behalf .
When the assembly is over , the school administrators retire to the principal ’s office and decide that Tammy ’s name must be removed from the ballot ; that her views are too disruptive .
Ron Paul , like Tammy , is too disturbing of the interests of the established order .
He must be placed at the end of the line of candidates — if , indeed , he is allowed to appear at all — and asked only the sorts of questions designed to make him look foolish .
That audiences love his message is as irrelevant to the system ’s owners as the students ’ responses to Tammy ’s platform were to the government school hierarchy .
The u201 Cdebateu201D must not be allowed to get out of hand by allowing members of the public to think that their preferences matter .
The questions must be u201 Creframedu201D to address such u201 Cpracticalu201D and u201 Cmainstreamu201D concerns as u201 Cwho will manage the Yankees next year ?

The iPhone was launched last summer
One million iPhones , or 27 % of those sold last year , have been adapted to work on other networks , said Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi .
Apple recently admitted that the number of unlocked iPhones was " significant " .
The iPhone , which was launched last summer , is tied to a single phone network in each country it is on sale .
While AT&T is Apple 's chosen partner in the US , in the UK the iPhone is only officially available through O2 , while in Germany it is tied to T - Mobile .
' Lost revenue '
Mr Sacconaghi said the high number of unlocked iPhones in the US would be a concern for Apple , as it receives a percentage of AT&T 's contract fees from iPhone users .
He estimates that if Apple sells 10 million iPhones in the US by the end of 2008 , but 30 % of them have been unlocked to work with other phone networks , Apple will lose $ 500 m ( £ 251 m ) in revenues .
Apple and AT&T have declined to comment on the detail of the report .
Last month Vodafone failed in the German courts to get T - Mobile 's exclusivity deal over the iPhone overturned .

It 's not necessarily a matter of " privatizing " the function of creating a good statewide database , it 's just a matter of getting it right .
In California the statewide voter registration database is the responsibility of the Secretary of State and for the first few months of 2006 their database was incorrectly rejecting up to 25 percent of submitted registrations which included spaces between the letters in a name , such as De Leon , or a two - word last name that was n't hyphenated .
It has long been known this would be a problem regardless of whether database is created and maintained by a government or private entity , as discussed in this October 2006 article , " Voter registration lists may foil voters . "

By the way , California 's Statewide Voter Registration Database was created in 2006 by the office of the Secretary of State during the Bruce McPherson administration .
At the time , Deborah Bowen was chair of the Senate Elections , Reapportionment & Constitutional Amendments Committee .
She wrote this letter to McPherson , asking " Now that you ’re aware that registration forms from tens of thousands of eligible voters have been rejected pursuant to the McPherson - USDOJ Agreement , what are you doing to re-evaluate and revise your data matching system ? "

In the California situation , I 'd like to know the source of the problematic poll books ' registered voters ' lists .
Do the precincts work from printouts or computer terminals ?
Are the lists printed and distributed , or do they access the latest version of the registration database online or what ?
Taking this apart piece by piece should be instructive .
The voters were confused , but somebody must understand clearly how the errors occurred .
I can't believe it will be that hard to figure out .
However , I think the odds are evenly divided as to whether it will be called a glitch , hiccup , pollworker error , or honest mistake .
And , as Desi said to Luci , somebody 's gonna have some ' splainin ' to do .

Brad , since you are apparently one of the only sources for news about election problems , how might the eventual outcome of the LA County debacle affect CA 's final results outcome ?
And ... I guess I need to follow up on exactly what happened to the voters in my county who claimed their registrations had been mixed up on the voter roster , and so chose to vote provisionally rather than on a ballot not for the party they thought they were registered with .
As a matter of fact , if other citizens throughout CA read this , you might be interested to follow up on this very issue yourselves wherever it is you live .
Since this is a very close primary election for the candidates , something like this could definitely sway the outcome for one candidate over another .

HAVA was n't just about paperless voting , it was also to disenfranchise on every level possible .
Ought people be checking in with their county offices about now to see how the system has them registered ?
If wrong , see that it 's corrected , if right , get some kind of documentation that as of that date , they were registered as _____ ?
Maybe if election officials see people forced to pursue avenues that cause them even more work , they wo n't be so inclined to jump to corporate " technology . "
Documentation -
That would have to be something binding , maybe a copy of the registration signed by the county authority , with a seal ; notarized .... is there some way to create a paper trail on registration ahead of time to subvert the outsourcing of registration rolls to corporations ?
On that thought , in the states I 've lived in , I 've been given a card that shows my district , where to vote , and my party ID .
What 's happening at the polls when / if this is presented and people are told it is not correct - even though it was generated by the " system " ?
In other words , now that the problem appears to be widespread , how to PROACTIVELY fight it ?
Ideas , anyone ?
I 'm not a fan of making more work for some good people in elections , and there certainly are many , but when massive flaws in the " system " sold to them crop up , I do n't see much of a way out of it .

Regarding the ongoing complaints about " privatizing " the election process ( as mentioned above ) you MUST understand this :
There is not a county in the country that has the resources to build their own voter registration system or voting system .
In fact , they also can't build their own database software , accounting systems , email systems , documents filing systems , welfare systems , or any other systems .
With very few exceptions , ALL government I.T. infrastructure is " outsourced " and has been for a decade or two , at least .
Election systems are no exception .
So demonizing " private " systems as if there were an alternative is a futile waste of time .
The critical thing is oversight .
System building is outsourced , but must be managed and monitored by dedicated and reliable government employees who know the requirements and the laws and will enforce them .
There 's where the problem lies and where efforts to correct the problem will pay off .
Voter registration and voting systems will always rely , to some extent , on custom or off - the - shelf software and hardware supplied by private companies .
The critical factor in making them reliable and accurate is the government officials who use them .
I would suggest that most or all of the problems observed during this current election cycle are the fault of lazy , incompetent or negligent election officals , not the tools they purchased to do the job .
The best construction tools in the world become weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a negligent carpenter .
Hold your election officials accountable .

Jack Nauti # 16 , Brad # 20 While Jack is correct for most counties , Los Angeles County , the largest elections jurisdiction in the US , built their own voting system .
It 's called the " Micro Tally System " ( MTS ) .
It 's ancient .
It 's early ' 80s technology originally designed to count punchcard ballots but modified to read the " Ink A Vote " ballot .
It was not part of Deborah Bowen 's original Top to Bottom Review but was finally examined and given " conditional certification " in time for this election .
The part of the system the public sees is the Ink A Vote ballot .
Those ballots are marked , then taken to Registrar HQ where it is scanned and tabulated on the MTS system .
The most press was given to the squabble between Bowen and ES&S , but that was only concerning ES&S 's AutoMark voting system which LA county , and others , use for the disabled .
Less than one percent of LA county 's vote is done on the AutoMark .
The real tabulation is done on the ancient Micro Tally System .

Confabulator # 23 - You 're wrong .
LA County uses the audio portion of ES&S InkaVote system for the disabled .
At my precinct , the machine was n't working , as wires were hanging out of it and both the poll workers and an election inspector from the county were scared to touch it for fear of being electrocuted .
Had meant to cover that ( and still hopefully will , with pictures ) , but have had to prioritize it down given all the other more notable disasters .
Of course , it did n't much matter because at the time I showed up , no voter had so far asked to use it .
Other than me .
It should also be noted that " the squabble between Bowen and ES&S " as you called it , was because ES&S refused to turn the source code over to Bowen , as required by law .
" It was not part of Deborah Bowen 's original Top to Bottom Review " because ES&S refused to cooperate .
Once they did , it became clear that their system was as simple to hack as any other .
And yes , Conny McCormack had previously been using the machines to tally votes and give those results to the media , though she did n't tell her voters that .

Confabulator # 29 - I understand perfectly well how the ballots are counted in LA County .
Yes , they are tallied by the MTS system at the county headquarters in Norwalk .
Until she was previously busted , however , McCormack HAD in fact been tallying them for her " snap tallies " at the precinct , using the ES&S InkaVote scanner .
She used those tallies when reporting to the media , after repeatedly denying that the machines were actually tallying votes at the precinct .
They were .
I suspect , that she got caught and has cut and run from her job , that they are no longer tallying at the precinct , only checking for overvotes .
The Diebold GEMS 2.0 she had previously likely been using as well , is also off the table for use since Bowen required that it actually be certified instead of just used as Conny wanted with no body ever checking to see if it worked .
LA County is very lucky she is gone , though Diebold will have to change their sales brochures to remove her picture I guess .
Unfortunately , we 've received King County WA 's equally dubious registrar in her place for the moment .
And just so you understand I do n't give a damn about the partisanship involved here , the LA County 's Democratic Board of Supervisors should be ashamed of themselves for hiring Conny in the first place , and allowing her to hire Dean Logan in the second place .

If you do not want California 's Statewide Database on Voter Registration to be privatized , you better talk to Secretary of State Debra Bowen real quick because she has issued a Request for Proposals ( RFP ) for the project .
Her website says , " The Secretary of State established the VoteCal Registration Database Project to develop and implement this federally mandated statewide voter registration list .

=======================================
Subject : Calif .
Statewide Database of Voter Registration should not be privatized Dear Sec. Bowen , I have been pleased with the actions you have taken to protect the integrity of elections
and take a meaningful stand against " black box " voting .
Equally important is that the creation and maintenance of any centralized voter registration database be handled in a publicly auditable manner .
I read recently that you have issued an Request For Proposals to looking for private vendors to create a statewide voter registration database .
I was reading a discussion online about this and came across a very good suggestion : that this type of project be done by a public university with the money going to fund their computer science / public policy / whatever programs .
This would be an excellent way to
1. maintain the integrity and confidence in public elections ;
2. get advanced , expert work product in a transparent environment ;
3. get the project executed with the product quality as the primary motivating factor , not
maximization of profit ;
4. direct public money back into the public sector where it benefits many more people
directly , and countless more people indirectly , than if it were directed to the private
sector , where it would only enrich investors ;
5. get off the privatization bandwagon that is currently hollowing out our public services
infrastructure and bleeding our tax dollars away ; and
6. transparency
7. transparency
8. transparency
It would be nice if you were to take the initiative and contact the universities
pro-actively and give them preferential consideration for this project .
Sincerely ,
Me =================================

I have poop on the brain today .
Someone gave my 6 - month old son Jack a copy of Everyone Poops even though we 're nowhere near that stage yet .
Still , it 's a fascinating book , and got me thinking about how little I know about poop .
While the following facts are n't found in Gomi 's book , they 're still pretty nifty .
1 . Bird poop is white because birds can't pee .
Their kidneys work like ours do , but instead of producing urine , birds excrete a white paste .
The paste , along with what comes out of the intestines , unites and is excreted through the bird 's cloaca , a multi- purpose hole which means sewer in Latin .
And , yes , by multi-purpose , I mean they even mate through it .
2 . Many dogs eat poop .
This I know because , sadly , my dog used to eat his own poop on occasion .
What I did n't know was that eating poop has a name : coprophagy , and is , of course , more popular with dung beetles than dogs .
If your dog eats his / her own feces , one way to discourage the behavior ( other than immediately cleaning up after your dog ) is to douse the poop with hot sauce or vinegar .
3 . The reason why some poops float is because they have a lot of gas in them .
Rather than coming out as flatulence , the gas gets stuck in the poop and forces it to the surface of the water .
If there 's a lot of fat in your diet , likewise your poop might float .
4. Cavemen were better equipped to chew and digest many plants and vegetables .
They had larger molars and longer digestive tracts better at handling foods rich in indigestible cellulose , like , er , corn , for instance .
Evolution has worked against our ability to chew and digest corn , which is why when some kernels get swallowed whole they appear in poop .
Groups of angry ethnic Serbs set fire to offices at the Jarinje and Banja border crossing stations between Kosovo and Serbia , forcing NATO troops to intervene for the first time since Kosovo declared independence on Sunday , February 17 .
Kosovo police manning the post called for help from the NATO
peacekeeping force , KFOR , which said it was stepping in .
KFOR forces in the district include French , Danish , Belgian and American units .
There were no reported casualties , and a spokesperson for the 17,000 - strong , NATO - led Kosovo peacekeeping forces KFOR told the AFP news agency that the incidents were " regrettable . "
In the nearby town of Mitrovica , around a thousand ethnic Serbs demonstrated against independence for Kosovo , which is overwhelmingly Albanian .
The protestors chanted " Kosovo is Serbia " and marched to a bridge spanning the river that divides Mitrovica 's Serbian and Albanian districts .
Along the way , they attacked a NATO vehicle with sticks and stones .
Kosovo has been under United Nations administration since 1999 , when NATO drove Serbian forces out of the territory .
Solana swing - by
The EU hopes it can help preserve stability in Kosovo
Amidst the unrest , the European Union 's foreign policy chief Javier Solana paid a brief visit to Kosovo for discussions with Kosovar President Fatmir Sedjiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci .
" We are good friends of Kosovo , and Kosovo is good friends with the European Union , " said Solana in a brief statement to reporters .
An independent Kosovo would be a potential candidate for accession to the EU -- a very distant prospect , to which Solana also alluded .
" The European perspective of all of the countries of the region is open , " Solana said .
" The joy that has been shown on the streets of Pristina and all over Kosovo has now to be converted into constructive and positive energy , to move towards the development of society . "
The EU is preparing a 2000 - strong contingent to take over the UN 's duties in Kosovo .
Serbia has fiercely rejected the idea of Kosovo becoming a full - fledged nation .
Independence splits world opinion
Angry Serbs destroy and burn UN vehicles
Most Western nations support Kosovo 's independence .
The United States , Britain and France have all recognized Kosovo as a nation , and most other EU nations , including Germany , are set to follow suit .
But some EU member states with minority separatist movements , most prominently Spain , have rejected the declaration from the Kosovan capital Pristina .
And China and especially Russia oppose the creation of an independent Kosovo .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he had talked to his American counterpart Condoleezza Rice by phone about Kosovo on Monday , February 18 .
" On our side , we confirmed our principled position on the unacceptability of one - sided acts of Pristina declaring its independence , " Lavrov wrote in a brief official statement .
" We underlined the dangerous consequences of such a step , fraught as it is with the destruction of the principles of peace and order and international stability , which have been developed over decades . "
Most of them only happen to an infinitesimally small group of people , but they can still happen .
Behold , six side effects that would suck for anyone unlucky enough to experience them , while being indisputably awesome for any onlooker with a video camera and a YouTube account .
We 're going to take a stand here :
We 're in favor of medicine .
Modern medicine ranks with internet porn and the George Foreman grill as one of the greatest achievements of mankind .
But there are drawbacks in the form of side effects , some of which are far more off - putting than the inability to operate heavy machinery .
Alli
Alli is a weight - loss medication that prevents fat absorption .
When you eat fat , the medication stops you from digesting it and helps it pass right along through .

Side effects may include ...
According to their website , Alli calls these " treatment effects . "
Which implies that these effects can happen to pretty much everybody under the right circumstances .
It 's nothing major , mind you , just things like " gas with oily spotting . "
This would be a polite way of describing a fart that spackles your chair with a greasy stain of ass buckshot .
In some cultures that 's a great compliment for the host .
Of course , that 's not all .
Prominently displayed on their list of treatment effects are also " loose stools " and " more frequent stools that may be hard to control . "
Again , this should not be that alarming as these events are quite humorous when portrayed in the realm of slapstick comedy .

Alli , purveyors of hilarity that they are , go on to describe in gut busting detail just what to expect from your twitching , out - of - control rectum , including this gem : " You may recognize it as something that looks like the oil on top of a pizza . "
Recognize what ?
The slurry that leaked out of your ass and into your khakis , that 's what .
Should you worry ?
Their site makes it sound like anyone who eats too much fat in one sitting can wind up with leakage .
It makes sense ; you 're not absorbing the grease from the fries you ate , the grease has to go somewhere .
The Alli people , ever the optimists , imply this is all part of the plan :

" In fact , anecdotally , many users have told us that treatment effects served as a signal that helped them adopt healthier eating patterns . "
As in , people start limiting their fat intake out of fear of uncontrollable pooping in the middle of , say , giving a eulogy at a loved one 's funeral .
TEACHERS NEED to pick their battles .
I scanned my fourth - grade students in the Bronx and considered several battles in my mind .
Battle Number One : Manolo arrived in my classroom determined to fight the world .
His mother had died when he was in second grade and he had to repeat the year .
However , Manolo took substantial steps when he began to write creative stories , favoring historical fiction in which he inserted himself into a famous event .
His writing revealed great imagination and interest , but his spelling and mechanics remained poor , and state exams continued to label him a failure .
Battle Number
Two : Sara entered my classroom leaps ahead of her peers .
She wrote hilarious , irreverent poetry and had already mastered grade - level math .
She fired off endless questions about current events .
Sara was a dream student , hungry to be challenged .
However , the administrators at my school discouraged creative lesson planning in order to cram in endless " drill - and - kill " packets of basic skills test - taking strategies .
Battle Number
Three : Eddie was in his fourth year in fourth grade because of absences and test failures .
It seemed impossible to get him engaged in class .
However , he loved to draw and showed a remarkable , natural talent for perspective sketching .
Tragically , my class was deprived of all arts in order to allot more time for standardized test preparation .
How could I help these children face their challenges ?
Every moment , I felt pulled in 26 directions , invariably drawn to the louder children who act out .
And then there was the ever - looming Test .
Everyone involved in education policy claims to be on the side of students , yet I quickly learned that the needs of my students fell quite low on the school 's priority list .
Nearly six years into the No Child Left Behind era , American public schools have more money than ever , but students are still widely denied the most crucial tools for their success : individual attention and specialized support .
In a more rational , equitable system , Manolo would have access to small - group tutoring , Sara could flourish in a challenging , high - level classroom environment , and Eddie could explore his artistic inspiration in school .
They would meet with guidance counselors ( my school had a ratio of 550 students per counselor ) and mentors .
Knowing their school supported their individual needs would further engage these children .
However , the resources that my students badly needed were being spent elsewhere ; the money was going into high - stakes testing .
We have entered a dangerous era in which the fad for education policy is to import statistics - driven paradigms from the business sphere .
These mechanistic models are an ill fit in education , a wholly human institution .
Testing may provide easy - to - crunch metrics , but it creates a negative , all - consuming test culture , and does not paint a comprehensive picture of students ' abilities .
Under No Child Left Behind , schools , particularly in high - poverty areas , are under intense pressure to meet quotas on one - size - fits - all standardized tests .
Prepping for the test and getting a well - rounded education are not the same thing , but there is not room in the school day for both tasks .
The suffocating squeeze that my students and I felt was not a case of a few rogue administrators misunderstanding the law , as Assistant Secretary of Education Doug Mesecar has said .
A recent report by the Center of Education Policy discovered that 44 percent of schools have reduced instructional time in untested subjects ( social studies , science , art and music , physical education , lunch , and / or recess ) .
It 's not just the government trumpeting high - stakes testing as the way to get " accountability " from schools .
The media have largely gone along for the ride as well , trumpeting minute shifts in test score graphs as headline - worthy successes or failures .
We have taken our eye off the ball on what is most important in schools - students ' needs .
Senator Edward Kennedy , chairman of the Senate committee overseeing the creation of a new No Child Left Behind bill , has an opportunity to recommend changes to the sweeping law .
Manolo , Sara , Eddie , and every other child , parent , and teacher in America are counting on him .

The process of converting your HD DVDs to Blu-ray is time - consuming , potentially costly and sucks balls .
Really , there 's almost no reason to , since you can bet most everything on HD DVD will be released on Blu , and if you have a million HD DVDs you do n't wanna rebuy , you should just buy a dual format player .
But if you revel in pain , here 's how to do it , thanks to the crazy video guys at Doom9 .

First , get an HD DVD ripper — DVD Fab HD Decrypter is free — and rip them .
Now it gets messy .
EVOdemux will " demultiplex " the files , after which you need H264I nfo or vc1conv ( v0.2 ) , depending on which one you ripped in .
Then use eac3to to cram the audio enough to fit on a 25 GB Blu-ray disc .
TsRemux or tsMuxeR will get your video ready to burn .
You can burn it onto Blu-ray discs with either IMGBurn 2.4 ( free ) or Nero 8 ( $ 100 , plz ) , but you obviously need a BR burner , which is a few hundred bucks , at least .
Finally , punch yourself in the face .

The other day I came across the blog post Finally : A Porn Site for ADHD Sufferers .
It ’s about a new porn site that has 2 porn videos going at the same time .
I know the post title was meant to be humorous but I really do n’t think adults with ADD are having any trouble focusing on regular porn sites .
In fact they tend to hyperfocus on them .
I admit I was a bit curious and took a look at the site .
After waiting about 30 seconds neither of the videos loaded .
I have feeling that adults with ADD who might really be interested in looking at this type of site will probably wait about 15 seconds and leave .
So I do n’t think this site is too ADD Friendly .
You may have missed it - almost everyone missed it - but Bill Clinton was on Rush Limbaugh 's show the day of the Texas primary .
You can hear the radio here .
Limbaugh himself was sick that day , apparently , but he had already urged Republicans to cross over to keep Hillary Clinton in the race .
Bill saw an opening - and went there .
Now just wrap your mind around this : the Clintons were happy to support a cynical , partisan Republican campaign to wound the Democratic front - runner , and they were brazen enough to go on the Limbaugh show to do so .
There also seems little doubt that Republican mischief played a real role in affecting the results .
And they call Obama 's call for them to release their tax returns a tactic worthy of Ken Starr .
I repeat : the chutzpah and the cynicism just leave you speechless .
And as you find it impossible to do much but splutter , the Clintons plow on with new self - serving lies .
You know how I realized this ?
I saw first hand the way they dealt with gay issues in their first term .
They did n't just wimp out on our push for marriage equality , they actively pivoted off homophobia to get a few points ( ask Dick Morris ; it 's one of the things he 's actually ashamed of in retrospect ) .
The Clintons even put anti-gay ads on Christianist radio stations in the South to build support for the 1996 re-election .
And they continue to show up at gay events claiming to be avatars for our civil rights .
And the stupid gays still believe them !

You could see the signs as you came down the hill toward the entrance to the Metro - North Station : “ Honk to Impeach . ”
“ Text IMPEACH to 30644 . ”
The George W. Bush presidency may end in a year , but that is n’t soon enough for the 25 or so protesters who gathered on the median of Galleria Drive this afternoon .
They say they want to see Bush — and vice - president Dick Cheney — impeached for lying about the Iraq War and violating the U.S. Constitution .
There were long - time protesters : “ I started before the war ; it ’s time the American people stand up , ”  Middletown ’s Stiles Najac said .
There were the converts : “ I voted for Bush twice , and I ’m a registered Republican .
I did n’t realize the Iraq war was based on a lie , ”  said Goshen ’s Tamara Grapek .
There were the inspired : “ He ( Bush ) made me into an activist and a writer , ”  said Goshen ’s Tom Degan , who blogs his displeasure of the current administration .
Local civil rights lawyer Michael Sussman marched back and forth with a large American flag in one hand and an “ IMPEACH ”  sign in the other .
The protestors blasted their message through a megaphone .
They handed out pamphlets to cars stopped at the traffic light .
And they implored drivers to honk their approval .
They got plenty of those ; some drivers even waved fists too .
Others went the other way —
“ Go home ! ”  one driver shouted .
MUMBAI , Feb 10 ( Reuters ) - Services on two of three broken undersea cables providing Internet services to parts of the Middle East and Asia have been restored after both cables were repaired , an Indian - owned cable operator said on Sunday .
FLAG Telecom , a subsidiary of India 's No. 2 mobile operator Reliance Communications RLCM .
BO , said in a statement the breaks in its FLAG Europe - Asia ( FEA ) and FALCON cables had been repaired and services routed back through these cables .
Web access in south Asia and parts of the Middle East was disrupted after breaks occurred in segments of two cables off Egypt ’s northern coast nearly two weeks ago , forcing service providers to re-route traffic .
This was followed by a breach in the FALCON cable between Dubai and Oman .
“ The customer circuits have been normalized on FEA and Falcon that were earlier restored on alternate routes due to cable cut last week , ” the FLAG statement said .
Repair work on SEA - ME - WE 4 , the second cable cut near Egypt , was also expected to be completed by Sunday .
A spokesman for Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd VSNL .
BOVSL.N , which co-owns SEA - ME - WE 4 , said there were no updates as yet .
VSNL has said it restored a majority of its Internet connectivity to the Middle East and South Asia within 24 hours of the breach , using other cables .
The International Cable Protection Committee , an association of 86 submarine cable operators , says more than 95 percent of transoceanic telecoms and data traffic are carried by submarine cables , and the rest by satellite .
One of the biggest disruptions of modern telecoms systems was in December 2006 , when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake broke nine submarine cables between Taiwan and the Philippines , cutting connections between southeast Asia and the rest of the world .
Internet links were thrown out in China , Hong Kong , Singapore , Taiwan , Japan and the Philippines .
Traffic was rerouted through other cables , but it took 49 days to restore full capacity .

“ All is race , ” wrote Benjamin Disraeli , “ there is no other truth . ”
What Disraeli meant by race is what Winston Churchill meant when he spoke of “ our island race ” — a tribe , an ethnic group , a people unique and separate from all others .
Disraeli saw the Irish in Britain as a breed apart , an alien race :
“ This wild , reckless , indolent , uncertain and superstitious race have no sympathy with the English character .
Their ideal of human felicity is an alternation of clannish broils and coarse idolatry ( i.e. , Catholicism ) .
Their history describes an unbroken circuitry of bigotry and blood . ”
And whose bigotry was on display here ?
Recently , this writer cited a Foreign Affairs article titled , “ Us and Them : The Enduring Power of Ethnic Nationalism . ”
Professor Jerry Muller therein described what happened to Europe in the 20th century as the violent and bloody parturition of all the multi-ethnic nations and empires into homogeneous states where each “ race ” at last had its own country to secure its own separate and privileged existence and tribal interests .
Only then did peace come to the Old Continent .
The process may not be at an end .
Serbs in Bosnia and Kosovo wish to be with their kinsmen .
Scots want out of Britain .
Catalan and Basque seek independence from Spain .
Flemish and Walloon are suing for divorce in Belgium .
This tribalism is now bedeviling America and the presidential politics of this diverse nation , and roiling its most diverse party .
The dominant minorities in the Democratic coalition are blacks , Hispanics and Jews .
Though Obama began this campaign with under half of the black vote , African - Americans are now voting close to 90 percent for him .
Dixiecrats called that the bloc vote .
Ex -Goldwater Girl Hillary is now getting Goldwater ’s share of that vote .
African - Americans are rejecting the wife of our “ first black president ” — for the real thing .
And though Latinos are similar in educational levels , incomes and political orientation to blacks , they seem as resistant to Barack ’s candidacy as white working men .
And where race and ethnic wedge - driving was thought to be the province of the Lee Atwater School of Republican Politics , liberals have shown themselves more than adept .
“ I like the fact that his name is Barack Hussein Obama , and that his father was a Muslim , ” said ex-Sen .
Bob Kerrey , a Hillary backer , in Iowa .
“ I think it is a tremendous asset for him … that he spent a little bit of time in a secular madrassa . ”
The day of South Carolina , Bill Clinton volunteered , “ Jesse Jackson won South Carolina in ’ 84 and ’ 88 . … Ran a good campaign . ”
And what do Jesse and Barack have in common ?
Portside columnist Richard Cohen was first to raise the issue of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Barack ’s spiritual mentor , whose magazine last year declared that Louis Farrakhan “ epitomized greatness . ”
Minister Farrakhan , Cohen reminded his readers , “ has reviled Jews in a manner that brings Hitler to mind . ”
Cohen ’s call for Obama to renounce Farrakhan was echoed by Hillary in the last debate , and she further demanded that Barack “ reject ” him .
A beleaguered Barack dutifully did .
This was the old one - two to the midsection .
Publicizing the Wright - Farrakhan ties alarmed Jewish voters backing Barack , while African - Americans , many of whom admire Farrakhan as a defiant black man , saw Barack as dissing a brother on the orders of the white liberal establishment .
Last weekend , The New York Times gave page - one coverage to the Farrakhan - Wright matter and Jewish concerns about Obama ’s ties to Zbigniew Brzezinski , who , said the Times helpfully , is “ loathed by many Jews . ”
The Times also regurgitated Barack ’s statement of last fall that “ no one has suffered more than the Palestinians . ”
On March 5 , the New York Post ran a page - one story with the banner , “ Shady , ” and subhead , “ Black Ops : Hill Ad ‘ Darkens ’ Obama . ”
The story was based on a left - wing Website ’s claim that Clinton ’s campaign is “ darkening the tone of Barack Obama ’s skin in a new TV attack ad . ”
Post columnist Amir Taheri drove the wedge deeper between Barack and Jews .
Saying Barack should be proud of his middle name , “ Hussein , ” Taheri then accused him of cutting Israel loose .
“ In an important symbolic move designed to signal an end of the special relationship between Israel and America , Obama has become the first major presidential candidate in 25 years not to commit himself to transferring the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . ”
Barack , said Taheri , is meeting the key demands of “ all radical Islamist forces , Sunni and Shiite . ”
Usually Democrats play the ethnic card against Republicans .
Al Gore said Bush revered a Constitution that declared blacks to be three - fifths of a person .
The NAACP said Bush did not care about the dragging death of African - American James Byrd .
This time , the liberals are playing the race card on each other , and showing real proficiency .
The Facts ...
The GIF graphics file format was invented by Steve Wilhite at CompuServe in 1987 .
In the years since , a debate has been raging as to the correct way to pronounce " GIF " : like " jif " as in the peanut butter , or with a hard ' g ' as in " gift " as a majority of Mac users seem to prefer .
With this page I intend to clear this up once and for all ...
It 's pronounced like " jif " .
Period .
The end .
That 's final .
End of story .
You disagree ?
Hey , I 'm just quoting the inventors of the format .
Here 's the evidence : CompuServe used to distribute a graphics display program called CompuShow .
In the documentation for version 8.33 in the FAQ section , it states : The GIF ( Graphics Interchange Format ) , pronounced " JIF " , was designed by CompuServe and the official specification released in June of 1987 .
There , straight from the inventors of the format .

.
In the documentation for version 8.33 in the FAQ section , it states :
The image below is an example GIF that came with CompuShow :
It is a picture of CompuShow 's author , Bob Berry .
He used some of the then - new features of the GIF89 format to display text on top of graphics .
One of the lines he entered in the text states :
Oh , incidentally , it 's pronounced " JIF " You can't see this text within a web browser , but if you save this image and load it up in GIF Construction Set or another animated GIF89 editor , you can see the comment for yourself .
Drag and View also displays this text , but kind of screwed up .

: The Graphics File Formats FAQ states the following : Choosy programmers choose " gif " or " jif " ?
The pronunciation of " GIF " is specified in the GIF specification to be " jif " , as in " jiffy " , rather then " gif " , which most people seem to prefer .
This does seem strange because the " G " is from the word " Graphics " and not " Jraphics " .
That last statement does n't mean anything .
It 's an acronym .
There 's no defined way to pronounce acronyms -- it 's up to the creators .

A graphics format known as PNG is being pushed by its creators as the next big thing .
Among its list of features is its " unambiguous pronunciation " .
Here 's part of its documentation : Pronunciation
No detail was too small for consideration in the authors ' quest for a near - perfect image format ; yea , verily , even the acronym and pronunciation were major topics of discussion .
The reason , of course , is the GIF format ; some pronounce it with a soft G like giraffe , some with a hard G like gift , and no one really knows what they 're talking about .
( For the record , the soft G is correct ; it is how the author of the format pronounces it . )
" PNG " is always spelled " PNG " ( or " Portable Network Graphics " ) and always pronounced " ping , " not " pinj " or " pee en gee " or any other multi-syllabic disaster .
See the introduction to the PNG specification for the definitive statement on the matter .

NetBITS , a weekly ePublication that provided practical Internet information , asked its readers in Issue 002 to supply information that could solve the GIF pronunciation debate .
They followed up in Issue 003 with this :
It 's " Jiff " and I Don't Want to Hear Another Word -- Logic may dictate the " g " in GIF ( Graphic Interchange Format ) is pronounced hard , like gift or gefilte fish , but that did n't stop dozens and dozens of readers from offering opinions , many of them hilarious .
However , several people wrote to say that they either worked with folks at CompuServe or read the original GIF specification , all of which specified a soft " g " .
None of us at NetBITS understand why we have n't seen the definitive word before , so here it is .
Charlie Reading < charlier@kreber.com > writes : I worked with the creator of GIF ( Steve Wilhite ) when I was still employed by CompuServe .
Steve always pronounced it " jiff " and would correct those who pronounced it with a hard G. " Choosy developers choose GIF " ( spinning off of a historically popular peanut butter commercial ) .
If you want to make a difference in this pronunciation conundrum , print this piece of NetBITS out and send it to the person who writes your local newspaper 's technology or Internet column .
We now have the specification 's authoritative pronunciation .
Let 's stamp out the hard " g , " however logical , once and for all .

Phillip Burgess writes :
Ahhh , good , someone with their head screwed on right .
Anyone who pronounces " GIF " with a hard G simply does not understand computer programmers ( and any programmers who still insist on this silly pronunciation are simply unfit ) .
No * decent * coder would pass up an opportunity to inflict a horrid pun on the world .
And seeing as peanut butter is one of the principle three programmer foods ( the other two being Pepsi and nacho cheese Doritos ) , the reference is immediately obvious .
The " acronym theory , " that a hard G should be used because it 's " Graphics " and not " Jraphics , " simply does not hold water .
If acronyms were always to be pronounced from their source words rather than as an independent new word , then by this very arrangement , " JPEG " would be pronounced " JFEG .
"
Just to give these people a taste of their own medicine ...
I 've started pronouncing " JPEG " with a hard G. Brenda Harrison writes :

Thanks for your page on the pronunciation of ' gif ' !
I 'm glad to have been vindicated by evidence !
Just thought I 'd point out that in the english language , when a g is followed by an a , o , or u , it is supposed to be hard .
When followed by an i or e , it is supposed to be soft .
Therefore I never had any question that it was pronounced ' jif ' , despite the fact that everyone around disagreed .
Rita Minnichsoffer rebuts : I 'd like to know what happens when you give a gekko to geese , or get a gift from a girl , then ...

Pronounce GIF as you may .
Clay McGovern writes :
Although an interesting diversion , the roots of a word and its original pronunciation are completely irrelevant to common usage .
Words have lives of their own .
The creators of a word have little control over pronunciation beyond their original act of creation .
Words are meant only for communication .
The salient question is on " Do you understand my meaning when I say ' GIF ' ? "
If the answer is " Yes . "
Then the dispute over " proper " pronunciation is absolutely absurd .
Very , very , few people pronounce GIF with a soft g .
Those who do are understood as well as those who do n't .
Where is the problem with that ...
Best regards , Clay ( with a " c " as in " cat " ) Erik J. Macki writes : ... English words beginning in " gi - " " ge - " or " gy - " that are not of Romance origin ( French , Italian , etc. ) are * all * pronounced with a velar ( hard ) " g. "
It is probably due to a misunderstanding of this principle that led the inventor of the GIF to pronounce it with an affricate ( soft ) " g " in the first place .
This is why a native speaker of English would intuitively pronounce a word spelled " GIF " with a velar ( hard ) " g " without knowing otherwise .
This is more consistent with all English - speakers ' natural , internal morphophonology , and that is why the velar pronunciation is so widespread .
Nonetheless , spelling is often irrelevant to pronunciation in English : with words like " tough , " through , " " gift , " " gypsy , " " egg , " " gem , " and " massage , " no one need waste any effort creating logic about how the letter " g " " ought " to be pronounced in English words : there simply is no logic .
One must go by usage .
English is full of words whose pronunciation deviates from prescribed standards -- precisely because usage , and not prescriptive rules , dictates what is " correct . "
No amount of arguing from pundits and word - coiners can ever change this !
I suspect from informally surveys that the velar pronunciation in " GIF " is actually more common than the affricate ( " soft " ) pronunciation - - a point of view validated by the very existance of your Web site -- and as such the velar variant is at least a " correct " alternative if not the more common and thus " more correct " form entirely .
Thanks ,
Erik ( Ed : Whoa , that 's over my head dude ... you lost me at " morphophonology " ! )

Cole Hewitt writes : Maybe GIF should be pronounced " zhif " with a French accent .
Then we could end this controversy .
Steve Bennett writes : I saw your site on the proper pronunciation of GIF and have to categorically state it 's pronounced with the soft G as in Jif.
Back in 1987 , I was an assitant Sysop on Compuserve , in the Comics and Animation forum , and also in the AmigaArts forum , and as such was given the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of GIF development .
( GIF was a godsend , especially for the Comics forum which was dealing with umpteen jillion different incompatible graphics formats ... )
Days after the format was announced and the first programs released by Compuserve , I was one of the first to post new GIF code , and wrote an Amiga program to display GIF images .
( I actually do n't recall if mine was the first 3rd party program uploaded -- if not , it was by a matter of a few days at most ... )
I called that program GIFFY because I had completely rewritten the decoder code ( still in use by a few programs out there ...:) and made it MUCH faster .
( Later , I wrote GIFFY2 , and HAMGIF ...)
We all pronounced it " Jif " at the time , and the name " GIFFY " seemed the obvious and clear choice of name .
It never even occurred to me that someone might pronounce it with the hard G until the mid 1990s .
Seeing your site was a breath of nostalgia for me -- I wonder if there 's an archive of those old Compuserve forums anywhere around .
So much great stuff was there .
Alas , I suspect it 's all lost in the maelstrom ...

A belated bit of opinion for the discussion about the pronunciation of GIF — it is well - established that it was intended by the creators for GIF to be pronounced with a " J " sound , similar to the peanut butter brand , and technically this pronunciation is correct .
However , savvy graphics people who know their history ( dare I say I 'm one ? ) are also quite familiar with the JPEG Interchange Format ( JIF ) , which is pronounced in the same manner .
Since the Joint Photographic Experts Group was organized in 1986 , their development of the JPEG family of standards ( including JIF ) possibly began earlier than the CompuServe work , which is consistently cited as resulting in the creation of GIF in 1987 .
Conversely , it can be argued that the Joint Photographic Experts Group did n't release their first standard until 1992 , well after GIF 's rise in popularity .
But the timeline is not so important .
Those of us who followed and became familiar with both standards ran into the pronunciation issue long years ago .
And the answer was simple — adhere to typical English rules , as cited rather well by Erik J. Macki , and pronounce GIF with a hard G and pronounce JIF with a J .
That rule made it simple to identify between the formats , even if it meant one was pronounced inconsistently with what its creators intended .
Such " bastardization of language " is unavoidable .
People still pronounce Porsche as a single syllable , despite there being no silent E in German .
Furniture stores advertise " chase lounges " instead of the correct French chaises longues .
While I generally agree with Mr. Macki that " one must go with usage , " this is a different case .
It 's not from laziness or poor understanding of etymology that I pronounce GIF with a hard G , nor because it follows what other people do .
It 's in respect to the knowledge that there are two graphic formats with identical - sounding names , and the easiest , most efficient way to distinguish them is to pronounce them differently .
For my two cents , it was silly of the creators of GIF to go against an obvious pronunciation and ignore the words that formed that acronym .
That was just asking for the very trouble that has kept this argument alive for so long .
Pigumon writes : Does n't matter what the " Creators " say .
You can't make up the word " banana " and tell everyone it 's pronounced " ping pong table " .
Gif(t ) .
Not like it matters , Spam is a stupid word for junk mail since tons of people LOVE SPAM but hate junk mail .
Computer geeks are stupid .
They named the " PDA " when they had the chance to call it a " PAD " .
Steve writes :
Yes , I realize this is such old hat that it now smells like ... an old hat .
But , because I was basically flung to your .gif controversy site , here 's my two bucks .
( which of course , used to be 2 cents )
My first objection is minor but meaningful to me .
You see the picture you have on your site of Bob Berry ?
Well , I do n't have a picture of Steve Wilhite as a second confirmation , but I 'll tell you right now , no one that looks like Bob Berry is going to have any effect on how I pronounce a damned thing .
Having said that , perhaps you will consider this : I do n't accept your position that anyone has the right to define pronunciation of anything at all , whether they made it up or not .
That includes , and perhaps needs to be emphasized in the case of acronyms , in light of their becoming a de facto modern day source of new words and language .
Because of this fact , and attempting to stop adding stupid pronunciations to the already too confusing and contradictory English language , I will debate you on that subject any day , in front of any audience , and win overwhelming support .
In other words , just because you assume , or because you SAY a thing , does n't make it so .
I could , for instance attempt to apply your " rights " logic to a myriad of other circumstances and be shot down without an argument .
For example , if I purchase a huge tract of worthless land , drain all the swamps , clean up the old garbage dumps , build beautiful lamp - lined streets and gorgeous houses , I might think I have a right to number my streets and houses how I want .
Perhaps call north south and south east .
But I do n't .
You see , there are laws , ( in this case laws for guiding people trying to find their way , which is something the jif 's should spend a little time thinking about ) just as there are laws of pronunciation .
Again , arbitrarily deciding to pronounce something with a natural " j " sound , that STANDS FOR something with a natural " g " sound WILL NOT make it so .
Not unless you can defend the pronunciation of graphics as jraphics .
Finally , I refuse to follow some illogical course , ( especially one based upon peanut butter of all things ) that stupidly flies in the face of the primary logic , which in this case would be the long name of the acronym : Grrrraphic etc. etc .
This principle of mine can be found vindicated in the very town where I live .
No one knows who first called this area , Buena Vista .
I assume it was a Hispanic , although it might not have been .
In any case , the rural , native population insists on pronouncing this name as , Byoona Vista .
Guess what ?
Even though some of these people have FOUNDING ancestors whose opinions predate any authority I might try to enforce by over 100 years , I AM NOT , EVER , going to call this place BYOOna .
To those who insist , ( and there are many ) and to you and your followers I say , Kiss My pet Jackass .
Steve Kim Williamson writes : ... as long as you insist on everyone saying you 're " heels over head " in love with someone .
Which is what is originally was ... as you 'd put it , " Period .
The end .
That 's final .
End of story . "
Language evolves .
Pronunciation is part of language .
Pronunciation evolves .

Thanks for the great info page on GIF pronunciation , I butt heads with this issue ALL the time .
I run ReactionGIFs and have to say GIF constantly .
I always say it with the soft G ( Jiff ) ... and every dang time , the person I am talking to will correct me with the hard G : " You mean GIF ?
It happens every time .
Then I tell them the ' choosy developers ' story and they just stare back blankly at me like I am a crazy person .
Then they continue to use the hard G and think I have some form of nerd OCD .
I hate to say it , but the hard G people are winning the war .
It 's an uphill battle for us soft Gs. I will continue to fight the good fight as I just prefer the soft G. I might have to stop trying to defend it though , people really do n't like to be corrected .
All the best ,
Justin John Bridges writes : I was one of the original GIF developers , wrote the image viewer PICEM which was first released in 1987 .
I have always pronounced it GIF like the word GIFT .
Sadly , I do n't have an archive of the developers forum on Compuserve from 1987 , but there was at least one discussion on the pronunciation , and I was on the GIF side .
My argument then , like many of the modern arguments was that it 's Graphics Image Format , not Jraphics Image Format , and that the closest word is GIFT .
Matt Drury writes : I have a note on my calendar every May 28th to celebrate GIF , and some quick google - fu found your page .
I helped run the Picture Support Forum on CompuServe , which expanded to the many Graphics Forums , from the late Eighties through the early 2000s .
Dining in the Oak Room with Steve and others , the soft - G " gif " was always used in - house .
I do n't remember people being as polarized about it then - Mac vs PC was more of a thing - but it was pre-Internet , after all .
It amuses me to no end that , 33 years on , it 's still being argued about .
And that 's just fine - how many other fancy file formats are in widespread use a third of a century later ? :)
Thanks for keeping the faith !

Jif peanut butter has weighed in on the debate with their #JIFvsGIF campaign .
The highlight is this video : Harry Walker has created the How to correctly pronounce GIF web site .
I particularly love the Jeopardy video from YouTube that I 'll also add here : I also discovered this GIF meme a while back .

10 Tech Terms You Might Be Pronouncing Incorrectly - by Daniel Bean , Yahoo !
Tech ' JIF '
Is the Format .
' GIF '
Is the Culture : A Modest Proposal - by Andy Baio GIF Inventor Steve Wilhite was honored with a 2013 Webby Lifetime Achievement award for inventing the GIF file format in 1987 .
That 's a picture of him from the October 1987 CompuServe magazine to the right .
And as the New York Times and BBC News reported , he re-validated the existence of this website with this gem of a quote : " The Oxford English Dictionary accepts both pronunciations , " Mr. Wilhite said .
" They are wrong .
It is a soft ‘ G , ’ pronounced ‘ jif . ’
End of story . "

Animated GIFs .
They 're not the subject of this page , but they 've become all the rage recently .
The ' animation ' feature was just one of several new features added to the official GIF specification in the GIF89a revision , along with transparent backgrounds and overlying text ( see left ) .
In the early days of the web , they became popular for displaying simple cartoon - like animations on web sites , such as the ubiquitous " Under Construction " notices with their flashing lights and so forth .
When broadband became the norm , larger GIFs became possible containing digitized video , which leads us to where we are today .
I kind of hoped a newer GIF revision would come out supporting audio , but there is a beauty to the simplicity of a brief , silent , repeating video clip that just starts playing without clicking a little triangle .
Thanks to Justin at ReactionGIFs for letting me use the above animated GIF !
PBS Off Book produced a nice little YouTube video detailing the history of Animated GIFs .
What 's relevant here is that GIF is pronounced both ways throughout the video , depending on whom they 're interviewing .
But they include a nice little epilogue on the issue of GIF pronunciation !

About ...
This site has been ( somewhat ) maintained by Steve Olsen since 1998 when I thought of compiling the facts surrounding the GIF vs. JIF pronounciation debate which I had followed since the graphic format 's inception in the late 80's when I was an avid BBS user .
Thanks to Andy L. at Skizzers.org who hosted this site for a while before I got my OlsenHome.com domain in 2002 .
Since then I 've continued to get the occasional e-mail from people with an opinion or direct connection to the subject , and I usually post it in the Reader 's Comments section .
If you 've got a view on this topic , feel free to e-mail me at :
As a member of the internet generation , I do more things online these days than offline .
In the world of commerce , there are a host of simple and useful tools , created by companies , that make it very easy for me to accomplish what I want to accomplish .
Need a map ?
Google .
Need information on where to go for dinner & drinks , and then what entertainment to take my wife to celebrate special occasions ?
Citysearch , ticketmaster , etc. Hotels , airfare , and vacations ?
A host of sites provide me with information , pricing , and simple booking .
I can communicate with fellow homebrewers or fellow Boilermakers on a number of message boards .
Buying and selling of goods and services can be done on a host of sites ( my favorite being craigslist ) .
Even banking , a form of commerce as old as money , is available and convenient online .
I ca n’t remember the last time I actually wrote a check , stuck it in an envelope , added a stamp , and sent it off to pay my bills .
But when it comes to making things easier for “ consumers ” , one area of our society lags far , far behind : the government .
Outside of a few bright spots , government - service web sites are largely cumbersome and useless .
Why ?
Well , the economist points us at the usual suspects : lack of competition , lack of accountability , and a tendency to spend money without actually ensuring the results are achieved .
Governments have few direct rivals .
Amazon.com must outdo other online booksellers to win readers ’ money .
Google must beat Yahoo !.
Unless every inch of such companies ’ websites offers stellar clarity and convenience , customers go elsewhere .
But if your country ’s tax - collection online offering is slow , clunky or just plain dull , then tough .
When Britain ’s Inland Revenue website crashed on January 31st — the busiest day of its year — the authorities grudgingly gave taxpayers one day ’s grace before imposing penalties .
They did not offer the chance to pay tax in Sweden instead . …
But shame and beauty contests are still weak forces in the public sector .
Failure in bureaucracy means not bankruptcy but writing self - justifying memos , and at worst a transfer elsewhere .
Bureaucrats plead that just a bit more time and money will fix the clunky monsters they have created .
That kind of thinking has led to the botched computerisation in Britain ’s National Health Service , where billions of pounds and millions of precious hours are spent on a system that at best will be substandard and at worst dangerously leaky with patients ’ private medical data .
That reflects another problem .
In the private sector , tight budgets for information technology spark innovation .
But bureaucrats are suckers for overpriced , overpromised and overengineered systems .
The contrast is all the sharper given some of the successes shown by those using open - source software : the District of Columbia , for example , has junked its servers and proprietary software in favour of the standard package of applications offered and hosted by Google .
Not that such an indictment of the system will surprise any regular readers of this web site , of course .
Systems do n’t work when the incentives do n’t force them to work , and the political incentive to operate efficiently simply does n’t exist .
I would , of course , add one additional point .
I added emphasis to the article ’s point on bureaucrats ’ use of overpriced , overpromised , and overengineered systems .
In addition , it ’s quite often that these systems are not chosen for their technical fit in the required application , but are chosen because of who is supplying the system , and what politicians they have lobbied .
Or , as is common in the military , the politically - correct need to source products from “ small disadvantaged businesses ” leads to perverse incentives , where either sub-optimal solutions are chosen , or the implemented solution has needless overhead in the cost because it must be purchased through a qualifying distributor .
As is usually the case with government , it ’s not that incompetence or malfeasance is the direct cause of the failure of a system .
It ’s that the system is not designed to operate in the way we expect it to .
Our elected officials and the bureaucrats they appoint are not supermen .
In fact , those who believe the internet is a series of tubes simply should n’t be expected to implement sound e-government policies .
USENIX is pleased to announce open public access to all its conference proceedings .
This significant decision will allow universal access to some of the most important technical research in advanced computing .

This is a joint press release from the National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) , which is part of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado at Boulder ; the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) , based in the United Kingdom ; and the Earth Dynamic System Research Center at National Cheng Kung University ( NCKU ) inTaiwan .
Satellite imagery from the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder reveals that a 13,680 square kilometer ( 5,282 square mile ) ice shelf has begun to collapse because of rapid climate change in a fast - warming region of Antarctica .
The Wilkins Ice Shelf is a broad plate of permanent floating ice on the southwest Antarctic Peninsula , about 1,000 miles south of South America .
In the past 50 years , the western Antarctic Peninsula has experienced the biggest temperature increase on Earth , rising by 0.5 degree Celsius ( 0.9 degree Fahrenheit ) per decade .
NSIDC Lead Scientist Ted Scambos , who first spotted the disintegration in March , said , " We believe the Wilkins has been in place for at least a few hundred years .
But warm air and exposure to ocean waves are causing a break - up . "
Satellite images indicate that the Wilkins began its collapse on February 28 ; data revealed that a large iceberg , 41 by 2.5 kilometers ( 25.5 by 1.5 miles ) , fell away from the ice shelf 's southwestern front , triggering a runaway disintegration of 405 square kilometers ( 160 square miles ) of the shelf interior ( Figure 1 ) .
The edge of the shelf crumbled into the sky - blue pattern of exposed deep glacial ice that has become characteristic of climate - induced ice shelf break - ups such as the Larsen B in 2002 .
A narrow beam of intact ice , just 6 kilometers wide ( 3.7 miles ) was protecting the remaining shelf from further break - up as of March 23 ( Figure 2 ) .
Scientists track ice shelves and study collapses carefully because some of them hold back glaciers , which if unleashed , can accelerate and raise sea level .
Scambos said , " The Wilkins disintegration wo n't raise sea level because it already floats in the ocean , and few glaciers flow into it .
However , the collapse underscores that the Wilkins region has experienced an intense melt season .
Regional sea ice has all but vanished , leaving the ice shelf exposed to the action of waves . "
With Antarctica 's summer melt season drawing to a close , scientists do not expect the Wilkins to further disintegrate in the next several months .
" This unusual show is over for this season , " Scambos said .
" But come January , we 'll be watching to see if the Wilkins continues to fall apart . "
Real - time collaboration
Images from NASA 's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) and data from ICESat showed that the ice shelf was in a state of collapse in March .
Scambos then alerted colleagues around the world , seeking to ensure that every means of gathering information was focused on the break - up .
British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) mounted an overflight of the crumbling shelf , collecting video footage and other observations .
BAS glaciologist David Vaughan said of the ice shelf , which is supported by a single strip of ice strung between two islands , " Wilkins is the largest ice shelf on West Antarctica yet to be threatened .
This shelf is hanging by a thread . "
Associate Professor Cheng - Chien Liu at Taiwan 's National Cheng - Kung University ( NCKU ) also responded , requesting high - resolution color satellite images of the area from Taiwan 's Formosat - 2 satellite ( Figure 3 ) , operated by the National Space Organization .
Cheng - Chien
Liu said , " It looks as if something is slicing the ice shelf piece by piece on an incredible scale , kilometers long but only a few hundred meters in width . "
South American scientists also got involved .
Andrés Rivera and Gino Cassasa at the Laboratorio de Glaciología y Cambio Climático at the Centro de Estudios Científicos in Chile ( CECS ) , acquired images of the Wilkins from the ASTER instrument , aboard NASA 's Terra satellite .
The combined efforts of these international teams have begun to provide observational data that will improve scientific understanding of the mechanisms behind ice shelf collapse .
Scambos said , " The Wilkins is an example of an event we do n't see very often .
But it 's a key process in being able to predict how sea level will change in the future . "
More information
The Wilkins is one of a string of ice shelves that have collapsed in the West Antarctic Peninsula in the past thirty years .
The Larsen B became the most well - known of these , disappearing in just over thirty days in 2002 .
The Prince Gustav Channel , Larsen Inlet , Larsen A , Wordie , Muller , and the Jones Ice Shelf collapses also underscore the unprecedented warming in this region of Antarctica .
Return to News Room
Two armed thieves picked the wrong night to rob a Sydney club , disturbing a meeting of 50 motorcycle bikers , who tackled and hog - tied one of the thieves until police arrived .
The Southern Cross Cruiser Club was staging its monthly meeting on Wednesday night in the club in Sydney 's west when two men armed with machetes entered the club and ordered patrons to lie on the ground and surrender their money .
But the balaclava - wearing bandits did not realize there were 50 bikers in the next room .
" I was in the middle of giving my meeting and someone ran in and said , " the place is being robbed ' , " biker club president Jester told local radio on Thursday .
" So we ran around the roller door out the front and as this guy opened the roller door , we crash tackled him in the doorway , " Jester said .
The thief managed to escape the biker 's tackle , but was caught again by the bikers .
" We caught him at the fence and crash - tackled him and hog -tied him to the ground and waited for the police to get there , " said Jester .
" Yeah , he picked the wrong night I think , " he said .
The other thief jumped over a balcony and ran into a nearby park , but was later caught by police .
" If they 'd only looked , right when they walked in the main door , they would have seen 40 or 50 of us sitting there .
Obviously they could n't see out of the balaclavas , because they did n't even look , " said Jester .

NEW DELHI : If you thought that Global Indian Takeover was just a hollow cliche leaning on a few iconic successes like Pepsi's Indra Nooyi , Citibank 's Vikram Pandit and steel world 's Lakshmi Mittal , there is a slew of statistics now to give it solid ballast .
The extent to which desis have made an impact in the US was reeled off in the Rajya Sabha ��� as many as 12 % scientists and 38 % doctors in the US are Indians , and in NASA , 36 % or almost 4 out of 10 scientists are Indians .
If that 's not proof enough of Indian scientific and corporate prowess , digest this : 34 % employees at Microsoft , 28 % at IBM , 17 % at Intel and 13 % at Xerox are Indians .
And the House of Elders also heard some startling facts about a country that 's still stuck with a Third World tag ��� 20 % of gold in the world is used by Indians and nine out of 10 diamonds used in the world are made in India .
The figures of Indian successes were given to the Rajya Sabha on Monday by D Purandeshwari , minister of state for HRD , in defence of the country 's higher education system and the state of research .
Purandeshwari said that although a lot needed to be done to encourage research , it was wrong to run down the country 's higher education system since most Indians who excelled abroad were products of Indian institutions .
He said there was no slackness in research and the number of PhD holders had gone up from 17,898 two years back to 18,730 last year .
The minister also listed initiatives taken to encourage research , especially in science .
Apart from creating 1,000 positions of research scientists at various levels , she said draft norms to create 10 networking centres in basic sciences in leading departments of universities were being prepared .
It would help in promoting collaborative research and give access to advanced facilities .
Also , all postgraduate programmes pertaining to science and technology would have an in - built component of research .
The University Grants Commission is also identifying performing universities so that they can be given 50 fellowships to carry out research in basic sciences .

McCain has personally pleaded with NY TIMES editor Bill Keller not to publish the high - impact report involving key telecom legislation before the Senate Commerce Committee , newsroom insiders tell the DRUDGE REPORT .
The paper 's Jim Rutenberg has been leading the investigation and is described as beyond frustrated with McCain 's aggressive and angry efforts to stop any and all publication .
The drama involves a woman lobbyist who may have helped to write key telecom legislation .
The woman in question has retained counsel and strongly denies receiving any special treatment from McCain .

先日の木曜日、YLUGに参加しました。笹田耕一さんの YARV ( Yet Another RubyVM ) の講演会でした。なんか、会は、過去9年間の間で、１，２を争う盛り上がりだったそうで、すごく楽しかったです。参加者のレベルも高く、YARV
の中の話を色々と聞かせていただきました。
その席で、ザイボウズ・ラボの竹迫さんに、「 Ruby on JavaScript つくらないの？」とお誘いを受けたので、この週末、作ってみました♪
名づけて、HotRuby。ちゃんと動いているよ〜
http://hotruby.accelart.jp/
基本的な文法は、大体、実装しました。ただし、組み込み関数や組み込みクラスは、大部分が実装されていません。文法面でも、例外は実装していません。
仕組みは、一度、サーバー の Ruby 1.9.0 の YARV でオペコード列にコンパイルさせて、それを JSON でクライアント側に渡し 、JavaScript 上の RubyVM で実行しています。つまり 、RubyVM on JavaScript です 。JSON を JavaScript のソースコードで持っておくと速いのですが、どうしても＜script type=" text /ruby " ＞を使いたかったので、毎回、サーバーにコンパイルさせています。でも、おかげでコードの最後の微調整は楽でした！
sum = " " 50000 .times ( |e| sum += e.to_str )
というベンチマークを動かしてみました。HotRuby@Opera9 で 6.767秒 、Ruby 1.9.0 で 12.051秒と、Ruby ( YARV ) よりも 78 % も速かったです！
でも 、IE でベンチマークはとらないでね ( ^^ ; ; ; ;
まぁ、GUIを操作するだけに、そんなにCPUパワーはいらなく、複雑な処理はサーバー側で処理すればいいだけなので、十分だと思います。
http://hotruby.accelart.jp/test-web/diy.html で自分で Ruby のソースを貼り付けて、実行させることができます。HotRuby 自体は " Ruby License " です。 「 これが動かないよ！ 」とか「このメソッド実装したよ！」とかソースでいただけたら、嬉しいです！
クライアント側は 、Array , Hash , String , Time などがちゃんと実装されていれば、あとは、そんなに組み込みクラスはいらなく、それよりも、DOM や ExtJS などの GUI ライブラリの Ruby ラッパーの方が重要です 。
では、よいお年を〜 ♪

Update : Flickr hits 2 Billion photos served .
That 's a lot of hamburgers .
Flickr is both my favorite bird and the web 's leading photo sharing site .
Flickr has an amazing challenge , they must handle a vast sea of ever expanding new content , ever increasing legions of users , and a constant stream of new features , all while providing excellent performance .
How do they do it ?
Site : http://www.flickr.com
Information Sources
Flickr and PHP ( an early document )
Federation at Flickr : Doing Billions of Queries a Day by Dathan Pattishall .
Building Scalable Web Sites by Cal Henderson from Flickr .
Database War Stories # 3 : Flickr by Tim O'Reilly
Cal Henderson 's
Talks .
A lot of useful PowerPoint presentations .
Platform
PHP
MySQL
Shards
Memcached for a caching layer .
Squid in reverse - proxy for html and images .
Linux ( RedHat )
Smarty for templating
Perl
PEAR for XML and Email parsing
ImageMagick , for image processing
Java , for the node service
Apache
SystemImager for deployment
Ganglia for distributed system monitoring
Subcon stores essential system configuration files in a subversion repository for easy deployment to machines in a cluster .
Cvsup for distributing and updating collections of files across a network .
The Stats
More than 4 billion queries per day .
~ 35 M photos in squid cache ( total )
~ 2 M photos in squid ’s RAM
~ 470 M photos , 4 or 5 sizes of each
38 k req/sec to memcached ( 12 M objects )
2 PB raw storage ( consumed about ~ 1.5TB on Sunday
Over 400,000 photos being added every day
The Architecture
A pretty picture of Flickr 's architecture can be found on this slide .
A simple depiction is :
-- Pair of ServerIron's
---- Squid Caches
------ Net App's
---- PHP App Servers
------ Storage Manager
------
Master - master shards
------ Dual Tree Central Database
------ Memcached Cluster
------ Big Search Engine
- The Dual Tree structure is a custom set of changes to MySQL that allows scaling by incrementally adding masters without a ring architecture .
This allows cheaper scaling because you need less hardware as compared to master - master setups which always requires double the hardware .
- The central database includes data like the ' users ' table , which includes primary user
keys ( a few different IDs ) and a pointer to which shard a users ' data can be found on .
Use dedicated servers for static content .
Talks about how to support Unicode .
Use a share nothing architecture .
Everything ( except photos ) are stored in the database .
Statelessness means they can bounce people around servers and it's easier to make their APIs .
Scaled at first by replication , but that only helps with reads .
Create a search farm by replicating the portion of the database they want to search .
Use horizontal scaling so they just need to add more machines .
Handle pictures emailed from users by parsing each email is it 's delivered in PHP .
Email is parsed for any photos .
Earlier they suffered from Master - Slave lag .
Too much load and they had a single point of failure .
They needed the ability to make live maintenance , repair data , and so forth , without taking the site down .
Lots of excellent material on capacity planning .
Take a look in the Information Sources for more details .
Went to a federated approach so they can scale far into the future :

My data gets stored on my shard , but the record of performing action on your comment , is on your shard .
When making a comment on someone else 's ’ blog
- Global Ring :
Its like DNS , you need to know where to go and who controls where you go .
Every page view , calculate where your data is , at that moment of time .
- PHP logic to connect to the shards and keep the data consistent ( 10 lines of code with comments ! )
Shards :
- Slice of the main database
- Active Master - Master Ring Replication : a few drawbacks in MySQL 4.1 , as honoring commits in Master - Master .
AutoIncrement IDs are automated to keep it Active Active .
- Shard assignments are from a random number for new accounts
- Migration is done from time to time , so you can remove certain power users .
Needs to be balanced if you have a lot of photos …
192,000 photos , 700,000 tags , will take about 3 - 4 minutes .
Migration is done manually .
Clicking a Favorite :
- Pulls the Photo owners Account from Cache , to get the shard location ( say on shard - 5 )
- Pulls my Information from cache , to get my shard location ( say on shard - 13 )
- Starts a “ distributed transaction ” - to answer the question : Who favorited the photo ?
What are my favorites ?
Can ask question from any shard , and recover data .
Its absolutely redundant .
To get rid of replication lag …
- every page load , the user is assigned to a bucket
- if host is down , go to next host in the list ; if all hosts are down , display an error page .
They do n’t use persistent connections , they build connections and tear it down .
Every page load thus , tests the connection .
Every users reads and writes are kept in one shard .
Notion of replication lag is gone .
Each server in shard is 50 % loaded .
Shut down 1/2 the servers in each shard .
So 1 server in the shard can take the full load if a server of that shard is down or in maintenance mode .
To upgrade you just have to shut down half the shard , upgrade that half , and then repeat the process .
Periods of time when traffic spikes , they break the 50 % rule though .
They do something like 6,000 - 7,000 queries per second .
Now , its designed for at most 4,000 queries per second to keep it at 50 % load .
Average queries per page , are 27 - 35 SQL statements .
Favorites counts are real time .
API access to the database is all real time .
Achieved the real time requirements without any disadvantages .
Over 36,000 queries per second - running within capacity threshold .
Burst of traffic , double 36 K / qps .
Each Shard holds 400K + users data .
- A lot of data is stored twice .
For example , a comment is part of the relation between the commentor and the commentee .
Where is the comment stored ?
How about both places ?
Transactions are used to prevent out of sync data : open transaction 1 , write commands , open transaction 2 , write commands , commit 1st transaction if all is well , commit 2nd transaction if 1st committed .
but there still a chance for failure when a box goes down during the 1st commit .
Search :
- Two search back - ends : shards 35 k qps on a few shards and Yahoo ! ’s ( proprietary ) web search
- Owner ’s single tag search or a batch tag change ( say , via Organizr ) goes to the Shards due to real - time requirements , everything else goes to Yahoo ! ’s engine ( probably about 90 % behind the real - time goodness )
- Think of it such that you ’ve got Lucene - like search
Hardware :
- EMT64 w/RHEL4 , 16GB RAM
- 6-disk 15 K RPM RAID - 10 .
- Data size is at 12 TB of user metadata ( these are not photos , this is just innodb ibdata files - the photos are a lot larger ) .
- 2U boxes .
Each shard has ~120 GB of data .
Backup procedure :
- ibbackup on a cron job , that runs across various shards at different times .
Hotbackup to a spare .
- Snapshots are taken every night across the entire cluster of databases .
- Writing or deleting several huge backup files at once to a replication filestore can wreck performance on that filestore for the next few hours as it replicates the backup files .
Doing this to an in - production photo storage filer is a bad idea .
- However much it costs to keep multiple days of backups of all of your data , it 's worth it .
Keeping staggered backups is good for when you discover something gone wrong a few days later .
something like 1 , 2 , 10 and 30 day backups .
Photos are stored on the filer .
Upon upload , it processes the photos , gives you different sizes , then its complete .
Metadata and points to the filers , are stored in the database .
Aggregating the data :
Very fast , because its a process per shard .
Stick it into a table , or recover data from another copy from other users shards .
max_connections = 400 connections per shard , or 800 connections per server & shard .
Plenty of capacity and connections .
Thread cache is set to 45 , because you do n’t have more than 45 users having simultaneous activity .
Tags :
- Tags do not fit well with traditional normalized RDBMs schema design .
Denormalization or heavy caching is the only way to generate a tag cloud in milliseconds for hundreds of millions of tags .
- Some of their data views are calculated offline by dedicated processing clusters which save the results into MySQL because some relationships are so complicated to calculate it would absorb all the database CPU cycles .
Future Direction :
- Make it faster with real - time BCP , so all data centers can receive writes to the data layer ( db , memcache , etc ) all at the same time .
Everything is active nothing will ever be idle .
Lessons Learned
Think of your application as more than just a web application .
You 'll have REST APIs , SOAP APIs , RSS feeds , Atom feeds , etc .
Go stateless .
Statelessness makes for a simpler more robust system that can handle upgrades without flinching .
Re-architecting your database sucks .
Capacity plan .
Bring capacity planning into the product discussion EARLY .
Get buy - in from the $ $$ people ( and engineering management ) that it ’s something to watch .
Start slow .
Do n’t buy too much equipment just because you ’re scared / happy that your site will explode .
Measure reality .
Capacity planning math should be based on real things , not abstract ones .
Build in logging and metrics .
Usage stats are just as important as server stats .
Build in custom metrics to measure real - world usage to server - based stats .
Cache .
Caching and RAM is the answer to everything .
Abstract .
Create clear levels of abstraction between database work , business logic , page logic , page mark - up and the presentation layer .
This supports quick turn around iterative development .
Layer .
Layering allows developers to create page level logic which designers can use to build the user experience .
Designers can ask for page logic as needed .
It 's a negotiation between the two parties .
Release frequently .
Even every 30 minutes .
Forget about small efficiencies , about 97 % of the time .
Premature optimization is the root of all evil .
Test in production .
Build into the architecture mechanisms ( config flags , load balancing , etc. ) with which you can deploy new hardware easily into ( and out of ) production .
Forget benchmarks .
Benchmarks are fine for getting a general idea of capabilities , but not for planning .
Artificial tests give artificial results , and the time is better used with testing for real .
Find ceilings .
- What is the maximum something that every server can do ?
- How close are you to that maximum , and how is it trending ?
- MySQL ( disk IO ?)
- SQUID ( disk IO ? or CPU ?)
- memcached ( CPU ? or network ?)
Be sensitive to the usage patterns for your type of application .
- Do you have event related growth ?
For example : disaster , news event .
- Flickr gets 20 - 40 % more uploads on first work day of the year than any previous peak the previous year .
- 40 - 50 % more uploads on Sundays than the rest of the week , on average
Be sensitive to the demands of exponential growth .
More users means more content , more content means more connections , more connections mean more usage .
Plan for peaks .
Be able to handle peak loads up and down the stack .
Eighteen of the 1 m - high robots , equipped with cameras and operated by remote control , are going to Iraq this spring , the Associated Press reports .
The machine is based on a robot already used by the military to disable bombs .
Officials say the robot warrior is fast , accurate and will track and attack the enemy with relatively little risk to the lives of US soldiers .
Unlike its human counterparts , the armed robot does not require food , clothing , training , motivation or a pension .
When not needed in war , it can be mothballed in a warehouse .
However , the robot will rely on its human operator , remotely studying footage from its cameras , for the order to open fire .
According to Bob Quinn , a manager with Foster - Miller , the US - based company which worked with the military to develop the robot , the only difference for a soldier is that " his weapon is not at his shoulder , it 's up to half a mile away " .
Test of metal
The robot fighter has been named Swords , after the acronym for Special Weapons Observation Reconnaissance Detection Systems .
Robot soldier Can be fitted with standard - issue M249 or M240 rifle
Has four cameras , night - vision and zoom lenses Can travel over rocks and barbed wire Batteries run for up to 4 hours at a time Remote control unit has two joysticks and video screen Costs $ 200,000 ( £ 106,757 ) per unit
It is based on the Talon robot , which is widely used by the military to disarm bombs .
A US officer who helped test the robot said it was a more accurate shot than the average soldier because it is mounted on a stable platform and takes aim electronically .
" It eliminates the majority of shooting errors you have , " said Staff Sgt Santiago Tordillos .
Mr Quinn says there are plans to replace the computer screen , joysticks and keypad in the remote - control unit with a Gameboy - style controller and virtual - reality goggles .
The Foster - Miller company is owned by the QinetiQ Group , a joint venture between the UK's Ministry of Defence and US - based holding company , Carlyle Group .

I ’ve racked up so many penalty - fees from my local video store for not rewinding DVDs before I return them I could have probably started up my own rental shop by now …
We all have those friends or family members that would probably believe that story and when they do you can now recommend that they pick up this DVD Rewinder to avoid those extra fees next time they return a movie .
The Rewinder has a slick fluorescent green color scheme and other high - tech stylings which make it rather convincing .
It even plays a rewind sound effect when spinning the disc so you can hear the device ’s progress and know when it ’s done .
For the tech - savvy ( though I think even a 3 - year - old will probably realize this is a gag ) you can record your own custom sound effects to replace the included ‘ rewind ’ one which can result in hours of comic hilarity .
The DVD Rewinder is available on their website and is actually on sale right now for $ 16.49 .

Summary : Users now do basic operations with confidence and perform with skill on sites they use often .
But when users try new sites , well - known usability problems still cause failures .
Enemies of usability have two counter - arguments against design guidelines that are based on user research :
" You 're testing idiots — most users are smarter and do n't mind complexity . "
— most users are smarter and do n't mind complexity . "
" You were right in the past , but users have now learned how to use advanced websites , so simplicity is n't a requirement anymore . "
I decided to put these claims to the test in a new study we 're currently conducting .
Because we 're testing this year 's sites with this year 's users , the study automatically assesses the second claim .
We can't directly assess whether our study participants are idiots , since we do n't subject them to an IQ test .
But participants ' comments during all of our studies these past 14 years indicate that we 've mainly had plenty smart test users .
Unless a specific study calls for participants with a different profile , we mostly recruit people with respectable jobs — an engineering consultant , an equity trader , a lawyer , an office manager , a real estate agent , a speech therapist , and a teacher , to take some of the job titles from the first week of our current study .
One part of the current study tests B2B sites since many of our seminar audience work on such sites .
This time , we chose sites targeting dentists in clinical practice , IT managers from big corporations , and CEOs of small businesses .
Thus , we have disproportionally many users with these job descriptions .
They are n't stupid .
One way of quantifying the level of users we 're currently testing is to look at their annual income .
In our screening , we look at the user 's personal income , rather than his or her household income .
We also recruit an equal number of people making : below $ 50,000 , $ 50,000 –99,999 , and $ 100,000 or more .
The following table compares our users with the entire U.S. population ( according to the Census Bureau ) within the study 's target age range ( 20 –60 years ; we 've covered kids , teens , and seniors in other research ) :
User 's Annual Income Our Participants U.S. Population
( age 20 –60 ) <$ 50,000 33 % 70 % $ 50,000 –99,999 33 % 22 % ≥ $ 100,000 33 % 8 %
We 're definitely testing people who are much more successful than the average .
We decided to bias the study in favor of high - salary users for three reasons :
We need to test many business professionals and doctors because so many of our seminar participants target these groups , whether for websites or intranets .
Wealthy users have more money to spend and are thus more important to seminar attendees who work on e-commerce sites .
Even conference attendees who target a broad consumer audience benefit from presentations that are based mainly on studies of wealthy users because that fact helps them overcome the " dumb users " objection when they take the guidelines back to their teams .
We 're not neglecting poor people — we have enough of them in the study to learn about their needs .
But our participant profile is clearly such that no one could claim that the findings do n't apply to high - end users .
Improved User Skills
So , with the qualifications about our research out of the way , what have we found in recent studies ?
We 've seen several indications that users are indeed getting a bit better at using the Web .
Almost all users :
are better at physical operations , such as mouse movements and scrolling ;
, such as mouse movements and scrolling ; are more confident at clicking , and less afraid that they 'll break something ; and
at clicking , and less afraid that they 'll break something ; and know the basics of using search and use it more often than we saw in the past .
In addition ,
some users are exhibiting expert behaviors , such as opening a second browser window to compare two websites or changing a PDF file 's zoom level .
When performing common tasks on sites they often use , most users are incredibly fast and competent .
This fact leads us to two interesting conclusions :
Many sites are now good enough that users reward them with loyalty and frequent use .
and frequent use .
When people revisit such sites , they tend to do the same things repeatedly and develop a high degree of skilled performance — something we rarely saw on websites in the past .
As an example , one user failed almost every task on unfamiliar websites , yet was highly confident and extremely fast in using her bank 's site to transfer money between two of her accounts .
Browsing and Research Skills Still Poor
Even though users are remarkably good at repeated tasks on their favorite sites , they 're stumped by the smallest usability problems when they visit new sites for the first time .
People are very bad at coping with information architectures that deviate from their view of the problem space .
They also fail to readjust their content interpretation to compensate for changing contexts .
For example , when users jump from one IA area to another , they often continue to think that the information addresses the previous topic .
Users are also overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information that many sites dump on them .
For example , a beginning investor tested E - Trade , which could be a great site to support his initial investments and might gradually grow his site involvement over time .
Instead , E - Trade 's first few pages were littered with scary jargon like " ADR " and " ETF . "
To escape , he clicked the Active Trading link , assuming this would help him understand how to trade .
In fact , it took him to an area for highly experienced investors and it had even more mumbo- jumbo .
So , this hot prospect concluded that he did n't dare open an E - Trade account .
First - time visitors to a site do n't have the conceptual model needed to correctly interpret menu options and navigate to the appropriate place .
Lacking this contextual understanding , they waste time in the wrong site areas and misinterpret the area content .
People 's reading skills are the same as they have always been , emphasizing the importance of writing for the web
In earlier research , we have studied lower - literacy users , but even the higher - literacy users in our current study had problems with the dense content on many sites .
For example , when testing NASA.gov , we asked users to find out when the rings around Saturn were formed .
One user did find a page about Saturn , but ended up picking a wrong answer , 1980 , which is when additional ringlets were discovered .
To help new users find their way , sites must provide much more handholding and much more simplified content .
Making comparisons is one of the most important tasks on the Web , and yet users have great difficulty doing so on most sites .
The test participants were particularly happy with those websites that do the comparing and consolidating for them , like kayak.com .
Why worry about new users ' ability to understand your site when your experienced users are clearly having a jolly old time performing frequent tasks ?
Because people develop into loyal , experienced users only after passing through the new - user stage .
To grow your business , you have to accommodate first - time visitors for whom small difficulties loom large and often spell defeat .
Also , it 's important to expand your loyal users ' interaction vocabulary to further increase their loyalty .
Because they move so fast , experienced users do n't waste much time learning new features .
Users have tunnel vision on their favorite sites : unless a new feature immediately proves its worth , users will stick to safe , familiar territory where they can quickly accomplish their tasks and leave .
By now , our test participants have extensive experience using the Web ( mostly 3 + years ) , and they 're still running into substantial problems online .
Waiting for people to get even more experience is not likely to resolve the issues .
Websites are just too darn difficult .
Google Gullibility
Users live by search , but they also die by search .
People turn to search as their first step — or as their second step , if their first attempt at navigating fails .
Users typically formulate good initial queries , and vaguely understand how to tickle the search engine into coughing up desired sites when they appropriately modify their main keywords .
For example , in our new study , a user looking for a modest gift for a football fan searched for " football trinket . "
Five years ago , such a user would most likely have searched " football " and been buried by the results .
Still , today 's users rarely change their search strategy when the initial query fails .
They might modify their first attempt , but they typically stick with the same general approach rather than trying something genuinely new .
For example , one user tested the Mayo Clinic 's site to find out how to ensure that a child with a milk allergy would receive sufficient calcium .
The user attempted multiple queries with the keyword " calcium , " but never tried the words " milk " or " allergy . "
Also , users are incredibly bad at interpreting SERP listings ( SERP = Search Engine Results Page ) .
Admittedly , SERPs from Google and the other main search engines typically offer unreadable gibberish rather than decent website descriptions .
Still , an expert searcher ( like me ) can look at the listings and predict a destination site 's quality much better than average users .
When it comes to search , users face three problems :
Inability to retarget queries to a different search strategy
to a different search strategy Inability to understand the search results and properly evaluate each destination site 's likely usefulness
each destination site 's likely usefulness Inability to sort through the SERP 's polluted mass of poor results , whether from blogs or from heavily SEO - optimized sites that are insufficiently specific to really address the user 's problem
Given these difficulties , many users are at the search engine 's mercy and mainly click the top links — a behavior we might call Google Gullibility .
Sadly , while these top links are often not what they really need , users do n't know how to do better .
I use " Google " in labeling the behavior only because it's the search engine used by the vast majority of our test users .
People using other search engines have the same problems .
Still , it 's vital to reestablish competition in the search engine field : it would be a tragedy for democracy to let 3 guys at one company determine what billions of people read , learn , and ultimately think .
Guidelines Reconfirmed
Our work is generating many interesting new findings on questions such as : What makes a website credible ?
What inspires user loyalty ?
We 're running more studies to dig into these issues , which are among the most important for improving website profitability over the next decade .
Once we 've analyzed the mountains of data we 're collecting , we 'll announce the new findings at our upcoming usability conference .
For now , one thing is clear : we 're confirming more and more of the old usability guidelines .
Even though we have new issues to consider , the old issues are n't going away .
A few examples :
Email newsletters remain the best way to drive users back to websites .
It 's incredible how often our study participants say that a newsletter is their main reason for revisiting a site .
Most business professionals are not very interested in podcasts or newsfeeds ( RSS ) .

Opening new browser windows is highly confusing for most users .
Although many users can cope with extra windows that they 've opened themselves , few understand why the Back button suddenly stops working in a new window that the computer initiated .
Opening new windows was # 2 on my list of top - 10 Web design mistakes of 1999 ; that this design approach continues to hurt users exemplifies both the longevity of usability guidelines and the limited improvement in user skills .

Links that do n't change color when clicked still create confusion , making users unsure about what they 've already seen on a site .
Splash screens and intros are still incredibly annoying : users look for the " skip intro " button — if not found , they often leave .
One user wanted to buy custom - tailored shirts and first visited Turnbull & Asser because of their reputation .
Clicking the appropriate link led to a page where a video started to play without warning and without a way to skip it and proceed directly to actual info about the service .
The user watched a few seconds ; got more and more agitated about the lack of options to bypass the intro , and finally closed down the site and went to a competitor .
Customer lost .

Customer lost .
A fairly large minority of users still do n't know that they can get to a site 's homepage by clicking its logo , so I still have to recommend having an explicit " home " link on all interior pages ( not on the homepage , of course , because no - op links that point to the current page are confusing — yet another guideline we saw confirmed again several times last week ) .
It particularly irks me to have to retain the " explicit home link " guideline , because I had hoped to get rid of this stupid extra link .
But many users really do change very slowly , so we 'll probably have to keep this guideline in force until 2020 — maybe longer .
At least breadcrumbs are a simple way to satisfy this need .

People are still very wary , sometimes more so than in the past , about giving out personal information .
In particular , the B2B sites in this new study failed in exactly the same way as most B2B sites in our major B2B research : by hitting users with a registration screen before they were sufficiently committed to the site .

Non-standard scrollbars are often overlooked and make people miss most of the site 's offerings .
The following screens show two examples from last week 's testing .
On the Carl 's Jr. hamburger chain website , we asked users to look up nutritional information for various meals .
Many participants thought the quick item view menu covered only breakfast items , because those were the only choices visible without scrolling ( see above ) .
Users overlooked the non-standard scrollbar , and instead often suffered through the PDF files available through the nutrition guide link .
( These PDF files caused many other problems , confirming more age - old usability guidelines .
That said , some users are now skillful enough to adjust PDF views so that they 're slightly more readable .
Still , it 's a painful process . )
On the Sundance Resort 's site , one user was thrilled to see photos of celebrations hosted at the resort .
She eagerly clicked through all five visible thumbnails ( see above ) , but never noticed the small triangles at the top and bottom that let users scroll to see more photos ( the circle at left shows the bottom arrow at full size ) .
Web usability guidelines are not the only guidelines our new studies confirm .
On VW 's site , we asked participants to use the configurators to customize a car according to their preferences .
Unfortunately , this mini-application violated some of the basic application usability guidelines , causing people many problems .
As the above screenshot shows , users can select their car 's wheel style from two options ( shown below the car ) .
This simple operation was difficult and error prone , however , because the option for the wheel that 's currently mounted on the car was grayed out — a GUI convention that 's supposed to mean that something is unavailable , not that it 's the current selection .
It would have been much better to show both available wheels at all times , placing a selection rectangle — or some other graphical highlighting convention — around the current selection .
( Poor feedback is # 4 on our list of top - 10 mistakes of application design . )
Interface conventions exist for a reason : they allow users to focus on your content ( in this case , the car and its options ) .
When all interface elements work as expected , users know how to operate the UI to get the desired effect .
Conversely , when you deviate from user expectations , you erect a great barrier between users and their ability to get things done .
Some designers think this makes the site more exciting .
In reality , non-standard design makes the site more frustrating and drastically reduces the user 's chance of success .
Users are thus more likely to quickly leave the site .
In VW 's case , the designers probably suffered from a case of metaphor overload : the design mimics the experience of actually assembling a physical car in a real workshop .
If you had two wheels on the workshop floor and mounted one on the car , then the chosen wheel would no longer be on the floor .
In reality , though , users are not greasemonkeys .
They 're clicking on interface elements , and they expect the picture of a wheel to behave like a GUI element .
We 're confirming hundreds more of the existing usability guidelines every week as our testing continues .
Even though we have upscale users and it's a new study testing new sites , most of the findings are the same as we 've seen year after year after year .
Usability guidelines remain remarkably constant over time , because basic human characteristics stay the same .

NEW YORK -- Roger Federer could n't figure out why he felt so sluggish at the start of this season .
His doctors eventually gave him an explanation :
The world 's No. 1 tennis player had mononucleosis .
" Roger found out he had mono , and did n't know it .
He found out a couple of weeks ago .
That 's probably what was wrong with him , " Federer 's agent , Tony Godsick , said Friday .
" He does n't want to make any excuses and take anything away from anybody .
In hindsight , had [ his doctors ] known he had mono , they would n't have let him play . "

Federer lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open semifinals in January , then did n't play again until this week , when he was upset by Andy Murray in the first round of the Dubai Tennis Championships .
Federer had not lost in the first round of a tournament since 2004 .
He was diagnosed with mononucleosis last month after seeing doctors in Switzerland and Dubai , Godsick said .
Mononucleosis is an infection caused by a virus .
Symptoms include fever , sore throat , headaches and feeling tired .
" This gave him a reason for why he was n't able to move and why he was n't able to recover , " Godsick said .
" It was annoying for him to not have reasons for why his body was n't responding . "
Federer was cleared to start practicing five days before the start of the Dubai tournament .
Godsick said Federer is " over it now , " and will play Monday night against Pete Sampras in their exhibition match at Madison Square Garden .
" It 's good to get an extra match under his belt , " Godsick said .
" He 's looking forward to the Garden , 19,000 people , playing his idol .
He 's been somewhat down because he did n't know what was wrong with him . "
Federer owns 12 Grand Slam singles titles , two away from Sampras ' career record .
" I was feeling so great in December up until the moment I got sick , so this has been my problem the last couple weeks : really getting back on track , " Federer told The New York Times for a story posted on its Web site Friday .
" I have n't practiced and could n't really work out the way I wanted to , because you have to be very careful with mono . "
Ohio plans recount of some primary votes
Ohio 's elections chief wants a fraction of the state 's Democratic and Republican presidential primary votes recounted .
Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner is hoping the first - of - its - kind audit will verify there were no major snags in the March 4 election .
Eleven counties have been asked to volunteer for the audit .
They would recheck at least 7 percent of the vote by hand .
Paper ballots counted by optical scan machines and votes cast on electronic touch - screen machines would be recounted .
" Brunner has proposed eliminating electronic voting before the November general election , " James Nash reports for The Columbus Dispatch .
" During her campaign , Secretary of State Brunner talked about elections that could be audited or verified , " spokesman Jeff Ortega said , according to the Ohio paper .
" This is a further step toward that fulfillment . "
The Dispatch article continues , " A 2007 audit of Cuyahoga County 's November 2006 election found a number of irregularities , including the loss of some ballots and others that were counted twice .
Brunner praised that audit , which was ordered by the county board of elections , and suggested that other checks would be coming to ensure the accuracy of polling across Ohio . "

The conference honoured those killed in the Madrid train bombing
The world 's anti-terrorism experts met for a conference in Stockholm this week and , as Roger Hardy , the BBC's Islamic Affairs Analyst , found , optimism was in short supply .
As the event began - at a conference centre overlooking the famous Stockholm waterfront - we stood in silent commemoration of the victims of the Madrid train bombings of 2004 .
It was a sign , had we needed one , that we were gathered in the Swedish capital to discuss one of the most important and difficult issues of our time .
The participants came at the topic from every angle .
There were senior soldiers and policemen , intelligence professionals , diplomats , think - tank experts , a handful of journalists - and , on the fringes , salesmen eager to explain the latest gadgets , designed to make us feel safer in a dangerous world .

Our common concern was how do you defeat an insurgency - and the phrase invoked more than once was T E Lawrence 's dictum that it is like eating soup with a knife .
He , after all , was in a position to know , having led a much - romanticised Arab insurgency against the Turks in the First World War .
Many experts see the " ideas war " to be as important as the battlefield Insurgencies of course are not new .
At one point , delegates trooped off to see that classic Sixties film The Battle of Algiers - the moral of which is that a Western country , however powerful ( and even one that is ready to resort to torture ) will fail to crush an insurgency if it faces determined popular resistance .
Now the West and its allies are trying to adapt the lessons drawn from past insurgencies to help them fight a new kind of war .
Even defining the conflict is problematic .
US President George W Bush dubbed it the " war on terror " .
Others now prefer to call it a " global insurgency " .
Still others think that term is not quite right either .
Ideological struggle
But whatever it is , it is posing a whole host of dilemmas for those who are fighting it .
Above all , this new war is being fought , not just on the battlefield , but in the mind .
Cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad inflamed opinions
The West and its Islamist adversaries are competing for Muslim opinion - and that means Muslim opinion in Birmingham and Jakarta , as well as Baghdad and Kabul .
So in this battle for hearts and minds , how do you protect law - abiding Muslims , while continuing to capture or kill the violent ones ?
And can you be sure you can tell the difference ?
One British defence expert remarked : " We 're not looking for a needle in a haystack - we 're looking for a piece of straw in a haystack . "
Everyone is having to reinvent their traditional role .
Soldiers are no longer just fighters but nation - builders .
Policemen must visit mosques and explain what they do to sceptical Muslim congregations .
Intelligence people are trying to get into the minds of an enemy they only dimly understand .
Government departments can no longer operate as " stovepipes " - the favourite jargon nowadays for agencies which do not co-operate with one another and sometimes do not even speak to one another .
It is clear there are still significant differences of approach - not least between the Americans , who tend to see terrorism as a form of war , and the Europeans , who tend to see it as a form of crime .
And , as the conference made plain , Europeans are far from being united in their perception of Muslim radicalism in Europe - and how their governments and societies should respond to it .
Pessimistic predictions
There is an abiding fear of social division .
The Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad polarised Muslim and non-Muslim opinion in Europe - and now there are fears that a film about the Koran , made by a right - wing Dutch politician , could do the same .
As for those salesmen for whom the conference was essentially a marketing opportunity , I had to confess to being technically challenged .
I never did master " predictive analytics " - and my favourite bit of gobbledy - gook was " open computer forensics architecture " - or OCFA for short .
And if , like me , you do an internet search for it , you may not end up much the wiser .
It is now widely recognised that Muslim hearts and minds matter
What struck me most , in three days of debate , was the degree of pessimism about the task at hand .
Yes , there has been a learning curve .
It is now widely recognised that Muslim hearts and minds matter and that military successes mean little if the battle of ideas is being lost .
But there is still a long way to go .
This came home to me when I spoke to an American military man who had helped produce the US Counter - Insurgency Manual .
How long did he think the " long war " - as many now call it - would last ?
It is the kind of question journalists ask , and I did not expect that he would put a number on it .
But he did .
" Thirty years if we get it right , " he said .
" A hundred years if we get it wrong . "

Researchers from Sweden 's Lund University made an extraordinary video of a bat flying in a wind tunnel , in order to better understand the animal 's aerodynamics .
Someday , their research could inform the design of small autonomous air vehicles .
In this still image from the video , the bat is seen feeding from a tube of nectar .
From Nature News :
… The sharp edge at the front of their wings cuts through the air in such a way as to create a vortex on top of the wing , producing up to 40 % of the lift needed to stay aloft .
" It explains how these animals are able to fly at very slow speed , " says Anders Hedenström from Lund University in Sweden , who led the research – published in Science – that showed the effect with a live bat .
The phenomenon of a ' leading - edge vortex ' is known to help insects to fly ; this discovery helped to work out how the bumble bee manages to stay airborne .
But it has n't been definitively seen before in a non-insect with live animals .
Washington , DC , March 4 , 2008 - Learning , Arts , and the Brain , a study three years in the making , is the result of research by cognitive neuroscientists from seven leading universities in the United States .
In the Dana Consortium study , released today at a news conference at the Dana Foundation 's Washington , DC headquarters , researchers grappled with a fundamental question :
Are smart people drawn to the arts or does arts training make people smarter "
For the first time , coordinated , multi-university scientific research brings us closer to answering that question .
Learning , Arts , and the Brain advances our understanding of the effects of music , dance , and drama education on other types of learning .
Children motivated in the arts develop attention skills and strategies for memory retrieval that also apply to other subject areas .
The research was led by Dr. Michael S. Gazzaniga of the University of California at Santa Barbara .
" A life - affirming dimension is opening up in neuroscience , " said Dr. Gazzaniga , " to discover how the performance and appreciation of the arts enlarge cognitive capacities will be a long step forward in learning how better to learn and more enjoyably and productively to live .
The consortium 's new findings and conceptual advances have clarified what now needs to be done . "
Participating researchers , using brain imaging studies and behavioral assessment , identified eight key points relevant to the interests of parents , students , educators , neuroscientists , and policy makers .
An interest in a performing art leads to a high state of motivation that produces the sustained attention necessary to improve performance and the training of attention that leads to improvement in other domains of cognition .
Genetic studies have begun to yield candidate genes that may help explain individual differences in interest in the arts .
Specific links exist between high levels of music training and the ability to manipulate information in both working and long - term memory ; these links extend beyond the domain of music training .
In children , there appear to be specific links between the practice of music and skills in geometrical representation , though not in other forms of numerical representation .
Correlations exist between music training and both reading acquisition and sequence learning .
One of the central predictors of early literacy , phonological awareness , is correlated with both music training and the development of a specific brain pathway .
Training in acting appears to lead to memory improvement through the learning of general skills for manipulating semantic information .
Adult self - reported interest in aesthetics is related to a temperamental factor of openness , which in turn is influenced by dopamine - related genes .
Learning to dance by effective observation is closely related to learning by physical practice , both in the level of achievement and also the neural substrates that support the organization of complex actions .
Effective observational learning may transfer to other cognitive skills .
As several of the consortium members stressed at today 's news conference , much of their research was of a preliminary nature , yielding several tight correlations but not definitive causal relationships .
Although " there is still a lot of work to be done , " says Dr. Gazzaniga , the consortium 's research so far has clarified the way forward .
" We now have further reasons to believe that training in the arts has positive benefits for more general cognitive mechanisms . "

" Confirmed my way of thinking and living that I learned over time from many great people and situations in life .
It 's a question that is burning up the blogosphere with some speculating that Microsoft has delayed XP SP3 , a long awaited release that could boost the performance of XP , to get more users to adopt Vista , a potential cash cow for Microsoft and PC makers given the operating system 's robust hardware refresh requirements .
With many in the blogosphere speculating that Microsoft could release the final version of XP SP3 this week , Microsoft late Tuesday snuffed out all hope that users would see the service pack , originally slated for release in 2006 , any time soon .
Instead of a final XP SP 3 release , Microsoft announced late Tuesday a refresh to the XP SP3 Release Candidate 2 version it posted to its Download Center just last month .
The software giant cited the need to elicit more feedback from testers , but some solution providers are n't buying it .
" I think Microsoft is withholding XP SP3 until all of the smoke has blown over with Vista SP1 , " said Patrick Derosier , co-owner of CPU Guys , a Hanson , Mass system builder .
" They are dealing with a driver backlash from Vista SP1 which was released only last week . "
Derosier said Microsoft is grappling with a raft of Vista driver issues that is hampering the adoption of the operating sytem .
He said CPU Guys recommends users stick with XP rather than move to Vista .
Derosier said Vista is not ready for prime time yet .
" Vista still needs a lot more hardware support in the form of drivers from major vendors before we can recommend it , " he said .
" You can tell there is a problem when a major Intel video driver on many chipsets has a problem . "
On top of that , Derosier said there is a significant amount of software driver problems .
" The thousands of the programs that have been written have all been written with certain rules in place , " he said .
" Those rules have drastically changed with the release of Vista .
The industry is being lazy and just has n't updated the software or the hardware to work with Vista . "
For example , the currently - available versions of Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.0 and Symantec Network Access Control are not certified for use with Vista SP1 , which means users wo n't be able to download SP1 until Symantec releases the next versions of the software , which the vendor says will happen " in the coming weeks " .
" This Vista situation is a growing pain for the PC business , " Derosier said .
" It 's a major problem that Apple does n't face because Apple controls the hardware and most of the software on its tightly held Macintosh system .
" Customers do n't like change , " he added .
" They are not ready for Vista .
They know Vista is there , but they wo n't go with it until we give it the greenlight .
They take our professional recommendation . "
Despite all the driver issues , Derosier said Vista is not as " horrible " as some are making it out to be .
" Remember back in the day XP was treated the same way , " he said .
" Technology is a lot different today than when XP came out many years ago .
Everyone likes to complain and when you complain it spreads across the blogosphere . "
Derosier said al lot of the issues surrounding Vista come with Microsoft moving to make the operating system more secure .
" With XP you had almost full access to certain areas of the operating system kernel that you do n't have access to with Vista , " he said .
" So what it boils down to is the way Microsoft is writing its software with Vista , making it secure from the ground up which they did n't do with XP .
They are going to run into problems like the driver issue with Vista SP1 as a result of that . "
Glen Coffield , president of Smart Guys Computers , an Orlando , Fla . - based retail chain with six stores in central Florida , said he sees Vista sales picking up with the release of Vista SP1 .
" We are starting to do a lot more Vista now that SP1 is out there , " he said .
" Whether it really fixes anything or not it does n't matter .
People sit on the fence and wait for the first service pack release .
We dealt with the same thing with Windows XP . "
Coffield said that some three months ago his business was selling 90 percent XP and 10 percent Vista on its systems .
That has shifted to 70 percent XP and 30 percent Vista , he said .
" The migration to Vista is starting to happen , " he said .
That said , he still sees a healthy business ripping and replacing Vista off of systems in favor of XP .
" I do n't think they are having a problem selling Vista , " he said .
CLINTON , Iowa 
On the final weekend before Iowa ’s presidential caucuses , the Democratic contenders tangled over electability Saturday as the leading Republican candidates delivered fresh attacks on their rivals , hoping to nudge undecided voters to reach a decision in an extraordinarily volatile campaign .
“ Who is tested and ready to be the winning candidate for the Democratic Party ? ” said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York , arguing her ability to fend off Republicans .
“ They ’ve been after me for 16 years .
And much to their dismay , I ’m still here . ”
Senator Barack Obama of Illinois took the rare step of mentioning his leading rivals by name .
He pointedly told voters he believed that Mrs. Clinton would “ start off with half the country not wanting to vote for her . ”

Asked about Mr. Obama ’s comments , Mrs. Clinton named Democrats supporting her , including Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio , who traveled with her Saturday .
“ They are not on a political suicide mission , ” she said .

Ideas Critical Faculties
The elegant assassin How an Englishman in Somerville is becoming the most feared man in American letters
( Getty Images ) THE BLOOD PRESSURE of some of America 's leading novelists no doubt just shot up : James Wood , The New Republic 's famously stringent book critic -- scourge of John Updike , Toni Morrison , Thomas Pynchon , Don DeLillo -- has jumped to The New Yorker , giving him a much wider audience for his coolly incendiary literary sermons .
For a hiring that followed a familiar pattern -- small , good magazine to big , good magazine -- Wood 's move caused an extraordinary stir in literary circles .
At The New Republic , his immensely learned , barbed essays , utterly unbowed by conventional wisdom , earned him an ardent following and the ire of novelists who failed to meet his standards .
Wood is controversial partly for his unusually clear ( his detractors say crabbed ) ideas about what a great novel is -- or , rather , is n't .
He is especially set against " hysterical realism , " his coinage for books that attempt to convey the raucousness of contemporary life through outlandish proliferating plots , allegory , bizarre coincidence , and high irony .
In other words : Pynchon , Salman Rushdie , much of David Foster Wallace , the first two Zadie Smith books , and half of " The Corrections , " by Jonathan Franzen .
He is not indirect in his criticisms .
The Nobel Laureate Morrison 's novel " Paradise , " Wood pronounced a few years back , " is a novel babyishly cradled in magic .
It is sentimental , evasive , and cloudy . "
DeLillo's " Underworld , " he has written , " proves , once and for all , or so I must hope , the incompatibility of the political paranoid vision with great fiction . "
Even his detractors concede that such takedowns are the fruits of a love for the novel -- of a certain sort .
But what does it mean that the most storied magazine in American history has aligned itself with a critic who essentially rejects the premises of a broad swath of contemporary American fiction ?
" I think he just does n't get America , " says Lindsay Waters , executive editor for the humanities at Harvard University Press , invoking the argument that a messy , sprawling country demands comparable novels .
With Englishmen now installed as prominent fiction critics at The New Yorker and The Atlantic ( Christopher Hitchens ) , " It 's like being in America in 1830 , before Emerson arose .
We still need to declare our independence . "
John Leonard , a book critic at Harper 's and television critic for New York magazine , said in an e-mail that while he 's determined not to start an intramural sniping session among critics , given the market pressures hurting literary criticism as a whole , he is also " tempted to suggest that not appreciating either Don DeLillo or Toni Morrison suggests that maybe you are tone - deaf to the American language as she is written . "
The hiring is a striking vote for intellectual rigor over magazine breeziness .
Ben Schwarz , the literary and national editor of The Atlantic , says he approached Wood several years ago about moving to The Atlantic , although both parties decided the time ( or fit ) was n't right .
The decision by David Remnick , The New Yorker 's editor , is a smart one , he thinks , but not without risks .
" For every reader who is going to buy The New Yorker because Wood 's essays appear in it , " Schwarz says , " there will be some others who flip through it and alight on a paragraph of Wood 's and think the magazine is too highbrow . "
Wood says he wants to influence literary culture on a grander scale ( The New Yorker 's circulation is 1.1 million , compared with 62,000 for The New Republic ) , and also felt a creeping staleness .
" I did have the sense I was reviewing the same authors again and again -- Rushdie , Roth , Updike , " he said in a phone interview that interrupted a vacation on Martha 's Vineyard last week .
( Potential - awkwardness alert : Updike has had The New Yorker as his playground for half a century .
Wood has been brutal toward his recent work , indicting him for intellectual slackness . )
At The New Yorker , Wood will now be writing shorter pieces , more often ( though he will stretch out at times , too ) -- a dozen a year .
" That presumes a different kind of book , " Wood says .
" It presumes I will try to find a writer producing his or her second or third book , preferably someone unknown to New Yorker readers . "
Wood grew up in an evangelical family in Durham , England -- worshipers quaked and spoke in tongues at his church -- but his faith migrated from God to the novel in his teenage years , at private school and then Cambridge .
There , he met the aspiring novelist Claire Messud , the author most recently of " The Emperor 's Children . "
Wood opted for the Guardian newspaper over a doctorate , rising to chief literary critic in his mid-20s , when he caught the eye of The New Republic .
He lived in Washington for six years , and then followed Messud to Amherst in 2001 , where she briefly taught .
Harvard hired him in 2003 .
Now married , the literary couple live in Somerville 's Union Square with their two young children .
Wood , 41 , has always hovered intriguingly between academia and journalism -- a space that can be lonely and vexing .
Leslie Epstein , director of the creative writing program at Boston University , says he tried to interest the English department chairman in hiring Wood , before Harvard did , but that the chairman retorted that Wood was a mere journalist .
( The then - chairman , James Winn , denies that account of " what must have been informal and private conversations that allegedly took place eight or nine years ago " and says he has great respect for Wood 's writing . )
Shortly after Harvard hired Wood , members of the University of Chicago 's Committee on Social Thought -- Saul Bellow 's onetime home -- approached him to apply for a position that could have led to lifetime tenure .
After some preliminaries , Wood decided to keep his part - time Harvard and New Republic posts .
These came with no guarantees .
" I was always impressed by that , " says The Atlantic 's Schwarz .
During his years at The New Republic , it was not just his ferocity in defense of his vision that stood out ( he was also publishing in the London Review of Books and , sometimes , The New Yorker ) , but also the range of his thought , captured in his essay titles : " Half Against Flaubert , " " Toni Morrison 's False Magic , " " Dostoevsky 's God , " " Salman Rushdie 's Nobu Novel . "
( Nobu is a hip New York restaurant ; Wood said the book " exhausts negative superlatives . " )
His voice was compressed , knotty , hyper - erudite , sometimes hilarious .
Wood called the British author Zadie Smith 's second book , " The Autograph Man , " " a flailing , noisy hash of jokes , cool cultural references , pull - quotes , lists and roaring italics .
It is like reading a newspaper designed by a kindergarten . "
Wood lauded Saul Bellow as an ideal , and championed the lesser - known writers W.G. Sebald , Norman Rush , and Alan Hollinghurst .
He also managed to produce a novel , " The Book Against God " ( 2003 ) , that received mixed - to - good reviews , despite all the knives awaiting it .
The job change will answer one criticism that has dogged him -- the suggestion that , however talented , he was a hatchet man for the editor Leon Wieseltier , whose literary pages at The New Republic manifest delight in popping reputations .
" Somehow TNR got the best people , " the literary magazine N + 1 wrote in its debut issue , in 2004 , " and encouraged their worst instincts . "
Wood rejects the idea that he did anyone else 's bidding or that there is something wrong with being tough - minded .
" I do think that a good part of being a critic is to press hard on texts , especially when the rest of the culture is n't doing so very often . "
But now we 'll have a better sense of his true instincts , independent of one magazine .
And the idea that he does n't " get " America , in all its weird glory ?
" Look , we all live in America .
We are all aware of its weirdness .
But how mimetic does fiction have to be about this weirdness -- how much does it have to reflect this weirdness ?
And how distinct is this weirdness from the weirdness of 20 years ago ? "
Amid postmodern tumult , " people are still dying around us , having children , making friends .
Without wanting to make fiction domestic in a dreary , writing - workshop way , you do feel a lack of these experiences in fiction . "
He does sound tired of at least the reputation of being a scold .
" I do think the job of a critic is to try to find some kind of vital current in the literary culture , " he says .
He did that at the New Republic , too , he insists , but now he 's fishing more intensely in the flood of new work .
" I 've been trying to keep up , but I 've been aware of things passing me by , so I want to rectify that . "
Yet this will hardly be a rebirth : Wood has penciled in reviews of the new Roth novel , two new translations of " War and Peace , " and a translation of the Psalms , by Robert Alter .
Wood 's fans and detractors are now watching with excitement , curiosity , and consternation to see where things might go .
Mark Greif , co-editor of N + 1 , says , " My own fantasy is that The New Yorker will release him to write about all the other things his talent may allow him to write about .
You do wonder what would happen if they said , ' Go take a trip to Europe and tell us what you see . '
What would happen if James Wood wrote about TV , or rock ' n ' roll ?
I 'm told he is a great fan of Keith Moon , the drummer for the Who . "
It 's true .
" Remember , I grew up with Bellow , " Wood says .
" If you love Bellow , you love exuberance and stylistic showing off .
That is exactly my complaint against someone like Rushdie .
It 's not style , it 's all noise .
He does n't hit the drums like Moon hits them . "

Kris Kobach , a former counsel to then - Attorney General John Ashcroft who is currently the chairman of the Kansas GOP , sent out an email on Thur entitled " Kansas Republican Party Year in Review " in which he brags of voter caging .
Blue Tide Rising has the goods :
... Kris Kobach , chairman of the Kansas GOP , sent out a self - congratulatory litany of accomplishments .
Among them was one particularly eye - catching item : " To date , the Kansas GOP has identified and caged more voters in the last 11 months than the previous two years ! " [...]
Slate.com has the best comprehensive write - up on how the Republican Party employs caging techniques to suppress the votes of the poor , the deployed , and college students .
( You know , likely Democratic voters . )
Did we mention it 's illegal ?
And that Kris Kobach is proud to be doing it ?
Since Kris Kobach can't expand his own party or force his own Party 's members to support his candidates he 's shamelessly trying to keep Democrats from voting instead .
This is the stratagem of a desperate and shrinking party .
Someone needs to ask Kris Kobach which voters he 's caging and how he 's doing it .
Someone like a newspaper editor or perhaps a Grand Jury .
... ( more )
More on Kris Kobach here and here ( He apparently suffers from an advanced case of Lou Dobbs disease ) .
Depending on what methods are being used in Kobach 's admitted voter caging scheme , it may very well be illegal , but hardly surprising .
Voter suppression through caging lists has become a standard part of the Republican playbook to steal elections for some time now .
In Sept McClatchy detailed current Republican voter caging efforts underway in Florida and Ohio to " impede Democratic - leaning minorities from voting in 2008 , " and back in July PBS NOW took a look at the Republican Party 's voter caging plan " designed to keep Democrats from voting , allegedly by targeting people based on their race and ethnicity . "
Watch that video here .
Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton and Harry Reid are being controlled by trial lawyers who want to blindfold the nation 's terror fighters and they plan to let the Protect America Act expire , according to a new Republican National Committee YouTube attack ad .
The senators foot - dragging in handing President Bush unchecked power to install permanent spying outposts inside American telecom facilities will " open a critical gap in our nation 's intelligence capabilities . "
The ad features a shaking countdown timer , shots of a Humvee against the backdrop of an American flag , and the silhouette of a Muslim with an AK - 47 in front of what looks to be a statehouse .
The ad closes by noting that " The terrorist threat to America never expires . "
www.youtube.com/watch?v=&rel=1
THREAT LEVEL hates to nitpick , so we wo n't point out that using satellite dishes to intercept international radio waves is n't affected by the Protect America Act .
Nor that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nevada ) –also targeted in the ad – continues to make it legislatively easy for the Administration - friendly bill to pass .
Nor that none of the lawsuits against the telecoms were filed by the traditional plaintiff lawyers .
And while the vid accuses Democrats of responding to special interests ( Al Qaida ? ) , the real special interest lobbying behind the bill comes from telecoms that knew they were breaking the law .
Also , FISA only really became important after 9/11 after the New York Times revealed that Bush had lied to the nation about warrantless wiretapping and had been sidestepping FISA for four years by 2005 .
And if the NSA wanted to spy on a known terrorist suspect in Pakistan who was calling someone in D.C. , should n't the NSA be using some of its multi-billion dollar budget to place the wiretap near the phone in Pakistan , rather than inside a telephone switch in New York City ?
That way the NSA might catch all the phone calls from a terrorism suspect , not just the ones to people in America .
Instead of nit-picking , THREAT LEVEL instead would like to dedicate the following clip as a chaser to the RNC 's stiff shot .

" I do n't cook .
So I made my eat - in kitchen a fabulous walk - in closet , " announces a young , attractive woman in the newest Citibank ad .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
It 's part of a $ 93 million campaign called " Tell your story , " that 's appearing in print , magazine , TV and online .
" My name is Grace and I live in a small apartment in a big city , " the ad continues .
" And since I enjoy a day of shopping far more than , say , cooking , I decided to do a bit of home remodeling .
So with my Citi card in hand , I set out to get some closet organizers .
I bought a shoe rack for the oven , sweater boxes for the lower cupboards and some 12 - inch baskets for handbags up above .
I saved room for plates , glasses and silverware .
And one large drawer stuffed with take - out menus . "
Citibank is so confident that women will identify with " Grace 's " sentiment , they 're even running the ad in February 's issue of Gourmet magazine .
Their assumption , I guess , is that even a good number of Gourmet 's readers ( who are mostly women ) do n't actually cook ; they 're just sampling the food porn .
This idea -- that liberated women do n't prepare food -- is n't one that Citibank just cooked up .
In fact , as one female friend of mine quickly pointed out , it 's still part of the Sex and the City cultural hangover .
Carrie Bradshaw , of course , famously used her oven as a shoe cupboard far before Grace , as a kind of feminist triumph : she likes sex and ( therefore ) does n't like to cook .
Shopping , friends and men sustained her instead , along with the occasional restaurant meal .
Last of a breed ?
But since Sex , the phenomenon has heated up .
Recently , I talked to a middle - aged male film director about a dinner he had just cooked for friends .
When I subsequently told him about a meal I 'd made , he raised his eyebrows .
" I do n't know a single other woman who cooks -- or at least admits to it in public ! " he exclaimed .
" You 're like a relic ! "
His male friends all cook , he said .
But no women of his generation or younger that he knows prepares food .
Why ?
In short , men come across as evolved , sexy and creative when they mix things up in the kitchen .
But women seem stuck in Leave - it - to - Beaver - land when they step in front of the stove : domestic suckers who are n't paying enough attention to their ambition or their libidos .
They 're not third wave feminists , embracing women 's traditional skills or sexy , busy people who make time for health and family , but women who need a good empowerment talk .
I spoke to a few of my other female friends about it .
" I never had anything in the cupboards before I had kids , " one friend , a professional singer , told me proudly .
" I was out having fun . "
" I can't even boil water , " another told me , smiling .
" If my husband is away , I just eat cereal or get take out . "
She 's never been taught to cook and has no desire to learn .
Plus , her husband 's dad was a chef , and he loves to cook elaborate meals .
" I put food on the table for the kids every day or whatever , but my partner does the fancier cooking for guests , " said another .
" It 's easier than getting him to help with anything else around the house -- he knows he 'll get lots of kudos for being the chef , but none for cleaning the toilet . "
Cooking as spectator sport
So actually , two things are happening .
One is that some women are n't cooking at all because they see it as low status or unnecessary .
And sure , women have been unfairly stuck with the brunt of domestic labour for a long time in a culture that has deemed it lower status than , say , working in an office .
Stepping away from the hearth is a form of rebellion and liberation and a way to gain more cultural status , which are both motivations I can sympathize with ( even though I think they 're both ultimately the opposite of liberated and healthy -- more on that later ) .
And the other is that many women do the daily food prep but do n't count that as " real " cooking .
For this , I blame the rise of foodie culture .
There are plenty of shows on the Food Network that feature quick and easy meals .
Like from one of my favourite celeb cooks -- Nigella Lawson -- in which , in the promo , she claims doing her hair and putting on lipstick takes more time than making the entrée .
But it 's clear this type of cooking is very different from real cooking -- i.e. highly fetishized , specialized , time consuming , expensive chef-ing , mostly done by men , both in restaurants and at home , and often involving blow torches .
It 's really a spectator sport , but it 's somehow become " cooking . "
Michael Pollan 's latest social recipe
A friend of mine , who is a chef , spent two weeks making a meal for his wife for her birthday .
It was the best meal she 's tasted .
But the meals they put on the table every day for themselves and their four - year old daughter are also real meals and actually more important socially , culturally and health - wise , says Michael Pollan in his new book , In Defense of Food .
In The Omnivore 's Dilemma , Pollan unearthed the rot in the food industry , and left many people scared to eat .
Then , in an article for the New York Times Magazine a year ago , " Unhappy Meals , " he caused an even greater cultural revolution with the following seven words : " Eat food .
Not too much .
Mostly plants . "
In his recent book , which followed from that magazine piece , he advocated a different way of approaching food .
" You would not have bought this book and read this far into it if your food culture was intact and healthy , " he writes in the book .
" Nor would you eat substances like Go-Gurt , eat them on the run or eat them at mealtimes that are so out of sync with friends and relatives that the real family dinner is an endangered ritual . "
He advocates eating local , organic food , even at the risk of elitism .
He says to buy fresh , local organic food ( which is more expensive ) but eat less of it , and you 'll still be ahead financially .
He says eating at home is better than eating out .
And that eating simple food together is the highest form of health and happiness .
Hand me that spatula
" We have more choices now than we 've ever had , " Pollan says in a recent interview , " An Omnivore Defends Real Food . "
" There is organic food at Wal - Mart .
The big challenge is that you do have to cook .
A lot of us are intimidated by cooking today .
We watch cooking shows on TV but we cook very little .
We 're turning cooking into a spectator sport .
This process of outsourcing our food preparation to large corporations , which is what we 've been doing the last 50 years , is a big part of our problem .
We 're seduced by convenience .
You 're going to have to put a little more time and effort into preparing your food .
I 'm trying to get across how pleasurable that can be .
It need n't be a chore .
It can be incredibly rewarding to move food closer to the center of your life . "
Who knew liberation would found in a kitchen cupboard full of produce , not purses ?
In fact , anyone who 's ever cooked will tell you the act of preparing food makes you more powerful and sexy .
The old saying , that a way to a man 's heart is through his stomach , always seems to hold up for both genders in my experience .
Who can resist a warm hearth as shelter from storms of all kinds ?
And as for a spatula making a woman into a relic , it 's all about the glint in the eye .

Steel chair attacks help unordained minister teach Catholicism David Edwards and Adam Doster

To say that Justin Fatica is abrasive would be an understatement .
This 29 - year old , unordained , freelance Catholic minister takes a controversial approach to religion , one that excites many kids and worries critics .
A new HBO documentary , recently previewed on ABC's Nightline , highlights Fatica 's Hard as Nails Ministry , an operation he runs to bring wayward kids back into the Catholic Church .
" I 'm not the smartest tool in the shed , " he jokes .
" I 'm just a regular guy .
But what I do know is I live here , right now , and I was born for this era .
There 's something big that God wants to do with me . "
That thing , in Fatica 's view , is to " shake kids up " through passionate presentations at Catholic high schools .
Fatica screams , points , and jumps around stage .
He points out when girls are overweight to show the kids " how we really treat people . "
Most shockingly , he allows kids to whack him across the back with a steel chair while he tells the room , " I want you to know that Jesus loves you ! "
Fatica says that his steel chair antics have multiple purposes .
The first is appeal .
" It 's hard to get young people 's attention in this era , " he says .
" So we use this experience to help them . "
He continues , pointing out that the excercise is really about love .
" St. Francis , to show people that he sinned , jumped in thorns ... I 'm just following what the saints do . "
Some worry that his style can push the envelope too far , advocating violence and aggression .
The documentary highlights one young person who appears to have a broken arm .
" It 's all about praising Jesus , " the boy says , " and if I have to get hurt praising Jesus , that 's just what I 'm going to have to do . "
In one Vermont high school , parents complained , and told him to leave the building .
But an emotional Fatica is sure Hard as Nails is a valuable project .
" I think God is proud of me , " he exclaims .
ABC's Nightline profiles an HBO documentary about Justin Fatica who encourages followers to hit him as part of religious teachings .

Men are not alone in finding the leggier form more attractive .
Women consider longer - legged men more physically appealing than their stumpier counterparts , a study has found .
Research involving more than 200 men and women revealed that people whose legs are 5 % longer than average are considered the most attractive , regardless of their gender .
Studies into sexual attraction have already shown that taller people are generally perceived as being more physically appealing to the opposite sex , but until now little was known about the effect a person 's leg length had on their overall attractiveness .
Psychologists led by Boguslaw Pawlowski at the University of Wroclaw in Poland investigated by asking 218 male and female volunteers to rank the attractiveness of seven men and seven women from digitally altered images .
While all of the people were the same height , the length of their legs was altered to make them equal to the Polish average or longer by 5 % , 10 % or 15 % .
The team found that regardless of the volunteers ' own body shape and leg length , people whose legs were 5 % longer than average were rated as the most attractive .
The next most appealing was an average leg length , or those that were 10 % longer than normal .
The scientists believe there are good evolutionary reasons for the preference .
" Long legs are a sign of health , " Pawlowski told New Scientist magazine .
Previous research has linked shorter legs with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity - related type 2 diabetes in both sexes .
Shorter - legged men are also more likely to have higher levels of triglycerides , which are linked to arterial disease and strokes .
Although the study only looked at Polish people , Pawlowski suspects the effect to be common across cultures .
Martin Tovee , a reader in visual cognition at Newcastle University , said longer legs were one of many subtle cues that suggest good health , especially in women .
" Leg length is a good indicator of childhood nutrition in women because their legs stop growing once they reach puberty .
So if a woman has long legs it suggests she grew up in a good environment and that has a positive effect on fertility .
" The effect in men is more subtle , because their legs continue to grow beyond puberty , " he said .

Without Walls : An Interview with Lebbeus Woods [ Image : Lebbeus Woods , Lower Manhattan , 1999 ; view larger ] .
Lebbeus Woods is one of the first architects I knew by name – not Frank Lloyd Wright or Mies van der Rohe , but Lebbeus Woods – and it was Woods 's own technically baroque sketches and models , of buildings that could very well be machines ( and vice versa ) , that gave me an early glimpse of what architecture could really be about .
Woods 's work is the exclamation point at the end of a sentence proclaiming that the architectural imagination , freed from constraints of finance and buildability , should be uncompromising , always .
One should imagine entirely new structures , spaces without walls , radically reconstructing the outermost possibilities of the built environment .
If need be , we should re-think the very planet we stand on .
[ Image : Lebbeus Woods , Havana , radically reconstructed , 1994 ] .
Of course , Woods is usually considered the avant - garde of the avant - garde , someone for whom architecture and science fiction – or urban planning and exhilarating , uncontained speculation – are all but one and the same .
His work is
Genres cross ; fiction becomes reflection ; archaeology becomes an unpredictable form of projective technology ; and even the Earth itself gains an air of the non-terrestrial .
[ Image : Lebbeus Woods , DMZ , 1988 ] .
One project by Woods , in particular , captured my imagination – and , to this day , it just floors me .
I love this thing .
In 1980 , Woods proposed a tomb for Albert Einstein – the so - called
But Woods 's proposal was n't some paltry gravestone or intricate mausoleum in hewn granite : it was an asymmetrical space station traveling on the gravitational warp and weft of infinite emptiness , passing through clouds of mutational radiation , riding electromagnetic currents into the void .
The Einstein Tomb struck me as such an ingenious solution to an otherwise unremarkable problem – how to build a tomb for an historically titanic mathematician and physicist – that I 've known who Lebbeus Woods is ever since .
[ Images : Lebbeus Woods , the city and the faults it sits on , from the San Francisco Bay Project , 1995 ] .
So when the opportunity came to talk to Lebbeus about one image that he produced nearly a decade ago , I continued with the questions ; the result is this interview , which happily coincides with the launch of Lebbeus 's own website – his first – at
[ Image : Lebbeus Woods , Havana , 1994 ; view larger ] .
In the following Q&A , then , Woods talks to BLDGBLOG about the geology of Manhattan ; the reconstruction of urban warzones ; politics , walls , and cooperative building projects in the future - perfect tense ; and the networked forces of his most recent installations .
• • •
BLDGBLOG : First , could you explain the origins of the
Lebbeus Woods :
This was one of those occasions when I got a request from a magazine – which is very rare .
In 1999 , Abitare was making a special issue on New York City , and they invited a number of architects – like Steven Holl , Rafael Viñoly , and , oh god , I do n’t recall .
Todd Williams and Billie Tsien .
Michael Sorkin. Myself .
They invited us to make some sort of comment about New York .
So I wrote a piece – probably 1000 words , 800 words – and I made the drawing .
I think the main thought I had , in speculating on the future of New York , was that , in the past , a lot of discussions had been about New York being the biggest , the greatest , the best – but that all had to do with the size of the city .
You know , the size of the skyscrapers , the size of the culture , the population .
So I commented in the article about Le Corbusier ’s infamous remark that your skyscrapers are too small .
Of course , New York dwellers thought he meant , oh , they ’re not tall enough – but what he was referring to was that they were too small in their ground plan .
His idea of the Radiant City and the Ideal City – this was in the early 30s – was based on very large footprints of buildings , separated by great distances , and , in between the buildings in his vision , were forests , parks , and so forth .
But in New York everything was cramped together because the buildings occupied such a limited ground area .
So Le Corbusier was totally misunderstood by New Yorkers who thought , oh , our buildings are n’t tall enough – we ’ve got to go higher !
Of course , he was n’t interested at all in their height – more in their plan relationship .
Remember , he ’s the guy who said , the plan is the generator .
So I was speculating on the future of the city and I said , well , obviously , compared to present and future cities , New York is not going to be able to compete in terms of size anymore .
It used to be a large city , but now it ’s a small city compared with São Paulo , Mexico City , Kuala Lumpur , or almost any Asian city of any size .
So I said maybe New York can establish a new kind of scale – and the scale I was interested in was the scale of the city to the Earth , to the planet .
I made the drawing as a demonstration of the fact that Manhattan exists , with its towers and skyscrapers , because it sits on a rock – on a granite base .
You can put all this weight in a very small area because Manhattan sits on the Earth .
Let ’s not forget that buildings sit on the Earth .
I wanted to suggest that maybe lower Manhattan – not lower downtown , but lower in the sense of below the city – could form a new relationship with the planet .
So , in lower Manhattan – is revealed , and , in the drawing , there are suggestions of inhabitation in that lower region .
[ Image : Lebbeus Woods , Lower Manhattan , 1999 , in case you missed it ; view larger ] .
So it was a romantic idea – and the drawing is very conceptual in that sense .
But the exposure of the rock base , or the underground condition of the city , completely changes the scale relationship between the city and its environment .
It ’s peeling back the surface to see what the planetary reality is .
And the new scale relationship is not about huge blockbuster buildings ; it ’s not about towers and skyscrapers .
It ’s about the relationship of the relatively small human scratchings on the surface of the earth compared to the earth itself .
I think that comes across in the drawing .
It ’s not geologically correct , I ’m sure , but the idea is there .
There are a couple of other interesting features which I ’ll just mention .
One is that the only bridge I show is the Brooklyn Bridge .
I do n’t show the Brooklyn - Battery Tunnel , for instance .
That ’s just gone .
And I do n’t show the Manhattan Bridge or the Williamsburg Bridge , which are the other two bridges on the East River .
On the Hudson side , it was interesting , because I looked carefully at the drawings – which I based on an aerial photograph of Manhattan , obviously – and the World Trade Center … something ’s going on there .
Of course , this was in 1999 , and I ’m not a prophet and I do n’t think that I have any particular telepathic or clairvoyant abilities [ laughs ] , but obviously the World Trade Center has been somehow diminished , and there are things floating in the Hudson next to it .
I ’m not sure exactly what I had in mind – it was already several years ago – except that some kind of transformation was going to happen there .
BLDGBLOG : That ’s actually one of the things I like so much about your work : you re-imagine cities and buildings and whole landscapes as if they have undergone some sort of potentially catastrophic transformation – be it a war or an earthquake , etc. – but you do n’t respond to those transformations by designing , say , new prefab refugee shelters or more durable tents .
You respond with what I ’ll call science fiction : a completely new order of things – a new way of organizing and thinking about space .
You posit something radically different than what was there before .
It ’s exciting .
Woods :
Well , I think that , for instance , in Sarajevo , I was trying to speculate on how the war could be turned around , into something that people could build the new Sarajevo on .
It was n’t about cleaning up the mess or fixing up the damage ; it was more about a transformation in the society and the politics and the economics through architecture .
I mean , it was a scenario – and , I suppose , that was the kind of movie aspect to it .
It was a “ what if ? ”
I think there ’s not enough of that thinking today in relation to cities that have been faced with sudden and dramatic – even violent – transformations , either because of natural or human causes .
But we need to be able to speculate , to create these scenarios , and to be useful in a discussion about the next move .
No one expects these ideas to be easily implemented .
It ’s not like a practical plan that you should run out and do .
But , certainly , the new scenario gives you a chance to investigate a direction .
Of course , being an architect , I ’m very interested in the specifics of that direction – you know , not just a verbal description but : this is what it might look like .
So that was the approach in Sarajevo – as well as in this drawing of Lower Manhattan , as I called it .
[ Images : Lebbeus Woods .
Future structures of the Korean demilitarized zone ( 1988 ) juxtaposed with two views of the architectonic tip of some vast flooded machine - building , from Icebergs ( 1991 ) ] .
BLDGBLOG : Part of that comes from recognizing architecture as its own kind of genre .
In other words , architecture has the ability , rivaling literature , to imagine and propose new , alternative routes out of the present moment .
So architecture is n’t just buildings , it 's a system of entirely re-imagining the world through new plans and scenarios .
Woods :
Well , let me just back up and say that architecture is a multi- disciplinary field , by definition .
But , as a multi- disciplinary field , our ideas have to be comprehensive ; we ca n’t just say : “ I ’ve got a new type of column that I think will be great for the future of architecture . ”
BLDGBLOG : [ laughs ]
Woods :
Maybe it will be great – but it ’s not enough .
I think architects – at least those inclined to understand the multi-disciplinarity and the comprehensive nature of their field – have to visualize something that embraces all these political , economic , and social changes .
As well as the technological .
As well as the spatial .
But we ’re living in a very odd time for the field .
There ’s a kind of lack of discourse about these larger issues .
People are hunkered down , looking for jobs , trying to get a building .
It ’s a low point .
I do n’t think it will stay that way .
I do n’t think that architects themselves will allow that .
After all , it ’s architects who create the field of architecture ; it ’s not society , it ’s not clients , it ’s not governments .
I mean , we architects are the ones who define what the field is about , right ?
So if there ’s a dearth of that kind of thinking at the moment , it ’s because architects have retreated – and I ’m sure a coming generation is going to say : hey , this retreat is not good .
We ’ve got to imagine more broadly .
We have to have a more comprehensive vision of what the future is .
[ Images : Lebbeus Woods , The Wall Game ] .
BLDGBLOG : In your own work – and I ’m thinking here of the Korean DMZ project or the Israeli wall - game – this “ more comprehensive vision ” of the future also involves rethinking political structures .
Engaging in society not just spatially , but politically .
Many of the buildings that you ’ve proposed are more than just buildings , in other words ; they ’re actually new forms of political organization .
Woods : Yeah .
I mean , obviously , the making of buildings is a huge investment of resources of various kinds .
Financial , as well as material , and intellectual , and emotional resources of a whole group of people get involved in a particular building project .
And any time you get a group , you ’re talking about politics .
To me politics means one thing :
How do you change your situation ?
What is the mechanism by which you change your life ?
That ’s politics .
That ’s the political question .
It ’s about negotiation , or it ’s about revolution , or it ’s about terrorism , or it ’s about careful step - by - step planning – all of this is political in nature .
It ’s about how people , when they get together , agree to change their situation .
As I wrote some years back , architecture is a political act , by nature .
It has to do with the relationships between people and how they decide to change their conditions of living .
And architecture is a prime instrument of making that change – because it has to do with building the environment they live in , and the relationships that exist in that environment .
[ Image : Lebbeus Woods , Siteline Vienna , 1998 ] .
BLDGBLOG : There ’s also the incredibly interesting possibility that a building project , once complete , will actually change the society that built it .
It ’s the idea that a building – a work of architecture – could directly catalyze a transformation , so that the society that finishes building something is not the same society that set out to build it in the first place .
The building changes them .
Woods : I love that .
I love the way you put it , and I totally agree with it .
I think , you know , architecture should not just be something that follows up on events but be a leader of events .
That ’s what you ’re saying :
That by implementing an architectural action , you actually are making a transformation in the social fabric and in the political fabric .
Architecture becomes an instigator ; it becomes an initiator .
That , of course , is what I ’ve always promoted – but it ’s the most difficult thing for people to do .
Architects say : well , it ’s my client , they wo n’t let me do this .
Or : I have to do what my client wants .
That ’s why I do n’t have any clients !
[ laughter ]
It ’s true .
Because at least I can put the ideas out there and somehow it might seep through , or filter through , to another level .
[ Images : Lebbeus Woods , Nine Reconstructed Boxes ] .
BLDGBLOG : Finally , it seems like a lot of the work you ’ve been doing for the past few years – in Vienna , especially – has been a kind of architecture without walls .
It ’s almost pure space .
In other words , instead of walls and floors and recognizable structures , you ’ve been producing networks and forces and tangles and clusters – an abstract space of energy and directions .
Is that an accurate way of looking at your recent work – and , if so , is this a purely aesthetic exploration , or is this architecture without walls meant to symbolize or communicate a larger political message ?
Woods :
Well , look – if you go back through my projects over the years , probably the least present aspect is the idea of property lines .
There are certainly boundaries – spatial boundaries – because , without them , you ca n’t create space .
But the idea of fencing off , or of compartmentalizing – or the capitalist ideal of private property – has been absent from my work over the last few years .
[ Image : Lebbeus Woods .
A drawing of tectonic faults and other subsurface tensions , from his San Francisco Bay Project , 1995 ] .
I think in my more recent work , certainly , there are still boundaries .
There are still edges .
But they are much more porous , and the property lines … [ laughs ] are even less , should we say , defined or desired .
So the more recent work – like in Vienna , as you mentioned – is harder for people to grasp .
Back in the early 90s I was confronting particular situations , and I was doing it in a kind of scenario way .
I made realistic - looking drawings of places – of situations – but now I ’ve moved into a purely architectonic mode .
I think people probably scratch their heads a little bit and say : well , what is this ?
But I ’m glad you grasp it – and I hope my comments clarify at least my aspirations .
Probably the political implication of that is something about being open – encouraging what I call the lateral movement and not the vertical movement of politics .
It ’s the definition of a space through a set of approximations or a set of vibrations or a set of energy fluctuations – and that has everything to do with living in the present .
All of those lines are in flux .
They ’re in movement , as we ourselves develop and change .

But , certainly , the new scenario gives you a chance to investigate .
Of course , being an architect , I ’m very interested in theof that direction – you know , not just a verbal description but :
So that was the approach in Sarajevo – as well as in this drawing of , as I called it . :
Part of that comes from recognizing architecture as its own kind of .
In other words , architecture has the ability , rivaling literature , to imagine and propose new , alternative routes out of the present moment .
So architecture is n’t just , it 's a system of entirely re-imagining the world through new plans and scenarios . :
Well , let me just back up and say that architecture is a multi- disciplinary field , by definition .
But , as a multi- disciplinary field , our ideas have to be comprehensive ; we ca n’t just say : “ I ’ve got a new type of column that I think will befor the future of architecture . ” : [ :
Maybe it will be great – but it ’s not enough .
I think architects – at least those inclined to understand the multi-disciplinarity and the comprehensive nature of their field – have to visualize something that embraces all these political , economic , and social changes .
As well as the technological .
As well as the spatial .
But we ’re living in a very odd time for the field .
There ’s a kind of lack of discourse about these larger issues .
People are hunkered down , looking for jobs , trying to get a building .
It ’s a low point .
I do n’t think it will stay that way .
I do n’t think that architects themselves will allow that .
After all , it ’s architects who create the field of architecture ; it ’s not society , it ’s not clients , it ’s not governments .
I mean , we architects are the ones who define what the field is about , right ?
So if there ’s a dearth of that kind of thinking at the moment , it ’s because architects have retreated – and I ’m sure a coming generation is going to say : .
We ’ve got to imagine more broadly .
We have to have a more comprehensive vision of what the future is . :
In your own work – and I ’m thinking here of the Korean DMZ project or the Israeli wall - game – this “ more comprehensive vision ” of the future also involves rethinking political structures .
Engaging in society not just spatially , but politically .
Many of the buildings that you ’ve proposed are more than just buildings , in other words ; they ’re actually new forms of political organization . :
Yeah .
I mean , obviously , the making of buildings is a huge investment of resources of various kinds .
Financial , as well as material , and intellectual , and emotional resources of a whole group of people get involved in a particular building project .
And any time you get a group , you ’re talking about politics .
To me politics means one thing :
How do you change your situation ?
What is the mechanism by which you change your life ?
That ’s politics .
That ’s the political question .
It ’s about negotiation , or it ’s about revolution , or it ’s about terrorism , or it ’s about careful step - by - step planning – all of this is political in nature .
It ’s about how people , when they get together , agree to change their situation .
As I wrote some years back , architecture is a political act , by nature .
It has to do with the relationships between people and how they decide to change their conditions of living .
And architecture is a prime instrument of making that change – because it has to do with building the environment they live in , and the relationships that exist in that environment . :
There ’s also the incredibly interesting possibility that a building project , once complete , will actually change the society that built it .
It ’s the idea that a building – a work of architecture – could directly catalyze a transformation , so that the society that finishes building something is not the same society that set out to build it in the first place .
The building changes them . : I love that .
I love the way you put it , and I totally agree with it .
I think , you know , architecture should not just be something that follows up on events but be aof events .
That ’s what you ’re saying :
That by implementing an architectural action , you actually are making a transformation in the social fabric and in the political fabric .
Architecture becomes an instigator ; it becomes an initiator .
That , of course , is what I ’ve always promoted – but it ’s the most difficult thing for people to do .
Architects say : .
Or : .
That ’s why I do n’t have any clients ! []
It ’s true .
Because at least I can put the ideas out there and somehow it might seep through , or filter through , to another level . :
Finally , it seems like a lot of the work you ’ve been doing for the past few years – in Vienna , especially – has been a kind of .
It ’s almost pure space .
In other words , instead of walls and floors and recognizable structures , you ’ve been producing networks and forces and tangles and clusters – an abstract space of energy and directions .
Is that an accurate way of looking at your recent work – and , if so , is this a purely aesthetic exploration , or is this architecture without walls meant to symbolize or communicate a larger political message ? :
Well , look – if you go back through my projects over the years , probably the least present aspect is the idea of .
There are certainly boundaries – spatial boundaries – because , without them , you ca n’t create space .
But the idea of fencing off , or of compartmentalizing – or the capitalist ideal of private property – has been absent from my work over the last few years .
I think in my more recent work , certainly , there are still boundaries .
There are still edges .
But they are much more porous , and the property lines … [ ] are even less , should we say , defined or desired .
So the more recent work – like in Vienna , as you mentioned – is harder for people to grasp .
Back in the early 90s I was confronting particular situations , and I was doing it in a kind of scenario way .
I made realistic - looking drawings of places – of situations – but now I ’ve moved into a purely architectonic mode .
I think people probably scratch their heads a little bit and say : But I ’m glad you grasp it – and I hope my comments clarify at least my aspirations .
Probably the political implication of that is something about being open – encouraging what I call the lateral movement and not the vertical movement of politics .
It ’s the definition of a space through a set of approximations or a set of vibrations or a set of energy fluctuations – and that has everything to do with living in the present .
All of those lines are in flux .
They ’re in movement , as we ourselves develop and change .
BLDGBLOG owes a huge thanks to Lebbeus Woods , not only for having this conversation but for proving over and over again that architecture can and should always be a form of radical reconstruction , unafraid to take on buildings , cities , worlds – whole planets .

British Columbia
-------
WHITEFISH - For years , backpacks crammed with cash have slipped north into Canada , followed closely by hockey bags packed with premium marijuana skating south into Montana .
A favorable exchange rate ( not long ago , one American dollar bought one and a half Canadian dollars ) made the smuggling profitable , and thus popular .
But last month , for the first time in more than 30 years , the two currencies were at par , matched in value , and today a Canadian dollar buys $ 1.10 U.S .
The financial tables have turned , and global economics have done what U.S. law enforcement could not : Capitalism has stopped the smugglers in their tracks .
Call it Marijuanomics 101 .
America borrows itself deep into the hole , ratchets up its trade deficits , buries itself beneath subprime mortgage debt , devalues its dollar with interest - rate cuts , and the currency plunges .
Meanwhile , Canada 's economy booms on oil , foreign investors turn north for stability , and the " Loonie " - Canada 's dollar , named for the bird on the coin - hits a 50 - year high .
Profits disappearing
Suddenly , it 's far more expensive to buy Canadian exports , legal or otherwise , and smuggling profits disappear .
" It 's very simple , " said Stephen Easton , professor of economics at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver , B.C. " Canadian marijuana production costs are met in Canadian dollars , and those are worth more now . "
Previously , he said , pot growers could produce a pound of potent " B.C. bud " for about $ 2,000 Canadian and , with the exchange rate , smugglers buying with U.S. currency could sell it for a hefty profit south of the border .
In those days , an American dollar in Canada was like a 50 percent discount card , and there 's nothing like a wholesale discount to bolster retail profits .
Production costs remain in the range of $ 2,000 Canadian , Easton said .
But with the currencies at par , the profit margin is completely gone , unless Montanans are willing to pay 50 percent more for the prime northern bud .
A smuggler 's risks and transport costs are no longer offset by profit .
" The upshot is that the Canadian marijuana is now less competitive against marijuana grown elsewhere , " Easton said .
" This is a cost - driven business .
With exports no longer viable , the British Columbia marijuana industry has certainly taken a hit , so to speak . "
As has green - bud availability for Big Sky pot smokers .
Although Canadian pot only accounts for perhaps 3 percent of all marijuana in the American market , it commands a strong presence in border states such as Montana .
Wide open border
" Sure , I 've known people who have brought it down and made a pretty good living , " said Bradford Moore , who owns the Heads Up pipe shop north of Kalispell .
" I wo n't deny it .
They 'd go up there , buy it on the Canadian dollar , bring it back and make a nice profit .
Let 's be honest - that Canadian border is wide open . "
As in : 5,500 miles of border land , much of it rugged and remote , and perhaps 1,000 agents sharing patrol duties .
These days , though , hardly any Canadian - grown marijuana crosses the border , because it just does n't pay .
And Easton predicts things will get worse before they get better for those on both sides of the illegal industry , because without exports , Canada 's pot crop will swamp the domestic market and prices there will plummet .
( One British Columbia grower predicts " a great glut of pot " due to the loss of export markets . )
That 's a very big deal for a province that , unofficially at least , counts marijuana exports as a major economic contributor .
Back in 2000 , Easton and his university colleagues published a study he says estimated the annual market value of British Columbia 's pot at around $ 5 billion , with perhaps 90 percent of the crop shipped south into the U.S .
" It 's huge , " he said .
" It 's a very large player , right up there with our traditional industries . "
Marijuana is illegal in Canada , but is widely tolerated and rarely prosecuted with the vigor American law enforcement musters .
From Quebec to British Columbia , large operations and small have become known for producing premium pot , carefully cloned for the best genetics and then grown under powerful lights , fed carbon dioxide and watered with special nutrient blends in hydroponic gardens .
" This is not our parents ' Mexican barnyard weed , " said Alan Middlemiss .
" This is pedigreed . "
Middlemiss owns the Holy Smoke Culture Shop and Psyche - Deli in Nelson , B.C. , and he knows a bit about quality marijuana .
The fact is , he said , much has been made of the potent B.C. bud , " but it 's a farce .
It 's no better than any bud that 's been cured and finished properly . "
( Bud refers to the sticky flower bud on female marijuana plants , which contains high amounts of delta - 9 tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC , the chemistry that makes stoners stoned . )
" Everybody grows it , " he said .
" But it 's called ' B.C. bud , ' so up here in B.C. , we get the baggage .
We get the heat . "
When DEA agents - Middlemiss calls them " ganja spies " - want to crack down somewhere , they often choose British Columbia , even though similar plants are grown throughout the United States .
The province 's big - time growers , the ones with the big - time smuggling operations , " have been killing it for the rest of us mom - and - pop growers , " he said .
That the spotlight is glaring on Middlemiss ' neighborhood was proved back in 2000 , when Time magazine announced the " world 's best pot now comes from Vancouver . "
That these latest economic changes also have caught international attention was proved last month , on Oct. 4 , when the business - news portion of National Public Radio's " Morning Edition " broke the story that Canadian pot dealers were suffering from the loss of their export business .
" Our last word in business today is ' skunk bud , ' " the reporter said in introducing the piece .
Middlemiss , for one , is glad to see the Canadian export business dry up .
He hopes it will " take some of the greed out of the business , " leaving smaller growers to water and tend and smoke without the hassles .
Because although Canada has not proved strong on prosecutions in recent years - Vancouver cafes offer smoking areas , and tourists can buy pot in paraphernalia shops - busts do occur .
Middlemiss lives in Nelson , B.C. , a town that enjoys top ranking for pot tolerance at webehigh.com , a Web site billing itself as " a travelers ' guide for getting high . "
They say pot in Nelson is " virtually legal , " and note that " public smoking is more or less OK if you 're not dumb about it . "
And yet Middlemiss can tell you all about hassles with authorities , hassles he blames on the myth of B.C. bud and the infamy of large exporters .
" We have a motto around here , and it 's called Canadian pot for Canadian lungs , " Middlemiss said .
" We do n't need the DEA blowback .
We 've got DEA helicopters over our gardens , and all this DEA money out of Washington being spent up in Vancouver .
It 's nuts . "
Also up in Vancouver is Marc Emery , the so - called " Prince of Pot , " a Canadian who for years made his living selling mail - order pot seeds .
He 's also head of the political Marijuana Party , and runs Cannabis Culture magazine .
To Canadian officials , he 's a businessman .
To U.S. law enforcement , he 's a fugitive for selling seeds across the border .
Emery , unlike Easton and Middlemiss , believes Canada 's booming oil fields have pumped enough dollars into enough pockets that the domestic demand can , for now , absorb the homegrown pot supply , thereby keeping prices high despite the lost export market .
" We have a very strong economy here , " Emery said .
" It 's just like a bull running through a china shop - this economy is on the run . "
But whether Canada has enough smokers to puff up this season 's entire crop - - it 's harvest time in Nelson right now - all agree on one thing : Exports have ceased , Montana is dry , and with California growers located so far away , the stage is set for a homegrown bonanza under the Big Sky .
" At this point , you might as well grow it locally , " said Moore , at Kalispell 's Heads Up .
" It 's not worth the risk to smuggle it down anymore , so people will start their own operations .
It 's simple supply - and - demand economics . "
During the last economic recession , local busts of grow operations went way up , he said , as people turned to pot to pay bills , meet mortgage payments and feed the family .
" What 's a better way of doing that than plugging in a light ? "
Moore said .
" Even in the good times , " he said , " people around here can't afford to buy a house .
If the economy takes a dive , well , it 's always easy to grow your own . "
According to Middlemiss , there 's a renaissance of sorts in new technology for small , compact , low - profile homegrown operations .
Emery likewise looks for the signs of economic fallout not on Wall Street but on Main Street , where the pot changes hands every day .
The signs , he said , are everywhere .
Three years ago , at least one person was caught smuggling marijuana south into the U.S. almost every day , he said .
Now , whole months go by without a substantial border bust .
But do n't forget the struggling peso , which down on the U.S. - Mexico border may soon be helping to fill the B.C. bud gap - albeit without the pedigree .
" They 're all about quantity down there , " Middlemiss said .
" We 're about the quality . "

( Cannabis - Canada )
J. E. Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes
Chicago Tribune
March 21 , 2008
Five years ago , as the Bush administration was preparing to attack Iraq , it claimed that the war would cost $ 50 billion to $ 60 billion .
We are now spending for military operations alone that amount every three months — and that sum does not even include future costs , such as disability and health benefits for returning troops .
We estimate conservatively that by the time the war is over , it will have cost America in excess of $ 3 trillion , an amount so vast it is hard to fathom .
The only way to grasp such numbers is to translate them into what a day or an hour of fighting costs , what economists refer to as the opportunity costs , what else we might have purchased .
Many are worried about China ’s growing influence in Africa .
But what we spend in aid to Africa amounts to but 10 days of upfront costs of fighting in Iraq .
President Bush talked about the enormous financial problems facing Social Security , saying that drastic reforms — even privatization — were needed .
Well , for one - sixth of the cost of an Iraq war , one could put Social Security on firm financial footing for at least the next 50 to 75 years .
War is always expensive , but this war is particularly expensive .
It is now the nation ’s second longest ( after Vietnam ) and the second costliest ( after the all - encompassing World War II ) .
The cost per troop , even adjusted for inflation , is some eight times greater than earlier wars .
Many of these costs arise because the administration tried to persuade the American people that they could have a war for free .
The government kept upfront costs down , not spending money on , for instance , vehicles that would have protected our troops against improvised explosive devices , or IEDs , which have led to so many deaths and disabilities , even after they were urgently requested .
This war is distinctive in the huge number of injuries , some 15 times the number of fatalities — a tribute to modern medicine , but an unfunded liability in excess of $ 600 billion , costs that we will be paying for decades .
( The administration has done all it can to hide these numbers ; working through veterans groups , we had to use the Freedom of Information Act to get the full scope of the injuries . )
This war relied more on National Guards , which are intended to protect us against domestic emergencies like Hurricane Katrina , not to fight foreign ventures .
This war has been privatized more than any other war .
The contractors have done well — just look at Halliburton Co. ’s share prices , which almost tripled in value .
But these strategies , too , have been penny - wise and pound - foolish .

Two films planned , with first film scheduled for Summer 2009 release
The Hollywood Reporter and Variety entertainment trade periodicals both report that Warner Brothers and Appian Way , the production company of actor Leonardo DiCaprio ( Titanic , The Aviator ) , will adapt Katsuhiro Otomo 's Akira manga into two live - action films .
Each film will cover three volumes of the renowned science - fiction manga about a governmental genetic project and a teenager 's attempt to save a fellow biker gang member .
The manga set in Neo - Tokyo , a city rebuilt after being destroyed in a mysterious explosion .
Otomo directed his own animated film adaptation that premiered on July 16 , 1988 — the same day that the story has the fictional Tokyo being destroyed .
The first live - action film is scheduled for release in the summer of 2009 and will move the story 's setting to " ' New Manhattan , ' a city rebuilt after being destroyed 31 years ago . "
Ireland 's Ruairi Robinson will be making his feature directorial debut with this project , and Gary Whitta ( Book of Eli ) is writing a script .
Warner Brothers once had the film rights for Akira before , but Executive Vice - President Greg Silverman ( 300 , Batman Begins ) had to re-acquire them from Kodansha after a round of pitched bidding that reached seven figures .
Mad Chance 's Andrew Lazar , DiCaprio , and Appian Way 's Jennifer Davisson will produce .
No announcement has been made regarding the cast .
Update :
The free version of Hollywood Reporter 's article is now active , and more information about the original manga and anime adaptation have been added .
Two new articles provide further evidence that we have hugely underestimated the number of species with which we share our planet .
Today sophisticated genetic techniques mean that superficially identical animals previously classed as members of a single species , including the frogs and giraffes in these studies , could in fact come from several distinct ' cryptic ' species .
In the Upper Amazon , Kathryn Elmer and Stephen Lougheed working at Queen 's University , Kingston , Canada teamed up with José Dávila from Instituto de Investigación en Recursos Cinegéticos , Cuidad Real , Spain to investigate the terrestrial leaflitter frog ( Eleutherodactylus ockendeni ) at 13 locations across Ecuador .
Looking at the frogs ' mitochondrial and nuclear DNA , the researchers found three distinct species , which look very much alike .
These species have distinct geographic distributions , but these do n't correspond to modern landscape barriers .
Coupled with phylogenetic analyses , this suggests they diverged before the Ecuadorean Andes arose , in the Miocene period over 5.3 million years ago .
" Our research coupled with other studies suggests that species richness in the upper Amazon is drastically underestimated by current inventories based on morphospecies , " say the authors .
And in Africa , an interdisciplinary team from the University of California , Los Angeles , Omaha 's Henry Doorly Zoo , and the Mpala Research Centre in Kenya has found that there may be more to the giraffe than meets the eye , too .
Their analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA shows at least six genealogically distinct lineages of giraffe in Africa , with little evidence of interbreeding between them .
Further divisions within these groups mean that in total the researchers have spotted 11 genetically distinct populations .
" Such extreme genetic subdivision within a large vertebrate with high dispersal capabilities is unprecedented and exceeds that of any other large African mammal , " says graduate student David Brown , first author of the study .
The researchers estimate that the giraffe populations they surveyed have been genetically distinct for between 0.13 and 1.62 million years .
The findings have serious implications for giraffe conservation because some among these subgroups have as few as 100 members , making them highly endangered -- if not yet officially recognised -- species .

Chatham , ON 1 recommendation JGROCKY Premium Member Update on throttling issue ...
Ok ...
Here 's the deal ...
They 're now openly acknowledging that they are rolling out a full throttling process .
They plan to have things fully throttled by April 7th .
All BT and P2P traffic will be affected .
They claim they are allowed to do so according to their Terms and Services under the Fair Usage Policy in the tariffed contracts ...
We 'll be looking into this shortly .
The meeting was with Sales and Product Management .
They will be preparing a formal letter before end of week .
In the meantime , we ( many other ISPs ) are going to prepare as well ...
I guess the high road is the path taken in this case .
Spread the word one and all as this topic needs to reach every level possible ...
There 's now officially an issue and action must be taken by all if we 're to rectify things ...

@teksavvy.com anonguy Anon so JUST bt and p2p traffic will be affected ?

Gotta love that we all leave Bell to send a message and now they screw us again ..
I cannot even begin to comprehend how Bell feels they are justified .
It may not have been the objective but Bit Torrent and P2P are integral parts of the internet today and no amount of throttling is ever going to change that .
Do these companies ( Bell , Rogers , Comcast , etc ) not realize that they are fighting a losing battle ?
I 'm glad to see that profits still remain the top priority over any quality of service for these huge corporations .

Are these contracts available on the net , they should be there is not much information on it just rules and terms i am sure the contract does n't say dont share it with others or let others read it .
Mind posting a copy ?
or parts of it .
There might be some lawyers on these threads or people related to some that would n't mind a stab at it .
I dont believe for a second that they have such authority though to do that to others peoples bandwitdh .
Sounds very fishy to me and a lot of other people .
The fillings should be implemented that these proceedings took without notice , and started the implemantation to its wholesellers without notification .
This at hand might be a violation , in the aspect that if they did this over the holiday weekend , then they had enough time to send out notification to their wholesellers / resellers / people that lease the lines etc .
They dont have to notify the user ( us ) but they should OF notified the buyers / etc .
So under their Terms and Services under the Fair Usage Policy in the tariffed contracts they claim that they can do this ?
all this time and now they decide to do it ?

That is ridiculous .
I 'm so glad I purchased Teksavvy , I plan on cancelling Bell , maybe they will put me on interleave again like they did when I purchased Teksavvy .
I need to convince my parents that Bell Satellite and Home Phone need to go , but it will take some convincing .
I honestly cannot see any good in people that just decide to abuse their power the way Bell does .
I 'll be sure to spread the word .

Something to look at is whether Bell is in breach of contract .
Presumably they are obligated to provide TSI ( and the other ISPs ) access to your clients via Bell 's existing POTS infrastructure .
It seems to me that by throttling they are interfering with this access and thus may be in breach of contract .

I highly doubt that throttling will be removed in the next few months unless there is a court order or some kind of government agency involved .
Obviously Bell people are n't stupid I am sure they are well planned for this .
If this is what they want we should get all dsl users together , not just Teksavvy .

So much for the ' play nice with Bell ' strategy .
Now that Bell sees Teksavvy ( et al ) as an actual competitor , there will be no high road .
There never is when profits come into the picture .
Strength in numbers , Rocky .
If your independent ISP assocation was an afternoon coffee klatsch before , it needs to grow some teeth now .
I 'd suggest that the first legal route is that the ILEC has no right to discriminate other people 's ( and companies ' ) net traffic .
Another would be to buy a few shares of BCE and create commotions at shareholder 's meetings , and make the teachers aware that they are buying into the receiving end of an open - ended ( class - action ? ) lawsuit .

Re : Update on throttling issue ...
Every major technology that got released got monopolized by a few firms before the Government got involved to make it fair for the consumer .
Without the Gov'ts help on this , Bell will not budge .
We need to somehow make the Canadian govt care about their consumers .
If the CRTC is not responsible for Bandwidth , then who is .
Almost every Canadian citizen has internet now and I find it amazing that there is n't an entity that protects the avg .

I do n't buy that it 's just BT and P2P affected ....
VoIP is also an issue , as I notice around the same time ( 4 pm to 2 am ) my VoIP acts up ..
This is a direct anti-competitive move .
I 've already filed complaints with the CRTC and Competition bureau .
The issue is , who you going to run to ..
This basically has made EVERY provider in Ontario and Quebec Throttled !
SHAME ON Bell .
My condo was to move to Expressvu and I 'm thinking maybe I just might refuse access to them .
( I do n't watch much tv anyhow )

What timing !
Gotta love the timing .
Just as Bell comes out with throttling across the board , the CBC begins to move forward with P2P distribution .
Are you listening CRTC !?!?

Re : Update on throttling issue ...
They throttle everything ( whole connection ) if they detect BT / P2P .
They 're also apparently misdetecting other stuff and throttling based on that .
Are you doing anything else with your connection when your VoIP acts up ?

If every one of their resellers ' put their foot down ( if they dare ) ' do n't they HAVE to do something - or they should for the good of themselves ( since thats what they only care about )

i'd Actually love to see portions of the contracts etc
lets see what is going on , if we are going to be paying for something we should at least know what is affecting us
More than 2.5 million people have fled their homes in Darfur More than 50,000 people are suffering in the latest cycle of violence in Sudan 's West Darfur region , says the UN humanitarian affairs agency , Ocha .
" Some of their homes were burnt to the ground .
They have absolutely nothing left , " said Ocha 's Orla Clinton .
Local residents say government aid raids over the last three weeks have been followed by militia raids .
China 's envoy to Darfur has urged Sudan to accept the full deployment of a UN - African Union peacekeeping force .
In a rare public rebuke to Khartoum , visiting envoy Liu Guijin said it should " co-operate better with the international community " on the force , according to a report by Chinese official news agency Xinhua .
The force began deploying in January , but still lacks most of the 26,000 personnel planned for the mission - due in part to Sudanese objections concerning the international composition of the force .
China has come under increasing pressure to use its influence with Sudan to end the fighting .
' Helicopter down '
Ms Clinton said up to an estimated 58,000 civilians in the areas of West Darfur attacked over the last few weeks were particularly vulnerable .
" They are dependent on humanitarian aid , they are at risk of further attacks , and they are in desperate need of further protection , " she told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
She said she was particularly concerned about civilians in the Jebel Moun area affected by the latest aerial bombardments .
The Sudanese army lost a helicopter close to the West Darfur capital , Geneina , on Sunday , but the cause of the incident is disputed .
A spokesman for the rebel Justice and Equality Movement ( Jem ) told Reuters it had downed the helicopter , but the army says the accident was due to a faulty engine .
Envoy 's rebuke Meanwhile , the Sudanese defence minister said the army had destroyed nine rebel camps in recent military operations in West Darfur .
Abdel Rahim Mohammed Husein told the official Suna news agency the army now " totally controls " the region including Salia , Jebel Sujuj , Sirba and Jebel Moun .
Mr Liu used unusually frank language Mr Liu began a five - day visit to Sudan on Sunday , and is set to travel to Darfur on Tuesday , the fifth anniversary of the start of the conflict which has left 200,000 people dead and 2.5 million homeless .
In his comments to Xinhua , Mr Liu said deploying the peacekeeping operation and resolving the Darfur issue required " the joint efforts of all sides .
" First , the Sudan government should co-operate better with the international community and demonstrate greater flexibility on some technical issues .
Next , anti-government organisations in the Darfur region should return to the negotiating table . "
China has long had strong trade and military links with Khartoum , which is accused of backing militias that have raped and murdered civilians in Darfur - accusations it denies .
But Beijing is keen to show it is playing a positive role in the region , says the BBC's Amber Henshaw in Khartoum .
Mr Liu said Sudan only bought 8 % of its weapons from China and said if China stopped selling weapons , they could easily be purchased from other countries .
Steven Spielberg recently pulled out as artistic adviser to the Beijing Olympics , saying China was not doing enough to end the humanitarian crisis in the troubled Sudanese region .

What are these ?
Feb. 20 , 2008  -- Forget Botox parties and sex toy soirees .
A new and controversial type of get - together has some women claiming enhanced sexual pleasure — it also has some sex experts worried that these women could be putting their health at risk .
The gathering in question is called a G - shot party .
And the women in attendance hope that a doctor can help to increase their sensitivity during sex through a special injection on the area on the inside front wall of the vagina , known as the G spot .
Heather Greene , who requested her real name not be used , is a 42 - year - old Los Angeles woman who attended a G - shot party Feb. 12 .
" When I first heard about it , I just started laughing hysterically because it was the funniest thing I had ever heard of , " Greene said .
" It was just so outrageous . "
But she says despite the initial humor , the shot gave her sex life a serious boost .
" There is no way you can miss where the G spot is now , " she said .
" That was kind of shocking to me . "
It 's precisely the type of review that David Matlock , gynecologist and innovator of the technique , hopes to achieve through the gatherings , which he says always occur at a doctor 's office .
" Our study showed that 87 percent of women reported enhanced sexual arousal because of an enhanced G spot , " he said .
" What we 're doing is basically talking to women in a small group about this procedure , with individual exams and procedures in the office . "
But the G shot is not a risk - free procedure .
And a number of sexual health experts say that until there is more research behind the techniques , women should be wary of the injection .
" This is a medical procedure , it is invasive , it involves inserting something into the vagina , it has never been tested , and it has never been approved by the FDA [ Food and Drug Administration ] , " said Jennifer Bass , director of communications for the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex , Gender and Reproduction in Bloomington , Ind .
She added that she is concerned the promotion and advertisement of the technique may drive women to seek it out and ignore the potential health risks .
" This is n't a sex toy we 're talking about here , " she said .
" I would hope that women take a different approach and have a sex toy party rather than one involving a medical procedure . "
Is It Safe ?
If there is any doubt that the procedure has its potential risks , one need only look at the consent form that all women must sign before having the procedure performed .
The two - page document lists 68 risks associated with the procedure , ranging from " No effect at all " to " Scar formation " and " Sexual dysfunction . "
But thus far , Matlock said , there have been no such injuries of which he is aware .
Plus , he said , he only teaches the technique to trained gynecologists , plastic surgeons and urologists .
And , he maintains , the simplicity of the procedure lends itself to safe results .
" First we numb the area with lidocaine using a very small needle that many patients do n't even feel , " he said .
" Then we inject right under the mucosa in the area of the G spot with collagen to augment it . "
And Matlock added that collagen injection into the vaginal area for medical purposes has been performed since the 1940s , mainly for the treatment of urinary incontinence .
But using the filler to pump up the G spot is a much newer indication .
And a study that documents the safety and efficacy of the procedure has yet to appear in a peer - reviewed medical journal .
Still , there are many women who are willing to give it a try .
And since the G shot is a lunchtime procedure , with women entering the doctors ' office and leaving 15 minutes later , women can get it done quickly and discreetly .
Adding to the discreet nature of the procedure , recovery time from the procedure is on the scale of hours according to the G - shot Web site .
Greene recalled that her experience was not an unpleasant one .
" The only thing I felt was the needle with the anesthetic going in , and I felt a tiny pinch .
I 've had gynecological exams that were much more uncomfortable . "
And while she says she recalls seeing the laundry list of potential risks , when asked Greene could name one of them .
But therein may lie the danger .
Bass said she worries that the group atmosphere of a G - shot party could cause women to ignore the potential risks of the procedure .
" Whenever you insert anything into the body without knowing what the risks or the long - term consequences are , you 're putting yourself in danger , " she said .
The Propriety of a Party
But Matlock said just because the procedure is being offered at a party does not make it any more dangerous .
And he added that the guidelines of the party are tightly controlled in order to maintain a professional treatment atmosphere .
" In a Botox party , you 're doing it at a home .
The attendees drink alcohol and so on , " he said .
" The G - shot party is done in the doctor 's office , with a group of women , and giving them education on the procedure together . "
" There is no alcohol , no wine , no cocktails , " Matlock said , adding that liquid refreshment is limited to coffee and soft drinks .
Not all sexuality experts said such parties were an altogether bad idea .
Judy Kuriansky , sex therapist and author of " The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Tantric Sex , " said there are pros and cons to the " parties " to discuss the procedure .
" This is like an outgrowth of the early consciousness - raising groups that women had 30 years ago , " she said , citing that such gatherings had the positive effect of teaching women about their own sexual arousal and responses .
But she said she fears the popularity of the procedure is a product of an almost competitive view of sexuality , in which women are pressured to perform .
" This is ripe for exploitation and even more pressure on women , " she said .
Donnica Moore , an obstetrician / gynecologist and president of the Sapphire Women 's Health Group , suggested a party of a different kind might be more productive .
" How about we have a party that invites male partners to come and be instructed on where the location of the G spot is ? " she said .
" While we 're at it , we can also show them how to locate the clitoris .
" Female sexual satisfaction is based a lot more on what 's going on in the relationship than what 's going on in or around the G spot . "
Quick Procedure , No Quick Fix
Greene said she does not yet know whether she will opt for a top - up procedure in the coming months .
Part of her decision may be based on the costs ; a single shot of the filler used in the procedure costs $ 1,850 , while a double shot — which Greene opted for — runs $ 2,500 .
And it 's safe to say that the controversy over the offering will not have died down before it is time for her to make her decision .
Matlock said he is not surprised that the method is controversial .
But he said the availability of such procedures is a boon for many women who may not be getting the experience they desire from sex .
" Women have been completely left behind , " he said .
" When I talk about laser vaginal rejuvenation for women , yeah , there 's controversy .
But look it up ; there are over 200 medical devices for male impotence . "
Still , Kuriansky said the doctor 's office may not be the first place for women to look for solutions to their sexual problems .
" If you enlarge this area , would it be possible that you would also want more stimulation in another area ?
What are you going to do , start injecting that area too ? " she said .
" The take - home point is for women to feel OK about their bodies and their responses .
That is essential before putting pressure on yourself and starting to look to medical procedures . "
Bass agreed .
" We 're always looking for quick fixes for lots of things in our lives , and sexuality is very complicated .
It may take more than a shot to create a satisfactory sex life . "
Anti-social behaviour was revealed by DNA fingerprinting of ant colonies
But new research suggests that their colonies are actually hotbeds of devious , selfish and corrupt behaviour .
And it is the royal family - or male ants carrying a so - called " royal " gene - that are largely to blame .
Scientists have discovered that some males pass the gene on selectively , to ensure that their offspring become reproductive queens , not mere workers .
The research , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , used DNA fingerprinting on five colonies of leaf - cutting ants .
The rarity of the royal lines is actually an evolutionary strategy by the cheats , to escape suppression by the altruistic masses that they exploit
Dr Bill Hughes , Leeds University
This revealed that a larva 's chances of becoming queen depended largely on who its father was .
Previously scientists were adamant that the species was a model of democracy and social co-operation .
It had been thought that nurture was the driving force in selecting royalty - some larvae were fed certain foods to prompt their development into queens .
But now it seems those who have been passed the royal gene have an unfair advantage over the rest .
Dr Bill Hughes , from the University of Leeds , who led the research , said : " The core principle of social societies is they should be egalitarian .
We 've found this is n't always the case , and that some of the males are cheating .
There is a genetic influence on royalty . "
Genes will help decide whether these ants are royals , or workers
The royal genetic lines are rare in each colony , leading the scientists to think that the ants cunningly spread their sperm around different colonies , so that the unfair advantage to their offspring is not spotted .
If too many larvae became queens , the imbalance could be noticed by the " commoner " worker ants , who might then turn on their leaders .
" When studying social insects like ants and bees , " said Dr Hughes , " it 's often the co-operative aspect of their society that first stands out . "
" However , when you look more deeply , you can see there is conflict and cheating - and obviously human society is also a prime example of this .
It was thought ants were an exception , but our genetic analysis has shown that their society is also rife with corruption - and it 's royal corruption at that . "
Leon recently posted a link to a great blog entry on rediscovering Logo .
You know , Logo -- the one with the turtle .
I remember being exposed to Logo way back in high school .
All I recall about Logo is the turtle graphics , and the primitive digital Etch - a - Sketch drawings you could create with it .
What I did n't realize is that Logo is " an easier to read adaptation of the Lisp language .. [ with ] significant facilities for handling lists , files , I/O , and recursion " , at least if the Wikipedia entry on Logo is to be believed .
Although I was eternally fascinated with programming , Logo held no interest for me .
It seemed like a toy language , only useful for silly little graphical tricks and stunts with the turtle .
But apparently there was a real language lurking underneath all that turtle graphics stuff .
Brian Harvey is a Berkeley professor who not only co-wrote Berkeley Lisp , but authored three books that , amazingly , teach the whole of computer science using nothing but Logo .
Computer Science Logo Style : Symbolic Computing
concentrates on natural language processing rather than the graphics most people associate with Logo .

discussions of more advanced Logo features alternate with sample projects using those features , with commentary on the structure and style of each .
Computer Science Logo Style : Beyond Programming
a brief introduction to six college - level computer science topics .
If you have no time to skim the material , and you 're still convinced Logo is a graphics language for little kids , check out a sample Logo program that Brian put together to impress us .
I 'm impressed , anyway .
Logo is much more than the thin wrapper over turtle graphics I thought it was in 1986 .
But turtle graphics still -- how shall I put this ?
-- suck .
I took two new books with me over the holiday vacation , and both deal with something akin to the spiritual successor to Logo -- the Processing environment .
Both Processing : A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists and Visualizing Data paint a picture of the Processing environment that strongly reminds me of Logo .
But Processing does n't offer up a new Lisp syntax -- it sticks with good old - fashioned Java .
If we did n't care about speed , it might make sense to use Python , Ruby , or many other scripting languages .
That is especially true on the education side .
If we did n't care about making a transition to more advanced languages , we 'd probably avoid a C++ or Java - style syntax .
But Java is a nice starting point for a sketching language because it's far more forgiving than C/C++ and also allows users to export sketches for distribution via the Web .
The focus of the Processing environment is squarely on learning while doing , which is definitely one of the tenets of Logo .
If you 're already familiar with programming , it 's important to understand how Processing differs from other development environments and languages .
The Processing project encourages a style of work that builds code quickly , understanding that either the code will be used as a quick sketch or that ideas are being tested before developing a final project .
This could be misconstrued as software engineering heresy .
Perhaps we 're not far from " hacking " , but this is more appropriate for the roles in which Processing is used .
Why force students or casual programmers to learn about graphics contexts , threading , and event handling methods before they can show something on the screen that interacts with the mouse ?
The same goes for advanced developers : why should they always need to start with the same two pages of code whenever they begin a project ?
In another scenario , if you 're doing scientific visualization , the ability to try things out quickly is a far higher priority than sophisticated code structure .
Usually you do n't know what the outcome will be , so you might build something one week to try an initial hypothesis and build something new the next week based on what was learned in the first week .
It 's an admirable philosophy , and it 's especially appropriate for a domain - specific language .
If you 're interested in graphics and visualization -- if you 're truly looking for a modern Logo -- leave the turtles behind and check out Processing instead .
A University of Copenhagen team has identified the gene which around 6-10,000 years ago underwent a genetic mutation in one individual who eventually gave rise to all blue - eyed people .
Professor Eiberg from the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine began his research in 1996 , when he " first implicated the OCA2 gene as being responsible for eye colour " , as ScienceDaily puts it .
Over the next decade , he and his colleagues " examined mitochondrial DNA and compared the eye colour of blue - eyed individuals " in countries including Denmark , Jordan and Turkey .
Eiberg explained : “ Originally , we all had brown eyes .
But a genetic mutation affecting the OCA2 gene in our chromosomes resulted in the creation of a ' switch ' , which literally ' turned off ' the ability to produce brown eyes . "
Specifically , ScienceDaily explains , the OCA2 gene " codes for the so - called P protein , which is involved in the production of melanin " .
The “ switch ” , located in the gene adjacent to OCA2 , does n't turn off the gene entirely , but " limits its action to reducing the production of melanin in the iris " , thus “ diluting ” brown eyes to blue .
That the switch does n't entirely disable the OCA2 gene is significant , because a complete shut - down of melanin production would result in albinism .
The proof that all blue - eyed people have a common ancestor comes from the fact that whereas eye colours ranging from brown to green are caused by relatively large differences in the amount of melanin in the iris , controlled by " considerable individual variation " in the area of the DNA responsible for melanin production , the variation in iris melanin levels across all blue - eyed individuals is very small .
Eiberg elaborated : “ From this we can conclude that all blue - eyed individuals are linked to the same ancestor .
They have all inherited the same switch at exactly the same spot in their DNA . ”
Eiberg noted that the blue eyes mutation is neither " positive nor negative " , since it does n't affect chances of survival .
He concluded : " It simply shows that nature is constantly shuffling the human genome , creating a genetic cocktail of human chromosomes and trying out different changes as it does so . ” ®

The makers of the erectile dysfunction product popularized by the " Smiling Bob " ads will pay $ 2.5 million and provide consumers restitution to settle a multi-state enforcement action that alleges the defendants made unsubstantiated claims about dietary supplements ' effectiveness and automatically billed consumers for products they never requested .
" Smiling Bob may have been happy , but many customers were not , " said California Attorney General Bill Lockyer .
" The defendants violated consumer protection laws that rest on a simple principle : businesses must deal with people fairly and honestly .
This settlement will prevent further violations and compensate consumers harmed by the defendants ' practices . "
Steve Warshak of Cincinnati , Ohio and five dietary supplement firms he owns entered the settlement with Lockyer , and the Attorneys General of 17 other states and Washington D.C .
The defendant companies include Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals , Inc. ( Berkeley ) and four subsidiaries : Boland Naturals , Inc. ; Lifekey , Inc. ; Wagner Nutraceuticals , Inc. ; and Warner Health Care , Inc .
All five companies operate out of the same location in Cincinnati , Ohio .
The states ' complaints allege the defendants violated state laws prohibiting false or deceptive advertising and unfair business practices .
The Attorneys General allege the defendants , in their advertisements , made claims about the effectiveness of their products that were not supported by reliable , competent scientific evidence .
The defendants made such unsubstantiated claims about more than 10 of their products , including Enzyte , the erectile dysfunction pill used by Smiling Bob .
The defendants ' ads claimed Enzyte would improve male sexual function and performance and give them firmer , fuller - feeling erections .
The companies ' other dietary supplements include Altovis , Avlimil , Avlimil Complete , Dromias , Mioplex , Ogoplex , Numovil , Pinadol , Prulato , Rogisen , Rovicid , Suvaril , Nuproxi and Rudofil .
" Free " Trials
The Attorneys General further allege the defendants deceived consumers in marketing " free " 30 - day trial orders of dietary supplement pills .
The defendants failed to tell consumers that if they accepted the offer , they would receive , and be automatically billed for , additional shipments .
Then , the defendants made it difficult for consumers to cancel shipments or obtain a refund , according to the Attorneys General .
The settlement requires the defendants to provide restitution to all consumers who have unresolved complaints on file with Attorney Generals ' offices , the Better Business Bureau or Berkeley on the date the settlement is filed with the court .
Additionally , the defendants must pay restitution to all consumers who file complaints with Attorney Generals ' offices , the Better Business Bureau or Berkeley within 90 days after the settlement is filed .
To protect consumers from future violations , the settlement mandates reforms of the defendants ' business practices .
Under these " injunctive relief " provisions , the defendants must :
• Stop using the word " free " in advertising , unless all the terms and conditions related to the " free " offer are disclosed to the consumer and comply with applicable state and federal laws .
• Stop making health claims they cannot support with scientific evidence .
• Make disclosures to consumers prior to sale about products the companies will deliver as part of a " negative option feature " or membership , and about refunds and guarantee procedures .
• Record all telemarketing calls and retain them for one year .
Aside from the restitution , the settlement requires the defendants to pay the states $ 2.5 million to cover their investigation and litigation costs .
The defendants also will have to pay the states a $ 2.5 million civil penalty if they fail to comply with the injunctive relief provisions , or fail to pay the $ 2..5 million in cost reimbursement .
The settling jurisdictions include : Arkansas , California , Florida , Illinois , Kansas , Mississippi , Missouri , Montana , North Carolina , Ohio , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Vermont , Virginia , Washington , Wisconsin and Washington D.C .
Customers of the defendant companies may file a complaint with their state 's attorney general .

An Indian Approximation of Pi
Here 's a riddle recently e-mailed to me by someone named Narayanaswamy in New Dehli , India :
Question : Place four eights ( and no other numbers ) in a formula that approximates pi .
For bonus points , break the formula down to yield the same approxmation using seven twos .
Answer : One of Ramanujan 's modular functions yields the following in its first term :
8.88 / sqrt ( 8 ) .
Bonus answer : ( 2.22+2.22 ) /sqrt ( 2 )

Pi and the Length of Rivers
From Fermat 's Enigma , by Simon Singh
" Professor Hans - Henrik Stolum , an earth scientist at Cambridge University has calculated the ratio between the actual length of rivers from source to mouth and their direct length as the crow flies .
Although the ratio varies from river to river , the average value is slightly greater than 3 , that is to say that the actual length is roughly three times greater than the direct distance .
In fact the ratio is approximately 3.14 , which is close to the value of the number pi ...
The ratio of pi is most commonly found for rivers flowing across very gently sloping planes , such as those found in Brazil or the Siberian tundra . "
Barbier 's Theorem
If you put a circle between two lines and rotate it , it always has the same width , right ?
There are other shapes that do this , too .
For instance , take an equalateral triangle and draw 3 arcs from each corner to the other , with the center at the third corner .
The resulting shape is called a Reulaux triangle , and it is a curve of constant width .
That is , as you rotate it , it always retains the same width .
Barbier 's
Theorem states that all curves of a constant width have the same perimeter : multiply the constant width by pi .
For a circle , you get the circumference by multiplying the diameter of the circle by pi .
In a Reuleaux triangle , you would multiply the length of one side of the original triangle .
Thanks to Professor Millie Johnson at Western Washington University for this one !
See this page for more information on Reulaux triangles , including some great photos of two British coins based on the shape .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgqbCq_sxmoWhy did humans and chimpanzees diverge so sharply on the primate family tree ?
Because of our diets , say German anthropologists .
In a study published yesterday in Public Library of Science ONE , a team of Max Planck Institute researchers compared gene expression in three groups of mice – one given a cafeteria - style human diet , another given the fruits and veggies consumed by chimps in zoos , and the last given McDonald 's takeout .
The chimpanzee diet produced thousands of changes in gene expression , especially in the mice 's livers .
The same genes have been observed to differ between humans and chimps , who are otherwise nearly 99 percent identical at the DNA level .
If human and chimp diets triggered such changes in mice , figured the researchers , maybe a few million years of eating well are the reason why people are n't still sucking termites off sticks .
" Some have proposed that it was our high - energy , high - protein and cooked diet that enabled us to fuel our big brains during our evolution , " said study co-author Mehmet Somel .
It 's an interesting proposition – but how much can we really infer about primates by giving our food to mice ?
I posed the question to
Somel .
" Mice and rats have been used to study dietary effects before , but when starting the experiment , we were n't sure whether the effects of different diets in mice would be of any relevance to human and chimpanzee differences , " he said .
" However , we could n't have conducted the same experiment on humans and chimpanzees .
Consuming each other 's diet could be detrimental to both species , and then , it is not really possible to measure brain or liver gene expression from live tissue .
So the mouse experiment was worth a try .
And in the end , we did get a positive result in liver .
This was one of the most interesting points in itself : that mice can be used to analyse human and chimpanzee differences . "
Note :
As an aside , Somel noted that the McDonald 's diet correlated with a slight downtick in brain gene expression – too small to be statistically significant , but tantalizing in light of other findings suggesting that diets high in saturated fats and refined sugars are
neurologically damaging .

Late last year , we tested a prerelease of the software development kit for Google 's Linux - based Android mobile phone operating system .
Although we saw a lot of potential in the platform , there were a number of serious flaws in both the software and the underlying development process .
Both have seen noteworthy improvement since our original tests .
The developers announced the availability of m5 - rc14 this week , a new Android prerelease that addresses many issues and brings a significant user interface overhaul to the operating system .
I put the new version of the SDK and Eclipse plug - in to the test on my Ubuntu desktop computer to see how it compares to the version that we tested in December .
As we noted in our previous review , one of the significant strengths of Android in the area of third - party development is the ease of installing the SDK .
That advantage has been retained , but I ran into a minor snag with dependencies for the Android Eclipse plug - in .
Ubuntu 7.10 users who wish to use the Android plug - in might need to download the latest version of Eclipse in order to do so .
If you have a standard version of Eclipse , the installation process for Android and the plug - in is relatively straightforward and can be done in a matter of minutes .
Twittering away on Android
My first test after installing the new SDK was attempting to compile and run the experimental Twitter client that I developed for my previous article .
This initially failed because of alterations to the Android XML manifest file format , but it was very easy to make the requisite changes .
You can refer to the Android manifest documentation page to see how the current manifest file should look .
In the source code for the program itself , the only element of the Android API used by my Twitter client that no longer works is the now - defunct Emboldened Span object .
I simply changed it to a StyleSpan object with a Typeface .
BOLD paramater .
All things considered , it was n't all that painful to get my simple application working with the new version of the SDK , but developers with more complex projects might have a different experience .
Google 's documentation includes an overview of the API changes between the m3 and m5 releases .
In general , the documentation seems to be a bit better all across the board .
Squashing bugs and polishing the UI
In our previous article about Android , we voiced sharp criticism of Google for failing to provide a public bug tracking system , an omission that greatly impeded the process of providing feedback .
Google finally resolved that problem last month when it announced that it would be using the issue tracker at the Android code.google.com page .
This is a very positive sign that Google is taking the needs of the Android third - party developer community more seriously .
The user interface of the Android platform also got a big boost with this release .
The home screen menu system is a bit more finger - friendly now and still retains solid usability with navigation buttons .
We noted in our previous article that Android has a highly hardware - neutral design that reflects Google 's intention to make it support a variety of different kinds of handsets .
The user interface changes generally seem consistent with that approach .
One oddity is a slide - down panel that displays notifications .
It can be dragged from the top of the screen , but I could n't find a way to activate it with a button .
Overall , the new home screen menu feels more functional and less cramped than its predecessor , but is a bit less stylish .
One very noticeable change in the Android user interface is the addition of transition animations .
The animations show up in many places throughout the system , generally when windows , dialogs , and menus appear .
They are very subtle and add some additional elegance without becoming a distraction .
I tested several of the applications that come with the SDK , including the mapping program , the contact book , and the web browser .
I also tested the experimental Google Talk chat integration feature .
I was able to connect to Google Talk and receive messages , which are displayed as items on the notification panel .
The performance and usability of the bundled applications is pretty decent .
The interface feels more complete now , but there are still some holes .
For instance , the home screen menu offers an option for changing the background wallpaper , but selecting it only displays a dialog stating that the feature is n't available yet .
There is obviously still work to be done before the interface is ready for use on a phone , but it is definitely improving at a reasonable pace .
It seems like the initial prerelease was primarily to let developers see what the platform would offer , and this release is more about addressing the needs that emerged in the process .
Google is clearly giving due consideration to criticisms of Android and resolving problems identified by third - party developers .
There are still technical issues to resolve , but Google has now demonstrated enough responsiveness to developer demands to justify giving the company the benefit of the doubt .
This second look at the platform and the development ecosystem has boosted my confidence in the endeavor and given me reason to be optimistic about Android 's prospects .

Pot dispensaries closing under threat of feds SAN FRANCISCO
Medical marijuana in San Francisco may be going up in smoke .
In late December , the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration sent letters to landlords of buildings that housed medical cannabis dispensaries in the city , telling them they face the loss of their property and possibly prison if the businesses stay open .
Now , less than two months later , seven of the city 's 28 dispensaries have closed or are on the verge of closing , according to medical marijuana supporters and activists .
They fear more will follow .
" It 's like a dagger in the heart , " said Wayne Justmann , a medical marijuana advocate .
" We 're barely holding on right now . "
Dispensary owners are being guarded about the closures , as they are fearful that speaking publicly will draw attention to their individual businesses and put them at greater risk .
So far , the Mason Street Dispensary in the Tenderloin district has closed completely .
One of the city 's older dispensaries , 194 Church St. - which last year city supervisors tried to name as a historic site - no longer sells marijuana but is still open for people to use the space to get high .
One of the best known dispensaries , the San Francisco Patients ' Cooperative on Divisadero Street , will shut its doors at the end of the month after nearly 20 years , according to the Rev. Randi Webster , one of the cooperative 's founders .
The owner of the building was " severely frightened " by the DEA letter , and the cooperative founders and the landlord had agreed years ago to part ways in the event of a situation like this , Webster said .
Activists will not disclose the locations of other dispensaries that have or may soon shut their doors .
San Francisco is the birthplace of the medical marijuana movement .
The first major club opened in the city in 1994 and the number peaked at 43 in 2005 , just before the city passed first - of - their kind regulations for the dispensaries .
All are supposed to possess city permits by March 1 , though so far only one - a delivery service - has complied , according to the city 's Department of Public Health .
The DEA sent letters to about 50 landlords in 14 Northern California counties , said Casey McEnry , spokeswoman for the agency .
In the letter sent to San Francisco dispensaries , DEA Special Agent in Charge Javier Pena wrote that the agency " has determined there is a marijuana dispensary operating on the property .
This is a violation of federal law . "
Pena goes on to threaten landlords with the seizure of the property and other assets and up to 20 years in prison .
The notices are the first step in this new effort to shut down dispensaries , said McEnry , who described them as " courtesy letters " to landlords who might not know such a business exists on their property .
Federal agents have for years been raiding dispensaries but had yet to go after landlords .
She said the agency has not determined its next step .
" We 're still evaluating the impact to see what kind of response we get , " McEnry said .
The DEA sent similar letters to dispensaries in Southern California last summer and about 50 shut down , according to Kris Hermes , legal campaign director for Americans for Safe Access , an Oakland marijuana advocacy organization .
While that number is significant , Hermes said , " In no way is the DEA completely eliminating medical marijuana access in California . "
Action by the DEA would be followed through in the courts by the U.S. attorney 's office .
In an interview with reporters last week , new U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said he thought most people who claimed to be patients did not need marijuana .
But he also said a lifetime of trying to close dispensaries would " be terribly unproductive and probably not an efficient use of precious federal resources . "
Still , activists are putting pressure on officials to take a strong stand .
The San Francisco Democratic
Party approved a motion last month condemning the letters and calling on local and federal leaders to denounce the action .
Mayor Gavin Newsom has been the target of some of that pressure .
On Wednesday , his spokesman Nathan Ballard said , " The mayor is concerned that the DEA 's actions will leave patients without their physician - recommended medical marijuana . "
But Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi , who wrote the city regulations , said he has not seen enough leadership from the mayor to protect the dispensaries .
" It 's an expensive proposition for medical cannabis dispensaries to pay for a permit then get shut down by the DEA , " Mirkarimi said , adding later that he has heard " nothing from the mayor " on the topic .
He said the city may need to consider dispensing marijuana itself at public hospitals and medical clinics .
On Tuesday , Supervisor Chris Daly introduced a resolution condemning the DEA letters .
Whatever happens , all eyes will be watching San Francisco for clues to the future of the movement .
" If it goes down in San Francisco , " said Webster , the activist at the Divisadero dispensary , " there 's no holding them back in the 11 other states with medical cannabis . "
In the year 2012 , buddhist kung - fu cops team up with teenage anarchist daughters of the establishment to fight supercrime !
Or , at least , that 's the concept behind Phoo Action , a new BBC pilot adapted by Doctor Who director Euros Lyn from a semi- forgotten strip by Tank Girl co-creator Jamie Hewlett .
Influenced by the sixties Batman TV show , the odd Buddhist - futurist series just might be the next cult hit or , if nothing else , an interesting televisual oddity .
Learn more about just what Phoo Action is and see a clip below .

Adapted from Hewlett 's 1990s strip Get the Freebies , the 60 - minute pilot follows the story of Terry Phoo , buddhist kung - fu policeman , and his mission to try and save future London from the unstoppable crime rampage of superpowered bad guys the Freebies .
This being Hewlett , of course , he can't do it without the help of Whitey Action , red - haired daughter of the local Chief of Police , as played by Weathers .
It may be more than ten years since Hewlett came up with the idea , but he 's apparently loving the adaptation :
It 's exciting , it really does look great and it is so good to see the comic strip turned into a TV drama .
The costumes , the sets , the creatures are all really faithful to my original stuff ... [ It 's ] a little bit more crazy than Doctor Who but I know my sons , who are 11 and seven , will love it .
I really hope it will inspire people .

Admittedly , the trailer looks more than a little off - kilter thanks to music that does n't quite fit and a mix of actors in awesome outfits , party scenes that seem taken straight from an updated version of Head and glimpses of British comedy icons Terry Thomas and Les Dawson , but with a script co-written by one of the writers of Spaced and early reviews calling it " the goofiest thing that 's been on TV for years , " and comparisons to the Banana Splits and The Young Ones , it 's certainly something to look out for when it premieres in the UK next Tuesday .

Last Friday , my father ( 81 in December , can still play me in tennis , life - long liberal democrat , sharp as a ... ) was in the process of going through security at JFK .
He had made a quick overnight trip to N.Y. from Florida for a cousin 's funeral , and before he left his house in N.Y. , he threw in his carry - on bag an old brass knuckle he once bought at a flea market .
Having seen the aforementioned brass knuckle on his desk for years , holding down piles of papers and other such detritus , I can attest , yes , your honor , he used it as a paper weight and it was being transferred to his desk in Florida where it would be resuming it 's non-nefarious avocation .
Understandably , the TSA worker saw the knuckle and my dad said , sorry , just take it .
No , they have to call their supervisor .
Supervisor comes , Dad says , sorry , I use it as a paperweight , just take it .
No , she has to call the police .
Police come , first a woman and then a guy , a schmuck who was a Sergeant .
The Sergeant said " book him and cuff him " and apparently the policewoman protested to him because my father heard him say to her " do n't you know you 're being monitored ! "
So , back to where we began - my almost 81 year dad was frogmarched through the terminal with the cop 's hand on his shoulder ( when he asked the policewoman if she could remove her hand , that it was embarrassing , she said she had to keep it there . )
He was taken in the back of a patrol car somewhere ( he did n't know ) and put in a cell , alone with just a mattress .
I should interject that my dad said that the " under - cops " were clearly upset and embarrassed by what was happening - the jailer even kind of apologized and the other 2 ( women ) made eye contact and communicated their feelings to him .
The Sergeant , on the other hand was a real nasty one .
He yelled at my dad at one point to shut up or he'd be in even more trouble than he already was in and he'd lock him in a cell with other criminals until Monday .
My dad was completely cooperative , and though I know he had to be scared , he kept his wits about him , even making a decision not to make a phone call , gambling that the less fuss he made the sooner he would get out .
Oy .
Well , the asshole , after asking my father some questions , and discovering that my dad knew the boss of the place his father - in - law worked , left for a few minutes , and reappeared with a paper and said " I am going to do something amazing for you - if you sign this paper , I 'll let you out . "
My dad said he must have signed something stating that he received his personal affects back ( oh yeah - since he was a flight / suicide risk they took his belt and shoelaces ) .
No charges .
This was 3 hours later .
Two policewomen drove him back to Kennedy , in the front seat this time , and he was able to get another plane .
I 've been reading ( mostly lurking ) Daily Kos since 2003 , I learned the truth from my parents about what our country was doing in Vietnam when I was in Jr. High , a long , long time ago , and I 've been a progressive and active politically since then .
In other words , like most of us here , I thought I knew my way around the block and nothing that this administration / crime syndicate could do would surprise me .
However , I was wrong .
We 're hoping he writes this up and gets his story out , and we want to nail the nasty Sergeant .
Meanwhile , what would have happened if my dad was n't white and educated and and upper - middle class ?
What if he were a ... Muslim ?
At just about every stop I ’ve made so far on my book tour , what I ’ve come to think of as The Question comes up .
I talk about the origins of the long right - wing dominance of American politics , and the reasons I believe that dominance is coming to an end .
Then someone asks , “ How can you be optimistic about the prospects for progressive change , when big money has so much influence on politics ? ”
It ’s a good question .
The public wants change .
“ If Americans have ever been angrier with the state of the country , ” begins a new strategy memo from the polling organization Democracy Corps , “ we have not witnessed it . ”
Nor is the demand for change solely about Iraq : there has been a strong revival of economic populism .
Democracy Corps asked those who believe America is on the wrong track to choose phrases that best described their views of what ’s gone wrong .
The most commonly chosen were “ Big businesses get whatever they want in Washington ” and “ Leaders have forgotten the middle class . ”
So much , by the way , for pundits who claim that Americans do n’t care about economic inequality .
Longer - term studies of public opinion suggest a substantial leftward shift .
James Stimson , a political scientist who uses data from many polls to construct an index of the overall liberalism or conservatism of the electorate , finds that America is now more liberal than it has been since the early 1960s .
And the tactics the right has historically used to distract voters from economic issues , above all the exploitation of racial tensions , have been losing their effectiveness .
The Federal Government has slapped down Police Commisioner Mick Keelty for calling for a media blackout during all terrorist operations .
" Commissioner Keelty 's comments represent his views , not those of the Rudd Government , " the Attorney - General Robert McClelland said in a statement today .
" The Government has no plans to introduce a media blackout on the reporting of terrorism cases . "
President Bush ’s 2009 budget is a grim guided tour through his misplaced priorities , failed fiscal policies and the disastrous legacy that he will leave for the next president .
And even that requires you to accept the White House ’s optimistic accounting , which seven years of experience tells us would be foolish in the extreme .
With Mr. Bush on his way out the door and the Democrats in charge of Congress , it is not clear how many of the president ’s priorities , unveiled on Monday , will survive .
Among its many wrongheaded ideas , the budget includes some $ 2 billion to ratchet up enforcement - heavy immigration policies and billions more for a defense against ballistic missiles that show no signs of working .
What will definitely outlast Mr. Bush for years to come are big deficits , a military so battered by the Iraq war that it will take hundreds of billions of dollars to repair it and stunted social programs that have been squeezed to pay for Mr. Bush ’s misguided military adventure and his misguided tax cuts for the wealthy .
The president claimed on Monday that his plan would put the country on the path to balancing the budget by 2012 .
That is nonsense .
His own proposal projects a $ 410 billion deficit for 2008 and a $ 407 billion deficit next year .
Even more disingenuous , Mr. Bush ’s projection for a balanced budget in 2012 assumes only partial funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for 2009 , and no such spending  zero  starting in 2010 .

God help us , Marty Peretz posted some thoughts from someone who overlapped with , but did not know , Rev. Jeremiah Wright during the 50’s when they attended the same Philadelphia high school .
It ’s on The New Republic blog this week , where this someone , Morton Klein , helpfully points out that the good Rev. was raised “ in privilege , not poverty . ”
And his point is …..?
It would be so easy to find TNR articles destroying the played - out notion of affluent , functional blacks as inauthentic that I refuse to dignify the exercise by undertaking it .
So , now I ’m just gonna tell y’all what his point is , the one for which he used the coincidence of a shared home town as a pathetic cover up .
First , his nut graf :
Wright grew up in Philadelphia in
“ … a lovely neighborhood to this day .
Moreover , Rev. Wright ’s father was a prominent pastor and his mother was a teacher and later vice - principal and disciplinarian of the Philadelphia High School for Girls , also a distinguished academic high school .
Two of my acquaintances remember her as an intimidating and strict disciplinarian and excellent math teacher .
In short , Rev. Wright had a comfortable upper - middle class upbringing .
It was hardly the scene of poverty and indignity suggested by Senator Obama to explain what he calls Wright ’s anger and what I describe as his hatred .
My , oh my .
Where does one begin ?
Knowing both the magazine and many of the folks who work or worked there ( I jumpstarted my career freelancing for them ; they ’re good friends ) , I ’m going to guess that Marty ’s blog is untouchable .
And , that this post is likely unreadable to most of the people there .
The premise itself — Wright was n’t born the proverbial poor , black child and therefore ca n’t be angry but merely racist — can only induce groans and energetic eyeball - rolling .
Perhaps the writer is unaware of Dr. King ’s Brahmin background , almost identical to Wright ’s ?
Except even higher ranking .
King was black royalty .
He was a bon vivant party boy , cavorting around in expensive suits , convertibles , and ( it must be said ) white girls , until the elders told him it was time to put away childish things and assume the family mantle .
He did n’t ask to pastor a church in war zone Montgomery so he could lead the bus boycott .
He was ordered there and shit happened .
So , if I remember my Logic 101 , by Klein ’s argument the dapper ladies ’ man King also had no right to be angry .
Wright ’s father a “ prominent pastor ? ”
His mother “ a strict disciplinarian and excellent math teacher ? ”
In the 1950s ?
How dare he ?
I do n’t know Morton Klein , but I assume he ’s well - educated enough to know that those two roles — prominent minister and school teacher / vice - principal — meant only one thing from 1900 - 1970 : a power couple keenly aware of racism and steeped in the fight for civil rights .
They were the political and moral leadership .
They were deferred to and consulted with on all community issues .
They were our best and brightest seeing as how we had a tad bit of trouble winning office or , like , staying alive .
But I think the author does know .
He certainly knows that life for blacks in the 1950s , educated or not , North or South , was no picnic .
This part is disgusting :
“ [ Wright ] could have gone to an integrated neighborhood school , but he chose to go to Central , a virtually all - white school .
Central is the second oldest public high school in the country , which attracts the most serious academic students in the city . ”
So , the black 8th grader Wright , with two highly educated parents in the segregated 1950s , was such an Uncle Tom that he refused to go to a less rigorous school with his own people ?
Weird , since he knew that in 2008 he was going to have to answer for the pre-teen choices he made under Jim Crow .
The point , ladies and gentlemen ?
The point is that the piece was penned by Morton Klein , national president of the Zionist Organization of America , who hates Wright for blaming America “ for supporting Israeli ‘ state terrorism against Palestinians , ’ ” and for receiving a lifetime achievement award from Nation of Islam leader , Louis Farrakhan .
Affluent Jews can care about Jews in another country , but affluent blacks can’t care about Watts ?
This would be kind of funny if the stakes were n’t so high ; I usually have fun with ‘ thinking ’ like this but not while the fight over Wright rages .
This is a time for honorable people to set standards .
If Klein was a man of honor , he ’d have skipped the first half of his post and only debated Wright for his stance on Jewish issues .
Nothing wrong with that .
But claiming that Wright could n’t possibly understand racism and poverty since he got to go to a nice high school with pre-Buppie parents is just another version of oppression one - upsmanship with the loser thrown out of the lifeboat , silenced .
Not just outranked , but denied a place in the nation ’s attention .
Peretz claims to offer this choice nugget as “ a contribution towards understanding this strange but apparently common type of preacher . ”
Preachers , preachers everywhere :
Whose fault is it that you never paid attention to what they were saying between all those gospel songs we ’ve entertained you with for so long ?
The sad part is , all the ‘ typical ’ white people will skip the pro-Jewish part and just glom onto the black - people - shut - up part .
In fact , I expect to be seeing this “ argument ” regularly now .
I usually have to hit the National Review , Coulter , or Fox to find my intellect and my morals so offended ; now I have a new blog to avoid .
Two final , not at all rhetorical , questions :
Should n’t these sorts of attacks be beneath all of us by now ?
If you want to debate Israel and Farrakhan , debate Israel and Farrakhan .
But this ?

Incorrectly Reports Voting Machines Undelivered ' ALL OVER LOS ANGELES '
Brad Friedman Byon 2/5/2008 , 1:29 pm PT
As happened on the day of the New Hampshire primary on January 8th , disinformation on the net about problems at the polling place were rampant .
But wrong .
The disinfo , as The BRAD BLOG was able to debunk that day , seems to have originally emanated from the DRUDGE REPORT .
It looks like Mr. Drudge is busy getting the story wrong again today , reporting that " The board of elections failed to deliver voting equipment to polling places ALL OVER LOS ANGELES " ...
After running the above story for a number of hours at his site --- and sending corporate mainstream media folks and Internet blogsites alike into a tizzy , as well as helping to ring our phones off the hook --- DRUDGE has finally updated the item with the real story , and it 's far less scary ...
" Board of elections failed to deliver voting equipment to polling place [ singular ! ] in Los Angeles , " he now reports , and adds a vague " reports of issues at other locations ... " linked to this MSNBC story about a problem at one polling place in West Los Angeles where voting machines were not delivered .
The same story , of the one precinct where equipment was not available , was reported an hour or two ago by AP .
MSNBC 's report says that :
Dozens of people were sent to other polling places nearby , but [ Bernie Cade , the electoral inspector at the Westside Jewish Community Center ] said a voting troubleshooter was on hand and the polling place was accepting hand - marked ballots .
A polling place without voting equipment is obviously a problem .
But it 's a far cry from Drudge 's red-lettered " ALL OVER LOS ANGELES " scream .
We 've spoken to a number of election officials and Election Integrity experts monitoring voting here in L.A. and we 've been able to find no other reports of the same issue happening elsewhere .
Drudge has since moved the above headline down on his page , where it is now hidden among his other stories today .
There were , and are , scattered reports about problems at polling places here in Los Angeles .
We 're trying to track them down and learn how significant and / or wide - spread they are .
We even encountered an interesting issue ourselves when we went to vote today .
We 'll report on those issues , and others elsewhere around the country , shortly ...
UPDATE 5:15 pm PT : The edited headline has now been removed entirely from the DRUDGE REPORT .
Farhad Manjoo of Salon also chased down this phony report from Drudge today .
Surprisingly , LA Times offers some actual legitimate reporting on election integrity problems here today ( aside from their headline reference to " glitches " instead of the more accurate " failures " . )
Apparently Clear Channel 's new motto is " if you can't beat 'em , make life suck on the other side of the merger . "
The broadcast giant has dropped a whole big list of requests on the FCC to impose as conditions upon XM / Sirius for a merger , not the least of which is asking for broadcast decency rules be applied to satellite radio .
Clear Channel feels the competitive threat of satellite radio could be mitigated a bit if the " edgy " content ( Howard Stern ) ceased to make terrestrial radio's edgy stuff look weak by comparison .
Of course , the big difference is that XM and Sirius are paid subscription services , and we 're guessing they 're going to pound the " but HBO can do it " argument for all they 've got , but it seems like these days no request is out of reach for terrestrial radio : Clear Channel also wants another satellite radio competitor , 5 percent " public interest " radio , and zero local programming or local advertising .
Idriss Deby has accused Sudan of being behind the coup bid
In a speech broadcast on state media , Idriss Deby said the emergency powers would be in effect for 15 days .
They include a night - time curfew and controls on the movement of vehicles .
The rebels , who Chad claims are backed by Sudan , were driven from N'Djamena after two days of fighting and back towards the eastern border with Sudan .
Meanwhile , one of three missing opposition leaders has been found , according to Interior Minister Ahmat Mahamat Bachir .
We left our houses and took to the streets to say hello to the rebels .
We can't go back now
Emmanuel , student
In pictures : Chad refugees
Earlier this week , France and human rights groups expressed their concern after the three disappeared during the fighting .
France has also acknowledged that its forces transported weapons to Chad 's army as it beat back the rebel assault .
The former colonial power said it had acted in accordance with a military co-operation agreement between the two countries .
Scared
Mr Deby said the emergency decree instituted " measures important and urgent to maintain order , guarantee stability and assure the good functioning of the state " .
It also authorised " house searches and controls on the private and public press " .
One of the 30,000 people who fled Chad to Cameroon told her that some people had welcomed the rebel advance .
" We left our houses and took to the streets to say hello to the rebels .
We ca n't go back now , " said a young student called Emmanuel .
" The government forces are going from house to house mistreating us civilians because we cheered for the rebels . "
The assault began on 2 February , when the rebels seized control of large parts of the capital , approaching the palace where Mr Deby was holding out .
The Red Cross said more than 160 people were killed and 1,000 injured in the fighting .
Mr Deby has accused Sudan of being behind the coup bid .
Chad says Darfur wants to delay the deployment of an EU peacekeeping force to Chad , to safeguard refugees from Darfur .
But Khartoum has denied the allegations and in turn accuses Chad of backing rebels in Darfur .
The deployment of the 4,000 - strong EU force was delayed by the rebel attacks but is now due by the end of February .
Mr Deby seized power in a coup in 1990 , but has won three elections since then , although their legitimacy has been challenged .
The animator , looking for a challenge , decides to make the stick figure harder to beat .
Little does he know exactly how much power he is giving to the little guy .

Powers being drafted by the government will compel internet service providers to take action against customers who access pirated material .
The Department of Media , Culture and Sport will recommend the plan in a green paper on the creative industries to be published this month , a source with knowledge of the paper said .
Under the new sanctions users will face a " three strikes " regime .
A warning email will be sent for the first offence , followed by suspension from the service and finally termination of the internet contract .
A draft copy of the green paper said the government " will move to legislate to require internet service providers to take action on illegal file - sharing , " although it has yet to decide if information on offenders should be shared between the ISPs , the Times reported .
The government has come under increasing pressure from the music and film industries to penalise users who download pirated files .
Although piracy is illegal , prosecutions are rare .
The UK's four largest internet providers - BT , Tiscali , Orange and Virgin Media - are already in talks with studios on a joint voluntary agreement to share information on web violators .
But under the legislation they could be forced to cut off customers .
ISPs which fail to enforce the rules could face prosecution , and suspected customers handed over to the courts .
It remains unclear who would be responsible for arbitration in disputed allegations , for example when customers claim that other users have " piggy - backed " on their wireless internet access .
A spokesman for the Department of Media , Culture and Sport said : " There are still meetings going on and consultation to take place , so nothing is finalised .
The strategy document is to be released within the next couple of weeks . "
The green paper is also expected to call for a £ 200 m national film centre , as well as 19 other schemes intended to turn Britain into the " world 's creative hub " .
Other pledges include the launching of a global arts conference , dubbed the " World Creative Economy Forum " modelled on Davos , the creation of a new college of digital media and the protection of live music venues such as the Astoria and the Hammersmith Apollo in London .
The government is also expected to reveal plans for a new creative festivals season , a new film centre on London 's South Bank and a permanent home for London fashion week .
Under plans to be announced by Gordon Brown and the culture secretary , Andy Burnham , children will be given the right to " five hours of culture a week " encouraging them to visit galleries and museums , attend the theatre , or study a musical instrument .
And some 1,000 creative apprenticeships for young people are also being proposed , which will be managed by a new Skills Academy .
Eighteen panda cubs living in China 's Wolong Nature Reserve have been named at a ceremony in Sichuan province .
Names for the five to seven - month - old cubs were chosen from about 30,000 entries submitted by the public after an appeal for ideas .
Tao Tao ( playful in Mandarin ) and Huan Huan ( happiness ) were amongst the most popular .
The panda above was named Fu Wa after Beijing 's Olympic mascot .
Panda cubs play with their keepers at a breeding centre Workers at the nature reserve aided a record number of births last year in a mini baby panda boom .
After the ceremony , the cubs left their mothers for the first time to stay in a panda " kindergarten " .
The move is to help the pandas adapt to the humidity and group living .
They will be resident until they are a year old .
The giant panda is one of the world 's most endangered species and is native only to China .
About 1,600 wild pandas live in nature reserves in Sichuan , Gansu and Shaanxi provinces and 217 are kept in captivity .

OK , so here 's something that makes me very skeptical .
Check the video on that series that has Maher interviewing General Paul Eaton .
Listen very carefully to what the general says about defunding the war - " No , that would be bad for our troops . "
This general is lambasting the Bush administration , but setting the stage for Democrats to continue the war .
Talk about the military - industrial complex playing the field !
There is no military solution .
There is no economic solution that would be amenable to the oil powers .
There is no political solution while US troops are on the ground .
How hard is that to understand ?
This general is having us on .

They are ignoring the " national intelligence " of the people , and instead have institutionalized the " national ignorance " of the neoCon republicans instead .
Now that preznit blush and the rubber stampers are at new lows , what is it that the people want ?
In a recent survey on how to improve the economy , they said the best thing to do to improve the economy is to stop the Iraq war where dollars and blood flow needlessly into the mud .
Dollars need to flow into America and the blood needs to stop flowing .
There is no " national intelligence director " so we are going to elect one in November .
And if the people 's vote counts it will not be preznit clone , ( a.k.a. McPreznit McCain ) who wants another 100 years of wars .

Sorry Dredd , but sometimes you need to look across the party lines .
Bush and the neocons have been bad , but they are n't really Repubicans ... which Republicans should have admitted a long time ago to avoid the horrible position they are currently in .
McCain is the frontrunner because Fox News says he is .
Pretty much all news is liberal , the simple fact is they are pushing our weakest contender to the top because he is the only Republican who will 100 % lose to Hillary , and we all know it 's her " turn " .
That being said , Obama and Hillary do n't plan to end the war either ... as a matter of fact , the Israel lobby has been pushing for Clinton , which means she is quite likely to escalate into a war in Iran .
The truth of the matter is that the forces that pushed us into the wars is n't Republicans or Democrats , it is people on both sides of party lines that have the same agenda , and you can mark my words , Hillary is part of that agenda .
Remember how Democrats were going to take back congress and the senate and end the wars ?
Well they did n't !
Remember how they were going to impeach Bush / Cheney ?
Well they did n't !
Remember how they were going to go after Gonzales ?
Well , they did a crappy job and then likely replaced him with somebody worse ( Muckasey ) !
This is n't a matter of Republicans or Democrats , this is a matter of ALL of our politicians failing us .

You have learned the talking points well .
All I can say is " Yeah , that 's the ticket " .
" Clear as mud " is the result of " you 're doin ' a heckuva job " republican propaganda .
Only those in a trance still believe that " true republicans " or " false republicans " is a real issue .
That is a wee bit psychotic .
What utter rubbish !
Take a look at the votes in Congress and tell me what party filibustered the stop the war bills more in the 110th congress than any other congress in history ?

The true less of all evils is Ron Paul and I hope he does go Independent .
While I am truly sorry for McCain 's POW , I do n't care for the bushie clone .
100 years of war is not my idea of progress , nor do I want the Middle East to be in my grandchildren 's future .
There are so many pressing issues we should be concerned with - global warming , the environment , population , etc. - has anybody addressed them ??
I truly hope the Repubs are gone in November .
We have gone backwards for 8 years , it would be nice to go forward with the Dems .

... Brandon said on 2/9/2008 @ 9:14 am PT ...
Dredd , your missing my point .
My point is that most current Republicans suck , but so do most Democrats .
Vote by the person , not the party .
Personally , I admit I lean Republican , but I could vote Democrat if no good Republicans were running and there was a good Democrat .
Unfortunately I feel like our party has been hijacked ... we used to be about small government , fiscal responsibility , and have taken several elections in the past in order to get OUT of a war ... which is obviously no longer the case , which deeply disturbs me .
There are SOME Democrats with good ideas , but IMO that is what Democrats are all about .
Good ideas and good intentions that are poorly executed or abandoned .
Democrats could have done a lot of good against the current administration if they 'd stop being such pacifists and stick to their guns for once .
Oh wait ... Democrats are against guns ... well , whatever it is that you guys stick to .
Big Brother is a neocon , which is basically just the people that hijacked the Republican party ... the traditional Republican values only exist in name anymore , but that is what many of us are referring to when we say we lean Republican .
You never mentioned one of my main points though ... you talk of getting out of the war , yet neither Democratic candidate plans on getting out of the war any time soon .
Then on top of that , they both want to increase spending by over $ 250 billion a year ... when we do n't have what we already spend .
How exactly do you think they are going to pay for that ?

That is absolutely incredible that these guys do n't know who our DNI is .
Absolutely incredible .
And how long has he been our DNI ?
No wonder these blowhards think we need to pass the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act ( H.R. 1955 / S. 1959 ) as a supplemental intelligence effort to go along with the other 16 spy agencies that we taxpayers are now paying for .
Sixteen spy agencies do n't provide them with enough intelligence to even know who our DNI is .
McConnell is Dianne Feinstein's new super - hero .
She relies on his " expert assessments " before she does things like approve the continued illegal wiretapping and surveillancing of American citizens w/o going through a FISA court .
And speaking of DiFi , she was recently quoted in the San Fran Chronicle as saying , " We saw the very real dangers earlier this year on the Straits of Hormuz .
Five armed Iranian boats sped directly toward three U.S. Navy warships .
The captain of one of the warships turned his guns on the boats , and they quickly retreated . "
This is so amazing .
No one has yet informed her that this incident was completely blown all out of proportion by the Bush / Cheney Fearmongering Machine .
Even the Pentagon and the admiral in charge of this fleet have come out and stated for the record that there was never any threat from these boats , yet DiFi and her staff are not aware of this .
There is so much that our fearful leaders do not know .
And so much that they do know that is actually untrue .
I believe this is all related to our broken elections system .
Also , how can it be that " al Qaeda is better able to hit U.S. " if the Bush / Cheney GWOT that includes the troop surge in Iraq is succeeding at keeping the fight over there so we do n't have to fight them over here , and while Bush keeps telling us that his surveillancing of us within our borders w/o a FISA court is successfully thwarting attacks and saving American lives , despite his being unable to explain how this is happening because that would be aiding the enemy ?
Could it be that post - super Tuesday , the administration recognizes that it 's gotta pull out the terrorist threat issue again in order to get enough legitimate votes for their guy McCain , " Mr. Hundred Years of War , " to make it possible for the computers to rig another election ?

I am a way on the left Democrat , but I 'll give some support to Brandon .
If you go here : http://www.commondreams....archive/2008/01/25/6613/
On Clinton : " Senator Clinton ’s foreign policy advisors tend to be veterans of President Bill Clinton ’s administration , most notably former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and former National Security Adviser Sandy Berger .
Virtually all were strong supporters of the invasion of Iraq and some - such as Jack Keane , Kenneth Pollack and Michael O’Hanlon - also supported President Bush ’s “ surge . ”
Her team also includes some centrist opponents of the war , however , including retired General Wesley Clark and former Ambassador Joseph Wilson .
" Her most influential advisor - and her likely choice for Secretary of State - is Richard Holbrooke , who prior to the invasion of Iraq insisted that that country posed “ a clear and present danger at all times , ” insisted that Bush had “ ample justification ” to invade Iraq , and has written that those who protested against the war and foreign governments which opposed the invasion “ undoubtedly encouraged ” Saddam Hussein .
Holbrooke has been severely criticized for his role as Carter ’s assistant secretary of state for East Asia in propping up Marcos in the Philippines and supporting Suharto ’s repression in East Timor , as well as his culpability in the Kwangju massacre in South Korea . "
Obama 's foreign policy team is a little better , but not by much .
A Democratic President with a veto - proof Democratic Congress would more likely get us out of the war than the opposite but anyone who thinks that Hillary or Barack becoming President automatically equals an immediate withdrawal from Iraq is dreaming .

Gravel is getting something like .01 % of the vote and so seriously barely warrants mention as a candidate .
But Ron Paul is Republican in name only ... sort of like Kucinich is a Democrat in name only .
Many Republicans do not consider Neocons to be real Republicans , and there is a sound basis for this .
Neither party has the moral high ground .
That is abundantly clear by now .
So could we try to simmer down on the partisan resentments ?
Most Americans are seriously concerned with the messes we 're in and it's up to each of us to fix them .

Obama 's foreign policy team is a little better ...
No , they 're not .
They 're just a different bunch of moldy old figs .
Obama 's FP crowd is as packed with paleo - cold warriors like Brzezinski , the man who boasted about how wonderfully the funding of the Afghan mujahedeen worked out for the US .
Anthony Lake also makes an appearance in Obama 's FP wonk squad .
This was the guy who downplayed the Rwanda massacre and took steps to prevent UN peacekeepers from becoming a significant force during that nightmare .
While Obama 's team did indeed argue against the invasion of Iraq , they did so out of ideological differences on the use of hard and soft power , not from any moral perspective .

There IS actually ONE real candidate and she is both Black and a Woman and is 100 % anti war , is for the bottom 98 % and is for Impeachment of both Bush and Cheney and is a staunch supporter of 9/11 truth .
She is also neither a worthless corrupt democrat nor a totally insane corrupt rethuglican .
That would be Cynthia McKinney Green Party .
Anyone with any sense will be voting for her come November .

Thank you , Bob in Pacifica , for helping me prove my point .
That being said , Ron Paul in reality is the only real Republican , by the traditional values of the party .
He might not seem like one in this day and age , but that is because the rest of them have turned into liberal warmongerers .
Perhaps what troubles me the most though is that no matter what party these people are from , they swear an OATH to uphold the constitution , yet for the most part none of them do , and there are no repercussions for it .
Nunya , I may look into that lady you mentioned .
A lot of people hate Hillary , and even more hate McCain .
This could be a good year for an independent or third party to make a good run .
I will not vote for her however if she does not uphold the constitution .

I love this site .
The election issue is non-partisan and when the occasional partisan discussion like this one pops up it becomes painfully apparent how terribly broken our entire system is .
I could easily argue partisan politics .
I do on other blogs .
But , when I see it here all I want to do is call for a truce among friends who all want a good political system restored .
We might argue over which party is fouled up most , but when it comes down to it this year it 's hard to say one is good and the other bad .
Instead , as with the election system , we see something terribly terribly wrong in our political system with neither party free of tar .
I wish it were so simple as to argue partisan policy positions .
I really do .
This year we have to stand together on one really really important issue : the system must be fixed before any partisan fights can be fought .
Right now , and I say this with no rancor , it seems both parties are a lot dirtier than we want to admit .
I pray my party , the Democrats , elect someone who will prove they are n't so stupid or dirty and get us out of the war .
I do n't have complete faith that will happen regardless of the many times I 've heard Clinton and Obama say they 're going to end the war .
Is n't it sad when you hear something over and over and still do n't believe them ?
Let 's stand together on fixing the system and leave our partisanship for other blogs .

Just FYI , I voted for Mike Gravel .
I 'm in that .1 % that cares enough to research and vote against these corrupt AIPAC / PNAC / CFR puppets .
If you voted for one of them , that 's on your conscious - - not mine .
After Kucinich dropped out , I was trying to find out WHO was actually still in .
I even considered Ron Paul - - except , my ballot was democrat ( yeah I know I said it was gonna be green ) and Ron Paul was not on my ballot .
Anyway , what I found while searching for WHO was still in the election , was kind of a dark joke , since some candidates still did n't say they dropped out on their websites .
( Assholes ! )
Anyway , my " time - out from politics " is helping to calm me down since I learned about this whole frigging " delegates / superdelegates " end run on the vote .
( that pushed me over the top - - I was so naive -- but not anymore )
Although from the rare time to time I do hear headlines ( it 's really unavoidable because of the fascist media ) , I find , it 's pissing me off more sharply than before .
The new key to my health , is that I need to not be pissed off if I want to live a life without an expected heart attack , cancer or brain hemorrhage .
I am already in pain 24/7 and barely getting any sleep .
call me when your finally serious about revolution against this oath breaking corruption -- till then , bless those of you who do have good health to fight against these constitutional oath breakers .
( I ain't had health care since 1985 ) You wo n't hear from me very often anymore , but I will check in from time to time .
I just can't fight every issue anymore , I wish I could say I left ten people behind that will take up my slack , but I can't .
This nonsense is not going to be reason for another dead activist .
e.g. me from my soul being sucked away .
It ai n't that I do n't care , I care , I just can't deal with this anymore without snapping .
Plus it 's probably better I shut the fuck up before getting labeled as some bullshit fucking homegrown terrorist .
( I am going to laugh the day those fuckers that drafted that bill are thrown in prison )
To all the oath breakers - Fuck you , I hope bad shit happens to you really soon !
To all the constitution protectors - Good Luck !
Bless you all !
