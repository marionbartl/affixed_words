My name is Juan , and I ’d like to talk a bit about some of the things I learned while porting BixAgent to FreeBSD and Mac OS .
Since I learned so much I ’ll break it up into a few posts .
This one is about FreeBSD and how the free and open philospohy of its community makes it a great OS to work with .
When most people hear the words “ open source operating system ” , the first thing that comes to mind is usually Linux .
It ’s kind of interesting when you think about it , because Linux and most of the GNU stuff that usually comes with it are n’t really what I would call open .
The license that the code is released under is typically the GPL .
It basically says that if you use the code in some new sofware then your new code must also be released with the same restrictions .
The idea behind this is to ensure that no one can compete against an open source project using its own source code against it .
This is all well and good if you consider some class of developers and organizations to be worthy recipients of the benefits of openness and others to be the sworn enemies of freedom .
If you want to develop software without making the source code available , you ca n’t use anything licensed under the GPL .
That ’s fine , though maybe the name open source is really a misnomer since to these people the source is most definitely closed .
If you ’re a regular software company that does n’t want to release the source to your product you should n’t even be looking at GPL ’d source code that ’s similar to your product if you can help it .
What ’s worse is that if you wanted to release your code under a license that ’s less restrictive ( i.e. more free ) you would n’t be allowed !
There are actually degrees of openness , and the GPL is pretty low on that scale .
So what does all this have to do with anything ?
Most of FreeBSD is licensed under the BSD license .
It pretty much allows you to do whatever you like with the code .
That means there ’s an amazing resource available to you if you ’re working on low level tools such as BixAgent .
When I first started working on the FreeBSD port of BixAgent , I was totally lost .
I was directed to look at the man page for sysctl to get started .
That ’s probably the most useful bit of real documentation that I found , but it ’s far from being a complete reference .
I ’ll share the details of how to get a lot of good stuff from sysctl in a later post .
So about that source code .
Let ’s say tou want to find out how to get the free disk space on a partition .
The command that is most commonly used to report this information is df .
Assuming you installed the source code with the base system , you can find the source for df very easily .
First type which df to find the location of the executable .
If your installation is typical , you ’ll see that when you run df it uses the binary at / bin / df .
The directory tree under /usr / src mirrors that of the base system .
For example , the source to the tools in / bin such as df can be found in /usr / src / bin .
The source for df can be found at / usr / src / bin / df .
Most of these tools have fairly simple source code , so it is often more useful to look at the source for a tool than it is to try and find out what you want by searching the web .
Just by scanning through df .c
I see a few things that might be useful for further research .
The first thing in the file is the license .
You should really read through that just to make sure .
The one for this file pretty much says I can do whatever I want as long as I reproduce the copyright notice .
Sounds good to me .
Shortly after that there ’s the list of #include’s .
Since this is the only source file for the program , every api function needed should be declared in the headers in this list .
If you look at the list , besides the usual stuff there ’s < sys/ sysctl.h > and < sys/ mount.h >.
Finding out what those headers contain could be big clues .
If you continue looking at the source , you ’ll notice that they use a function called getmntinfo .
The man page for this says that it returns a statfs structure for each mounted file system .
The man page for statfs contains the definition for that structure .
The most useful fields in the structure for what we ’re looking to do are :
uint64_t f_blocks ; /* total data blocks in filesystem */
uint64_t f_bfree ; /* free blocks in filesystem */
With these data we can find out the number of free blocks and the total number of blocks , and with simple arithmetic we can figure out the number of used blocks .
Great !
Almost .
This is pretty useful , but you might want that to be in bytes rather than blocks .
How many blocks are there per byte ?
The man page does n’t say , but df knows the conversion and we know everything df knows .
We are very close .
Looking at the source again and searching for f_bfree a few times leads us to some code that uses the f_bsize member of the statfs struct as the block size .
I ’m pretty sure that I read through the entire man page before and did n’t notice anything like that .
If I look at the man page again , I find this :
uint64_t f_bsize ; /* filesystem fragment size */
Oh .
Fragment size .
The field is named f_bsize which does imply that it could be the block size , but when I read documentation I tend to expect things to be clear .
Now , it ’s entirely possible and maybe even likely that a fragment and a block are different things .
However , if it ’s good enough for df , it ’s good enough for me .
I ’m sure that with some amount of research I could find out , but I think it ’s pretty safe to assume that code is correct as a starting point .
I believe that reading code is the best way to learn about programming .
Using the code that ’s available is a great way to learn how things on your new OS .
Plus you have the added benefit of being able to customize the tools that come with your system .
If you get good enough at it you might even want to improve the code and give something back .
I ’d say that this is what real open source is about .
Modern - day metaphor

In the glass case , they are living together but separated by a transparent wall , in what they say is a metaphor for the gap in modern family relationships in China .
“ People want to kill people , and they want biblical permission to do so . ” ~ Wilma Ann Bailey
It is bad enough to hear the Bush Administration , the neocons , the Randians , most Republicans in Congress , the right - wing talk show hosts , and some assorted libertarians still defend the war in Iraq , but it is even worse when Christians do the same .
Never at any time in history have so many conservative , evangelical Christians held such unholy opinions .
The adoration that many of these Christians have toward President Bush is unholy .
The association of many of these Christians with the Republican Party is unholy .
The alliance between evangelical Christianity and the military is unholy .
The idolatry that many of these Christians manifest toward the state is unholy .
But what continues to amaze me the most is the unholy desire on the part of many of these Christians to legitimize killing in war .
The Sixth Commandment Although the attempt to legitimize killing in war is done in a number of ways , watering down the sixth commandment ’s prohibition against killing is always one of them .
If someone is in the military or otherwise in the killing business for the state , then ( so we are told ) the commandment does n’t apply .
Many Christians would go further and say that the commandment never applies to killing in war , period , or at least it does n’t apply to American troops .
Others have the crazy idea that the commandment must be interpreted in light of the September 11th attacks .
And although they would never say it publicly , some Christians believe that the commandment does n’t apply to the killing of Muslim infidels because they ’re not “ innocent . ”
The simplest way to water down the prohibition against killing is to redefine it .
Since killing in the sixth commandment obviously does n’t mean “ the taking of any life , ” it has been limited by some Christians to murder because , as everyone knows ( so we are told ) , it is not murder to kill a man on the battlefield .
Therefore , Christians can in good conscience enlist in the military knowing that they might be expected to travel halfway around the world and bomb , maim , “ interrogate , ” and kill for the state .
No Christian need fear any negative consequences by God at the Judgment because he ca n’t be faulted for “ following orders ” or “ obeying the powers that be . ”
End of story .
Case closed .
Christians can join the military or the National Guard and kill heartily in the name of the Lord .
We should support the troops .
They are not responsible for anyone they kill during a war .
We should support conscription if the state says it needs more troops .
We should ask God to bless our troops .
On the phrase “ Thou shalt not kill ” in the sixth commandment , here is Kenneth C. Davis , author of Do n’t Know Much About the Bible : Everything You Need to Know About the Good Book but Never Learned ( William Morrow , 1998 ) : This is another critical King James Version mistranslation of the original Hebrew .
The correct reading is “ You shall not murder ” ( NRSV , JPS , and others ) .
As the rest of the Hebrew scriptures clearly indicate , God had no problem with certain forms of killing .
So , Kenneth Davis , who could n’t recite the Hebrew alphabet if his life depended on it , tells us that the most widely accepted Protestant version of the Bible mistranslates “ the original Hebrew . ”
Where , then , is Davis getting his information ?
Evangelicals Robert Morey , in his book When Is It Right to Fight ?
( Christian Scholars Press , 2002 , originally Bethany House , 1985 ) , and Loraine Boettner , in his book The Christian Attitude Toward War , ( Presbyterian and Reformed , 3rd ed. , 1985 ) , say basically the same thing .
Morey mentions , but does not otherwise refer to , the definitive work of C. John Cadoux , The Early Christian Attitude to War : A Contribution to the History of Christian Ethics ( Headley Bros. , 1919 ) , in arguing that the early church did not reject war and military service for Christians .
Boettner , manifesting a profound ignorance of American history , believes that “ America is not and never has been a militaristic nation . ”
A noted evangelical recently wrote : Previously we examined five ways in which God revealed that murder violates and perverts
His moral absolutes and fixed order of moral law .
The fifth way was through God giving Israel the following commandment : “ You shall not murder ” ( Ex. 20:13 ) .
Some versions of the Bible use the word kill instead of murder .
But since the Bible indicates that some killings are not murder but are permissible and , in some cases , required by God , “ You shall not murder ” is “ a more precise reading than the too - general . . . u2018 thou shalt not kill ' ” [ quoting the Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament ( Moody , 2003 ) ] .
He goes on to quote from volume 13 of the Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament ( Eerdmans , 2004 ) regarding the Hebrew word for kill in Exodus 20:13 : “ It is noteworthy that rsh [ rasah ] is never used for killing in battle or for killing in self - defense .
Neither is it used for suicide . ”
Even Norman Geisler , in his valuable book , Christian Ethics : Options and Issues ( Baker , 1989 ) , tells us that the prohibition against killing in Exodus 20:13 “ is translated correctly by the New International Version : u2018 You shall not murder . ' ”
Thus , the general evangelical consensus is that the Hebrew word underlying the word kill in the sixth commandment means “ murder . ”
Most of the Christians who make this argument do so , not because they know anything about biblical Hebrew or Bible translation , but because they are trying to justify Christians killing for the state in Iraq , Afghanistan , or wherever else the government has sent or will send its soldiers .
This gives them something to fall back on when the recitation of their “ obey the powers that be ” mantra does n’t quite do the job .
This ideological desire to legitimize killing in war is an unholy one , and every Christian who attempts to do so should be ashamed of himself and repent “ in sackcloth and ashes ” ( Matthew 11:21 ) .
Kill or Murder ?
Fortunately , Christians who are beginning to question the lies of the Bush Administration and distrust the latest pronouncements of their “ leaders ” have some help .
Wilma Ann Bailey , an associate professor of Hebrew and Aramaic Scripture at Christian Theological Seminary in Indianapolis , has penned a small ( 94 pages ) book called “ You Shall Not Kill ” or “ You Shall Not Murder ” ?
The Assault on a Biblical Text ( Collegeville , Minnesota : Liturgical Press , 2005 ) .
I do not know Ms. Bailey , and doubt seriously that we could have much fellowship around any other thing than the subject of her book .
She would probably consider me to be a fundamentalist , and I would probably consider her to be a liberal .
I strongly disagree with her approach to Scripture ( she believes that the source of Exodus 20 and 21 may be different because the vocabulary is different and Exodus 20 is apodictic law while Exodus 21 is casuistic law ) .
I strongly disagree with her interpretation of Scripture ( she denies that God sanctioned war , killing , and capital punishment in the Old Testament ) .
I also strongly disagree with her political philosophy ( she is in favor of gun control ) .
Nevertheless , Bailey has written an important work that I highly ( but reservedly ) recommend to anyone ( Christian or not ) who believes or is familiar with the “ sixth commandment only prohibits murder ” argument .
I have written briefly about this issue in my article “ Humpty Dumpty Religion . ”
There I showed that it was wrong to limit the sixth commandment to just prohibiting murder .
I have also explained in my article “ Is It or Is n’t It ? ” that even if we grant that it is only murder which is prohibited by the sixth commandment , Christian warmongers are still responsible for explaining how U.S. soldiers killing for the state in Iraq is anything but murder .
But because this is the first book on the subject that I have seen , the whole idea needs to be revisited and expanded upon .
Bailey ’s book focuses on “ the meaning of the Hebrew word used in Exod 20:13 and the altering of the English translation of the commandment in several large traditions during the twentieth and twenty - first centuries .
”
The book contains six short chapters and two short appendixes .
The first chapter is an analysis of the Hebrew word underlying the prohibition against killing in the sixth commandment .
This chapter is not only the longest ; it contains the meat of the book .
The next four chapters survey this commandment in Evangelical Protestantism , Mainline Protestantism , Judaism , and Roman Catholicism .
The final chapter is her explanation of why “ killing is not the solution to the problem of killing . ”
The first appendix is a helpful list of the major translations of the Bible with an indication of whether they use kill or murder in the sixth commandment .
The second appendix is a technical study of the Hebrew word underlying the prohibition against killing in the sixth commandment .
It is basically an expansion of the first chapter for scholars .
All Hebrew words in the book are transliterated , except for those in the second appendix .
( Bailey transliterates the Hebrew root in question as rtsh .
Other acceptable transliterations are rsh , rasah , and ratsach , which is the form I have used in previous articles . )
We need not read far into the preface to see the direction in which Bailey is headed :
The sixth commandment is perhaps the most disturbing of all the commandments .
This is evidenced by the lengths to which scholars and church folk go to explain it away .
Most killing throughout history has taken place within the context of what is legal ( e.g. , war , capital punishment ) and therefore exempt from this commandment in the minds of many people .
Interpreters narrow the prohibition to what relatively few people do , a criminal act — a person illegally killing another person — while allowing for the bulk of killing that takes place in the world to continue .
“ This commandment , ” she continues , “ exposes the true moral substance or vacuity of its interpreters .
The Quaker Elton Trueblood once observed : u2018 The ultimate moral principles of a people are revealed , not by what they do but by the way in which they defend their actions . ' ”
Bailey argues four things in her first chapter :
The English word “ murder ” is too limited and too varied a legal term to function adequately as the translation for the Hebrew word rtsh .
The use of rtsh in other biblical texts indicates that the word is meant to be translated more broadly .
The verbal form of rtsh often appears in a list or an ambiguous phrase that makes it impossible to determine a precise meaning .
Murder is too rare a crime to merit Ten Commandment status .
She first shows that “ the word u2018 murder ’ is a legal term , ” with a variety of meanings “ from one jurisdiction to another . ”
The fifty states each have their own legal code that defines what a murder is .
Bailey then undertakes an exhaustive study of the Hebrew word rtsh in the Old Testament .
Among other things , she points out that when this word is used in a list , “ it is impossible to determine its precise meaning , ” Ahab is said to have killed ( rtsh ) Naboth ( 1 Kings 21 ) , but never actually killed anyone , and a lion can kill ( rtsh ) someone , but would never be considered a murderer .
She concludes in chapter one :
This chapter has presented a biblical argument against the automatic assumption that the commandment “ You shall not kill ” must be understood as “ You shall not murder . ”
First , it is clear that the Hebrew word rtsh does not mean u2018 murder ’ everywhere it is found in the Bible .
Second , it is inappropriate to harmonize Scripture rather than letting the various theological traditions in the Bible speak for themselves .
The English word u2018 murder ’ is a restricted legal term .
Last , the Ten Commandments are meant to be general and not to refer to one particular , rarely committed crime .
After refuting the arguments for the translation “ murder ” in the sixth commandment using the biblical data , Bailey turns to how that commandment has been interpreted and translated in the various theological traditions : Evangelical Protestantism , Mainline Protestantism , Judaism , and Roman Catholicism .
The second chapter , “ The Sixth Commandment in Evangelical Protestantism , ” is the most important of these because of the unholy alliance that exists today between evangelical Christianity and the military .
Bailey shows that evangelicals were pacifistic during the period between the world wars , but notes that “ by the 1960s the argument that the word u2018 kill ’ in the Ten Commandments really means u2018 murder ’ was being used by evangelicals even though the primary Bible translation used by evangelicals , the King James Version , did not read u2018 murder . ' ”
This is no doubt due in a large measure because “ in the latter half of the twentieth century being patriotic in the United States started to mean being pro-military and pro-war . ”
In this chapter Bailey chronicles the shift in the rendering of the sixth commandment in the Bible translations of evangelicals from kill to murder .
This change was accepted because of the “ melding of evangelicalism , patriotism , and militarism . ”
“ Although , ” as Bailey says , “ a major American mainline translation did not read u2018 murder ’ until the publication of the New Revised Standard Version in 1989 , ” the notion “ began appearing in commentaries and sermons much earlier . ”
Why have mainline Protestants , who would be most open to critical scholarship , also produced a translation that reads “ murder ” ?
Bailey bluntly replies : “ People want to kill people , and they want biblical permission to do so .
The translators of the NRSV and the other translations of the late twentieth century gave them that permission . ”
English translations of the Old Testament made by Jews did not appear until the middle of the nineteenth century .
The earliest , that of Isaac Leeser in 1853 , reads “ kill , ” but this was changed in the Jewish Publication Society ’s 1917 translation to “ murder . ”
Thus , Bailey acknowledges , the translation of murder has a longer history in Judaism than Protestantism , but , as she also shows , “ it is not an unchallenged reading . ”
In her chapter on the commandment in Roman Catholicism , Bailey finds that “ all of the English translations produced in the Roman Catholic tradition have been consistent in the translation of the commandment . ”
Yet , she believes that “ the church developed u2018 just war ’ theory in order to theologically cope with the incongruity between biblical teachings ( particularly New Testament teachings ) and the desire of the state to wage war .
Wars that were declared to be just , however , tended to be wars the state wanted to fight . ”
In her concluding chapter , Bailey summarily restates her objection to the “ movement away from the traditional wording of the sixth commandment ” in the late twentieth century and into the twenty - first century : “ This would be appropriate if it more accurately reflected the meaning of the biblical text , but it does not . ”
Her argument in the end is that rather than being more precise , murder is much too narrow of a translation .
The ambiguity of the word kill in English matches that of ratsach in Hebrew .
And since “ the vast majority of violent and unnatural deaths during the last century were not the result of murder , but actions that in English are covered by the word u2018 kill , ' ” to limit “ the scope of the commandment to illegal one - on - one killing exempts the primary causes of unnatural deaths in the twentieth and early twenty - first centuries . ”
There is no disputing the fact that many modern versions of the Bible narrow the prohibition against killing in the sixth commandment to murder .
There is also no disputing the fact that many Christians appeal to the sixth commandment , not to condemn killing in war , but to countenance it .
But does the first fact necessarily have to lead to the second ?
Has the change in the sixth commandment from kill to murder in recent translations of the Bible contributed to some Christians turning into Christian warmongers ?
I think not .
And neither does Bailey .
She is merely saying that the change was accepted and even welcomed by those seeking biblical permission to legitimize killing in war .
Does she put too much emphasis on this change in translation ?
I think so , and for four reasons .
First , the earliest major modern Bible translation to make the change from kill to murder was the Revised Version of 1885 .
This is much too early to substantiate Bailey ’s thesis .
Second , the venerable King James Version of the Bible ( but not the New King James Version ) , which is the only Bible used by some conservative Christian warmongers , contains the familiar reading “ thou shalt not kill . ”
But this has n’t stopped these Christians from defending the death and destruction meted out by “ Christian ” U.S. soldiers in Iraq .
Third , a reviewer of Bailey ’s book from Denmark pointed out that “ the Danish Bible changed from u2018 kill ’ to u2018 murder ’ in the late 1990s , but neither is capital punishment favored in the Danish society nor is there a growing positive attitude to ( just ) war but rather to the contrary . ”
And then there is the matter of the 1917 Jewish Publication Society translation — obviously not even the work Christians — which also reads “ murder . ”
I have some other problems with Bailey ’s book as well .
She does not address the implications of an absolute prohibition against killing that she seems to be sanctioning .
Also , she unfortunately does not interact with the New Testament references to the sixth commandment ( Matthew 5:21 , 19:18 ; Mark 10:19 ; Luke 18:20 ; Romans 13:9 ) .
The strength of Bailey ’s book clearly lies in the first chapter where she shows that the Hebrew word for kill in the sixth commandment does n’t mean murder in many contexts .
Therefore , Bible versions that use the translation murder are wrong to narrowly focus the word .
The Unholy Desire to Legitimize Killing in War Christians who desire to legitimize killing in war will attempt to do so no matter what any Bible says .
Most , however , want some kind of biblical permission for their unholy desire .
If their Bible reads “ murder ” in the sixth commandment , then Christians will repeat the old canard that “ All murder involves the taking of life , but not all taking of life is murder ” and say that killing in war is not murder .
And not only is it not murder , to kill for your county — regardless of the location of the war — is the quintessence of patriotism .
To kill for your country — regardless of the cause of the war — is always the right thing to do .
To kill for your country — regardless of the nature of the war — is a perfectly okay thing for a Christian to do .
If their Bible reads “ kill ” in the sixth commandment , then Christians can simply redefine it as “ murder ” and treat the text as if that is what it actually says .
Therefore , everything said in the previous paragraph would then apply .
But just because the sixth commandment prohibited murder does n’t necessarily mean that it allows for killing in war .
Would anyone say that manslaughter is acceptable because the commandment only condemns murder ?
Why , then , do people appeal to the sixth commandment to justify killing in war unless they have an ideologically desire to legitimize killing in war ?
There are , of course , other attempts by Christians to legitimize killing in war by distorting the sixth commandment .
They reason that one cannot apply the sixth commandment to killing in war :
Because the prohibition against killing in the commandment obviously does n’t mean the taking of any life .
Because God commanded the Jews in the Old Testament to go to war against other nations .
Every Christian
I have ever talked to or read who made these statements did so , not because of his concern to correctly interpret the Scripture , but because of his desire to justify Christians killing for the state in Iraq .
In reply to the former reason I would point out that it is unlawful killing that is condemned in the sixth commandment .
Killing in self - defense , animal sacrifices , and capital punishment were all permitted by God in the Old Testament because they were lawful killings .
There is nothing lawful about an American soldier traveling thousands of miles away and killing an Iraqi in his own house .
In reply to the latter reason I would remind the desperate Christian warmonger who uses it that no nation or group of people can claim today to enjoy the privileged position that was occupied by the nation of Israel in the Old Testament .
And that goes for the United States as well .
The desire to legitimize killing in war is an unholy one .
Of all people , it is conservative , evangelical Christians who ought to be the first to denounce the state ’s latest pretext for war instead of defending it and in many cases supplying the state with a fresh supply of cannon fodder in the form of their young people .
It is a terrible blight on Christianity that many non-Christians are not so blindly in love with the state that they defend its president , its military , and its wars .
The Best of Laurence M. Vance
Coasts and Drowned Mountains
On May 12 , 2007 , Cassini completed its 31st flyby of Saturn 's moon Titan , which the team calls T30 .
The radar instrument obtained this image showing the coastline and numerous island groups of a portion of a large sea , consistent with the larger sea seen by the Cassini imaging instrument ( See http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/pia08930.html).
Like other bodies of liquid seen on Titan , this feature reveals channels , islands , bays , and other features typical of terrestrial coastlines , and the liquid , most likely a combination of methane and ethane , appears very dark to the radar instrument .
What is striking about this portion of the sea compared to other liquid bodies on Titan is the relative absence of brighter regions within it , suggesting that the depth of the liquid here exceeds tens of meters ( tens of yards ) .
Of particular note is the presence of isolated islands , which follow the same direction as the peninsula to their lower right , suggesting that they may be part of a mountain ridgeline that has been flooded .
This is analogous to , for example , Catalina Island off the coast of Southern California .
The image as shown is about 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) by 270 kilometers ( 170 miles ) at 300 - meter ( 980 - foot ) resolution .
The image is centered near 70 degrees north latitude and 310 west longitude .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington , D.C. The Cassini orbiter was designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
The radar instrument was built by JPL and the Italian Space Agency , working with team members from the United States and several European countries .

If you write a lot of JavaScript , then you ’ll find Matthias Miller ’s website
chockfull of useful information .
And even better , he ’s put together two great
tools .
The first is JavaScript
Lint , a tool that analyzes JavaScript code and reports potential
errors .
Mozilla ’s SpiderMonkey JavaScript
engine has similar functionality , which you can turn on by typing about : config
as the URL and then searching for javascript.options .
strict .
However , JavaScript
Lint detects more types of errors and is configurable .
To give it a try ,
I ran it over the MapBuzz code base and was very impressed by the errors it revealed .
I immediately added it to our automated testing processes ( i.e. , its spawned
by a rake task
now ) and have come to depend on it .
And if that was n’t enough , Matthias has adopted a second tool , called Drip ,
that detects memory leaks in Internet Explorer ’s JavaScript engine .
Memory
leaks occur in IE because it uses COM based
reference counting to delete objects .
Reference counting is
fast , and easy to understand , but does not handle
circular object
references .
As you use your website in IE , Drip keeps track of these circular
references .
Once you ’re done , it prints out a report showing you where the
memory leaks occurred .
Thanks for the great tools Matthias .
Update1 – A few people have pointed out some negative articles aboout JSLint .
I ’ve never used JSLint so I do n’t have any opinions about it .
What I ’m talking about above is a totally separate project called JavaScript Lint ( confusing , is n’t it ? ) .
I highly recommend JavaScript Lint , it turned up a number of bugs that I had n’t caught previously .
In addition , it is highly configurable so it ’s easy to turn off certains classes of errors .
And for the utmost in flexibility , you can annote your code to tell JavaScript Lint to skip certain sections of it .
Update 2 – A couple of people mentioned FireBug and Venkman as invaluable tools .
I could n’t agree more – I posted about Firebug a while back when I first started using it .
And Venkman has been an old favorite for years – it was great to see it finally updated to workin Firefox 1.5 .
Hopefully it will also be quickly updated to work with Firefox 2.0 .
And if you ’re debugging Internet Explorer , Visual Studio provides a good JavaScript debugger as does Microsoft ’s free script debugger package .
A graffiti artist calls for Banksy 's return
Enlarge Image
The image depicted a scene from Quentin Tarantino 's Pulp Fiction , with Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta clutching bananas instead of guns .
It had become one of the most famous graffiti paintings by the artist .
Transport for London said a tough line had to be taken on graffiti because it created an atmosphere of social decay .
The Pulp Fiction mural was visible near Old Street Tube station .
In place of the famous image , another graffiti artist has spray - painted the words " come back " in large letters .
Our graffiti removal teams are staffed by professional cleaners not professional art critics
Spokesman
Transport for London
George Thomas , who owns a barber 's shop near the site , told the Independent the image was a " real draw " to the area .
" People used to come from all over to see it and photograph it , " he said .
" There is no way it could have been mistaken for graffiti .
Whoever destroyed it is an idiot . "
Lost Banksys
In March a wall mural in east London by the artist was almost entirely removed by thieves .
One of Banksy 's early murals was mistakenly painted over in the same month by Bristol council 's graffiti-removal contractors .
And in February two smaller works in London were also painted over .
Commenting on the latest incident , a spokesman said Transport for London had to take a tough line on removing graffiti because it created a " general atmosphere of neglect and social decay which in turn encourages crime " .
" We have no intention of changing this policy as it makes the transport system safer and more pleasant for passengers . "
The spokesman added that the company recognised that there were some who viewed Banksy 's work as legitimate art but that their graffiti removal teams were " staffed by professional cleaners not professional art critics " .
Last year Banksy left a life - size replica of a Guantanamo Bay detainee at the California theme park Disneyland .
And in 2005 , he decorated Israel 's controversial West Bank barrier with satirical images of life on the other side .

The thesis statement can be defined as a declaration of what you are proposing .
Try to do this in no more than one sentence and make sure it fits in perfectly with the topic title of your essay .
For narrative essays , this may work a little bit differently , but the idea is the same .
Find a main subject ( or character ) , and introduce that subject as the reader finds it / him / her .
Supporting your thesis statement
Still within the introduction , you should give some supporting elements to the statement you just made .
Building approximately three supports around your statement will effectively build your introduction to the point it needs to be .
In a narrative essay , your supporting points could be something like supporting characters , characteristics of the main character , or a setting your character finds him - or herself .

A research group has devised a new type of mirror that reverses the magnetic field of a light wave upon reflection , rather than its electric field , as regular mirrors do .
Seems like a minor difference ?
It 's not .
“ Our mirror 's ability to reverse the magnetic field of a light wave but not its electric field is extremely unusual , ” physicist Alexander Schwanecke , the study 's corresponding scientist , said to PhysOrg.com .
Schwanecke is a researcher at the NanoPhotonics Portfolio Centre at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom .
“ It is the first demonstration of an entirely new type of optical tool . ”
A typical household mirror works like this : Photons ( particles of light ) bounce off an object or person , hit the mirror , and are absorbed by electrons on the surface of its metal backing .
The electrons almost instantly emit “ reflected ” photons ( not the same photons that came in , as those are absorbed and gone ) , which travel to our eyes , allowing us to see our image .
Photons that strike the mirror head - on are reflected squarely back , and those hitting at an angle are reflected at the same angle in the other direction , forming a V - shaped path .
This is the law of reflection .
To understand the work by Schwanecke and his colleagues , however , we must remember that light is both a particle and a wave , and that , as a wave , it consists of an electric - field component and a magnetic - field component .
After a reflection , the direction of the emitted light wave 's electric field is reversed ( this is one type of a “ phase change ” ) but the magnetic component is not .
This magnetic mirror produces the opposite scenario : a flipped magnetic field and an unchanged electric field .
The mirror has three layers : a layer of aluminum , a layer of silicon dioxide , and finally a layer of carefully arranged aluminum nanowires , shaped into a wavy pattern that the researchers call “ fish scales . ”
The fish - scale shape is important because it allows the light to interact with the nanowires in a particular way , due to the spacing between each “ scale . ”
As a result , the scales resonate with the light much like molecules would .
The mirror is tiny and square , about 500 micrometers ( millionths of a meter ) on each side , and contains about one million fish - scale - shaped elements .
It works best for visible light , but the group expects that , with some tweaks to the fish - scale pattern , near - infrared light would work , too .
The nanowire layer is the key to the mirror 's function .
The curved nanowire “ fish scales , ” like molecules , have dimensions that are smaller than the wavelength of visible light .
This means that they can interact with the light to influence or directly produce the material 's overall optical response , in this case , a reversal of the light 's magnetic field .
The researchers discovered the mirror 's ability by observing a reflection using an interferometer , a device that can detect the difference in behavior of two light waves by recording what happens when they “ interfere , ” or cross paths .
“ One characteristic of our mirror is that it is very sensitive to energy losses at the surface , ” said Schwanecke .
“ This property could make it very useful for improving devices that work by detecting light , such as photodetectors . ”
The mirror could also be useful , he says , in the detection of tiny particles or molecules near the mirror ’s surface .
If a particle or molecule was nearby and emitted a photon , the mirror would reflect the photon ’s electric component without reversing it .
A “ normal ” mirror would reverse it , thus weakening the signal and making it harder to detect the photon and , by extension , the particle or molecule .
The mirror ’s potential to work with near - infrared light ( light close to the visible range but still in the infrared ) could make it advantageous to the telecommunications industry , in which near - infrared light is commonly used .

Hope among Gore backers of another WH run Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday May 8 , 2007 Print This Email
This Half of Al Gore 's major fundraisers from his 2000 campaign are not backing a 2008 contender , in the hope the former vice president will enter the race , the Washington Times reports today .
" If he wants to run , I would be supportive of that ... I just do n't see any reason for him not to run , " H.E. " Sonny " Cauthen Jr. told the Times .
Cauthen said he has been courted by other campaigns but is waiting to hear Gore 's plans before committing to anyone else .
Cauthen may learn more about those plans when he meets this month with about 20 Gore supporters and fundraisers at a private dinner that has fueled speculation about Gore 's future , reports the Montgomery Advertiser .
Speculation over Gore 's possible candidacy has persisted even though the man who won the popular vote in 2000 has demurred when the subject has come up .
Gore generally says he has no intention of running , but he made a mock announcement speech before the orchestra cut him off at the Academy Awards this year .
At least 12 of 25 major donors who helped raise more than $ 100,000 for Gore are so far sitting out this campaign , the Times reports .
Although he has not campaigned since the disputed end of his last presidential campaign , Gore holds his own in polls of Democratic voters ; some show him on a par with former Sen.
John Edwards , though he trails frontrunners Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) .
Gore 's strong showing is in part because of his recent star turn as an environmental advocate .
The Inconvenient Truth , based on Gore 's global warming presentation , won the best documentary Oscar for 2006 .
A Gore spokeswoman told the Times , however , that Gore " has been very clear that he has no intention of running for president . "
Appearing earlier this year on CBS '
The Early Show , Gore shrugged off suggestions that he might seek the White House again .
" Well , you know , I worked in the White House for eight years and tried very hard to solve this crisis and found that ... the one element that was most needed was a sea change in public opinion to empower the politicians in both parties to do the right thing here , " Gore told The Early Show 's Harry Smith in February .
" And so I 'm involved in a different kind of campaign to try to change enough minds to make it a new reality so that whoever runs will hear it from the voters , and hear it as a demand that they act . "
Smith persisted , " So I take it you wo n't announce your candidacy at the Oscars or on our program now ? "
" No I 'm not announcing anything today , " Gore said .
Like all good media dinosaurs EMI Records is in no hurry to meet the future .
The status quo is just too familiar and comfortable ; better hang onto it as long as you can .
Last week EMI postponed the future just a little bit longer by refusing a $ 4.1 billion takeover bid by WMG and breaking off discussions with online music services over the possibility of selling DRM - free downloads .
You would think a company that ’s rapidly losing market share and issuing profit warnings every month would be taking drastic steps to turn things around , but that ’s clearly not the case with EMI .
As a card carrying member of the “ big four ” EMI is one of the last of a dying breed .
I ’m pretty sure there ’s something in The Endangered Species
Act that prevents the company from actually going bankrupt .
There ’s a chance that EMI ’s head - in - the - sand approach might actually work to the company ’s advantage .
It ’s possible that WMG ’s offer could pale in comparison to what a technology company like Microsoft or Apple might pay to buy control of EMI .
EMI ’s demand for an large up - front payment in order to license its music for DRM - free download is just the latest example of the difficulties that technology companies have had in dealing with the major labels .
Last November UMG did everything but blackmail Microsoft into paying a per-device fee just days before the Zune product launch .
Then there ’s the ongoing battle between the majors and Apple over the flexibility of iTunes pricing .
At some point companies like Apple and Microsoft are going to realize it might actually be easier and cheaper to buyout the major labels than it is to continue negotiating with them every time a new product or service is launched .
A Microsoft - WMG deal or an Apple - EMI deal makes a hell of a lot more sense than a WMG - EMI deal does .
The last thing the music industry needs is more consolidation among the major labels .
While a WMG - EMI merger might have improved earnings for the combined company , it would have done nothing to solve the real problem the music industry is facing — a lack of innovation .
Technology companies are in a position to deliver real innovation when they can release products and services without having to negotiate every new development with labels who are more concerned about propping up a archaic business model .
The next logical question is what would happen to iTunes if Microsoft were to buy a major label .
A Microsoft owned EMI could be just as difficult for Apple to negotiate with .
Except that , like Apple , Microsoft has indicated they realize that DRM is a limiting factor in consumer adoption of digital media technologies .
If Microsoft were to purchase EMI the most subversive thing they could do would be to give Steve Jobs exactly what he ’s asking for — DRM - free music .
Besides , if Microsoft were to buy one of the majors it probably would n’t be long before Apple followed suit .
The only question is whether or not Google and Yahoo would jump into the bidding as well .
In a decade or so it ’s possible the big four might be Microsoft , Apple , Google , and Yahoo .
Matoaca High School just outside Richmond , Va. , began eliminating its five - year - old laptop program last fall after concluding that students had failed to show any academic gains compared with those in schools without laptops .
Continuing the program would have cost an additional $ 1.5 million for the first year alone , and a survey of district teachers and parents found that one - fifth of Matoaca students rarely or never used their laptops for learning .
“ You have to put your money where you think it ’s going to give you the best achievement results , ” said Tim Bullis , a district spokesman .
Everett A. Rea Elementary School in Costa Mesa , Calif. , where more than 95 percent of students are Hispanic and come from low - income families , gave away 30 new laptops to another school in 2005 after a class that was trying them out switched to new teachers who simply did not do as much with the technology .
Northfield Mount Hermon School , a private boarding school in western Massachusetts , eliminated its five - year - old laptop program in 2002 after it found that more effort was being expended on repairing the laptops than on training teachers to teach with them .
Two years ago , school officials in Broward County , Fla. , the sixth - largest district in the country , shelved a $ 275 million proposal to issue laptops to each of their more than 260,000 students after re-evaluating the costs of a pilot project .
The district , which paid $ 7.2 million to lease 6,000 laptops for the pilot at four schools , was spending more than $ 100,000 a year for repairs to screens and keyboards that are not covered by warranties .
“ It ’s cost prohibitive , so we have actually moved away from it , ” said Vijay Sonty , chief information officer for the district , whose enrollment is 37 percent black , 31 percent white and 25 percent Hispanic .
Here in Liverpool , parents have long criticized the cost of the laptop program : about $ 300,000 a year from the state , plus individual student leases of $ 25 a month , or $ 900 from 10th to 12th grades , for the take - home privilege .
“ I feel like I was ripped off , ” said Richard Ferrante , explaining that his son , Peter , used his laptop to become a master at the Super Mario Brothers video game .
“ And every time I write my check for school taxes , I get mad all over again . ”
Students like Eddie McCarthy , 18 , a Liverpool senior , said his laptop made him “ a lot better at typing , ” as he used it to take notes in class , but not a better student .
“ I think it ’s better to wait and buy one for college , ” he said .

More than a decade ago , schools began investing heavily in laptops at the urging of school boards and parent groups who saw them as the key to the 21st century classroom .
Following Maine ’s lead in 2002 , states including Michigan , Pennsylvania and South Dakota helped buy laptops for thousands of students through statewide initiatives like “ Classrooms for the Future ” and “ Freedom to Learn . ”
In New York City , about 6,000 students in 22 middle schools received laptops in 2005 as part of a $ 45 - million , three - year program financed with city , state and federal money .
Very fast indeed .

Free Perfect Pitch Software / Programs
Many people say perfect pitch can only be gained at a very young age or that people are just magically born with the ability .
There have been several people to gain perfect pitch later in life and there 's some great free perfect pitch software to help you train .
Also see my relative pitch ear training software collection .
How Long It Takes To Develop Perfect Pitch
It can take weeks to show improvement .
You should not be in the mindset of spending 3 hours with full enthusiasm trying to get perfect pitch .
It 's better to just passively practice guessing notes throughout the day and checking yourself .
Practicing perfect pitch can be very frustrating for musicians because we 're used to looking at the musical movement in interval length to derive feeling and emotion from a song .
If you use that as a reference , you 'll continue to find no absolute .
If you 're going to practice for awhile , do it at night .
You 'll have a greater chance of thinking about it in your sleep .
If you really want absolute pitch , there 's no rush .
Whenever you get it , you get it .
InPitch - Freeware
Java based free perfect pitch software that allows you to select a midi instrument and guess a huge range of tones .
One thing I wish they had was a " Tell me Button " instead of having to guess continually being wrong , but then again they probably would say go to an easier level =P .
* This software requires a java soundbank to play the midis .
Pitch Coach - Freeware
Pitch coach is a free absolute pitch program that has tons of features and modes you can practice in .
One annoying thing is that it can not be resized .
Herken - Freeware
Herken is weird ...
You need to download alut.dll , an nvidia sound plugin or have it already installed for this to work .
You also need OpenAL a 3d audio API which is like 700k .
The program is installed along with the source code in program files with some non - working " real instruments " .
The actual program is only 360k ...
It contains a short song per pitch in a folder called words which is actually useful .
Ear Test - Demo
EarTest Accepts Midi
Input so I can guess the note with my keyboard .
I really like that feature .
It 's a pretty nice program , but it looks really really ugly on XP and can messup the fonts until restart .
Absolute Pitch - Demo
It does n't seem like this would ever help any , but it seems popular .
Probably because the software name is absolute pitch , another word for perfect pitch .
Pitch Train - Demo
Only lets you guess on 3 notes ?
That 's not even worthy of linking .
David Lucas Burge's PerfectPitch.com Review
David Lucas
Burge has a really really gay voice and will go on telling anecdotes about irrelevant stuff .
He spends more time hyping people than actually giving techniques or relevant information .
Stay away from this disgusting product .
Graham English Ear Training Hypnosis
This is some kind of joke ?
From the intro it sure sounded like it .
Basically the guy plays sine waves for x amount of minutes and you 're supposed to just sit , relax their and memorize the notes .
I guess the theory is that if you take away the timbre of the instrument and play pure tones it 's easier to memorize them .
It 's not , and you can generate sine waves using a shareware called goldwave and get the frequencies number in hz of any piano pitch .
Both are directed like infomercials and spend more time hyping .
update Graham English contacted me saying he did n't like my review and wanted me to change it .
I told him to change his website to reflect my views instead .
Not being smart enough to appreciate the irony , he called me an idiot .
Absolute Pitch Power Sucks , absolutely .
If you want to read more read my Absolute Pitch Power Review .
The nutbag actually says his course increases your IQ !!!

Real Perfect Pitch Learning Techniques by Jimmy Ruska
You already have Perfect Pitch
Many people have perfect pitch and do n't even know it .
If I play a tone , many people can play it back by whistling or singing without even having to readjust the tone .
They know where _that exact tone is_ when they shape their vocal cords or shape their lips to whistle with muscle memory and they dont even have to think about it .
If I play a tone , you can play it back in your head or sing it back to me .
That means you remembered the tone .
You have perfect pitch .
If you can remember a note , there 's no reason why it can not be put into permanent memory .
Is there some magical limit where we forget a particular tone ?
Maybe 5 minutes ?
Maybe it disappears when we play a certain amount of other notes ?
There 's no such thing as special music memory .
Our brain processes music and sounds just like anything else and thus , without any doubt , perfect pitch is just a matter of practice and memorization .
Many people sing their favorite songs in perfect pitch without even realizing it while the music is not playing because of the insane amount of times they 've heard and sang along to it on their ipod .
Their voice just jumps to the correct note automatically just as their vocal cords or lips switch to the correct position without thinking when repeating a tone .
Perfect Pitch is Commonly Used NOT Genetic
Maybe not in the UK or US but in other parts of the world it 's very common .
There are many pitch based languages used today .
For example in Vietnam if you 're off pitch in your pronunciation of a particular word people will interpret what you said as a completely different word !
Foreigners who have their pitch constantly checked and validated just get better at it .
Foreigners kids in a pitch based language pickup the language as perfectly as any native children , proving it 's not genetic .
Techniques
Practicing just involves constantly guessing and checking .
It 's that simple even if other people will try to sell it to you otherwise .
I do n't recommend seeing notes as having some innate feeling or color as the idiot lucas burge suggested because you 'll get yourself confused at the effect of changing intervals ( making the note ' feel happy ' or ' mean ' ) and the instrument timbre ( making a particular note seem buzzy or mellow ) in testing .
It 's better to concentrate more on where the tone is on your voice range or your particular instrument and how it sounds at that tone .
It does n't matter if you memorize just one note with perfect pitch whether its concert F or A 440hz .
You can then find where the other notes are with relative pitch .
The more you do it , the more it becomes automatic and do n't have to think about it , the more you will develop your perfect pitch .
If you flick glass ( a cup ) it makes a C# tone .
If you honk your horn or use a microwave they generate tones too .
Grab the first pitch of your favorite TV show .
Just find ways to constantly test and practice perfect pitch by guessing before you hear the tone then see how far off you were .
You will get better .
I 've been saying really good results and my success rate is about 90 % on pitch coach .
Why I think Kids Under 5 Obtain Perfect Pitch Easier
Kids exposed a lot to different tones will be able to decipher the absolute position of notes much faster .
It 's like they say kids pickup things a whole lot faster as babies because everything is new to them !
A study found that in the game of chess , beginners have to think much more than the grandmaster even though the grand master flaunted seeing 20 moves ahead .
When things are new , there 's an uncomfortablenesses and difficulty to disciplined study .
For babies everything is new : sounds , words , images , colors , feelings , smells ...
Their brain is in constant learning mode and they 're also constantly analyzing everything to try and understand things .
As we grow older our brain grows in neural concentration for repetitive stimuli , meaning we use less of our brain to process very common tasks like language and sight or even playing piano and chess if they 're a common hobby .
After learning something complicated people tend to be more comfortable practicing things they 're very good at , like the grandmaster with chess or a professional pianist working on difficult songs , rather than uncomfortably learning new things or instruments .
Many people I 've met do not like that feeling of comfortability or starting something new they WILL be bad at to begin with .
The best soccer players I 've played with are people who were constantly screwing up in practice , because they were trying new things rather than repeating what they were already good at .
To learn perfect pitch we have to go back to active learning mode and have the mental discipline to really keep with it , try different methods and think about each question .
If it can be learned why do n't more people have it ?
It 's like teaching yourself calculus or learning a foreign language on your own .
Most people have the enthusiasm and dedication required to get better , but unlike most studies , it 's very difficult to get constant validation and musicians have to learn to ignore interval movement .
It 's like learning english again but now with each letter of the alphabet pronounced differently .
Few people have the mental discipline to really keep to their studies and experience results .
Progress is slow and people do n't like the uncomfortable feeling called learning .
It 's like chess , a beginner can look at a position and see nothing even though they analyze it with all that they 've got for hours .
A grandmaster can spend a few minutes and find mate in 5 moves .
You have to work a lot more when you 're a beginner but after a lot of practice , things become more clear and you have to think much less to find the correct answer .
There 's no fast way to turn a beginner into a master .
It 's too difficult to teach a person what they think they already know .
Musicians are around notes every day what more practice could you have than that ?
Musicians can play all their lives and never get good at identifying intervals that 's just a matter of practice .
Since practicing perfect pitch is just really focusing on individual notes it 's easy for them to say , " this is stupid I do this everyday " even though in normal practice they 're almost completely focused on the movement of the intervals rather than a notes absolute location .
Colors and Associations
Again I do n't recommend you try and associate feelings to a particular note because you will find that in many cases the interval jump from the previous note is the one that defines emotion as we 're used to noticing it .
Colors such as orange , yellow , red , green , blue if directly associated with any particular note are again subject to problems because of timbre and octaves .
For example a note may sound buzzy or shimmery on your piano , but when a clarinet plays it it can sound very rich and full .
Or maybe an E sounds very dissonant at low octaves but sounds very pure at higher ones .
Finding an absolute is very difficult .
Tonal Memory
Tonal Memory is not the same thing as perfect pitch .
It 's just temporarily remembering a tone to use it as reference .
Tonal memory is usually what messes musicians up most with perfect pitch , because like it or not the previous note is remembered and automatically compared with the new note .
The interval difference can make a previously mellow note sound like a sharp , mean , uncomfortable note .
How I have The Notes Associated
I have several notes I have a very high accuracy at identifying .
These are my personal connections and might be of no use to you and I 'll go through them in no particular order .
I used to play tuba in middle school and freshman year of high school ( I quit when they forced us to do marching instead of just concert band ) .
We always warmed up by playing F. I have that F engraved in memory .
I also have the pitch of the tuning fork at A440 pretty well .
Bb was a common note on the tuba and the starting note of a song I learned , the nocturne sonata Op 9 by chopin .
It 's the only note I get almost instantly without a doubt correct .
I can say I have perfect pitch for that note and every time I play it I associate the song .
G sounds very pure at all octaves with no dissonance .
I can't assign an adjective easily to most tones but I feel G is definitely " sweet " and the adjective usually does n't waver changing timbre or octaves , for me .
It 's about the lowest note I can sing .
G# /
Ab seems very thin in density .
Seems like a very weak note .
B seems a little ' whinny ' but I 'm usually wrong when I jump to the B just because of that adjective , especially in higher octaves .
I have a hard time identifying it .
C , C# and D are closest to the tone of my voice so I think of them as very normal .
Whenever I hear one of the those tones I know it 's in that range .
C# is the tone you get when you flick glass ( I think Eb is silverware ) .
E and Eb sound pretty thin , soft , or sweet .
Since I have F pretty much in memory I sometimes just hear it as a flat F and know where it is .
F# is anything but twangy haha .
I usually think of it as not quite F but not quite G since those notes are more pronounced .
Ideas -
There are Many Ways to Try
If one method does n't work for you it 's no problem .
Switch different methods and see which one you feel you get progress from .
Guess and Check Everything -
Your primary way to get better
Try to find what notes are in a complex chord -
Extracting tones from inside a mesh of tones is difficult and good practice Inside Tone of Favorite Song - Try to find every instance of where a note repeats in the song .
Grab a Song For Every Pitch -
Find a song for each pitch .
Get the beginning of the song or a very notable part and loop them randomly Practice At Night - Practicing at night will allow you to learn better because usually we are more relaxed and have a better chance of dreaming about them Sing a Pitch - Sing and guess if you 're correct from time to time .
It 's more difficult while a song is playing in the background because people tend to just jump to the key of the song .
Play One Tone Until You Memorize it -
Play only one tone in your computer or headset for several days .
You can use the actual tone or crop the beginning of songs that begin with the tone .
There 's no better way to memorize something than repetition .
Identify Notes as Colors Feelings Thicknesses or Emotions - I do n't personally recommend this because of the effect of instrument timbre and interval changes .
What may seem ineffective for me may work for you though .
Do n't be quick to guess -
Think of the tone on different instruments or associated songs before making your guess .
Have it play back in your head at different octaves .
Use Your Voice - Hum , sing , and try to talk in the tone of the note .
It usually helps located approximately where the ton is .
Do n't Be Afraid of Taking Your Time -
Once you get better , you get faster .
The associations will be automatic if you take the time and really think about each note .
If not you 'll just be guessing a random card out of the deck for hours .
Gamers can Switch Audio :
If you 're a gamer and spend long hours playing games you can switch the audio on your PC games with custom audio that you think will help train pitch .
Just go to program files and try to find the audio folder for the game .

The reason Paul Wolfowitz should resign as president of the World Bank has nothing to do with Iraq , or his last job as No. 2 in Donald Rumsfeld ’s Pentagon , or even his clashes with the bank ’s directors and staff .
He should resign because he made clean governance his main cause at the bank and has fallen far short of his own standards .
The facts are not in dispute .
When Mr. Wolfowitz was appointed he was in a personal relationship with a woman employed there .
Since working under Mr. Wolfowitz ’s supervision would violate the bank ’s conflict - of - interest rules , she was reassigned to the State Department , where she initially worked under Liz Cheney , the vice president ’s daughter .
She remained on the bank ’s payroll , and it now turns out that Mr. Wolfowitz helped arrange for her to receive a whopping $ 60,000 raise .
Mr. Wolfowitz has launched a full rearguard action , apologizing to the staff , pledging full cooperation with any investigation , and appealing to staff members not to hold his “ previous job ” against him .
The issue is n’t his previous job .
Mr. Wolfowitz had already created enough turmoil in his current job to raise serious questions about his stewardship .
The directors and the staff were especially incensed about the cavalier way in which he pursued his anticorruption agenda , paying little heed to anyone save a tight circle of advisers he brought in with him .
What might Mr. Wolfowitz himself say if he discovered that a government receiving World Bank loans was making similar sweet arrangements for the personal friends of its president ?
There is no way Mr. Wolfowitz can recover his credibility and continue to be effective at the bank .
And according to the New Statesman 's sources , the plan is the culmination of 4 years ' of planning ...
British military sources told the New Statesman , on condition of anonymity , that " the US military switched its whole focus to Iran " as soon as Saddam Hussein was kicked out of Baghdad .
It continued this strategy , even though it had American infantry bogged down in fighting the insurgency in Iraq .
The US army , navy , air force and marines have all prepared battle plans and spent four years building bases and training for " Operation Iranian Freedom " .
Admiral Fallon , the new head of US Central Command , has inherited computerised plans under the name TIRANNT ( Theatre Iran Near Term ) .
Which helps explain why the new head of operations in Iraq , Admiral Fallon , seemed so disinterested in all things Baghdad during his confirmation testimony :
The admiral picked by President Bush to oversee his new strategy for Iraq testified yesterday that he does not know much about the plan that the administration says will determine whether the U.S. wins the war .
" I have not gotten into the detail of these plans , " Adm. William J. Fallon told the Senate Armed Services Committee , adding that he has been concentrating on his current job as head of the U.S. Pacific Command ...
The admiral , whose expertise centers on sea power and diplomacy in dealing with China , said he will leave the Iraq battle decisions to Army Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus , who leaves for Baghdad this week as the top U.S. commander in Iraq .
The admiral appeared before the panel for confirmation hearings on his appointment to lead the U.S. Central Command .
" I do not know the details of how he plans to use " the new troops , Adm .
Fallon said .
" I 'm sure he 's going to have to consult with his generals on the ground once he gets into position and then figure it out . "
It seems the Admiral has bigger fish to fry than a four - year - old war with 140,000 American troops on the ground , over which he holds command .
For instance , the arrival today of the USS Stennis in the Gulf .
It joins the carrier strike group led by the USS Eisenhower .
Also on the way , or already there , is the strike group led by the assault ship USS Bataan .
The Bataan , by the way , is part of a new class of ships designed to accomplish amphibious landings .
Nor will these be the only ships available to the Admiral , according to the New Statesman report :
Two carriers in the region , the USS John C Stennis and the USS Dwight D Eisenhower , could quickly be joined by three more now at sea : USS Ronald Reagan , USS Harry S Truman and USS Theodore Roosevelt , as well as by USS Nimitz .
Each carrier force includes hundreds of cruise missiles ...
Today , marines have the USS Boxer and USS Bataan carrier forces in the Gulf and probably also the USS Kearsarge and USS Bonhomme Richard .
Three others , the USS Peleliu , USS Wasp and USS Iwo Jima , are ready to join them .
Earlier this year , HQ staff to manage these forces were moved from Virginia to Bahrain .
' Earlier this year ' .
That would mean in the last six weeks .
Meaning the finger may have already been placed on the trigger .
And from the BBC report :
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the trigger for such an attack reportedly includes any confirmation that Iran was developing a nuclear weapon - which it denies .
Alternatively , our correspondent adds , a high - casualty attack on US forces in neighbouring Iraq could also trigger a bombing campaign if it were traced directly back to Tehran .
Or maybe even something simpler , such as abducting and killing soldiers in Karbala :
BAGHDAD , Jan. 30 — Investigators say they believe that attackers who used American - style uniforms and weapons to infiltrate a secure compound and kill five American soldiers in Karbala on Jan. 20 may have been trained and financed by Iranian agents , according to American and Iraqi officials knowledgeable about the inquiry .
The officials said the sophistication of the attack astonished investigators , who doubt that Iraqis could have carried it out on their own — one reason a connection to Iran is being closely examined .
So , is the U.S. really planning a massive attack on Iran ?
Well , consider the following from a February 10th report in the Guardian .
But as you do , go back in your mind to 2002 , and substitute the word ' Iran ' with the word ' Iraq ' , and ' Tehran ' with the word ' Baghdad ' :
Neo -conservatives , particularly at the Washington - based American Enterprise Institute , are urging Mr Bush to open a new front against Iran .
So too is the vice - president , Dick Cheney .
The state department and the Pentagon are opposed , as are Democratic congressmen and the overwhelming majority of Republicans .
The sources said Mr Bush had not yet made a decision .
The Bush administration insists the military build - up is not offensive but aimed at containing Iran and forcing it to make diplomatic concessions .
The aim is to persuade Tehran to curb its suspect nuclear weapons programme and abandon ambitions for regional expansion .
To those who remember , it 's all too familiar .
And when and if it comes , how ' massive ' will the attack be ?
Here 's a final , chilling , observation from the New Statesman :
With little military effort , the US air force can hit the last - known position of Iranian military units , political leaders and supposed sites of weapons of mass destruction .
One can be sure that , if war comes , George Bush will not want to stand accused of using too little force and allowing Iran to fight back .

Have you ever bought an airline ticket only to see the price fall and your anger rise ?
Now there is something you can do about it .
Few customers realize it , but many airlines will give refunds if they cut the price after you have bought a ticket .
Alaska , JetBlue , Southwest , United and US Airways all offer vouchers for the full price difference -- if the price drops $ 200 , you can get a $ 200 coupon towards a future trip .
Others offer vouchers , or cash , after deducting change fees ( which can run up to $ 100 ) .
In industry jargon , ...
Researchers from the Nanomaterials Research Centre at Massey University in New Zealand have developed synthetic dyes that can be used to generate electricity at one tenth of the cost of current silicon - based solar panels .
These photosynthesis - like compounds work in low - light conditions and can be cheaply incorporated into window - panes and building materials , thereby turning them into generators of electricity .
Dr Wayne Campbell and researchers in the center have developed a range of coloured dyes for use in dye - sensitized solar cells .
The synthetic dyes are made from simple organic compounds closely related to those found in nature .
The green dye Dr Campbell is synthetic chlorophyll derived from the light - harvesting pigment plants use for photosynthesis .
Other dyes being tested in the cells are based on hemoglobin , the compound that give blood its color .
Dr Campbell says that unlike the silicon - based solar cells currently on the market , the 10x10 cm green demonstration cells generate enough electricity to run a small fan in low - light conditions – making them ideal for cloudy climates .
The dyes can also be incorporated into tinted windows that trap to generate electricity .
He says the green solar cells are more environmentally friendly than silicon - based cells as they are made from titanium dioxide – a plentiful , renewable and non-toxic white mineral obtained from New Zealand ’s black sand .
Titanium dioxide is already used in consumer products such as toothpaste , white paints and cosmetics .
“ The refining of pure silicon , although a very abundant mineral , is energy - hungry and very expensive .
And whereas silicon cells need direct sunlight to operate efficiently , these cells will work efficiently in low diffuse light conditions , ” Dr Campbell says .
“ The expected cost is one 10th of the price of a silicon - based solar panel , making them more attractive and accessible to home - owners . ”

On most days , I feel completely confident .
I ’m happy with my wild curls , pale skin , and big eyebrows — funnily enough , attributes I used to think were flaws have become my best assets .
But , every once in awhile , I get caught in a spiral of I ’m not good enough–type feelings .
There have been several think pieces about the damage social media has done to our psyche — how it breeds jealousy and negative thoughts .
I do n’t really feel that way .
I love Instagram , I love sharing parts of my life with those who care to look ( and , hopefully , to like ) .
But there is one thing I realized through all of it — I ’m , unfortunately , and for a time , hopelessly , unphotogenic .
When I posted a picture , it was after several ( that ’s being generous ) failed attempts .
I thought I was smizing when I was scowling and standing up straight when I was slumped over .
I just did n’t know how to hold myself for photos .
So , in order to keep my passion for a pretty feed and lots o’ likes going strong , I came up with a few rules to live by each time the camera clicks .
Previously , we talked a lot about finding your light .
But these have less to do with outside circumstances and more to do with you .
To say they ’re easy to follow is an understatement — I ’m not a model after all .
And , who needs more hardships in life ?
Keep scrolling to get schooled on how to be more photogenic , the easy way .
Play With Poses
Standing in front of the camera is inherently awkward — because of course , it is .
It feels unnatural most of the time .
But , there are ways to look less uncomfortable than you feel .
Move around a bit , play with your sunglasses , etc .
It ’ll make for a more interesting photograph and it ’ll put you at ease .
Posing will get less difficult and you ’ll come up with a few familiar go - to 's over time .
Some can take unabashed , sultry - eyed selfies and look genuinely great — I am not one of those people .
So instead , I ’ve had to come up with a way to look ( and feel ) like myself in every picture .
Know Your Angles
It ’s hard to look good straight on .
Or at least , it ’s hard for me .
Instead , I ’ve started to get a knack for how to position my face in a way that shows off my bone structure .
My " side " is my left .
So , when posing for pictures , I make sure to keep my eyes on the lens but turn my face a bit to highlight that side .
I also began to notice photographers would consistently tell me to " lower my chin . "
Raising it , I realized , had become a reflex in order to ward off phantom fear of a double chin — but that ’s just my own insecurity .
Now , I keep my chin down while I pose and it ’s made a huge difference .
Go With Awkward Feelings
There 's no reason to pretend you 're someone you 're not in front of the camera .
I posed for 20 to 30 pictures before landing on the above Boomerang .
I just was n’t feeling it — until I decided to get a little weird .
Posing for photographs does n't have to be a serious , stressful thing .
Letting your personality and quirks shine through can make a picture .
Do I look ungraceful ?
Sure , but , I would n’t have it any other way .
Try Doing Something
Some of my favorite pictures are a far cry from the traditional composition .
Instead of standing , popping a hip out , and flashing a smile , I feel more comfortable mid-move .
Sipping a drink , flipping my hair , laughing over the ridiculousness of posing in general —
It ’s all fodder for natural - looking pictures .
It ’ll keep them interesting for your friends to look at and easier for you to pull off .
Experiment With a Different Look
I have a go - to beauty look and very rarely deviate from that .
I found that after a while , I got sick of it .
My pictures all looked the same and my likes started to trail off .
I upped the ante a bit with a look that was really different than my usual no -makeup makeup .
I slicked my hair back , applied a bright orange -y , red lipstick and really loved the results .
It 's the easiest and most fun way to boost your confidence while you pose .
Consider Your Posture
A huge reason I was unhappy with most of my pictures was that I had such bad posture .
I slump my shoulders habitually and it can absolutely ruin a photo .
Now , when I pose , even if I ’m looking down or away from the camera , I always think about my shoulders first .
I stand tall , put my shoulders back , and get ready for a really great photograph .
FYI : I 've gotten hundreds of DMs about my brows — so , here 's everything I use .

DOES Larry
Page ever get vertigo when contemplating his life and future ?
After all , Mr Page and Sergey Brin , the co-founders of Google , the world 's most popular internet search engine , can legitimately claim to have caused an information and media revolution .
At 32 , they are already worth far more than $ 10 billion each and fly around in their own Boeing 767 .
Bill Gates fears them ; others in the industry admire or envy them , and some seem to consider them capable of anything .
Expectations are dizzyingly high .
“ It 's not a good thing to think about , ” said Mr Page behind the stage after his keynote address in Las Vegas at the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) last week .
But if he must ponder his company 's achievements and power , he says in his halting , thoughtful voice , it gives him an even greater “ sense of responsibility ” to make the world a better place .
“ The reason your question does n't make sense ” , adds Eric Schmidt , the comparative veteran who is Google 's chief executive and jointly runs the company with the founders , “ is that he 's too busy ” to have vertigo .
Busy , that is , changing the world .
That self - avowed goal causes a great deal of confusion .
For instance , for the entire week leading up to his Las Vegas speech , much of the world 's press decided to believe a rumour that Mr Page would announce a new , cheap computer powered by Google software ( thus , went the logic , finally contesting Microsoft 's reign over operating systems ) .
Mr Page announced nothing of the sort .
Yes , Google will “ support ” an existing ( and well - known ) project by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to produce a laptop for the poor , but so will many companies , and who would n't ?
At one point , Mr Page mocked such inflated expectations by “ announcing ” Google Fastfood , a button in car dashboards that delivers instantaneous hamburgers .
Mr Page used much of his speech to play the part of visionary geek - in - chief , dressed in a white lab coat and standing on spring - heeled sneakers , exhorting the 2,500 exhibitors at the CES to agree on industry standards and to make their gadgets less off - putting .
He did also announce some intriguing new products — such as an expansion of Google Video , a download service that allows anybody to sell videos — thus continuing a seemingly endless dribble of product launches that cumulatively suggest astonishing ambition .
Not only is Google already pursuing its stated goal to “ organise all the world 's information ” ( not just web pages ) by scanning library books to make them searchable , by bringing local information to mobile phones and people on the go , and so forth ; it is also dabbling in side projects such as providing free wireless internet access to its home town in Silicon Valley , and perhaps to San Francisco and beyond .
Mr Page 's ambition started early .
When he was 12 , he read a biography of Nikola Tesla , a prolific inventor who never got credit for much , but is now a hero among geeks .
Mr Page decided that he would be different : a great inventor and an acknowledged world - changer to boot .
As the son of a computer - science professor , he channelled his energy into technology .
By the time he was in college , Mr Page was building working inkjet printers out of Lego bricks — probably just to show that he could .
A few years later , while doing his doctoral thesis at Stanford , Mr Page thought up his “ PageRank ” system of ranking web pages by relevance , the foundation of Google 's search engine .
Teaming up with his intellectual soul mate , the Russian - born and mathematically gifted Mr Brin , Mr Page went “ on leave ” from his research and founded Google .
Mr Page was chief executive , until the founders were advised that they needed a more experienced adult at the helm : hence the arrival of Mr Schmidt , formerly the boss of Novell , a software firm .
But Google stayed very much its founders ' creation .
It was Mr Page who wrote the letter — now legendary — in Google 's regulatory filings for its stockmarket listing that announced the company motto : “ Do n't be evil ” .
Despite rapid growth — from about 200 employees when Mr Page was chief executive to nearly 5,000 now — Google has lost none of its puritanical fanaticism .
This zeal is starting to annoy some people .
One visitor to the company 's “ Googleplex ” in Silicon Valley “ felt as if I were in the company of missionaries ” .
A consequence of the theory that Google is aiming to run the world could be that “ Google may be less liked in the industry than Microsoft inside 12 months , ” says Pip Coburn , a technology analyst .
Bloggers have started accusing Google of hubris and arrogance .
Paul Saffo at Silicon Valley 's Institute for the Future says that “ Google is a religion posing as a company . ”
Playing God
If Google is a religion , what is its God ?
It would have to be The Algorithm .
Faith in the possibility of an omniscient and omnipotent algorithm appears to be what Messrs Page and Brin have in common .
It 's “ in their DNA , ” says Michael Moritz , a venture capitalist famous for investing early in both Yahoo ! and Google .
Whereas Yahoo ! was started by two Stanford students who turned a hobby into a business , Google was started by two Stanford students who turned an intellectual obsession into a quest , says Mr Moritz .
And what is that quest ?
Merely upstaging Microsoft would be almost banal .
“ We 're not trying to build a better operating system , ” says Mr Schmidt ( although that will not kill the rumour ) .
Part of the plan is certainly “ organising the world 's information ” .
But some people think they detect an even more grandiose design .
Google is already working on a massive and global computing grid .
Eventually , says Mr Saffo , “ they 're trying to build the machine that will pass the Turing test ” — in other words , an artificial intelligence that can pass as a human in written conversations .
Wisely or not , Google wants to be a new sort of deus ex machina .
Stephen Fletcher II tried to grow some psychedelic mushrooms in his Lawrence apartment .
Tremain V. Scott shot and killed a man at close range during an armed confrontation , then , according to an eyewitness , took the victim ’s gun and shot him with it as he lay on the ground .
An autopsy showed the victim had been shot 18 times .
Both Fletcher and Scott are in their early 20s and have little or no criminal - conviction record , their attorneys say .
So who ’s facing the stiffer sentence ?
Fletcher , by double .
Under state drug - sentencing guidelines , he ’s facing at least 11 1 / 2 years in prison unless a judge finds “ substantial and compelling ” reasons to lighten the sentence .
Under a separate set of guidelines for all nondrug crimes , Scott faces between four and six years in prison for his violent crime .
“ There ’s no question that that ’s not equitable , ” said Donald E. Jackson , a member of the Kansas Sentencing Commission , which advises the Legislature on sentencing policy .
The discrepancy is due to illogical , overly harsh drug sentences that do n’t serve justice , advocates say .
In short , under Kansas criminal law , experimenting with forbidden fungus can be a more serious crime than murder .
“ It does n’t surprise me because I know the laws , ” said Lawrence defense attorney John Frydman .
“ The bottom line is we are punishing our nonviolent offenders more harshly in many cases than our violent offenders . ”
‘ Alice in Wonderland ’
There are more examples playing out in Douglas County District Court .
Dezerro D. Smith , 33 , of Kansas City , Kan. , is scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday for cocaine possession and faces the possibility of serving about 10 years in prison .
The reason is that , until recently , cocaine possession was what attorneys call an “ enhanced offense . ”
Get caught once , it ’s a level four felony .
Get caught a second time , it ’s a level two .
Get caught a third time — as Smith did — it ’s a level one felony , the highest possible .
By contrast , point a gun at someone again and again , or knowingly infect someone with HIV again and again , and each time the charge stays at the same severity level .
The rules changed somewhat with passage this year of Senate Bill 123 , which as of Nov. 1 did away with most enhanced drug- possession penalties .
It requires drug treatment and probation instead of prison for people like Smith .
But because Smith ’s offense happened before July 1 , it ’s possible he ’ll end up behind bars — again .
Lawrence defense attorney Jonathan Becker sees another problem with the new drug - treatment bill .
Some drug users ’ past nondrug offenses can come back to haunt them and disqualify them for treatment .
For example , if someone gets convicted of home burglary , then later gets charged with drug possession , the past conviction automatically disqualifies the person from the drug - treatment law .
A past conviction for a felony deemed slightly less severe under state law ’ such as stalking , does not automatically disqualify the person .
In other words , a drug addict who once stalked someone is eligible for drug treatment , but not a drug addict who once burglarized a home .
“ Have you ever read ‘ Alice in Wonderland ? ' ”
Becker asked .
Mushrooms vs. meth
Defendant : Stephen Fletcher II , age 24 .
Crime : Trying to make hallucinogenic “ magic mushrooms .
” Applicable statute : K.S.A. 65-4159 , attempted manufacture of a controlled substance , a level one , drug felony .
Presumed penalty : Between 11.5 years and 12.8 years if he has no criminal record .
A psilocybin - mushroom growing operation is n’t as dangerous as a methamphetamine lab , and mushrooms are n’t as dangerous a drug as heroin .
That ’s what a police detective told Stephen Fletcher as investigators served a search warrant in Fletcher ’s apartment in September 2002 , according to a police report .
Those statements may have put Fletcher at ease during the interview , but they do n’t reflect legal reality .
Under Kansas law , trying to grow hallucinogenic mushrooms — which for Fletcher involved equipment such as horse droppings , brown - rice powder and moldy jars — is treated the same as cooking meth , which involves a potentially explosive mix of chemicals .
Both offenses fit under the same criminal statute : manufacturing or attempting to manufacture a controlled substance .
It used to be that a first conviction on that charge was a level 2 felony , but that changed in 1999 when the Legislature toughened the law to make it a level 1 felony on first offense , which means a minimum sentence of 11 1/2 years in prison .
Even Dan Dunbar , the assistant in Dist .
Atty .
Christine Kenney ’s office who prosecuted Fletcher ’s case , said he was not convinced Fletcher is the kind of person lawmakers were trying to target .
“ I think they were after the meth cooks .
I think the psilocybin people just got scooped up with them , ” Dunbar said .
“ It ’s not my goal to see this guy go to prison . ”
Facing prison
Defendant : Tremain V. Scott , age 22 .
Crime : Shooting and killing Quincy M. Sanders , 21 .
Applicable statute : Charged with second - degree murder , but pleaded guilty to K.S.A. 21-3403 , voluntary manslaughter , a level three , person felony .
Presumed penalty : 4.6 to 5.1 years if he has no criminal record .
Second - degree murder would have been between 9 and 10.25 years .
If that ’s true , why did n’t Dunbar just let Fletcher plead to a lesser offense ?
Dunbar said his job was to convict people of the crime they committed , and if the sentence is too strong , to try to address that at sentencing .
Under Kansas law , a judge can deviate from sentencing guidelines if there are “ substantial and compelling ” reasons to do so .
Fletcher ’s attorney , Elbridge “ Skip ” Griffy IV , said he planned to file a motion asking Judge Michael Malone to do that when Fletcher appears for sentencing Dec. 12 .
There ’s a complication , however .
The 1999 change to the law added language that says a sentence for drug - manufacturing “ shall not be subject to statutory provisions for suspended sentence , community work service , or probation . ”
On Dec. 5 , Tremain Scott will appear for sentencing for killing Quincy M. Sanders in March during an armed confrontation between the two men in the 2500 block of Ridge Court .
“ I shot the ( expletive ) in the head , ” an eyewitness testified he heard Scott say before picking up Sanders ’ gun and shooting him with it .
Amid concerns cited by Scott ’s defense attorney that he would be able to argue at trial that the shooting was in self - defense , prosecutors allowed him to plead guilty recently to the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter .
To the dismay of Sanders ’ family members , it cut Scott ’s potential sentence in half .
But assuming Scott and Fletcher have the same criminal - history background , even if Scott had been convicted of second - degree murder , Fletcher still would be facing more time for trying to grow mushrooms .
Room for improvement
Lawrence attorney John Solbach , who helped draft Kansas ’ sentencing guidelines 10 years ago as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , admits the system is n’t perfect and is n’t always fair .
“ The drug crimes were always problematic and very emotional , ” he said .
“ There is n’t any legislator who wants to go back home and say , ‘ I voted to reduce sentences for possession or sale or manufacture of drugs . ' ”
The sentencing grid — an actual sheet of paper with rows and columns — combines a defendant ’s criminal history score with the severity level of the crime at hand .
Each defendant falls into in a box that contains a range of months considered to be the presumed sentence .
There ’s one grid for nondrug offenses , and a separate grid for drug offenses .
People who fall into certain boxes are expected to get probation .
People who fall into others are expected to get prison , and there ’s a border area in between in which it ’s up to a judge to decide .
These guidelines were intended to create consistency in sentencing statewide and solve racial disparities that showed people of color were more likely to be sent to prison .
Before the grid took effect , judges would sentence someone to a broad range of years in prison — say , six to 20 years — and the actual release date would be determined through the parole process .
Today , the sentence is right there on paper .
But along with consistency comes inflexibility .
“ There are always unique crimes or situations that our more rigid system does n’t handle very equitably , ” said Rep. Tom Sloan , R - Lawrence .
One way to solve these problems , Solbach said , is through the 17 - member Kansas Sentencing Commission , which was created to analyze the sentencing guidelines in detail , monitor prison populations , and make recommendations for change .
Expert advice from the commission — which includes judges , lawmakers , community members and attorneys — helps take heat off politicians who do n’t want to appear soft on crime , Solbach said .
Commission member Jeff Goering , a Republican House member from Wichita , said he thought sentencing discrepancies similar to the one Fletcher is facing were common .
Goering said he did n’t like that the guidelines take away judges ’ discretion for dealing with criminals individually .
Another unpleasant fact of life for commissioners , he said , is that concern about overcrowding in the state ’s near - capacity prison system is one of the major factors driving criminal - justice policy .
The recent drug - treatment bill — which was recommended by the Sentencing Commission — was in large part an effort to manage the size and cost of the prison population .
“ Until we build a new prison in this state , I think you ’re always going to be looking at nonviolent offenses to tweak to free up bed space , ” he said .
Glyn Normington :
It ’s interesting to speculate what would have happened if a static module system had been put into Java much earlier .
My guess is that it would n’t have bothered to address versioning or dynamicity requirements which only become crucial in the context of relatively large systems with continuous operation .
Indeed it is interesting to speculate .
Mono and .net are both implementations of the Common Language Infrastructure .
Â
They have had a static module system from the beginning and they power many applications from best in show MP3 players to relatively large systems with continuous operations such as myspace and shortly second life .
CLI implementations and JVM implementations could n’t be more different .
Â
While at first glance they appear very similar , they both have an intermediate language and they both use a JIT , the similarities seem to end there .
CLI implementations have been designed to apply classic compiler optimizations using code analysis techniques just like those found in a typical C++ compiler .
For example their approach for method inlining is very simple .
They also JIT all code once on first use .
They can do this as most of the CLI languages have been designed for compilation using classicÂ analysis techniques .
JVMs , on the other hand , use runtime knowledge to decide what to optimize .
Â
Rather than using the classic techniques they guess a lot ( e.g. on whether a method can be inlined ) and they have to keep these guesses around in case they load a class that invalidates them .
Â
They also have different levels of optimizations that they perform , saving the most aggressive for code that is getting used the most ( i.e. the hotspots ) .
Â
They use these approaches as the class loading rules in java make the application of code analysis techniques virtually impossible .
So which is better , I think the jury is still out , and they both have strong supporters .
Â
However , CLI implementations have one big advantage over JVMs .Â
As they rely on classic static analysis CLI modules can be ahead of time compiled to native binaries .
This brings many advantages such as improved startup and better memory sharing between processes , the latter being a key requirement if multiple applications are being run on a single workstation .
As such , the forthcoming language level changes for Java modularity along with the corresponding changes to the runtime provide a unique opportunity .
Â
They could be designed as a static module system like the one in the CLI .
Â
To do this they would need to change the classloading rules for classes in modules , but this would allow JVM implementations to ahead of time compile java modules to native code bringing all the advantages I mentioned above .
I really hope the expert groups design with this flexibility in mind and I see that I am not the only one that has seen the potential .
Update : I posted a follow up pointing out how subtle language differences have lead to the two different approaches to the runtime .
Recently , our source code analyzer was used to find flaws in several open source applications that are widely used in Internet communication .
The latest releases of Apache , OpenSSL , and sendmail were analyzed .
An overview of each application follows .
Open Source Software Under Test
APACHE .
According to apache.org , the Apache open source hypertext transfer protocol ( HTTP ) server is the most popular web server in the world , powering more than 70 % of the web sites on the Internet .
Given the ubiquity of Apache and the world ’s dependence on the Internet , the reliability and security of Apache represent an important concern for all of us .
The Apache web server consists of approximately 200,000 lines of code , 80,000 individual executable statements , and 2,000 functions .
2.2.3 is the version under test .
OPENSSL .
OpenSSL is an open source implementation of Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL ) and Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) .
TLS is the modern reimplementation of SSL , although SSL is often used as a general term covering both protocols .
SSL forms the basis of much of the secure communication on the Internet .
For example , SSL is what enables users to send private credit card information securely from their browsers to an online merchant ’s remote server .
In addition to being intimately involved with data communication , OpenSSL contains implementations of a variety of cryptographic algorithms used to secure the data in transit .
OpenSSL is available for Windows ; however , OpenSSL is the standard SSL implementation for Linux and UNIX worldwide .
In addition , because of its liberal licensing terms ( not GPL ) , OpenSSL has been used as a basis for a number of commercial offerings .
Like Apache , OpenSSL is a keystone of worldwide secure Internet communication .
Flaws in this software could have widespread deleterious consequences .
OpenSSL consists of approximately 175,000 lines of code , 85,000 individual executable statements , and 5,000 functions .
0.9.8 b is the version under test .
SENDMAIL .
According to wikipedia.org , sendmail is the most popular electronic mail server software used in the Internet .
Sendmail has been the de-facto electronic mail transfer agent for UNIX ( and now Linux ) systems since the early 1980s .
Given the dependence on electronic mail , the stability and security of sendmail is certainly an important concern for many .
The name “ sendmail ” might lead one to think that this application is not very complicated .
Anyone who has ever tried to configure a sendmail server knows otherwise .
Sendmail consists of approximately 70,000 lines of code , 32,000 individual executable statements , and 750 functions .
8.13.8 is the version under test .
How Source Analysis Works
A source code analyzer is usually run as a separate tool , independent of the compiler used to build application code .
Sometimes the analyzer is built into the same compiler used to build production code ( as is the case with the Green Hills analyzer ) .
The analyzer takes advantage of compiler - style dataflow algorithms in order to perform its bug - finding mission .
One advantage of using a single tool for both compiling and analyzing is that the source code parsing need only be done once instead of twice .
In addition , source analysis can be configured to cause build errors when flaws are detected so that developers will be encouraged to find and fix them quickly .
The analyzer looks for many types of flaws .
It looks for bugs that would normally compile without error or warning .
The following is a list of some of the more common errors that the analyzer will detect :
* Potential NULL pointer dereferences
* Access beyond an allocated area ( e.g. array or dynamically allocated buffer ) ; otherwise known as a buffer overflow
* Writes to potentially read - only memory
* Reads of potentially uninitialized objects
* Resource leaks ( e.g. memory leaks and file descriptor leaks )
* Use of memory that has already been deallocated
* Out of scope memory usage ( e.g. returning the address of an automatic variable from a subroutine )
* Failure to set a return value from a subroutine
* Buffer and array underflows
The analyzer understands the behavior of many standard runtime library subroutines .
For example it knows that subroutines like free should be passed pointers to memory allocated by subroutines like malloc .
The analyzer uses this information to detect errors in code that calls or uses the result of a call to these subroutines .
Limiting False Positives
The analyzer can also be taught about properties of user - defined subroutines .
For example if a custom memory allocation system is used , the analyzer can be taught to look for misuses of this system .
By teaching the analyzer about properties of subroutines , users can reduce the number of false positives .
A false positive is a potential flaw identified by the analyzer that could not actually occur during program execution .
One of the major design goals of a source code analyzer is to limit the number of false positives so that developers can minimize time looking at them .
If an analyzer generates too many false positives , it will become irrelevant because the output will be ignored by engineers .
The analyzer is much better at limiting false positives than traditional UNIX programming tools like lint .
However , since an analyzer is not able to understand complete program semantics , it is not possible to totally eliminate false positives .
In some cases , a flaw found by the analyzer may not result in a fatal program fault , but could point to a questionable construct that should be fixed to improve code clarity .
A good example of this is a write to a variable that is never subsequently read .
Complexity Control
Much has been published regarding the benefits of reducing complexity at the subroutine level .
Breaking up a software module into smaller subroutines makes each subroutine easier to understand , maintain , and test .
A complexity limitation coding rule is easily enforced at build time by calculating a complexity metric and generating a build - time error when the complexity metric is exceeded .
The source analyzer can optionally check code complexity .
Once again , since the analyzer is already traversing the code tree , it does not require significant additional time to apply a simple complexity computation , such as the popular McCabe complexity metric .
Some analyzers can be configured to generate a build error pointing out the offending subroutine .
Thus , the developer is unable to accidentally create code that violates the rule .
In general , a good analyzer can be used to help enforce coding standards that would otherwise need to be done with manual human reviews or non-integrated third party products .

Output Of The Analyzer
Output format differs amongst analyzers , but a common mechanism is to generate an intuitive set of web pages , hosted by an integrated web server .
The user can browse high level summaries of the different flaws found by the analyzer ( Figure 1 , above ) and then click on hyperlinks to investigate specific problems .
Within a specific problem display , the flaw is displayed inline with the surrounding code , making it easy to understand ( Figure 2 , below ) .
Function names and other objects are hyperlinked for convenient browsing of the source code .
Since the web pages are running under a web server , the results can easily be shared and browsed by any member of the development team on the network .

Analysis Time
Analysis time will obviously be a gating factor in the widespread adoption of these tools .
We performed some build and analysis time comparisons using the Green Hills compiler and source code analyzer to determine the added overhead of using the analyzer on a regular basis .
The build time for the Apache web server using a single desktop PC running Linux was 1.5 minutes .
The source analysis time on the same PC was 3.5 minutes .
Build time using distributed PCs was 30 seconds .
With the Green Hills distributed build system , source code processing is automatically parallelized across worker PCs on the network .
The system only uses PCs that have cycles to spare .
In our test environment , 15 PCs were configured to act as workers , and approximately 10 of them were used at any one time for a build .
The source analysis time using distributed processing was 1.0 minutes , significantly less than the standard compile time using a single dedicated PC .
It seems clear that when 200,000 lines of code can be analyzed in a minute using commonly available PC resources , there really is no reason not to have all developers using these tools all the time .
Flaws Found .
The following sections provide examples of actual flaws in Apache , OpenSSL , and sendmail that were discovered by the Green Hills source code analyzer .
The results are grouped by error type , with one or more examples of each error type per section .
Potential Null Pointer Dereference
This was by far the most common flaw found by the analyzer in all three suites under test .
Some cases involved calls to memory allocation subroutines that were followed by accesses of the returned pointer without first checking for a NULL return .
This is a robustness issue .
Ideally , all memory allocation failures are handled gracefully .
If there is a temporary memory exhaustion condition , service may falter , but not terminate .
This is of particular importance to server programs such as Apache and sendmail .
Algorithms can be introduced that prevent denial of service in overload conditions such as that caused by a malicious attack .
The Apache web server , sendmail , and OpenSSL all make abundant use of C runtime library dynamic memory allocation .
Unlike Java which performs automatic garbage collection , memory allocation using the standard C runtime requires that the application itself handle memory exhaustion failures .
If a memory allocation call fails and returns a NULL pointer , a subsequent unguarded reference of the result pointer is all but guaranteed to cause a fatal crash .
On line 120 in the Apache source file scoreboard.c , we have the following memory allocation statement :
ap_scoreboard_image = calloc(1 ,
sizeof ( scoreboard ) + server_limit *
sizeof ( worker_score *) + server_limit *
lb_limit * sizeof ( lb_score *) ) ;
Clearly , this allocation of memory could be substantial .
It would be a good idea to make sure that the allocation succeeds before referencing the contents of ap_scoreboard_image .
However , soon after the allocation statement , we have this use :
ap_score_board_image->global =
( global_score *) more_storage ;
The dereference is unguarded , making the application susceptible to a fatal crash .
Another example from Apache can be found at line 765 in the file mod_auth_digest.c :
entry = client_list -> table[idx ] ;
prev = NULL ;
while ( entry - > next ) { /* find last entry */
prev = entry ;
entry = entry -> next ; …
}
Note that the variable entry is unconditionally dereferenced at the beginning of the loop .
This alone would not cause the analyzer to report an error .
At this point in the execution path , the analyzer has no specific evidence or hint that entry could be NULL or otherwise invalid .
However , the following statement occurs after the loop :
if ( entry ) {
…
}
By checking for a NULL entry pointer , the programmer has indicated that entry could be NULL .
Tracing backwards , the analyzer now sees that the previous dereference to entry at the top of the loop is a possible NULL reference .
The following similar example was detected in the sendmail application , at line 8547 of file queue.c , where the code unconditionally dereferences the pointer variable tempqfp :
errno = sm_io_error( tempqfp ) ;
sm_io_error is a macro which resolves to a read of the tempqfp -> f_flags field .
Later , at line 8737 , we have this NULL check :
if ( tempqfp != NULL )
sm_io_close ( tempqfp , SM_TIME_DEFAULT ) ;
with no intervening writes to tempqfp after the previously noted dereference .
The NULL check , of course , implies that tempqfp could be NULL ; if that was ever the case , the code would fault .
If the pointer can never in practice be NULL , then the extra check is unnecessary and misleading .
What may seem to some as harmless sloppiness can translate into catastrophic failure given the right ( wrong ) conditions .
In sendmail , there are many other examples of unguarded pointer dereferences that are either preceded or followed by NULL checks of the same pointer .
One more example in this category comes from OpenSSL , at line 914 in file ssl_lib .c :
if ( s->handshake_func == 0 ) {
SSLerr( SSL_F_SSL_SHUTDOWN , SSL_R_UNINITIALIZED ) ;
}
Shortly thereafter , we have a NULL check of the pointer s :
if ( (s != NULL ) && ! SSL_in_init(s ) )
Again , the programmer is telling us that s could be NULL , yet the preceding deference is not guarded .
Buffer Underflow
A buffer underflow is defined as an attempt to access memory before an allocated buffer or array .
Similar to buffer overflows , buffer underflows cause insidious problems due to the unexpected corruption of memory .
The following flaw was discovered at line 5208 of file queue.c in sendmail :
if ( ( qd == - 1 || qg == - 1 ) &&
type != 120 )
…
else {
switch ( type ) {
…
case 120 :
if ( bitset ( QP_SUBXF ,
Queue[qg ]->qg_qpaths[qd].qp_subdirs ) )
}
}
The if statement implies that it is possible for qd or qg to be - 1 when type is 120 .
But in the subsequent switch statement , always executed when type is 120 , the Queue array is unconditionally indexed through the variable qg .
If qg was - 1 , this is an underflow .
The code was not studied exhaustively to determine whether qg can indeed be - 1 when type is 120 and hence reach the fault .
However , if qg can not be - 1 when type is 120 , then the initial if check is incorrect , misleading , and / or unnecessary .
Another example of buffer underflow is found at line 1213 of file ssl_lib.c in OpenSSL :
p = buf ;
sk = s-> session -> ciphers ;
for ( i = 0 ; i < sk_SSL_CIPHER_num(sk ) ; i++ ) {
...
*( p++ ) =':';
}
p [ - 1 ] = ' \0 ' ;
The analyzer informs us that the underflow occurs when this code is called from line 1522 in file s_server.c .
From a look at the call site in s_server.c , you can see that the analyzer has detected that buf points to the beginning of a statically allocated buffer .
Therefore , in the ssl_lib .c code , if there are no ciphers in the cipher stack sk , then the access p [ - 1 ] is an underflow .
This demonstrates the need for an intermodule analysis , since there would be no way of knowing what buf referenced without examining the caller .
If it is the case that the number of ciphers cannot actually be 0 in practice , then the for loop should be converted to a do loop in order to make it clear that the loop is always executed at least once ( ensuring that p [ - 1 ] does not underflow ) .
Another problem is a potential buffer overflow .
No check is made in the ssl_lib .c code to ensure that the number of ciphers does not exceed the size of the buf parameter .
Instead of relying on convention , a better programming practice would be to pass in the length of buf and then add code to check that overflow does not occur .
Resource Leaks
In line 2564 of file speed.c in OpenSSL :
fds=malloc(multi*sizeof * fds ) ;
fds is a local pointer and is never used to free the allocated memory prior to return from the subroutine .
Furthermore , fds is not saved in another variable where it could be later freed .
Clearly , this is a memory leak .
A simple denial of service attack on OpenSSL would be to invoke or cause to be invoked the speed command until all of memory is exhausted .
Conclusion
What better applications to pick , than popular , open source Internet communications , for demonstrating the importance of automated source code analyzers ?
Not only is this software of tremendous importance to the world at large , but the fact that the software is open source would , as many would argue , indicate that the code quality is expected to be relatively high .
According to the book Open Sources : Voices from the Open Source Revolution by DiBona , Ockman , and Stone ( O’ Reilly 1999 ) : ” by sharing source code , Open Source developers make software more robust .
Programs get used and tested in a wider variety of contexts than one programmer could generate , and bugs get uncovered that otherwise would not be found . ”
Unfortunately , in a complex software application such as Apache , it is simply not feasible for all flaws to be found by manual inspection .
There are a number of mechanisms available to help in the struggle to improve software , including improved testing and design paradigms .
But automated source code analyzers are one of the most promising technologies .
Using a source code analyzer should be a required part of every software organization ’s development process .
Not only is it effective at locating anomalies , but it can be used with little or no impact on build times and easily integrated with the regular software development environment .

Now a study has found that timing is indeed important .
Consuming protein supplements immediately before and after weight training builds more muscle compared with taking them at other times .
What ’s more , the volunteers in the study only trained at moderate intensity , suggesting that similar gains are within reach even of an average gym user .

メーリングリストでの 思慮足らずの発言 から、 あからさまに下品な発言 に至るまで、男性中心のオープンソース・ソフトウェアの世界には女性の居場所はないという認識に対し、女性は常に闘っている。しかし、その状況に変化が生じるかもしれない。
GNOME Foundation のSummer Outreach Programのような、女性開発者の支援を目的としたプロジェクトの立ち上げや、LinuxChixやDebian Womenのような女性中心のLUGの登場に見られるように、大半のコミュニティ・メンバ（男女を問わず）が納得するような形で、女性が相応に尊重されるようになってきたのである。
コンピューティングの世界での女性の不平等感は、コンピュータの誕生以来ずっと存在していた。長きにわたって、コンピューティングは「男の世界」と認識されており、女性の関与は積極的には推進されてこなかった。Free/Libre/Open Source Software : Policy Support（FLOSSPOLS）の2002年のレポートによると、このオープンソース・コミュニティのメンバの性別を調査した結果、女性の割合はわずか1.5%だったそうだ。
しかし、公然の性差別だとして男性だけを一方的に責めるのは、不正確でアンフェアだ。「 How to encourage women in Linux」（女性 をLinuxに招くため のHOWTO）という文書を発表しているLinuxカーネル開発者のVal Hensonさんによると、女性の側に起因する問題もあるという。たとえば、自信が欠けていること、コンピューティングの世界に通常はあまりない社交性を求める傾向が強いこと、オープンソース・コミュニティの競争性に対する嫌悪感などだ。
朗報なのは、女性が直面している障害は、内的要因にせよ外的要因にせよ、いずれも克服できるということだ。
女性が進む 道
Software Freedom Internationalのプレジデントであ るPia Waughさんは、コミュニティに関与する方法を探ることが第1歩であり、そのための道はいくつかあると語る。「 Debian Women、GNOME
Women 、Fedora Women 、Ubuntu Womenのような、女性向けの活動は、参加の第1歩としてうってつけだと思います。素晴らしい指導者に出会ったり、情報を得たりできますし、FOSSの広大な世界に踏み込んでいくための足がかりにもなります。これらのグループは、我々のコミュニティを分断するものではありません。参加のための新たな道を開くものです。そして、道の数が増えれば増えるほど、そこからやって来る人も増えていきます」。
「 他にも、地元 のFOSSユーザ・グループに加わったり、プロジェクトに直接参加したり、必要な活動に自発的に取り組んだり、既にFOSSを使用している知り合いに声をかけたり、積極的に関与して手を下したりなど、いろいろな方法が考えられます。一番いいのは、まずはFOSSを使い始め、楽しんでみることです。そうすれば、関与の方法が見つかります」。
Debian Womenプロジェクトのリーダーの1人であるHanna Wallachさんも同様の意見だ。「どのように貢献したいのか、そして参加によって何を得たいのかを考えてみましょう。もっと現実的なレベルで言うと、バグ・レポートをファイルする、バグ修正を手伝う、IRCでの議論に参加する、プロジェクトのメーリングリストを購読する、などがあります。プロジェクトの開発者コミュニティについて理解を深めましょう。協力したいプロジェクトに女性グループがある場合は、連絡を取って、参加についてアドバイスを受けましょう」。
オープンソース・コミュニティに加わった女性は、他の女性にも門戸を開いておけるよう、いろいろな形で力になることができる。Wallachさんはこう語る。「現在のフリー・ソフトウェアに欠けている重要な点の1つが、手本となるような女性がいないことです。他の女性の手本になることは、女性の参加を促すための最も優れた方法の1つです。それに向けた具体策はいくつもあります。たとえば、コンファレンスやLUGで発表の場を持つ、開発者コミュニティと協力して、フリー・ソフトウェア開発への参加を希望する女性が直面する問題への理解を深める、女性向けの指導教育プログラムに参加する、などです」。
「 目立ちましょう！目立っている素敵な女性が増えるほど、新しい女性の参加も促進されます。プロジェクトの環境を、すべての参加者にとって前向きなものにして、知り合いや新規メンバーの参入を促しましょう。目立つということだけでも、その効果が現れ、コミュニティ全体にとって逆風となるネガティブなイメージが消え去るきっかけになると私は思います」。
「 究極的には 、FOSSは、大きなことを成し遂げる可能性を、すべての人に与えるものです。FOSSの価値の中心にあるのは、自由であり、可能性であり、協力と自由に主眼を置いたグローバルな環境で力を合わせて作業するということです。我々を取り巻く世界における政治や社会規範ではありません。FOSSでは、すべての人が大きな可能性を手にできます。実力主義だからです。大きなことをするための大きな可能性があります。私が手にした大きな可能性やチャンスはすべて、FOSSへの参加によって得られたものだと、私は強く感じています。その点を念頭に置いて、FOSSで得られる可能性を他の人にわかってもらう必要があります。そこで、さまざまなバックグラウンドからの新規メンバの参入を歓迎するべく、各自の取り組みが必要なのです」。
プロジェクト・リーダの役割
女性にとって助けとなるよう、女性自身ができることは多くあるが、プロジェクト・リーダも、多種多様な背景の人たちがコミュニティに参加できるよう、コミュニティをオープンにするための策を講じることができる。Waughさんはこう語る。「女性など、FOSSで少数派の人たちにもっと参加してもらうためにプロジェクト・リーダが果たせる役割は2つあります。1つ目は、個人的・文化的な偏見に影響されずに、優れた人たちがその力を発揮して大きなことを成し遂げられる雰囲気を作り出すうえでの、根本的な良識としての存在です。プロジェクト・リーダは、年齢、性別、人種、宗教など、いかなるものにも左右されない、ポジティブな環境を確立するために、積極的な役割を果たす必要があります。これはまさに、FOSSの精神に合致する考え方です」。
「 プロジェクト・リーダは、新規参加の促進や建設的なフィードバックにおいて、まさに良い見本となる必要があります。また、プロジェクトのネガティブ要因に積極的に対処することも必要です。性差別や人種差別などのネガティブな意見は、プロジェクトからきっぱりと排除する必要があります。そうせずに黙っていると、そのような行為を承認するという意味に受け取られるおそれがあり、大きな可能性を秘めた人たちがプロジェクトから離れていく原因になります。最終的に、プロジェクト・リーダは、前向きで社交的なプロジェクト環境を保つという点についても責任を負っています。コードに対する責任だけではないのです」。
「2つ目の役割は、女性の参加を積極的に推進するという役割です。いくつかのプロジェクトでは既に実践されていることです。これは、女性の数を増やすという点に的を絞った役割であり、その好例が、GNOME
Women のSummer Of Programmingです（これは、女性の参加者が200名以上に上りました。一方、Google Summer of Codeは、180名の参加者中、女性は1人もいませんでした）。こうした取り組みは、現在のニーズに対処するうえで有効です。私は、女性と男性がITの世界で偏見なしに同等の役割を果たせる日が来ることを夢見ています。あいにく、多くの国では、現実は異なりますが。ITの仕事やソフトウェア開発自体が、男のものではなく性別に無関係のものとしてとらえられるようになって、プロジェクト・リーダのこの2番目の役割が不要になることを、私は期待しています」。
既存のプロジェクトに女性をスムーズに受け入れるという問題に対処したことのないマネージャは、その点で苦労する可能性があるということを、Wallachさんも認めている。「プロジェクト・リーダが直面する最大の障害は、プロジェクト・リーダ自身がこの問題に特に興味がない場合がある、ということだと思います。フリー・ソフトウェア・コミュニティでは、プロジェクト・リーダはほぼ例外なく男性です。男女の平等という問題について、これまであまり考えたことがない人が多いため、彼らにとっては未知の領域なのです」。
Wallachさんは、次のように勧めている。「マネージャは、自分たちのプロジェクトにまつわる性別の問題について、議論と啓蒙を促すとともに、フリー・ソフトウェア開発に参加する女性の数を増やすための新たな試みに取り組む意欲を持ちましょう」。
Wallachさんの話では、プロジェクト・リーダが実行できる最も重要なことは、FLOSSPOLSのレポートと勧告を読むことだという。「この中には、女性の参加者を増やすためのヒントがたくさん含まれています」。
つまるところ、オープンソース・コミュニティ内の男女差をなくすうえで肝心なのは、ネガティブで非生産的なパターンを変えるよう、男性と女性の両方が積極的に取り組むことだ。オープンソースに既に関与している女性は、そこから1歩進んで、他の女性の手本になるという意識を持ち、FOSSのコンファレンスで発言の機会を持ち、FOSSのユーザ・グループの会合に参加することが必要だ。
男性は、次の言葉を頭に入れておく必要がある。「経験が欠けているからと言って、能力が欠けているとは限りません」というWallachさんの言葉だ。「往々にして、西洋社会での女の子と男の子の育てられ方の違いによるものなのです。時間と励ましがあれば、女性でも超一流の開発者になれる可能性がありますし、きっとそうなります」。

I think the power of using background images is amazing .
Whenever you need to display text as an image due to fonts or for something like a logo , it ’s easy to make it work and keep it 100 % accessible .
This is not rocket science , but it ’s important .
For instance , if I wanted to display a logo .
The wrong way : < img src=" logo.gif " alt = " Company Logo " />
The right way :
Look at your website on a mobile phone if you want to understand why “ the right way ” is better .
You will also appreciate it when it comes time to redesign the site and you do n’t have to touch the html .

Using more than one class per element .
For example , I could give a paragraph tag two classes .
< p class = " highlight clear " > .
This may seem extremely novice but I find that when I talk to people about this , they have no idea it ’s possible .
( This also comes in handy when you want the last element class to take on a slightly different property as the ones before it . )

Reusable code .
In nearly all of the CSS which I ’ve written recently , I ’ve started developing code which can be applied to any element .
For example , I might have a ‘ hide ’ class for an element on a page which I want to be hidden , or a ‘ mute ’ class for something which I want to be ‘ muted ’ ( i.e. with less emphasis than regular content — footnotes , for example ) .
To see this technique in action , just take a look at any of my stylesheets .
Another technique I use is to develop a robust grid , with ‘ column block ’ making up the grid .
To do this , I define several classes , such as ‘ col_1′ , ‘ col_2 ′ — but not how you might expect .
Where you could assume that ‘ col_1 ′ is the first column in the design , I take a slightly different approach by defining this as a column which spans 1 ‘ column block ’ — ‘ col_2 ′ would span 2 ‘ column blocks ’ etc. [ Oliver Beattie ]

Web : Verdana 11px ( 150 % leading ) .
Display : Maple ( Process Type ) .
Print : Mercury Text ( H& FJ ) [ Matthew Buchanan , New Zealand ]
Mmm , I ’m a big fan of Georgia .
I know that means that if Georgia is not available , it means falling back to Times New Roman , but hey ho , them ’s the breaks .
[ Ian Lloyd , UK ]
I find myself using Georgia and Verdana quite a bit .
They are good utility fonts and are fairly ubiquitous .
While I wish there was more variety available , there are only a handful of fonts which are reliable , due to the limited selection installed across multiple operating systems .
The key to best using fonts is to know what typefaces are available in which environments .
I have seen quite a few sites which resort to using sIFR , but I think that with a little research and patience , there is still quite a bit that can be done within the browser itself .
One thing I have learned by dabbling in typography is that the default sans - serif font on Ubuntu is considerably wider than the sans - serif on other operating systems .
While the sans - serif for Windows and Mac tends to look like Arial or Helvetica , the default sans - serif on Ubuntu is actually closer to Verdana in width .

[ Christian Heilmann , London , England ]
Many of my corporate clients have existing corporate identities .
In these cases , my role is often about interpreting corporate identities into the web environment .
This means that fonts are often dictated from the outset .
For other clients , I do n’t think I have particular favourite fonts .
I use different fonts - depending on the client and the feeling we are trying to get across .
Even within serif font families there have not been particular favourites .
I ’ve used Rockwell , Clarendon , Goudy and even American Typewriter .
I generally try to use as few actual image - based fonts as possible .
I ’m always conscious that the site may be viewed by small screen devices , by people who have images turned off , by blind users or people with screen magnifiers .
Often image - based fonts are a barrier or an irritation to these people .
Ideally , I prefer my content to be able to scale , display well on any device and be flexible enough so that users can override my settings .

“ Do n’t make me think ! ” by Steve Krug .
best hour of your time you ever spent on learning usability .
[ Christian Heilmann , London , England ]
Hands down , bar - none , undoubtedly the best book written about web design is Do n’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug .
[ Patrick Griffiths , UK ]
More usability than design related , but one of the influential books for me was Steve Krug ’s - Do n’t Make Me Think [ Lucian Slatineanu , US / Romania ]
For CSS Design I would recommend CSS Mastery by Andy Budd .
For UI design and understanding usable layouts I would recommend Do n’t Make Me Think ! by Steve Krug .
Many people may not consider the second book a design book , but I think it is crucial for any designer to understand how users think .
Design is not only aesthetic , but also has to be functional in order to create results for your client .
[ Nick Francis , US ]
“ CSS Mastery ” by Andy Budd is a great introduction to producing good CSS layouts .
I ’ve read a few others on this subject but this is the best in my opinion .
[ Dan Lindop , UK ]
With seamingly endless resources online , I find it hard to justify purchasing an actual book off the shelf .
The only book that I have purchased and can recommend CSS Mastery by Andy Budd ( with Cameron Moll & Simon Collison ) .
A great primer for anyone interested in building a strong foundation from which to build off of .
[ Derek Punsalan , US ]
The Elements of Typographical Style , by Robert Bringhurst .
This is the book which inspired WebTypography .net .
Another great book about user interface design is Do n’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug .
It encourages web designers to create intuitive site navigation and messages .
[ Nathan Smith , US ]
The Elements of Typographic Style [ Cameron Moll , USA ]
Elements of Typographic Style by Bringhurst .
[ Mark Boulton , UK ]
The Elements of Typographic Style is pretty boring , but it ’s amazing how much you pick up from it while you ’re dozing off .

Jeffrey Zeldman ’s “ Designing with Web Standards ” [ Paul Boag , UK ]
I like “ Transcending CSS ” , it has some good ideas and is great for inspiration , plus my screenshot is in there ( page 48 ) .

If there is one book that many , many people working in the Web industry desperately need to read it is Ian Lloyd ’s “ Build Your Own Website The Right Way Using HTML & CSS ” .
[ Roger Johansson , Sweden ]
“ How to be a Graphic Designer Without Losing Your Soul ” by Adrian Shaughnessy [ Rob Goodlatte , US ]
Web Standards Solutions by Dan Cederholm .
[ Matthew Buchanan , New Zealand ]
The only book I have on my desk is “ Bulletproof Web Design ” by Dan Cederholm .
That ’s more CSS than design - but I do n’t buy design books .
They ’re way too expensive , they take up space , and I can find everything I need online , if I need something .
[ Ryan Masuga , US ]
Pro CSS Techniques book by Jeff Croft , Ian Lloyd and Dan Rubin .
But if I had to pick one book that I ’d recommend to everyone starting on their journey towards standards development it would be Web Standards Solutions by Dan Cederholm .
[ Matt Downey , US ]
Well , it ’s a not a book to read but sure is eye candy .
And it ’s not just one either : ‘ Los Logos ’ , ‘ Dos Logos ’ and ‘ Tres Logos ’ .
Love ‘em. [ Filipe Varela , Portugal ]
Ca n’t recall a book that I ’ve read specifically on design .
But here are some web related books that I recommend : Books for your brain .
[ Keegan Jones , US ]
All of Edward Tufte ’s books .
They are n’t directly related to design per se , but they have an incredible wealth of information with regards to communicating and pragmatic aesthetics .
[ Garrett Dimon , US ]
Making and Breaking the Grid by Timothy Samara .
An introduction to grid based layouts .
Highly recommendable .
[ Wolfgang Bartelme , Austria ]
Ogilvy On Advertising .
[ Mike Davidson , USA ]
I ’ve just got a copy of Web Standards Creativity by ( among many , many others ) Cameron Adams , Mark Boulton , Andy Clarke , Jeff Croft , Dan Rubin etc. - that one ’s a pretty good read .
Also , it ’s good to read other books not directly related to web designs .
For example , I ’ve got quite a few print books : 1) Letterpress - New applications for traditional skills ( David Hury ) 2 ) Grid Systems ( Kimberley Elam ) 3 ) The Elements of Typographic style etc .

I do n’t read any design magazines on a regular basis - online or offline .
I just started reading Digital Web a little bit .
I have a newsreader that I hardly open anymore because I ’m busy with work !
I sift through cssmania.com now and then just to see what people are up to , and spend all my time on the ExpressionEngine forums .
[ Ryan Masuga , US ]
There are n’t really any printed magazines that I read regularly .
I suppose that my online reading list is probably fairly typical for most web designers , consisting of the usual suspects : Digital Web Magazine , A List Apart , UX Magazine , Boxes +
Arrows , and of course Smashing – though you guys need a unique site design .
[ Nathan Smith , US ]
A List Apart .
[ Mike Davidson , USA ]
Online , I trust A List Apart , sorry that one ’s probably obvious .
I really like Create Magazine in print , just because I enjoy looking at the ads .
[ Nick Francis , US ]
I do n’t get design magazines from the shops , at all - I tend to find them too pretentious or up themselves , to be honest !
Likewise , I ’ve not bought techie magazines for a long while .
For me , it ’s all online , and once more I ’m thinking more on the technical / techniques front .
So for me it ’s still alistapart.com - great writers , good ideas and nicely presented .
[ Ian Lloyd , UK ]
A List Apart .
[ Oliver Beattie ]
Does Wired count as a design magazine ?
It ’s certainly got some of the best infographics I ’ve ever seen .
[ Cameron Adams ]
Pingmag [ Derek Punsalan , US ]
I really live the vibe and the variety that Netdiver features every day .
[ Filipe Varela , Portugal ]
UX Magazine is a great read , and post a lot of fun articles .
I also fill my feed reader with a bunch of web standards / web design / usability blogs and scan through them when I can find a spare minute from working !
Andy Peatling , Canada ]
I Check out Smashing Magazine from time to time , but I do n’t really read a lot of design magazines , unless they have something specific .
I do , however , watch Pixelperfect with Bert Monroy every week .
[ James Mathias , US ]
Why Smashing Magazine , of course .
[ R. Marie Cox , US ]
Fontblog.de - a German weblog on typography and other design related stuff .
[ Wolfgang Bartelme , Austria ]
. net magazine ( cheating , I get it for free as I am a contributor ) [ Christian Heilmann , London , England ]
Communication Arts. [ Kyle Neath , US ]
Relevant Magazine .
It ’s extremely well designed ( even the ads ! ) , and it ’s inspiring to flip through .
If nothing else , it helps spark good design ideas .
[ Keegan Jones , US ]
Computer Arts and .net magazine monthly .
[ Dan Lindop , UK ]
HOW magazine is always an incredible source of design inspiration for me .
Seeing printed and promotional pieces really challenge me to think about how to display and organize information on the web .
[ Matt Downey , US ]
I like to read things that will broaden my horizons as a designer , not narrow them .
A recent magazine I picked up in the UK which had great design , but also great content , was a magazine called Monocle .
[ Mark Boulton , UK ]
I do n’t follow any particular design magazines .
Occasionally I ’ll browse through a copy of Computer Arts or Communication Arts . [ Rob Goodlatte , US ]
I do n’t read any on a regular basis any more - there are so many nowadays I just follow links and suggestions to interesting articles .
[ Patrick Griffiths , UK ]
I really have n’t read any magazines .
I ’ve spent most of my time exploring books and finding books on classical aspects of design like typography and the grid .
I ’ve also found it incredibly enlightening to read books from different industries or different periods in art and history .
It ’s easy to follow the latest “ fads ” and apply that to a design , but it ’s the classical and unchanging principles that really make a quality design stand out regardless of its particular style .
I ’m also starting to get into books on psychology , anthropology , and other related books that lend themselves to understanding human behavior and think of how we can apply that knowledge to the web .
[ Garrett Dimon , US ]
I do n’t read design magazines anymore .
I used to , but these days I do n’t have the time .
Or the interest .
[ Roger Johansson , Sweden ]
I do n’t read any particular one on a weekly basis , but I pick up any design - related mags as often as I can with topics that range from food to architecture to aircraft design etc. [ Cameron Moll , USA ]
" People always make the assumption that we 're done with search .
That 's very far from the case .
We 're probably only 5 percent of the way there .
We want to create the ultimate search engine that can understand anything ... some people could call that artificial intelligence . "
" a lot of our systems already use learning techniques "
The ultimate search engine would understand everything in the world .
It would understand everything that you asked it and give you back the exact right thing instantly , "
" You could ask ' what should I ask Larry ? ' and it would tell you . "
" For 30 years I have been wondering , what indication of its existence might we expect from a true AI ? ...
Anomalous accumulation or creation of wealth might be a sign , or an unquenchable thirst for raw information , storage space , and processing cycles "
" In attempting to construct such machines we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls , any more than we are in the procreation of children .
Rather we are , in either case , instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates . "
It 's an extraordinary publishing phenomenon - atheism sells .
Any philosopher , professional polemicist or scientist with worries about their pension plan must now be feverishly working on a book proposal .
Richard Dawkins has been in the bestseller lists on both sides of the Atlantic since The God Delusion came out last autumn following Daniel Dennett 's success with Breaking the Spell .
Sam Harris , a previously unknown neuroscience graduate , has now clocked up two bestsellers , The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation .
Last week , Christopher Hitchens ' God Is Not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything was published in the US .
The science writer , Matt Ridley , recently commented that on one day at Princeton he met no fewer than three intellectual luminaries hard at work on their God books .
This rising stack of books has prompted screeds of debate , flushing out all manner of belief and unbelief in blogs , reviews , essays and internet exchanges in the US .
The Catholic columnist Andrew Sullivan has just concluded his exchange with Sam Harris on the net , while the philosopher Michael Novak recently took on the whole genre of New Atheism , or neo-atheism .
Surely not since Victorian times has there been such a passionate , sustained debate about religious belief .
And it 's a very ill - tempered debate .
The books live up to their provocative titles : their purpose is to pour scorn on religious belief - they want it eradicated ( although they differ as to the chances of achieving that ) .
The newcomer on the block , Hitchens , sums up monotheism as " a plagiarism of a plagiarism of a hearsay of a hearsay , of an illusion of an illusion , extending all the way back to a fabrication of a few non-events " .
He takes the verbal equivalent of an AK47 to shoot down hallowed religious figures , questioning whether Muhammad was an epileptic , declaring Mahatma Gandhi an " obscurantist " who distorted and retarded Indian independence , and Martin Luther King a " plagiarist and an orgiast " and in no real sense a Christian , while the Dalai Lama is a " medieval princeling " who is the continuation of a " parasitic monastic elite " .
This kind of vituperative polemic sounds a tad odd this side of the Atlantic .
Apart from an ongoing anxiety about Islam , the British are pretty phlegmatic about religion .
Church attendance continues its steady decline and the Christian evangelical boom has never taken off .
The whole New Atheist publishing phenomenon is like eavesdropping on a blistering row in the flat next door : one 's response alternates between fascination and irritation , but is it really anything to do with us ?
What 's clear is that this wave of New Atheism is deeply political - and against some of its targets even a devout churchgoer might cheer them on .
What they all have in common is a loathing of an increasing religiosity in US politics , which has contributed to a disastrous presidency and undermined scientific understanding .
Dennett excoriates the madness of a faith that looks forward to the end of the world and the return of the messiah .
What Dawkins hates is that most Americans still have n't accepted evolution and support the teaching of intelligent design ; according to one poll , 50 % of the US electorate believe the story of Noah .
He argues that " there is nothing to choose between the Afghan Taliban and the American Christian equivalent ...
The genie of religious fanaticism is rampant in present - day America . "
Harris similarly draws an analogy between Muslims and the American Christian right : " Non-believers like myself stand beside you dumbstruck by the Muslim hordes who chant death to whole nations of the living .
But we stand dumbstruck by you as well - by your denial of tangible reality , by the suffering you create in service of your religious myths and by your attachment to an imaginary God . "
This is popular stuff - a plague on both your houses - on both sides of the Atlantic after a war on terror in which both sides have used their gods as justification for appalling brutality .
But it tips over into something much more sinister in Harris 's latest book .
He suggests that Islamic states may be politically unreformable because so many Muslims are " utterly deranged by their religious faith " .
In a another passage Harris goes even further , and reaches a disturbing conclusion that " some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them " .
This sounds like exactly the kind of argument put forward by those who ran the Inquisition .
As one New York commentator put it , we 're familiar with religious intolerance , now we have to recognise irreligious intolerance .
The danger is that the aggression and hostility to religion in all its forms ( moderates are castigated as giving the fundamentalists cover for their extremism ) deters engagement with the really interesting questions that have emerged recently in the science / faith debate .
The durability and near universality of religion is one of the most enduring conundrums of evolutionary thinking , one of Britain 's most eminent evolutionary psychologists acknowledged to me recently .
Scientists have argued that faith was a byproduct of our development of the imagination or a way of increasing the social bonding mechanisms .
Does that make religion an important evolutionary step but now no longer needed - the equivalent of the appendix ?
Or a crucial part of the explanation for successful human evolution to date ?
Does religion still have an important role in human wellbeing ?
In recent years , research has thrown up some remarkable benefits - the faithful live longer , recover from surgery quicker , are happier , less prone to mental illness and so the list goes on .
If religion declines , what gaps does it leave in the functioning of individuals and social groups ?
This is n't the kind of debate that the New Atheists are interested in ( with the possible exception of Dennett , who in an interview last year was far more open to discussion than his book would indicate ) ; theirs is a political battle , not an attempt to advance human understanding .
But even on the political front , one has to question whether all the aggression is n't counterproductive .
Robert Winston voiced increasing concern among scientists when he argued in a recent lecture in Dundee that Dawkins 's insulting and patronising approach did science a disservice .
Meanwhile , critics in America argue that the polarisation of the debate in the US is setting the cause of non-deism back rather than advancing it .
Dawkins is an unashamed proselytiser .
He says in his preface that he intends his book for religious readers and his aim is that they will be atheists by the time they finish reading it .
Yet The God Delusion is not a book of persuasion , but of provocation - it may have sold in the thousands but has it won any souls ?
Anyone who has experienced such a conversion , please email me ( with proof ) .
I suspect the New Atheists are in danger of a spectacular failure .
With little understanding and even less sympathy of why people increasingly use religious identity in political contexts , they 've missed the proverbial elephant in the room .
These increasingly hysterical books may boost the pension , they may be morale boosters for a particular kind of American atheism that feels victimised - the latest candidate in a flourishing American tradition - but one suspects that they are going to do very little to challenge the appeal of a phenomenon they loathe too much to understand .

North Wales Police surveyed drinking habits in teenagers
Inspector Roly Schwarz said controlled drinking in pubs would allow teenagers ' alcohol consumption to be monitored .
A survey of 2,000 teenagers by North Wales Police found 88 % of girls and 79 % of boys aged 16 have been drunk .
North Wales Police said the views were the inspector 's personal opinion and not those of the force .
Insp Schwarz said : " Young people are going to drink alcohol , but they must be shown how to enjoy it . "
North Wales Police said a recent operation in north Denbighshire found that 39 licensed premises sold alcohol to underage drinkers .
Better monitored
Police research also found that children in the force area have spent more than £ 75,000 on alcohol this year .
Insp Schwarz , whose beat covers the seaside towns of Rhyl and Prestatyn , said children should be allowed into pubs when they are 16 , but it should remain illegal for teenagers under 18 to drink alcohol outside licensed premises .
Controlled drinking in licensed premises would allow alcohol consumption by youngsters to be better monitored , he said .
You give your views on the issue of pub drinking for 16 - year - olds .
In pictures
Insp Schwarz added : " 80 % of children between the ages of 11 and 17 are given alcohol by their parents , but what their parents do n't realise is that they are also drinking at other times . "
The police survey revealed that of the 2,000 youngsters interviewed , 88 % of 16 - year - old girls had been drunk and 68 % said that alcohol has caused them some form of harm .
Of boys the same age , 79 % said they had been drunk and 42 % had been injured or made ill through alcohol .
However , Miles Vaughan , chairman of the Rhyl and District Licensed Victuallers '
Association said he opposed the idea of allowing 16 year olds to drink inside pubs .
" In principle I do n't believe it 's a licensee 's position to supervise underage drinkers .
I would n't be interested in letting 16 year olds into my premises , " he said .
Mr Vaughan , also the Welsh chairman of the British Institute of Innkeeping added : " If we allow 16 year olds in we 'll automatically get the 14 and 15 year olds coming in . "
With 32 years in the pub industry , the landlord of the Royal Victoria in Prestatyn said it should not be up to him to educate teenagers about drinking alcohol .
" I think a lot of education through drink should begin at home .
I think it 's far too easy for parents to ignore what their children are getting up to , " he added .
A spokesman for Age Concern also dismissed the idea .
He said : " Research shows that for people under the age of 18 and still growing up there is no amount of alcohol which can be drunk safely .
" On average , 13 people aged under 18 are admitted to hospital A&E departments for having drunk too much every night .
" We know a lot of under 18s already drink illegally in pubs and we need to rethink the way bars monitor all people who consume alcohol " .
WASHINGTON -- The Global Positioning System , relied on for everything from navigating cars and airplanes to transferring money between banks , may be threatened by powerful solar flares , a panel of scientists warned yesterday .
" Our increasingly technologically dependent society is becoming increasingly vulnerable to space weather , " David L. Johnson , director of the National Weather Service , said at a briefing .
GPS receivers have become widely used in recent years , for satellite signals that navigate airplanes , ships , and automobiles and for cellphones , mining , surveying , and many other commercial uses .
Indeed , banks use the system to synchronize money transfers , " so space weather can affect all of us , right down to our wallet , " said Anthea J. Coster , an atmospheric scientist at the Haystack Observatory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
The cause for their concern , Johnson said , was an unexpected solar radio burst on Dec. 6 that affected virtually every GPS receiver on the lighted half of earth .
Some receivers had a reduction in accuracy while others completely lost the ability to determine position , he said .
Solar activity rises and falls in 11 - year cycles , with the next peak expected in 2011 .
If that increasing level of activity produces more such radio bursts , the GPS system could be seriously affected , the researchers said .
Protecting the system is no simple task , said Paul M. Kintner Jr. , a professor of electrical engineering at Cornell University , who monitored the December event .
There are two possible ways to shield the system , he said , both very expensive : either alter all GPS antennas to screen out solar signals or replace all of the GPS satellites with ones that broadcast a stronger signal .
That is why it is essential to learn more about the sun 's behavior quickly in an effort to find ways to predict such events , the researchers said .
The December solar flare also induced unexpected currents in the electrical grid , Johnson said .
Patricia H. Doherty , co-director of the Institute for Scientific Research at Boston College , said the burst affected but did not shut down the Federal Aviation Administration 's Wide Area Augmentation System , which uses GPS signals to assist in navigation .

I ’ve followed my friends as they jump around from social network to social network , creating profiles on Friendster , Hi-5 , Orkut , MySpace and now Facebook , even though I never use the sites .
Facebook is great networking tool that lets you keep in contact with former friends from high school , university and various jobs .
It easily connects people together with tools like registering that you are the owner of a specific cell phone number , keeping track of every email address you ’ve ever had , and logging into your email account to find out who you know .
As you can guess from my previous series on online pseudo - anonymity , something that collects as much personal information as Facebook scares the bejebus out of me .
From the address book import I can clearly see that everyone I ’ve ever even remotely known is already on Facebook , and the default settings mean they ’re all sharing all kinds of personal information they may not be aware of .
The potential downside a lot of my friends and acquaintances do n’t realize is that Facebook is more like Linked In than MySpace and it is “ on the radar ” of your employers .
People have already lost their jobs because of their Facebook activity .
Most people do n’t think about online privacy concerns like these unless they ’ve had a bad experience because of being too free with information .
But Facebook can be used safely and with little impact on the rest of your life by following these tips .

Understanding the Relationship Levels
Facebook sucks for not having enough control over how well you know someone .
There are nine million ways to define how you know them , but only three levels for how well you know them .
By default everyone is a stranger .
A network is a group by region / location , school or company .
Your friends are people who you ’ve mutually agreed that you know each other .
You have the ability to change the privacy of things at the micro - level but it is tedious .
Facebook has no global solution in place for “ he ’s my Friendster but not my friend ” — handling acquaintances without giving them the same access as people who are close to you .
Changing The Default Privacy Settings
This should be an obvious tweak but most people ignore it .
By default anyone in your networks can see everything you ’re doing on Facebook .
Click on the My Privacy link to start editing your information .
One thing Facebook does very poorly is it always assumes you ’re going to want to share all of your information with your global networks for cities , schools and businesses .
HACK : If you do n’t join any networks then the default privacy settings are n’t that bad .
Profile
Profile defaults to All my networks and all my friends when it should be Only my friends .
defaults to when it should be .
Contact emails defaults to Only my friends when it should be No one .
defaults to when it should be .
Profile Features default to All my networks and all my friends when it should be Only my friends , only me , or no one .
default to when it should be , , or .
This is where you can do things like turn off your wall , hide your online status and hide your groups .
Search
Search defaults to Everyone when it should be Only my friends .
There is no explicit option to not appear in search results , but in testing when I unchecked all of the options I stopped appearing .
defaults to when it should be .
There is no explicit option to not appear in search results , but in testing when I unchecked all of the options I stopped appearing .
By default people can see your picture , send you a message , poke you or add you as a friend from the search results .
, , or from the search results .
UPDATE 2007/09/05 : Facebook search results now show up in Google search results .
These privacy settings will prevent you from showing up .
News Feed and Mini-feed
This is the most worrisome display of private information on Facebook .
Your newsfeed publishes information on everything you are doing on Facebook .
I ’d turn most if not all of these off .
At the very least turn off the Show times in my Mini - feed option — no one needs to know you spent all morning tweaking your profile .
Poke , Message and Friend Request Settings
Whenever you poke , message or friend request someone they are able to see parts of your profile even though your privacy setting may normally prevent them .
Change these to whatever you are comfortable with .
They are only shown when you initiate contact with someone .
Privacy Settings for Friends , Notes , and Facebook Development Platform
Friends list .
By default Everyone can see your friends list .
It should be Only my friends .
.
By default can see your friends list .
It should be Notes are like a mini-blog .
By default Everyone can see your notes .
It should be Only my friends .
Do n’t forget other privacy settings that are hidden in your Edit Profile like displaying your birthday .
That ’s also where the email notification settings are tucked away .
Have a Professional and a Personal Profile
Facebook is a good professional networking tool .
It is also a fun place to keep in contact with friends using public messages , photos and events .
Things you would n’t want to show up on a professional profile .
So have your cake and eat it too by having two profiles ( even though this may be against the Facebook terms of service ) .
A professional / public profile
Shows your full name , job history and schooling .
Only add work - related email accounts / IM .
Only add industry contacts as friends .
Only join networks related to school and work .
Only have one professional looking photo or do not include a photo .
If “ blasts from the past ” try to find you this is where they ’ll end up and you can add them as a contact without revealing lots of personal information to them .
A personal / private profile
Shows first name / nickname , and last initial .
Do n’t join networks related to school or work .
Do n’t list your work experience .
Do n’t use your work email address .
Do whatever you want with it .
Obviously , do n’t link your personal and professional account as friends .
Since you have two Facebook accounts that are unrelated to each other you can switch accounts to test how much information is publicly available on the other account .
Friends Not Acquaintances
People use these social networks to connect to anyone they ’ve ever remotely known , proudly trying to amass the largest friends list they possibly can .
There are people I know that I only keep in touch with when we join a new social networking site .
One of the potential problems with Facebook is that the privacy settings only distinguish between strangers , networks and friends .
Once you list an acquaintance as a friend they have the highest level of access to your personal information .
Do n’t Use the “ Find Your Friends ” Feature
The “ Find Your Friends ” feature grabs a list of all of your email contacts and tries to find them on Facebook .
This would n’t be a problem except that it uses your entire address book contact list .
Most email software automatically adds anyone you have exchanged emails with as a contact .
That list could include ex’s , co-workers and any stranger who sent an email to the wrong address that you politely replied - to to inform them of their mistake .
Do n’t Use Facebook at Work
Facebook has a feature called the mini-feed that lets other people see / stalk everything you ’re doing on Facebook and logs the day and time .
Your profile shows the last ten things you did , and it ’s possible to view all activity you have ever done on Facebook and when you did it .
So people can see exactly how often you Facebook at work .
Facebook even makes it very convenient to sort this information to find photos OTHER people have uploaded to you and to track every bulletin board message you ’ve ever posted .
It ’s a stalker ’s wet dream .
You can remove / modify this feature by going to My Privacy >>
News Feed and Mini-Feed Privacy .
At the very least everyone should turn off the Show times in my Mini - feed option .
If you ’re going to Facebook at work , at least hide the fact .
Hide Your Groups
When using the create a group feature , by default anyone can join , anyone can see the group information , read the discussion board or see the photos .
When creating a group set the group access to secret .
Be aware that at any point an administrator can change a group from secret to public .
NOTE : If a group is public then you can hide things you ’ve posted from showing up on your profile by using the My Privacy >>
News Feed and Mini-Feed Privacy settings .
You ca n’t however hide being a member of that group , or prevent someone from browsing the any of your messages in that group .
Identity Theft
The problem with publicizing a lot of information about yourself is that you have no control over how it will be used .
While it is unlikely that someone will use that information to apply for credit cards under your name , there is a chance of minor mischief like using the information to impersonate you on another site or for someone to pretend they know you as a fake reference during a job interview .
I have seen both of those happen .
Facebook Privacy Policy
If you read the Terms of Service with a fine - toothed comb , Facebook is allowed to sell / share your information with other companies without asking you for further permission .
The Facebook Wikipedia page has more information about criticisms of Facebook ’s privacy policies .
Applications
This guide was written before Facebook applications existed , but you can find out about how to configure the privacy settings for your Facebook apps here .
5 Things to Remember
People are only friends , limited profile , network , strangers or blocked — those are the only different access levels Privacy settings are frickin complicated — set yourself to have no network to avoid most of the hassles Private messages are better than wall posts — wall posts can bite you in the ass later Turn off times and online status — no one needs to know when you ’re Facebooking Adjust your news feed and mini-feed — if people ca n’t see when you write in groups , or comment on other people ’s photos then it avoids a lot of the stalking opportunities
Conclusion
The problem with Facebook is that people use it without giving a second thought to how much information they are publishing and by default they are publishing more information than they may want to .
Facebook is used for professional job searches and networking as well as pure socialization and problems can happen when the two meet .

Mike Gravel : ' Love between a man and a man is beautiful ' David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday May 9 , 2007 Print This Email This Mike Gravel , 2008 Democratic presidential candidate , says he has no problem with gay love .
New Hampshire 's WMUR TV hosted a conversation with Gravel in which the former US senator , answering an audience question about gay marriage , replies , " If a couple of lesbians or gay men want to get married , and they love each other , they should have the right to do that and enjoy all the legalities in our society that go along with that .
I have no problem with that at all . "
" I think that people who create these problems of homophobia and the likes of that do us a disservice , " Gravel continues .
" We are all human beings and one of the things that should motivate us , most of all , is love . "
He blasts President Bush 's " faith - based leadership , " saying , " You ca n't legislate morality . "
The first quarter financial reports , which were due at midnight Sunday , offer a glimpse into an aspect of the 2008 presidential election that sets it apart .
All of the leading candidates have chosen to forgo public campaign financing in order to raise and spend private donations without any limits .
Several have raised more than three times as much as any candidate did during the same period before the last election .
The leading Republicans filed their reports Friday and Saturday .
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama were the two top fund - raisers in either party .
Mrs. Clinton raised $ 19.1 million for the primary , and $ 6.9 million for use in the general election ( accessible only if she wins the nomination ) .
Mr. Obama raised $ 24.8 million for the primary and $ 1 million for the general election .
The primary campaign of John Edwards , the former senator from North Carolina , said in its filing that he had spent less than $ 3 million of the $ 13 million he raised in the quarter , leaving him with $ 10.7 million in the bank .
He raised less than $ 1 million for the general election .
Campaign finance laws cap contributions to each phase of the race at $ 2,300 , leading to a frantic scramble among the top contenders in each party to assemble networks of fund - raisers , bundlers , who can collect $ 2,300 checks from friends and associates .
But dependence on such large checks can pose a risk to campaign momentum because the big donors cannot continue to give as the campaign continues .
Although Mr. Obama has sought to publicize his campaign ’s emphasis on small contributions , he , too , depended heavily on a relatively small number of big checks .
About 4,800 supporters gave the maximum $ 2,300 to his primary campaign , accounting for about $ 11 million , nearly half his total .
About 75 of those donors gave another $ 2,300 to his general election fund , according to an analysis of his campaign ’s filing .
On Sunday , his campaign released a list of about 130 bundlers who had each raised $ 50,000 , for more than $ 6.5 million , about a quarter of his total for both races .
Mrs. Clinton , though , depended even more heavily on a relatively narrow base of wealthy and committed donors who contributed about $ 19 million .
More than 5,100 gave about the legal limit of $ 2,300 to her primary campaign , contributing more than $ 11.7 million , nearly two thirds of her primary fund .
What is more , nearly 3,000 of those who had already hit the $ 2,300 limit for the primary also contributed $ 2,300 toward her general election fund .
Alec Holden said his secret to long life was to " keep breathing "
Alec Holden , from Epsom in Surrey , is picking up his winnings from bookmaker William Hill , which gave him odds of 250/ 1 that he would reach his century .
The retired engineer , born on 24 April 1907 , joked he had been " very careful " about what he had been doing recently .
Mr Holden , who also used to work as a teacher and a carpenter , plans to take some friends to a hotel to celebrate .
These age wagers are starting to cost us a fortune and from now on we are going to push out the age to 110
Rupert Adams , William Hill
Worth a bet ?
What are your chances of living to 100 ?
He placed the bet on 10 December 1997 , when he was aged 90 , with the thought that he " would live forever " .
Mr Holden , who has two sons aged 70 and 60 , puts his longevity down to porridge for breakfast and " remembering to keep breathing " .
He said it was also important not to worry about anything , do as little work as possible , and go on lots of holidays .
He also plays chess every day , running a local club .
He said in recent months he had been keeping watch for " any hooded groups from William Hill standing in the street " , so that he could avoid them .
He also said he had already received his birthday card from the Queen .
' Mythical landmark '
" In fact , I think I saw her delivering it on her bicycle , " he joked .
Bookmakers William
Hill said they had now raised the target age for bets from 100 to 110 .
Spokesman Rupert Adams explained : " When we started taking these bets , 100 years old seemed to be an almost mythical landmark and we were prepared to offer massive odds .
" But these age wagers are starting to cost us a fortune and from now on we are going to push out the age to 110 . "
However , he added : " I am sure that Alec will get more pleasure from our letter than he will from the Queen's . "
The bookmaker has now paid out three times on the same type of bet .
The two others were Rosalyn Strover , from Suffolk , in November 2004 , and Arthur Best , from Cheltenham , in January 2005 .
UNITED NATIONS 
As her aides anticipated an important announcement about Israeli - Arab diplomacy yesterday , sources in Jerusalem and Washington said Secretary of State Rice has encountered enough resistance from all sides to lower her expectations for a breakthrough .
Israeli officials have spoken to a top White House official in recent days , using friendly Washington contacts to go " over Condi's head " to describe several of her new ideas as unrealistic , a Jerusalem source , who declined to be identified , told The New York Sun .
Specifically , according to three officials involved in this week 's flurry of diplomatic activity in Washington , Jerusalem , Arab capitals , and the United Nations , Ms. Rice intended to intensify her shuttle diplomacy between Israeli and Palestinian Arab leaders , in an attempt to get them to start negotiating " final status " issues .
Prime Minister Olmert , who met with Ms. Rice last night , " did n't like that idea , " an Israeli official said .
Jerusalem opposes conducting negotiations now on such issues as final borders between Israel and a future Palestinian Arab state , control over Jerusalem , and the fate of so - called Arab refugees .
Instead , Israel insists on sticking to an incremental sequence described in the so - called road map , which calls for an end to violence first .
The president of the Palestinian Authority , Mahmoud Abbas , recently entered into a unity government with Hamas , defined by America as a terrorist organization , which can veto any agreement reached with Mr. Abbas .
The unity government has yet to recognize Israel , respect prior signed agreements , or renounce violence , as Washington and its partners have stipulated .
" Rice wants to show progress , but the regional laws of physics are against her , " an official involved , who asked for anonymity , said .
Mr. Olmert reportedly agreed yesterday to " open ended " meetings with Mr. Abbas , but only to discuss " humanitarian issues , " as he did prior to the formation of a unity government with Hamas .
An Arab League summit that will convene tomorrow in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , is expected to reaffirm a five - year - old plan known as the " Saudi initiative . "
But Arab foreign ministers yesterday failed to make any amendments to the plan , leaving several of its provisions unacceptable to Jerusalem .
Ms. Rice had scheduled a press conference yesterday afternoon , Israel time , where her aides expected an important announcement , but the press conference was rescheduled for this morning after her discussions with Mr. Olmert continued late into last night .
" I do n't intend by any means to take control of the Palestinian - Israeli bilateral dialogue , " Ms. Rice told reporters yesterday , when asked about " final status " issues after meeting Israel 's foreign minister , Tzipi Livni .
" What my role is is to assist the parties , and I 've been doing it this time in parallel , and I think that 's a good way to do it , to explore the issues before them , the possibilities of a political horizon , but also concrete issues of how to deal with their daily lives . "
At today 's press conference Ms. Rice is aiming to announce a future meeting in the region of the group known as " the quartet "  America , the European Union , Russia , and the United Nations .
The new twist is that this meeting would include several Arab countries  Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Jordan , and the United Arab Emirates  as well as Israel .
But though Mr. Olmert said he " would not hesitate to participate , " details involving the expanded meeting had yet to be finalized late last night .
" It is a very interesting , useful idea to consider , " Secretary - General Ban told reporters .
" But we need more consultations . "
On his first tour of the region in his new role , Mr. Ban met with Israeli representatives from across the political spectrum , and the main topic was the Saudi initiative , also known as the Arab plan .
The plan demands several territorial and other concessions by Israel in return for eventual diplomatic recognition by Arab states .
" The Arab plan is exactly that  Arab , " the opposition Likud leader , Benjamin Netanyahu , told Mr. Ban , according to Israeli press reports .
" It is good for the Arabs , but not for Israel . "
Mr. Netanyahu cited two objections to the plan : its approach to a " right of return " to Israel for 4.5 million descendants of Arabs who fled Palestine in 1948 ; and its insistence that Israel withdraw to an armistice line that existed in the West Bank between 1948 and 1967 .
Israel 's vice premier , Shimon Peres , asked Mr. Ban to convey his thanks to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia for his involvement , an aide to Mr. Peres , Yoram Dori , told the Sun .
Overt political debate in the Middle East is hostile to the American occupation of Iraq and dominated by calls for it to end sooner rather than later .
No less a figure than King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia , arguably the United States ' closest Arab ally , has declared the occupation of Iraq " illegal " and " illegitimate " .
Real intentions , however , are different .
States and local political groups might not admit it - because of public opinion - but they do not want to see the back of the Americans .
Not yet .
For this there is a simple reason : while the US can no longer successfully manipulate regional actors to carry out its plans , regional actors have learned to use the US presence to promote their own objectives .
Quietly and against the deeply held wishes of their populations , they have managed to keep the Americans engaged with the hope of some elusive victory .
The so - called axis of moderate Arab states - comprising Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Jordan - dreads an early US withdrawal .
First , because it would be widely interpreted as an American defeat , which would weaken these pro-American regimes while both energising and radicalising their populations .
Second , if the US leaves , the emergence of a Shia regime in Iraq - in itself an offensive prospect to them - would only be a matter of time .
Facing Arab antipathy , this regime would be likely to look eastward and forge close ties with its Iranian co-religionists .
In the view of most Arabs , this would present a formidable challenge , setting in motion a series of dangerous events - an Iranian - Iraqi alliance ; political and material support from Arab countries being offered to disgruntled Iraqi Sunni groups ; retaliation by Iraqi forces ; and the threat of broader regional involvement .
Third , a US departure risks triggering Iraq 's partition .
As some Arabs see it , the occupation is what holds the country together .
So long as coalition forces are deployed , a full - blown breakup can be avoided .
In contrast , with the Americans gone , the odds of partition would increase dramatically , presenting a threat to the integrity and security of regional states .
Exacerbating dormant , and in some cases not so dormant , secessionist tendencies would be one concern .
Perhaps more worrying would be the ensuing challenge to the legitimacy of the fundamental tenets of nationhood , state , and national borders .
Paradoxically , the competing axis of so - called rogue states made up of Syria and Iran also wants the US to stay .
So long as America remains mired in Iraq 's quicksand , they think , it will be difficult for it to embark on a similar adventure nearby .
This is true not only politically - the quagmire standing as a stark reminder of the invasion 's failure - but also militarily : US capabilities will remain stretched for as long as the occupation continues .
Moreover , American forces in Iraq present relatively soft targets for retaliation in case Iran or Syria is attacked .
In short , whether or not Syria and Iran are correct in their calculations , the occupation of Iraq is seen as the most effective insurance policy against a possible US attack against them .
For Turkey , America 's presence ensures that the national aspirations of Iraq 's Kurds will not metamorphose into a fully fledged independent state , a strict red line for Ankara , which has its own irredentist Kurdish problem .
By containing Kurdish ambitions , the US diminishes the probability of a costly and uncertain Turkish military campaign to thwart them .
Nor is Turkey attracted to the prospect of an Iraqi Shia state allied to Iran and tolerant of Kurdish aspirations - an outcome it hopes the occupation will make less likely .
For Israel too , an American withdrawal could spell disaster .
Already , nothing has dented Israeli deterrence more than America 's performance in Iraq - an inspiration to Israel 's Arab foes that even the mightiest can be brought to heel .
An early withdrawal , coming in the wake of last summer 's Lebanon war , could put Israel in a dangerous position , handing a victory to Iran - the latest putative threat to Israel 's existence - and providing a boost to Syria which may be considering military options to recover the Golan Heights .
There are risks for the smaller Gulf states too .
With their large Shia communities and heavy dependence on American protection , they would be threatened by an early US departure from Iraq .
In Bahrain , home to an unhappy Shia majority , the fallout could be imminent .
Inside Iraq , this is a period of consolidation for most political groups .
They are building up their political and military capabilities , cultivating and forging alliances , clarifying political objectives and preparing for impending challenges .
It is not the moment for all - out confrontation .
No group has the confidence or capacity decisively to confront rivals within its own community or across communal lines .
Equally , no party is genuinely interested in a serious process of national reconciliation when they feel they can improve their position later on .
A continued American presence is consistent with both concerns - it can keep clashes manageable and be used to postpone the need for serious political engagement .
Shias in government would like the US to stay long enough for them to tighten their grip on the levers of state power and build a loyal military .
Those Shias who are not in power would like them to stay long enough to avoid a premature showdown with their rivals .
Militant Shia groups can simultaneously blame the occupation forces for their community 's plight and attack them to mobilise further support .
Pro-Iranian Shias , meanwhile , retaliate against anti-Iranian US moves with attacks on Americans in Iraq .
Al - Qaida and its affiliates arguably benefit most from the occupation .
They established themselves , brought in recruits , sustained operations against the Americans and expanded .
The last thing they want is for the Americans to leave and deny them targets and motivation for new members .
Other Sunni armed groups need the Americans for similar reasons and for protection against Shias .
For Sunni politicians , the occupation prevents a total Shia takeover of state institutions and helps increase their influence .
Of all ethnic groups , the Kurds have made best use of the Americans .
Protected by the US from their powerful and ruthless historical foes , Arab and Turk , they have built quasi - independent institutions and prospered amid relative security .
They have no reason to want this situation to end .
In common with neighbouring states , Iraqi Shias , Sunnis and Kurds are united in being able to use the Americans ' presence to pursue separate and often conflicting political agendas .
The grand disconnect in the region is between the political sentiments of ordinary people , which are overwhelmingly for an end to occupation , and the political calculations of leaders , which emphasise the benefits of using the Americans and consequently of extending their stay - at least for the time being .
In this grim picture , the Americans appear the least sure and most confused .
With unattainable objectives , wobbly plans , changing tactics , shifting alliances and ever - increasing casualties , it is not clear any longer what they want or how they are going to achieve it .
By setting themselves up to be manipulated , they give credence to an old Arab saying : the magic has taken over the magician .

Haskell shows best and brightest the glamour of monads for i/o , C function calls and other interactions .
However lazy i/o expressed by monads is more a matter of style , and can be closely emulated in other languages .
Scheme for example allows both unbridled side - effecting interaction , and a " pure " , monadic IO with all worldly effects performed only by a distinguished actor .
A message " lazy string - append and HTML generation " gives another example of monads , in concatenating strings .
Rather than applying string - append to a list of strings , we can " assume " the operation and leave the list of strings as it is .
If we need to concatenate more strings , we will join the corresponding lists .
We can assume the join operation as well , and represent ( append l1 l2 ) with just ( list l1 l2 ) .
The resulting tree of string chunks denotes the concatenated string : the string - append action is implied but not actually performed .
Chances are we may not need any explicit string - append at all : if the resulting string is meant to be written , we will walk the tree instead and display the chunks in - order .
' Impeachment rallies ' scheduled across US for Saturday
Josh Catone
Published : Monday April 23 , 2007 Print This Email This
People will call for the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney at over 100 actions planned across the country on Saturday , April 28 .
The creative actions include rallies , banner drops on freeways , " guerrilla slide shows " on the sides of New York City buildings , skywriting , and " human murals " of people spelling out " IMPEACH ! " with their bodies at Ocean Beach in San Francisco , Coney Island in New York , the foot of the Washington monument in Washington , D.C. , and other locations .
" George Bush and Dick Cheney lied the nation into an illegal war of aggression , are spying on millions of innocent Americans , and have authorized the use of torture , " said Jacob Park , the national coordinator of the April 28 impeachment actions .
" The time has come for all Americans -- particularly our representatives in Congress - - to decide where they we stand .
To turn a blind eye to lying , spying , and torture makes a mockery of our most basic values and the very notion of democracy . "
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) plans to introduce articles of impeachment for Vice President Dick Cheney at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon .
" Cheney spokeswoman Megan McGinn responded to Kucinich 's announcement by saying that the vice president has served the nation honorably for almost 40 years , " reports the Associated Press .
" The vice president is focused on the serious issues facing our nation , " McGinn said .
On Friday , Vermont state senators passed a resolution calling for the impeachment of both the president and vice president for actions that have raised " serious questions of constitutionality . "
Chess makes a fantastic game for programming examples .
You will find hundreds of examples on the internet .
Some dedicated to OO patterns , others to algorithms and so forth .
Unfortunately , most of these examples do not use a database or if they do , treat the database as nothing more than a storage repository .
In this series of articles we will use SQL Server and T - SQL to implement the game of chess with an emphasis on thinking in sets .
Modeling the board
Chess is played on an 8 by 8 grid represented by 64 unique squares .
Each square has 2 properties that provide its location on the board .
The nomenclature of chess uses an alpha-numeric designation for each square
a8 ( 1,8 ) b8 ( 2,8 ) c8 ( 3,8 ) d8 ( 4,8 ) e8 ( 5,8 ) f8 ( 6,8 ) g8 ( 7,8 ) h8 ( 8,8 ) a 7 ( 1,7 ) b7 ( 2,7 ) c7 ( 3,7 ) d7 ( 4,7 ) e7 ( 5,7 ) f7 ( 6,7 ) g7 ( 7,7 ) h7 ( 8,7 ) a6 ( 1,6 ) b6 ( 2,6 ) c6 ( 3,6 ) d6 ( 4,6 ) e6 ( 5,6 ) f6 ( 6,6 ) g6 ( 7,6 ) h6 ( 8,6 ) a5 ( 1,5 ) b5 ( 2,5 ) c5 ( 3,5 ) d5 ( 4,5 ) e5 ( 5,5 ) f5 ( 6,5 ) g5 ( 7,5 ) h5 ( 8,5 ) a4 ( 1,4 ) b4 ( 2,4 ) c4 ( 3,4 ) d4 ( 4,4 ) e4 ( 5,4 ) f4 ( 6,4 ) g4 ( 7,4 ) h4 ( 8,4 ) a 3 ( 1,3 ) b3 ( 2,3 ) c3 ( 3,3 ) d3 ( 4,3 ) e3 ( 5,3 ) f3 ( 6,3 ) g3 ( 7,3 ) h3 ( 8,3 ) a 2 ( 1,2 ) b2 ( 2,2 ) c2 ( 3,2 ) d2 ( 4,2 ) e2 ( 5,2 ) f2 ( 6,2 ) g2 ( 7,2 ) h2 ( 8,2 ) a 1 ( 1,1 ) b1 ( 2,1 ) c1 ( 3,1 ) d1 ( 4,1 ) e1 ( 5,1 ) f1 ( 6,1 ) g1 ( 7,1 ) h1 ( 8,1 )
If we swap the alphabetical characters with numbers ( a=1 , b=2 , etc . . ) the square could be interpreted as a " Point " like structure represented as X ( a..h ) and Y ( 1..8 ) coordinates .
Using this " Point " representation will allow us to perform basic maths against the board .
One way to represent a Point is by creating an attribute ( column ) for each property .
That gives us a basic table with X and Y attributes .
This design allows us to leverage the indexing system in SQL Server .
To help us with the mapping from a " Point " to the chess nomenclature , we add another column named Square .
I have chosen to implement the Square attribute as a computed ( derived ) column for no good reason other than to test the conversion formula between the " Point " and " Square " representation .
CREATE TABLE [ dbo ] .[ Board ] ( [ X ] [ smallint ] NOT NULL , [ Y ] [ smallint ] NOT NULL , [ Square ] AS ( isnull ( convert ( char ( 2 ) , ( char ( ( 96 + [ X ] ) ) + convert ( char ( 1 ) , [ Y ] ) ) ) , '' ) ) , CONSTRAINT [ PK_Board ]
PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ( [ X ] , [Y ] ) , CONSTRAINT [ CK_Board ] UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED ( [ Square ] ) , CONSTRAINT [ CHK_Board_X_Domain ] CHECK ( [ X ] >= 1 and [ X ] <= 8 ) , CONSTRAINT [ CHK_Board_Y_Domain ] CHECK ( [ Y ] >= 1 and [ Y ] <= 8 ) ) GO
We now have a simple table with basic constraints .
Insert 64 unique rows using this script and the board representation is complete .
Consider the proposition that a piece can be anywhere and moved to anywhere but its original position .
In other words , show all the " From Square " - " To Square " combinations .
It is surprisingly easy to do this by using some basic SQL .
Select R.Square as FromSquare , O.Square as ToSquare from dbo .
Board R CROSS JOIN dbo .
Board O WHERE R.Square != O.Square --( 4032 row(s ) affected )
Examining this query we find 2 important features :
The CROSS JOIN multiples 2 tables together .
In this case , 64 rows times 64 rows = 4096 rows .
This is a PRODUCT in relational terms .
The WHERE applies the fact that a " move " requires the piece to actually move .
This is a RESTRICTION in relational terms .
( 64 Rows )
Thus 4096 rows - 64 rows = 4032 rows .
This very simple query shows the inherent power of manipulating sets .
We will create a view ( AllMoves ) to encapsulate this statement for reuse .
create view AllMoves ( X , Y , FromSquare , Xi , Yi , ToSquare ) as Select R.X , R.Y , R.Square , O.X , O.Y , O.Square from Board R cross join Board O where R.Square !=
O.Square
I have used the column names Xi to and Yi to indicate the " To Square " and X and Y to indicate the " From Square " .
Obviously , there are " movements " in this view which are impossible in chess .
By interpreting the rules of chess , we will RESTRICT this set ( AllMoves ) until only valid chess moves remain .
Basic Piece Movement
The Castle
Castles move in either a horizontal or vertical path along the board .
When we look at the point representation of the board , we can see a pattern that must be followed :
The X coordinate is constant OR the Y coordinate is constant
Select FromSquare , ToSquare from dbo .
AllMoves where ( X = Xi or Y = Yi ) --( 896 row(s ) affected )
How simple was that ?
Enough said !
The Bishop
Bishops move in diagonals .
Looking at the board we see another pattern that must be followed :
The absolute difference between the X movements equals the absolute difference the Y Movements
Select FromSquare , ToSquare from AllMoves where ABS ( X - Xi ) = ABS ( Y - Yi ) --( 560 row(s ) affected )
Still a very simple query .
Incidentally , this query threw an overflow error in my initial design .
Tinyint 's are n't wide enough .
The Knight
Looking at the Board , we can see how easy it is to translate the knight movements into a set of all possible knight moves using the " One - Two " motion .
Select FromSquare , ToSquare from dbo .
AllMoves where ( ABS ( X - Xi ) = 2 AND ABS (Y - Yi ) = 1 ) OR ( ABS ( X - Xi ) = 1 AND ABS (Y - Yi ) = 2 ) --( 336 row(s ) affected )
When the castle , bishop and knights moves are added together , they represent the set of every possibly valid move :
Castle ( 896 ) + Bishop ( 560 ) + Knight ( 336 ) = 1792 Possibly Valid Moves
The king , queen and pawn movements are contained within these Possibly Valid Moves .
In relational terms it is very simple to add tables together using an addition ( Plus ) operation .
In SQL , it is just as easy with a choice of UNION or UNION ALL .
The " ALL " extension includes duplicates but in our case there are none and is irrelevant .
select X , Y , FromSquare , Xi , Yi , ToSquare from dbo .
AllMoves where ( X = Xi or Y = Yi ) union all select X , Y , FromSquare , Xi , Yi , ToSquare from dbo .
AllMoves where ABS ( X - Xi ) = ABS ( Y - Yi ) union all select X , Y , FromSquare , Xi , Yi , ToSquare from dbo .
AllMoves where ( ABS ( X - Xi ) = 2 AND ABS (Y - Yi ) = 1 ) OR ( ABS ( X - Xi ) = 1 AND ABS (Y - Yi ) = 2 ) --( 1792 row(s ) affected )
This query can be re-written without the UNION operator and expressed entirely with RESTRICTION ( WHERE ) :
select X , Y , FromSquare , Xi , Yi , ToSquare from dbo .
AllMoves where ( X = Xi or Y = Yi ) -- Castle OR ABS (X - Xi ) = ABS (Y - Yi ) -- Bishop OR ( ( ABS ( X - Xi ) = 2 AND ABS (Y - Yi ) = 1 ) OR ( ABS ( X - Xi ) = 1 AND ABS (Y - Yi ) = 2 ) ) -- Knight --( 1792 row(s ) affected )
The speed freak in all of us would prefer the later approach as only 2 scans of the table are taken versus 6 .
Just for a moment consider the simplicity of the above SQL .
Not bad for a " storage repository " !
The Queen
The queen can behave like a castle or bishop .
A simple UNION of the Castle and Bishop moves .
Select FromSquare , ToSquare from dbo .
AllMoves B where ABS ( X - Xi ) = ABS ( Y - Yi ) union all Select FromSquare , ToSquare from AllMoves C where ( X = Xi or Y = Yi ) -- ( 1456 row (s ) affected )
The King
The king can move to an adjacent square or perform a " castling " .
The adjacent square rule can be expressed by restricting the absolute difference between the X movements and Y movements to less than 2 .
The castling rule applies positional restrictions on the Y and X elements
Select FromSquare , ToSquare from dbo .
AllMoves where ABS ( X - Xi ) < 2 AND ABS ( Y - Yi ) < 2 OR ( Y = Yi AND X = 5 AND ABS ( X - Xi ) = 2 AND Y in ( 1,8 ) ) -- ( 424 row (s ) affected )
The Pawn
The pawns movement is slightly more complex than the others due to the " 1 or 2 square " start move , plus the different attack move , but is still fairly straight forward .
Select FromSquare , ToSquare from dbo .
AllMoves where Y != Yi AND ( ( ABS ( X - Xi ) < 2 AND ABS ( Y - Yi ) < 2 ) OR ( X=Xi AND ( ( Y = 2 and Yi = 4 ) OR ( Y = 7 and Yi = 5 ) ) ) ) --( 324 row(s ) affected )
So far , we have found the set of all possibly valid moves for each piece .
The simplicity of the code involved should demonstrate to you the power of set based processing .
Before we start looking at the " deeper " chess rules in the next article we will continue with basic piece movement and examine the paths that pieces travel over when moving .

The launch took place at the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia at 1420 ( 1020 GMT ) on Tuesday .
The missile , called RS - 24 , can be armed with up to 10 warheads and was designed to evade missile defence systems , the Russian defence ministry says .
Russia has complained that US plans to base parts of an anti-missile system in central Europe threaten its security .
The Americans maintain that their system is not directed at the Russians .
The US wants to deploy interceptor rockets in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic to counter what it describes as a potential threat from " rogue states " such as Iran and North Korea .
The Russian test missile successfully struck its target 5,500 km ( 3,400 miles ) away on the far eastern Kamchatka peninsula , the Russian Strategic Missile Forces said .
The statement said the missile would replace two ageing ICBM systems - the RS - 18 and RS - 20 , known in the West as the SS - 19 Stiletto and SS - 18 Satan , respectively .
Modernising arsenal
Our world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds says the Russian missile test has more to do with Russia 's plans to modernise its nuclear force than its complaints about the proposed US missile defence shield in Europe , which US officials say could not intercept Russian missiles .
Of particular concern to Russia is the treaty between the US and the then Soviet Union that banned intermediate range nuclear weapons , he writes .
This treaty is still in force and applies only to the US and Russia .
Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov , quoted by Reuters on Tuesday , said the deployment of medium - and short - range missiles by Russia 's neighbours to the east and south now posed a " real threat " .
" The Soviet - American treaty ( on intermediate nuclear forces ) is not effective because since ( its signature ) scores of countries have appeared that have such missiles , while Russia and the United States are not allowed to have them , " he told a military - industrial commission in the southern city of Znamensk .
" In these conditions , it is necessary to provide our troops with modern , high - precision weapons . "
Please walk vigorously on the spot while reading this , because apparently 10,000 steps a day might not be enough after all ( it always felt like a conveniently round figure anyway ) .
A study by the University of Alberta has concluded that a six - month exercise programme of so - called moderate intensity is a better way of achieving what one researcher called " marked health benefits " than placing one foot in front of another ad , it seems , nauseam .
But instead of taking the long route around the office to throw your pedometer into the bin - stopping to touch your toes while breathing regularly throughout - do not despair .
According to Ellen Mason , a cardiac nurse for the British Heart Foundation , the " 10,000 - steps idea is a good way to encourage people to start ; but a big failing is that many people just do n't walk fast enough or hard enough " .
So what is the easiest way to keep obesity at bay ?
( According to the current way of thinking , at least . )
" Our publicity recommends 30 minutes , five times a week , of moderate - intensity exercise - like brisk walking , swimming or cycling - and one hour every day for children .
You should feel warm after it , maybe a bit sweaty , and still be able to speak , but not very easily . "
The parameters , then , are clear : if , after your swift perambulation / paddle / pedal you find yourself cool , dry and sufficiently loquacious to visit the in - laws for dinner without taking a shower , the chances are you have missed the mark .
If , however , you bring to mind the Scottish golfer Colin Montgomerie at the end of his singles match in Sunday 's Ryder Cup , you are doing just fine .
Over in America , there seems little danger of that .
The website of the US Department of Health & Human Services contains a handy list of 119 " small steps " towards larger lungs , of which , " Walk briskly in the mall " is reassuringly typical .
However , since other snippets of advice include " Sit up straight at work " , " Make up a batch of brownies with apple sauce instead of oil " and " Try your burger with just lettuce , tomato and onions " , it seems fair to ask whether 30 minutes , five times a week will ever catch on .

I remember my brother and I playing this game ( I mean toy ) many years ago and we would have always the guy get hurt and our dad got pissed and told us to not do it ( we never listened ) .
Russia is preparing its own military response to the US 's controversial plans to build a new missile defence system in eastern Europe , according to Kremlin officials , in a move likely to increase fears of a cold war - style arms race .
The Kremlin is considering active counter - measures in response to Washington 's decision to base interceptor missiles and radar installations in Poland and the Czech Republic , a move Russia says will change " the world 's strategic stability " .
The Kremlin has not publicly spelt out its plans .
But defence experts said its response is likely to include upgrading its nuclear missile arsenal so that it is harder to shoot down , putting more missiles on mobile launchers , and moving its fleet of nuclear submarines to the north pole , where they are virtually undetectable .
Russia could also bring the new US silos within the range of its Iskander missiles launched potentially from the nearby Russian enclave of Kaliningrad , they add .
In an interview with the Guardian , the Kremlin 's chief spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , said Moscow felt betrayed by the Pentagon 's move .
" We were extremely concerned and disappointed .
We were never informed in advance about these plans .
It brings tremendous change to the strategic balance in Europe , and to the world 's strategic stability . "
He added : " We feel ourselves deceived .
Potentially we will have to create alternatives to this but with low cost and higher efficiency . "
Any response would be within " existing technologies " , he said .
As well as military counter - measures , Russia 's president , Vladimir Putin , also wanted " dialogue " and " negotiations " , he added .
The Bush administration says the bases are designed to shoot down rogue missiles fired by Iran or North Korea .
Its proposed system would be helpless against Russia 's vast nuclear arsenal , it says .
But this claim has been greeted with widespread incredulity , not just in Russia but also among some of the US 's nervous Nato allies .
They include Germany , where the Social Democrat leader , Kurt Beck , warned last month that the US and Russia were on the brink of another arms race " on European soil " .
Defence experts say there is little doubt that the real target of the shield is Russia .
" The geography of the deployment does n't give any doubt the main targets are Russian and Chinese nuclear forces , " General Vladimir Belous , Russia 's leading expert on anti-ballistic weaponry , told the Guardian .
" The US bases represent a real threat to our strategic nuclear forces . "
The threat of a new arms race comes at a time when relations between Russia and the US are at their worst for a decade .
In February Mr Putin accused the Bush administration during a speech in Munich of seeking a " world of one master , one sovereign " .
On Friday Russia 's duma , or lower house or parliament , warned that the US 's plans could ignite a second cold war .
" Such decisions , which are useless in terms of preventing potential or imaginary threats from countries of the middle and far - east , are already bringing about a new split in Europe and unleashing another arms race , " the declaration - passed unanimously by Russian MPs - said .
The same day Russia ruled out cooperating with the US over the shield .
" Despite certain signals received in recent days from the US side ... I see no political foundation for it , " said Sergei Ryabkov , a foreign ministry spokesman .
Moscow now had little choice but to take the bases " into account in our strategic planning " , he said .
Analysts said there was a common feeling in Russia that the US had reneged on an agreement after the collapse of the Soviet Union to abandon cold war politics .
" Cold war thinking has prevailed , especially on the western side , " Yevgeny Myasnikov , a senior research scientist at Moscow 's Centre for Arms Control , told the Guardian .
" Russia has been deeply disappointed by what has happened after 1991 .
Nato started to expand , and the US started to think it had won the cold war .
We had hoped for a partnership .
But it did n't happen . "
A three - week wave of massive cyber-attacks on the small Baltic country of Estonia , the first known incidence of such an assault on a state , is causing alarm across the western alliance , with Nato urgently examining the offensive and its implications .
While Russia and Estonia are embroiled in their worst dispute since the collapse of the Soviet Union , a row that erupted at the end of last month over the Estonians ' removal of the Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial in central Tallinn , the country has been subjected to a barrage of cyber warfare , disabling the websites of government ministries , political parties , newspapers , banks , and companies .
Nato has dispatched some of its top cyber - terrorism experts to Tallinn to investigate and to help the Estonians beef up their electronic defences .
" This is an operational security issue , something we 're taking very seriously , " said an official at Nato headquarters in Brussels .
" It goes to the heart of the alliance 's modus operandi . "
Alarm over the unprecedented scale of cyber - warfare is to be raised tomorrow at a summit between Russian and European leaders outside Samara on the Volga .
While planning to raise the issue with the Russian authorities , EU and Nato officials have been careful not to accuse the Russians directly .
If it were established that Russia is behind the attacks , it would be the first known case of one state targeting another by cyber - warfare .
Relations between the Kremlin and the west are at their worst for years , with Russia engaged in bitter disputes not only with Estonia , but with Poland , Lithuania , the Czech Republic , and Georgia - all former parts of the Soviet Union or ex-members of the Warsaw Pact .
The electronic offensive is making matters much worse .
" Frankly it is clear that what happened in Estonia in the cyber - attacks is not acceptable and a very serious disturbance , " said a senior EU official .
Estonia 's president , foreign minister , and defence minister have all raised the emergency with their counterparts in Europe and with Nato .
" At present , Nato does not define cyber - attacks as a clear military action .
This means that the provisions of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty , or , in other words collective self - defence , will not automatically be extended to the attacked country , " said the Estonian defence minister , Jaak Aaviksoo .
" Not a single Nato defence minister would define a cyber - attack as a clear military action at present .
However , this matter needs to be resolved in the near future . "
Estonia , a country of 1.4 million people , including a large ethnic Russian minority , is one of the most wired societies in Europe and a pioneer in the development of " e- government " .
Being highly dependent on computers , it is also highly vulnerable to cyber - attack .
The main targets have been the websites of :
· the Estonian presidency and its parliament
· almost all of the country 's government ministries
· political parties
· three of the country 's six big news organisations
· two of the biggest banks ; and firms specializing in communications
It is not clear how great the damage has been .
With their reputation for electronic prowess , the Estonians have been quick to marshal their defences , mainly by closing down the sites under attack to foreign internet addresses , in order to try to keep them accessible to domestic users .
The cyber-attacks were clearly prompted by the Estonians ' relocation of the Soviet second world war memorial on April 27 .
Ethnic Russians staged protests against the removal , during which 1,300 people were arrested , 100 people were injured , and one person was killed .
The crisis unleashed a wave of so - called DDoS , or Distributed Denial of Service , attacks , where websites are suddenly swamped by tens of thousands of visits , jamming and disabling them by overcrowding the bandwidths for the servers running the sites .
The attacks have been pouring in from all over the world , but Estonian officials and computer security experts say that , particularly in the early phase , some attackers were identified by their internet addresses - many of which were Russian , and some of which were from Russian state institutions .
" The cyber - attacks are from Russia .
There is no question .
It 's political , " said Merit Kopli , editor of Postimees , one of the two main newspapers in Estonia , whose website has been targeted and has been inaccessible to international visitors for a week .
It was still unavailable last night .
" If you are implying [ the attacks ] came from Russia or the Russian government , it 's a serious allegation that has to be substantiated .
Cyber - space is everywhere , " Russia 's ambassador in Brussels , Vladimir Chizhov , said in reply to a question from the Guardian .
He added : " I do n't support such behaviour , but one has to look at where they [ the attacks ] came from and why . "
Without naming Russia , the Nato official said : " I wo n't point fingers .
But these were not things done by a few individuals .
" This clearly bore the hallmarks of something concerted .
The Estonians are not alone with this problem .
It really is a serious issue for the alliance as a whole . "
Mr Chizhov went on to accuse the EU of hypocrisy in its support for Estonia , an EU and Nato member .
" There is a smell of double standards . "
He also accused Poland of holding the EU hostage in its dealings with Russia , and further accused Estonia and other east European countries previously in Russia 's orbit of being in thrall to " phantom pains of the past , historic grievances against the Soviet union and the Russian empire of the 19th century . "
In Tallinn , Ms Kopli said : " This is the first time this has happened , and it is very important that we 've had this type of attack .
We 've been able to learn from it . "
" We have been lucky to survive this , " said Mikko Maddis , Estonia 's defence ministry spokesman .
" People started to fight a cyber - war against it right away .
Ways were found to eliminate the attacker . "
The attacks have come in three waves : from April 27 , when the Bronze Soldier riots erupted , peaking around May 3 ; then on May 8 and 9 - a couple of the most celebrated dates in the Russian calendar , when the country marks Victory Day over Nazi Germany , and when President Vladimir Putin delivered another hostile speech attacking Estonia and indirectly likening the Bush administration to the Hitler regime ; and again this week .
Estonian officials say that one of the masterminds of the cyber - campaign , identified from his online name , is connected to the Russian security service .
A 19 - year - old was arrested in Tallinn at the weekend for his alleged involvement .
Expert opinion is divided on whether the identity of the cyber - warriors can be ascertained properly .
Experts from Nato member states and from the alliance 's NCSA unit - " Nato 's first line of defence against cyber - terrorism " , set up five years ago - were meeting in Seattle in the US when the crisis erupted .
A couple of them were rushed to Tallinn .
Another Nato official familiar with the experts ' work said it was easy for them , with other organisations and internet providers , to track , trace , and identify the attackers .
But Mikko Hyppoenen , a Finnish expert , told the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that it would be difficult to prove the Russian state 's responsibility , and that the Kremlin could inflict much more serious cyber - damage if it chose to .
Is there anything you cannot do from your car these days ?
Maybe you 'll get the answer after reading this article :
At the Daytona Drive in Church , in Florida , Christians do n't even have to get out of the car .
Reverend Larry G. Deitch delivers a sermon from a balcony to the church goers at the parking lot .
This drive - in Christian Church is a converted drive - in movie theatre in Daytona Beach .
The minister delivers his message from a high balcony just below where the movie screen once hung .
According to National Catholic Reporter , the congregation attracts an average of 700 people every week .
To hear the service , worshipers must tune 88.5 FM .
As you can see at this fantastic Andrew Kaufman ’s photo essay , churchgoers receive a packaged Communion kit where they can find some wine for the worship .
Of course , at the end of each sermon , Reverend Deitch “ makes it a point to say goodbye personally to all the church goers ” .
However , this drive - thru service is not the only one in the world .
The Reverend Erling H. Wold opened the early morning drive - in services of Emmanuel Lutheran Church in North Hollywood , June 1965 .
A few years ago the “ Main Place Christian Fellowship , an evangelical church located in Tustin outside Los Angeles , converted a former photo booth in a nearby parking lot into a drive - thru prayer booth " .
" Any driver in need of a prayer can drive through and remain in his car while a pastor on duty prays for him through a window .
In addition to free prayers , the booth also gives away free Bibles , bottled water and sometimes flowers " .
“ For the couple that wants to have some fun and tell their friends they got married at a " Drive Thru " Wedding Window in Las Vegas ” .
In Alexandria , Pennsylvania , Climax " gentlemen 's club " claimed to be the first , and apparently the only , drive - through strip club in the world .
Patrons pulled up next to a tiny window so the drivers could watch through it at $ 5 per minute .
For some time , Junior Funeral Home in Pensacola ( Florida ) offered ' an optional drive thru viewing window ' .
The body was displayed close to the window so relatives could give their last goodbye from the car .
The Pensacola drive - thru Funeral home was finally closed , but there 's another one in Chicago More info and sources : 1
NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski reports on how the Bush administration pays the Pakistani government $ 1 billion a year to hunt down Osama bin Laden , and demands zero accountability as to how that money is spent .
Download Download
So if I understand this correctly , we are paying Musharraf $ 1 billion a year to strike immunity deals with the warlords thought to be harboring this man we 're paying him to catch ?
This is appalling on so many levels .
Given the huge sum of money we 're paying this man to implement policies that are counterproductive to our national security and yield few results , how can we possibly consider him our " strong friend and ally " ?
Let 's review the Bush administration 's record for a second and how insane it is for them to suggest ( and for his water carriers to defend ) that they are " strong on terror " : First , they ignored countless warnings pre-9/11 .
( more below the fold )
Then they allowed bin Laden to slip across the Pakistani border .
Then they propagated a non-existant link between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein to drag us into a war that has not only destroyed our military , treasury , and moral credibility , but has also made us infinitely less safe by creating an entirely new generation of Islamic extremists hellbent on destroying America .
Then , as if all that was n't enough , they shut down the CIA unit dedicated to huting down the man President Bush once pledged to bring to justice " dead or alive . "
Can anybody tell me with a straight face what this administration has done right in the war on terror ?
Anybody ?
To put this into perspective , that yearly $ 1 billion could have insured 600,000 children ; paid for more than 17,000 teachers ; or sent 48,000 kids to college for four years .
But no , it 's smarter to give it to someone who could seemingly care less about apprehending America 's # 1 fugitive .

Princeton , N.J. :
On the front page of the NY Times today is an article replete with pictures of the Bush administration 's treatment of Joseph ( sic ) Padilla , an American citizen .
Do you think the pictures will have a similar effect on the U.S. public as did the pictures of torture in Iraq ?
Howard Kurtz : I do n't know .
It depends on whether you believe that someone accused of plotting a dirty - bomb attack should have to wear blacked - out goggles and have his legs shackled when he is taken outside solitary confinement for a dentist 's appointment .
Wilmington , N.C. : " It depends on whether you believe that someone accused of plotting a dirty - bomb attack should have to wear blacked - out goggles and have his legs shackled when he is taken outside solitary confinement for a dentist 's appointment . "
None of the allegations against Mr. Padilla mention a dirty - bomb attack .
Have I missed something ?
Howard Kurtz :
Well , the second graph of the NYT story says , " Mr. Padilla , a Brooklyn - born Muslim convert whom the Bush administration had accused of plotting a dirty bomb attack and had detained without charges ... "
UPDATE
Howard Kurtz , the media critic for both CNN and The Washington Post , participated in an online chat yesterday , and was asked about the Jose Padilla story in yesterday 's New York Times .
This is what ensued : Kurtz 's answer , brief though it may be , illustrates so very many things about our country and its media ( h/t to this TPM commenter , who obviously knows how to bait ) .
Some aspects of Kurtz 's answer are too self - evident to merit extended discussion , beginning with his painfully shallow and misleading understanding of what the entire Padilla story is about .
To Kurtz , the uproar is about nothing other than whether an Accused Terrorist should have to wear leg shackles and " goggles " when being transported outside of his prison cell .
In Kurtz 's world , the only thing this non-story really implicates are some routine matters involving prisoner security which only whiny human rights hysterics would be upset about .
After all , what sensible person would ever question whether a Dangerous Prisoner should be subject to some reasonable security precautions when being transported ?
It 's just some leg shackles and goggles .
What 's all the fuss about ?
What 's next ?
Will the ACLU also demand a color television for Al Qaeda murderers ?
Kurtz's " understanding " of this story is the rough equivalent of what a garden - variety right - wing blogger would say about it -- say , Kurtz 's most favorite TV guest , John Hinderaker , or even Rush Limbaugh .
And then there is the inexcusable outright factual inaccuracy of claiming that Padilla 's treatment can be justified on the ground that he is " accused of plotting a dirty - bomb attack . "
It 's fairly obvious that Howard Kurtz knows very , very little about what has happened to Jose Padilla .
Anyone who has paid even mild attention knows that when the Bush administration was finally forced to indict him , the criminal charges included none of the flamboyant accusations they had made in press conferences and via leaks over the last 3 years , including the accusation that he is a " dirty bomber . "
Contrary to Kurtz 's claim , Padilla does not stand accused of that .
Even when confronted with that fact in a subsequent question by a reader much more informed than he was , Kurtz continued to display abject ignorance about the Padilla case on which he was opining : Kurtz is ignorant of the most basic facts here because he is indifferent to this story .
And he 's indifferent to this story not because he has no opinion about it , but precisely because he does have an opinion about it -- a very clear and didactic opinion .
Kurtz 's answer to the reader -- as well as his factual ignorance about this entire matter -- makes clear that he thinks there is nothing even notable , let alone objectionable , about the fact that the Bush administration imprisons American citizens and treats them for years like farm animals even though they 've never been charged with ( never mind convicted of ) any crime .
To Kurtz , that is not something even worthy of discussion .
When someone discusses the Padilla matter specifically -- or the general fact that the Bush administration imprisons people indefinitely , including U.S. citizens , with no charges and often in the most inhumane manner -- it is quite common to hear expressions of incredulity , genuine bafflement , over the fact that not only is our government engaging in such conduct , but that it is prompting so little public outcry .
I 'm rarely able to avoid talking about this issue without making that point -- why is n't this most patent violation of our country 's core principles , whereby our fellow citizens are being imprisoned and tortured by our government with no charges , prompting genuine anger ?
This is the reason why .
Over the last five years , the media ( with some notable and noble exceptions ) essentially embraced the central premise of the Bush administration -- that in order for us to be protected , we must place our faith in the Leader and know that he is doing Good , because he wants to protect us .
He may err at times .
He might even go a little too far or be a little zealous in what he does to make us safe .
But there are Very , Very Bad People in the world who want to kill us -- Padilla is " accused of plotting a dirty - bomb attack " ! -- and the Leader needs the power to get his hands dirty and take care of them .
The last thing we should be concerned with is what the Leader does to them .
With those premises snugly in place , " journalists " like Kurtz have spent the last five years doing the opposite of what they were supposed to be doing -- rather than skeptically scrutinize the conduct and motives of the Leader , they became his most enthusiastic followers .
The President 's promises of protection from the Scary Terrorists Who Want to Kill
You resonated most loudly among the frightened , coddled media elites like Kurtz , who were more than eager to fulfill their end of the bargain by assuming the core goodness and honesty of the Government and never questioning that basic premise .
For the media to have any worthwhile function at all , it needs to be the least trusting group in the country , not the most .
Their principal function is to serve as an adversarial watchdog over those in power , informing Americans when the Government 's claims and behavior are suspect .
That 's just Journalism 101 .
It is vital that , if anything , they err -- strongly -- on the side of excess skepticism .
Placing blind faith and trust in the actions of political leaders is the antithesis of the journalistic ethos , but those are the attributes which have been driving most of the nation 's most influential political journalists throughout the Bush Presidency .
As Walter Pincus ' belated though still welcome
Post article this week illustrates , the time of reckoning for journalists -- an examination of the indispensable and corrupt role they played in enabling what has happened over the last five years -- is rapidly approaching .
Journalists and similar types are beginning to acknowledge the almost complete co-opting of the media by the Bush administration over the last five years .
There is , in some journalistic circles , a burgeoning ( and very well - earned ) shame over the entirely voluntary transformation of the media into a subservient propaganda arm of the most extreme elements of the Bush agenda .
The Bush administration was able to invade Iraq , imprison and torture people ( including U.S. citizens ) , and repeatedly and openly break the law not because the Howard Kurtz 's of our country failed in their duty as journalists ( although they did , profoundly ) .
It goes beyond that .
They affirmatively believed in those things -- and in many cases , still do -- every bit as much as the President and his government did , and they worked in harmonious concert with the administration to do as much , if not more , to enable it .
Why is n't there more of a controversy over the radicalism of the Bush movement ?
Ask Howard Kurtz .
It 's just some goggles and leg shackles for a Terrorist .
What 's there to discuss ? :
Credit where it 's due - one authortarian Bush follower has discovered a very likely and reasonable explanation as to why Padilla was forced to wear those " goggles . "
And just to be clear : she did not say this in jest .
In case you missed it , Fuel 0.1 recently landed in Firefox 3.0a4 .
Fuel 0.1 focused on building a solid foundation for further development ; laying a good application and events layer , and building out Preference management .
Much of our original plan was scaled back due to the nature of how JavaScript APIs need to be written using XPCOM and IDLs .
In a nutshell : Dynamically - generated properties are out , as are optional arguments , and arguments that contains non-primitive objects ( arrays , objects , regexps , etc. ) .
The plan for Fuel 0.2 is pretty well defined at this point .
We ’re on track to have it land in Firefox 3.0 a5 .
Specifically , Fuel 0.2 is going to be dealing with two things : Browser tabs and Bookmarks .
We have a fairly - complete version of the Fuel 0.2 API up , this will be on top of the existing Fuel 0.1 API .
If you ’re curious what this new code is going to look like , here ’s some examples from our current plan :
NOTE
All of the following is subject to change – please view the final plan and API before attempting to use .
Browser
Open , and activate , a new tab
Application.browser.open ( " http://google.com/ " ) .active = true ;
Open , and activate , a tab just after the current tab
var tab = Application.browser.open ( " http://google.com/ " ) ; Application.browser.insertBefore ( tab , Application.browser.activeTab.next ) ; tab.active = true ;
or :
var tab = Application.browser.open ( " http://google.com/ " ) ; tab.index = Application.browser.activeTab + 1 ; tab.active = true ;
Move the active tab to be the first tab
Application.browser.insertBefore( Application.browser.activeTab , Application.browser.tabs [ 0 ] ) ;
or :
Application.browser.activeTab.index = 0 ;
Close the active tab
Application.browser.activeTab.close ( ) ;
Do something when the active tab loads
Application.browser.activeTab.events.addListener( " load " , function ( ) { this.query ( " #foo div " ) } ) ;
Change the URL in the active tab
Application.browser.activeTab.url = " http://mozilla.org/ " ;
Close all Google - related tabs
Application.browser.tabs.forEach(function(tab ) { if ( tab.url.match(/google / ) ) tab.remove( ) ; } ) ;
Re-use a tab , or open a new one
var url = " http://google.com/ " ; Application.browser.tabs.some( function ( tab ) { if ( tab.url == url ) return tab.active = true ; } ) || Application.browser.open ( url ) .active = true ;
Stop the user from opening any new tabs
Application.browser.events.addListener( " TabOpen " , function(e ) { e.target.close ( ) ; } ) ;
Bookmarks
Log the title of all top - level bookmarks :
Application.bookmarks.all.forEach(function(cur ) { console.log ( " title " , cur.title ) ; } ) ;
Add a new bookmark :
Application.bookmarks.add ( " Mozilla " , " http://mozilla.org/ " ) ;
Remove all bookmarks that point to Google :
Application.bookmarks.all.forEach(function(cur ) { if ( cur.url.match(/google.com / ) ) cur.remove( ) ; } ) ;
Add a new bookmark , if one does n’t already exist :
var url = " http://google.com/ " ; Application.bookmarks.all.some( function ( cur ) { if ( cur.url == url ) return true ; } ) || Application.bookmarks.add ( " Google " , url ) ;
If you ’re interested in tracking our progress on Fuel 0.2 , feel free to CC yourself on the tracking ticket for it .
If all goes well , this should be in your hands by the time the Firefox 3.0 betas are rolling out .
I ’m really excited to see some new applications come out that are built on this code .
PayPlay .FM , which currently sells a nearly - 1.3 million - song indie music catalog in the secure WMA format , will start selling its entire catalog in the unprotected MP3 format by the end of May , according to an email received today from PayPlay co-founder Elliot Goykhman .
These plans have been brewing since October of last year , or possibly earlier , but apparently all of the artists on the site have now signed off on the new policy : protected WMAs cost $ 0.77 , while unprotected 192 Kbps MP3s versions of the same song cost $ 0.88 .
The site has a really smooth interface , and the size of the indie catalog is impressive , but all that is academic unless A ) they sell albums from bands you like , or B ) they make it really easy to discover new ( to you ) bands .
PayPlay .
FM makes it easier to preview albums than Amazon does , andoffers a decent discovery engine for finding bands that are similar toones you 've heard of ( example : similar to Mogwai ) .
I think they could take this concept even further ... maybe with something that analyzes your iTunes library a la Goombah , and feeds you stuff it knows you 'll like a la Pandora .
One thing that would surely help is a centralized search tool for PayPlay .
FM
and everywhere else that sells MP3s .
1.3 million songs is a lot of music , butthere 's enough missing from PayPlay .
FM that it could never function asmy only digital music store .
Perhaps MySpace , with its centralizedartist database , could offer something like this , although they seemlargely focused on their own embeddable SnoCap stores , rather thanbecoming a hub for other digital music stores .

“ Everything depends on the political context and political will , and I do n’t see the political will in Lula ’s administration , ” José Miguel Vivanco , the executive director of the Americas program of Human Rights Watch , said in a telephone interview from Washington .
“ Politicians are rational actors .
They are willing to challenge the status quo only if they have a constituency or some pressure , and I do n’t know if that constituency exists in Brazil the way it does in Argentina and Chile . ”
Speaking on behalf of Colonel Ustra , his wife , Joseita , declined a request for an interview with him , saying he is recovering from surgery .
But in recent speeches made to military groups before his hospitalization , he suggested that he was not the human rights groups ’ only target .
“ I am the first , but tomorrow there will be others , ” he said in a speech to an audience of more than 400 fellow officers and sympathizers at the Military Club in Rio de Janeiro in January .
“ I am being judged for a crime I did not commit .
It is the revenge of those who were defeated in 1964 , many of whom today find themselves in power . ”
Colonel Passarinho said that among the people Colonel Ustra had in mind was Dilma Rousseff , Mr. da Silva ’s chief of staff .
As a member of an armed revolutionary group , Ms. Rousseff , then nicknamed “ the guerrilla Joan of Arc , ” was involved in a $ 2.5 million robbery in 1969 and was captured the next year , tortured and held in prison for three years .
Colonel Ustra , 74 , is the founder of a group called Terrorism Never Again , formed as a counterpoint to Torture Never Again , and the author of a book , “ The Suffocated Truth . ”
The book was intended to , in his words , “ undo the myths , farces and lies to manipulate public opinion ” about the period of the dictatorship .
He acknowledges that some of his subordinates may have committed abuses , but he insists that he never personally participated in torture sessions .
That claim has been contested by human rights groups and former prisoners .
“ As commander , he not only knew what was going on , but personally tortured me when I was seven months pregnant , ” said Ms. Schmidt de Almeida , a former guerrilla .
“ He used electricity to shock me not on the anus , mouth and genitals , which was the standard practice then , but on the hands and feet , and he beat me about the head .
“ It ’s not just me , but Brazilian society as a whole that is living with the consequences of that repression , ” she added .
“ It ’s a difficult thing to confront , but there have been important advances in Argentina , Chile and Uruguay , and for our own well - being , we need to resolve this issue , too . ”

Kucinich to launch Cheney impeachment push on April 25
Michael Roston
Published : Thursday April 19 , 2007 Print This Email This
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , the former mayor of Cleveland who is seeking the 2008 Democratic nomination for president for the second time , has selected a date to introduce articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney .
A source who asked to remain anonymous told RAW STORY that the articles of impeachment would be introduced next week .
" The Congressman plans to introduce the articles on Wednesday , April 25th , " the source told RAW STORY .
The Congressman 's office responded in an e-mail Thursday afternoon to RAW STORY by saying " No comment " when asked if the report was true .
Mary Ann Akers reported at her blog , The Sleuth , on Monday that the Congressman had sent a " dear colleague " letter to fellow Members of Congress informing them of his plan to introduce the articles of impeachment against the Vice President .
However , he had postponed the plan in the wake of the killing of 32 students , faculty , and staff at Virginia Tech on Monday .
Multiple congressional offices confirmed to RAW STORY that they had received the letter , but none had been apprised of the impeachable offenses with which the Ohio Democrat would charge the Vice President .
Additionally , a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee , which would receive and consider Kucinich 's charges against the Vice President once they are filed , was not yet aware of them .
Vice President Cheney 's office would not comment to the Cleveland Plain Dealer on the reports about the charges because they had not yet seen the articles .
For those seeking images of everyday life through a Google image search , little will be found .
Tourist , stock , or commercial images , along with completely irrelevant material , will instead dominate .
Such images reinforce thoroughly inaccurate conceptions of what our world looks like - meaning they also distort and disguise the real social processes that are going on .
The " revitalization " of a city will be trumpeted with images of a few gentrified blocks , while the surrounding areas languish in misery .
Increasing inequality is offered as a progressive force , as if a rotting society can be refurbished in tandem with an increasing poverty and misery of the working class .
The images we are shown of our society are of great importance to how we understand it .
Google image search ( GIS ) claims to be " the most comprehensive image search on the web "
From my experience it enjoys great respect ; in particular I know plenty of artists who use it extensively as a resource .
To show how dangerous it is to uncritically accept this resource , I ’ll provide the visual results that Google will gather on places I know .
My goal is to see pictures that provide a truthful and comprehensive look at these towns and cities .
If one searches for " Wilmington , Delaware " this first image is from the state webpage , and is so small that it is useless .
The second working result is this :
But this is n't even Wilmington !
It 's actually Richmond , Virginia !
The next image result is also somewhere else - Cleveland , Ohio - but shows a boat perhaps registered in Wilmington .
Good start !
To clarify , this is what the interstate looks like at night in Wilmington .
The muck in front is a marsh polluted by remnants from former industries , complemented with the beauty of a polluted sunset .
Postcard historical images of Wilmington and maps fill up the first 20 results ; only then is there even a generic skyline few .
The image about is result 26 .
As far as GIS searches go , this image is astounding : it shows everyday life of the working class .
Searching the next 20 pages of results will bring up nothing similar , and other cities I 've searched have nothing like this at all .
There are certainly no pictures of a huge public housing complex the city destroyed in winter of 2005 - 2006 .
There are no pictures of the overcrowded Gander Hill prison , though thousands in Wilmington have had to experience it directly or indirectly .
Piles of trash and abandoned factories wo n't be found either .
All in all , a GIS search for Wilmington shows little of what it actually looks like .
How about Baltimore ?
Those photos are all from the first page of results , and all show the exact same thing : the tiny , tourist heavy area called the Inner Harbor .
Delving into the results further shows hardly anywhere else - yet Baltimore has a population of 640,000 people !
Where do they live , what do they do ?
Why have over 300,000 left since 1950 ?
Large sections of Baltimore are devastated , with acres of industrial land lying in ruins and entire residential areas left only with abandoned row houses .
None of this can be found in a GIS search , though in Baltimore it would be impossible to ignore .
For more : http://osterizer.blogspot.com/2007/03/view-from-train-through-baltimore.htmlPerhaps the smaller city of Petersburg , Virginia fares better .
This is " historic Petersburg , " a small area where the old and historic buildings have been restored .
Everywhere else , they are instead old and decaying .
This restored area is lauded as the rebirth of this small city .
It 's an incredible fable ; and any brief visit to Petersburg would show it .
Even ignoring images , and just looking at social and economic statistics - how can an area improve if nothing improves the conditions of the working class ?
Nearby " historic Petersburg " is the main commercial street , South Sycamore .
At 5 pm , this man is promptly closing up one of the few restaurants around .
Scarcely any other store is open .
And why should other stores be open ?
Bus service ends at 5 pm too !
But back to the " real " Petersburg found through a GIS search .
I took a picture of that mansion as well .
You wo n't find images of the enormous , crumbling Seward Luggage buildings that are right across the street from that mansion , though .
Currently they are being renovated into " luxury apartments . "
It seems likely that the few large houses around here were for the owners and top layers of the companyIf that is the case , these are the houses just a few blocks away for workers .
It 's typical for Petersburg and so many other cities ; old , small , in need of maintenance , or boarded up completely .
Also nearby : 5 huge concrete piers ( two out of the picture ) left to stand awkwardly after CSX railroad dismantled the steel portions of this railway trestle over two decades ago .
The building beside them is connected to Virginia Union University .
I could find no images on GIS of this inactive Brown and Williamson cigarette factory , despite the fact that it dominates the landscape of several city blocks quite close to downtown .
More about Petersburg : http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/feb2007/pete-f01.shtmlMoving on to Richmond , Virginia .
GIS gives the same typical , cliche and useless results .
One was already seen , the first image of this post .
It shows downtown Richmond , with the Federal Reserve building , Wachovia Towers , and characteristic long , empty highway bridge .
Someone has also added starlight filters to all of the overhead highway lights .
Here 's some alternative images : Public Housing near the Leigh Street bridge .
A GIS for " public housing Richmond Virginia " finds absolutely nothing of use in the first ten pages of results .
Over a hundred apartment units , abandoned , in the northside of Richmond .
I unintentionally found a similar situation in Southside recently as well .
A boarded up elementary school , in the northeast of Richmond .
Bus stop on Broad Street .
Daily life is almost visually non-existent according to GIS ( or TV . ) Someone who sits a bus stop most of the day , several days in a row , for whatever reason .
GIS will find plenty of images of pets .
Not this kind though .
GIS certainly does not bring up images of people working .
Not even a janitor whose worked 17 - 21 hours a day , several days a row , and has to clean the court during halftime of a soldout basketball game .
Only to handpick all the trash in an 8,000 seat sports center after the game .

The beauty of Murtha 's plan is that rather than cutting funds , he is actually demanding the president spend more money on the troops .
He 's just adding some conditions to the funding .
Murtha wants a strict accounting of where the money Congress has already appropriated for spending on the troops went .
For fiscally conservative Republicans it should n't be unreasonable to ask where $ 18 billion of what Congress already appropriated went before we get into evaluating where future spending should go .
Murtha asserts war profiteers like Halliburton should be held accountable , possibly with their executives fined , indicted , tried and banned from future contracts .
He wants to use the powers granted by the Constitution to Congress :
To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ;
To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations ;
To declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ;
To raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ;
To provide and maintain a navy ;
To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ;
To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ;
To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ;
To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of the government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings ; -- And
To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof .
Through control of appropriations Murtha can exercise Congressional authority over the budget and reference its authority over tribunals including military commissions , Congressional authority to define and punish offenses , to Declare War , authorize the use of force , make rules , raise and support armies and navies , make rules for the government , and the land and naval forces , provide for organizing , arming and disciplining the troops , and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof .
He can use his control of appropriations to provide for organizing , arming and disciplining the troops by allocating money for body armour as a first priority and taking it out of the money set aside for building new attack subs .
Every dollar the Pentagon asks for can be evaluated in terms of how does it accomplish the mission the American People have given the Congress of bringing the troops home ?
We the People have established the mission .
Its the job of Congress to see it gets accomplished by giving direction to the Commander in Chief , the Defense Department and the Pentagon using appropriations and rules to steer with .
By Anne Flaherty
ASSOCIATED PRESS 3:06 p.m. February 15 , 2007 WASHINGTON – Rep. John Murtha is quickly emerging as one of President Bush 's most formidable foes on the Iraq war debate .
Many Democrats , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , match Murtha 's fiery opposition to Bush 's policies .
But the Marine combat veteran 's prowess on military matters , strong relationships with Republicans and – most importantly – control of the Pentagon 's spending bills has put him at the forefront of the debate .
The Pennyslvania Democrat is leading the charge among members of his party to end the war by limiting funding .
That fight , which will probably be waged next month , is expected to overshadow this week 's battle over a nonbinding resolution opposing Bush 's troop buildup .
Part kindly Irish Catholic grandfather and part political pit bull with two Purple Hearts in his pocket , Murtha seems the Democrats ' best chance of using the budget to curtail the war without appearing to be leaving troops in the lurch .
" Many of the roads ( in Congress ) lead through Murtha , " said Darrell West , a political science professor at Brown University .
" So Bush has to deal with him . "
Murtha retains clout among his Democratic colleagues , especially on defense issues , despite losing a post-election challenge to Rep. Steny Hoyer , D - Md. , to become majority leader .
Hoyer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , C - Calif , have tapped Murtha to address caucus meetings on the issue of the war and used him to assure the more liberal members of their base that Democrats will do everything they can to bring troops home .
So far , Democrats and Republicans alike are listening closely .
" Do most people have enormous respect for Mr. Murtha ?
Oh yes , " said Pelosi .
By mid-March , Murtha will unveil legislation that he says would set such stringent rules on combat deployments that Bush would have no choice but to begin bringing troops home .
His legislation would dictate how long troops can stay , the equipment they use and whether any money could be spent to expand military operations into Iran .
Murtha says few units could meet the high standards he envisions , meaning Bush 's plan to keep some 160,000 troops in Iraq for months on end would be thwarted .
Under his plan , he says , Democrats would be helping and not hurting troops by making sure they have what they need before being thrown into combat .
" This vote will be the most important vote in changing the direction of the war , " Murtha , D - Pa. , told an anti-war group in an interview broadcast on the Internet Thursday .
" The president could veto it , but then he would n't have any money , " he later said .
...
Bush this week seemed keenly aware of Murtha 's political momentum .
In recent days , the president shrugged off the significance of House vote Friday on a symbolic resolution stating opposition to his war plans .
Instead , the president has focused his sights on the upcoming war supplemental .
Bush says he needs another $ 93 billion to continue funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through Sept. 30 ; the military is expected to run out of money by May , making passage of the bill critical .
" We have a responsibility , Republicans and Democrats have a responsibility to give our troops the resources they need to do their job and the flexibility they need to prevail , " Bush told reporters .
When Murtha first talked about redeploying the troops out of harms way few realized that the real impact was on a clause of the War Powers Act of 1973 .

CONGRESSIONAL PRIORITY PROCEDURES FOR JOINT RESOLUTION OR BILL
A concurrent resolution is defined as a non binding resolution passed by both House and Senate :
(.)
CUPERTINO , Calif . --
By most measures , Monta Vista High here and Lynbrook High , in nearby San Jose , are among the nation 's top public high schools .
Both boast stellar test scores , an array of advanced - placement classes and a track record of sending graduates from the affluent suburbs of Silicon Valley to prestigious colleges .
But locally , ...
But a claim that indigenous people 's or their representative governments " own " the venom of a tree frog , medicinal or otherwise , simply by virtue of having discovered it ...?
Well , it sounds like patenting a law of nature to me .
Would these same discoverers share the risk and blame if the product were somewhere downstream , found to cause birth defects or other harm ?
Would they also desire to share in the profits from sales of coffee , tea , and chocolate , claiming to have discovered their property of tastiness ?
What about the properties of coca leaves and opium poppies ?
Would they like to share in the profits from the development of those products into painkillers ?
Would they also like to share in the profits from the sales of heroin and cocaine ?
What about crack ?
Leave it to some of the loudest critics of patents to come up with the broadest theory of ownership yet , most resembling a feudal entitlement .
Solveig Singleton accidentally makes a very strong argument against patent rights in an article critical of actions taken by the Brazilian government to protect the knowledge of indigenous tribes and their discoveries of the many uses of tree frog poisons :
To which we say , " exactly . "
All inventionsdiscoveries .
Does the act of discovering a new fact , idea , or combination of components cause the discoverer to own that fact , idea , or combination , and give them the right to exclude all others from practicing any similar idea ?
Does it give the holder of patents covering these ideas the right to a complete monopoly over entire industrial sub-sectors ?
According to our patent system , yes and yes .
Solveig continues : Would the " discoverers " of wireless email ( NTP ) share the risk and blame if the BlackBerry network went down , or if BlackBerrys were found to cause birth defects or other harm ?
The answer , of course , is no .
Patent trolls are completely decoupled from any responsibility whatsoever , other than the duty they have to spend money on lawyers and extort outrageous fees from ' infringers ' through abuse of our legal system .
I 'm not sure why Solveig brings this point up , unless she 's of the same opinion that we are -- namely , that any system which assigns exclusive ownership of discoveries and ideas to only one party ( such as our patent system ) is inherently absurd .
She continues in this vein :
Of course , maybe Ms. Singleton has n't heard of Peruvian patents on potatoes or Indian patents on basmati rice ?
Or perhaps she has n't examined the tags of just about any plant , shrub , or tree purchased at a nursery in this country lately , which warn the purchaser that breeding or germinating the plant is in strict violation of the " intellectual property rights " of the grower ?
Surely Ms. Singleton must be aware of the many ' rights ' that companies such as Monsanto exercise , such as the right to sue farmers when Monsanto 's seeds blow into their fields
But the point is this : if patents give exclusive property rights to discoverers of new medicines and technologies , what argument could there possibly be against giving those same rights to the discoverers of tree frog venom ?
In both cases , some labor and inventiveness was spent to make the discovery .
In both cases , something new and innovative resulted .
Perhaps the distinction is that the tribes in the Brazilian Rain Forest did n't know about the patent system when they made their discovery , and therefore did n't anticipate receiving such rights ?
But then , whoops ! -- that would be an admission that discoveries and invention can occura patent system in place .
Or maybe the tribes do n't deserve this economic benefit because they are primitive , and only 1st world discoverers ( i.e. , ones that are literate and that wear lab coats instead of loin clothes ) deserve patent protection ?
But then , whoops ! -- we should n't be foisting strong patent protection systems upon the third world and claiming that this will benefit those countries when the truth is that it mostly benefits us and our large , corporate patent - holding interests .
Ms. Singleton concludes : Wrong , Ms. Singleton .
It was proponents of " strong " patent " rights " who have created a system in which such absurdities abound .
And it does n't appear , from the NYTimes article , that the ' loudest critics of patents ' are the ones coming up with this tree frog poison protectionist scheme .
On the contrary , it was Tribal Chief Fernando Katukina , who appears to be using the simple self - interest of his tribe as his motivator .
He should at least be commended for his cleverness in exposing patent systems for what they really are : an artificial scheme to take wealth from one party and give it arbitrarily to another .
All this complaining by IP - maximalists when foreign nations figure out how to use our patent regime against itself only illustrates the true motives of creating these corrupt systems in the first place : to fortify exactly those feudal and aristocratic societies which Ms. Singleton claims to oppose , where status and wealth is determined only be which patent - owning ' family ' you belong to .
Advanced Graphics Card Repair
Now that you have already learned how to repair broken capacitors and inductors on your graphics cards ( or any other boards ) , it 's time to move on to the smaller components that are harder to tackle .
These include surface - mounted resistors and capacitors .
So , this second guide on graphics card repair will show you how to repair small , chipped - off SMD components .
Do note that my handiwork is n't that good in this guide because I just could n't find my missing 0.2 mm solder tip .

Although there is normally a fall off in consumer demand for gasoline at the end of the summer driving season , and the hurricane season was very benign , the demand fall was n't so big this year as to justify the collapse in gasoline prices at the pump .
According to the Deepcaster newsletter , " We are now witnessing interventions massive in their degree and scope - that is , we are witnessing The Mother of all Interventions . "
Why ?
Big oil has received more than $ 5 billion dollars in tax breaks and tax credits from the Bushistas and been complicit in many of their schemes .
They provide a substantial proportion of GOP funding , and they see it all back many times over .
From The Nation : Greasing the Skids Republicans have been pleased to focus on what they can manipulate , if not overtly control .
Big
Oil gave the GOP 81 percent of its $ 63 million in campaign contributions since Bush took office .
Republicans are giving Big Oil a $ 5 billion helping of tax breaks .
Last November the Republican - led Senate Commerce Committee , headed by Alaska Senator Ted Stevens , gave oil companies a post - Katrina break to keep their exorbitant profits .
Democrats called for windfall profits .
Republicans did n't .
Big oil does not want to be investigated .
They do not want windfall taxes .
They do not want market manipulation or antitrust actions .
They like oilmen in the White House and a complicit GOP Congress .
According to Doug Henwood 's Left Business Observer study , there 's a 78 percent correlation between the direction of gas prices and approval for the GOP .
Update [ 2006-10-25 10:16:4 by LondonYank ] ::
This is one of those issues where there is n't any " proof " one way or the other .
I appreciate that Jerome and Bonddad think that gas prices are a function of the market , and of course they are right , but that does n't mean that Bush 's cronies can't give the GOP a push toward election day .
The crack price is what intrigues me most , because that is solely within the control of the handful of Bush Big Oil cronies that own refineries .
They decide how much product to sell and what margins they 'll accept for it individually .
Driving down the crack spread from over $ 19.00 in July to under $ 6.00 in October is a pretty big sacrifice to profits .
Maybe they were sitting on too much product in expectations of refinery fires and hurricanes that never materialised .
Maybe the market is so competitive and efficient that they had to accept massively lower margins from July to September .
And maybe they are helping the homies in the White House by dumping product into the market at a key time in the election cycle .
As Jerome noted , the gasoline futures market is notoriously illiquid because much of the market is tied to refineries , independent retailers do n't buy forward , and speculators are easily spooked .
An illiquid market is very easy to influence with a bit of leverage - both down and up .
The refineries and Wall Street bankers and hedge funds that have done so well under Bush might be inclined to nudge the market lower - or discourage anyone they can influence going long .
A campaign to talk down a market does n't have to be explicit or coordinated to be effective .
I can't prove manipulation .
It takes two views to make a market and different folks seeing the same facts will draw different conclusions .
For my money , the United States stopped being a market economy for energy when it put two oilmen in the White House and Goldman Sachs trader in the Treasury .
If they can buy this election with cheap gas and a record Dow Jones , they certainly will .
But after November 7th , do n't be surprised if you pay through the nose again as rhetoric against Iran hots up - whether war follows or not , OPEC brings in production curbs , and as the refineries increase the crack spread back to the obscene levels they have come to expect as their due .
From Conservapedia
The theory of evolution is a naturalistic theory of the history of life on earth ( this refers to the theory of evolution which employs methodological naturalism and is taught in schools and universities ) .
Merriam - Webster 's dictionary gives the following definition of evolution : " a theory that the various types of animals and plants have their origin in other preexisting types and that the distinguishable differences are due to modifications in successive generations ... " [ 2 ]
Currently , there are several theories of evolution .
Since World War II a majority of the most prominent and vocal defenders of the evolutionary position which employs methodological naturalism have been atheists and agnostics .
[ 3 ]
In 2007 , " Discovery Institute 's Center for Science and Culture ... announced that over 700 scientists from around the world have now signed a statement expressing their skepticism about the contemporary theory of Darwinian evolution . " [ 4 ]
In 2011 , the results of a study was published indicating that most United States high school biology teachers are reluctant to endorse the theory of evolution in class . [ 5 ]
In addition , in 2011 , eight anti-evolution bills were introduced into state legislatures within the United States encouraging students to employ critical thinking skills when examining the evolutionary paradigm .
In 2009 , there were seven states which required critical analysis skills be employed when examining evolutionary material within schools . [ 6 ]
A 2005 poll by the Louis Finkelstein Institute for Social and Religious Research found that 60 % of American medical doctors reject Darwinism , stating that they do not believe man evolved through natural processes alone . [ 7 ]
Thirty - eight percent of the American medical doctors polled agreed with the statement that " Humans evolved naturally with no supernatural involvement . " [ 8 ]
The study also reported that 1/3 of all medical doctors favor the theory of intelligent design over evolution .
[ 9 ]
In 2010 , the Gallup organization reported that 40 % of Americans believe in young earth creationism . [ 10 ]
In January 2006 , the BBC reported concerning Britain :
“ Just under half of Britons accept the theory of evolution as the best description for the development of life , according to an opinion poll .
Furthermore , more than 40 % of those questioned believe that creationism or intelligent design ( ID ) should be taught in school science lessons . [ 11 ] ”
Johns Hopkins University Press reported in 2014 : " Over the past forty years , [ 12 ]
Picture above was taken at Johns Hopkins University reported in 2014 : " Over the past forty years , creationism has spread swiftly among European Catholics , Protestants , Jews , Hindus , and Muslims , even as anti-creationists sought to smother its flames . "
Johns Hopkins University Press reported in 2014 : " Over the past forty years , creationism has spread swiftly among European Catholics , Protestants , Jews , Hindus , and Muslims , even as anti-creationists sought to smother its flames . " [ 13 ]
In addition , China has the world 's largest atheist population and the rapid growth of biblical creationism / Evangelical Christianity in China may have a significant impact on the number of individuals in the world who believe in evolution and also on global atheism ( see : China and biblical creationism and Asian atheism ) .
The theory of evolution posits a process of transformation from simple life forms to more complex life forms , which has never been observed or duplicated in a laboratory . [ 14 ]
Although not a creation scientist , Swedish geneticist Dr. Nils Heribert - Nilsson , Professor of Botany at the University of Lund in Sweden and a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , stated : " My attempts to demonstrate Evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed .
At least , I should hardly be accused of having started from a preconceived antievolutionary standpoint . " [ 15 ]
The fossil record is often used as evidence in the creation versus evolution controversy .
The fossil record does not support the theory of evolution and is one of the flaws in the theory of evolution . [ 16 ]
In 1981 , there were at least a hundred million fossils that were catalogued and identified in the world 's museums . [ 17 ]
Despite the large number of fossils available to scientists in 1981 , evolutionist Mark Ridley , who currently serves as a professor of zoology at Oxford University , was forced to confess : " In any case , no real evolutionist , whether gradualist or punctuationist , uses the fossil record as evidence in favour of the theory of evolution as opposed to special creation . " [ 18 ]
In addition to the evolutionary position lacking evidential support and being counterevidential , the great intellectuals in history such as Archimedes , Aristotle , St. Augustine , Francis Bacon , Isaac Newton , and Lord Kelvin did not propose an evolutionary process for a species to transform into a more complex version .
Even after the theory of evolution was proposed and promoted heavily in England and Germany , most leading scientists were against the theory of evolution . [ 19 ]
The theory of evolution was published by naturalist Charles Darwin in his book On The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life , in 1859 .
In a letter to Asa Gray , Darwin confided : " ... I am quite conscious that my speculations run quite beyond the bounds of true science . " [ 20 ] Prior to publishing the book , Darwin wrote in his private notebooks that he was a materialist , which is a type of atheist . [ 21 ]
Darwin was a weak atheist / agnostic ( see : religious views of Charles Darwin ) . [ 22 ]
Charles Darwin ’s casual mentioning of a ‘ creator ’ in earlier editions of The Origin of Species appears to have been a merely a ploy to downplay the implications of his materialistic theory . [ 23 ]
The amount of credit Darwin actually deserves for the theory is disputed . [ 24 ]
Darwin's theory attempted to explain the origin of the various kinds of plants and animals via the process of natural selection or " survival of the fittest " .
The basic principle behind natural selection is that in the struggle for life some organisms in a given population will be better suited to their particular environment and thus have a reproductive advantage which increases the representation of their particular traits over time .
Many years before Charles Darwin , there were several other individuals who published articles on the topic of natural selection . [ 25 ]
Darwin did not first propose in his book Origin of Species that man had descended from non-human ancestors .
Darwin's theory of evolution incorporated that later in Darwin 's book entitled Descent of Man .
As far as the history of the theory of evolution , although Darwin is well known when it comes to the early advocacy of the evolutionary position in the Western world , evolutionary ideas were taught by the ancient Greeks as early as the 7th century B.C. [ 26 ]
The concept of naturalistic evolution differs from the concept of theistic evolution in that it states God does not guide the posited process of macroevolution . [ 27 ]
Belief in evolution and intuition
In 2012 , the science news website Livescience.com published a news article entitled Belief in Evolution Boils Down to a Gut Feeling which indicated that research suggests that gut feelings trumped facts when it comes to evolutionists believing in evolution . [ 28 ]
In January of 2012 , the Journal of Research in Science Teaching published a study indicating that evolutionary belief is significantly based on gut feelings . [ 29 ] [ 30 ]
The January 20 , 2012 article entitled Belief in Evolution Boils Down to a Gut Feeling published by the website Live Science wrote of the research : " They found that intuition had a significant impact on what the students accepted , no matter how much they knew and regardless of their religious beliefs . " [ 31 ]
In response to evolutionary indoctrination and the uncritical acceptance of evolution by many evolutionists , the scientists at the organization Creation Ministries International created a Question evolution !
campaign which poses 15 questions for evolutionists .
In addition , leading creationist organizations have created lists of poor arguments that evolutionists should not use . [ 32 ]

Theory of Evolution - Mutations and the Life Sciences in General
See also : Theories of evolution
Evolutionist Theodosius Dobzhansky wrote concerning the theory of evolution : " The process of mutation is the only known source of the new materials of genetic variability , and hence of evolution . " [ 33 ]
Concerning various theories of evolution , most evolutionists believe that the processes of mutation , genetic drift and natural selection created every species of life that we see on earth today after life first came about on earth although there is little consensus on how this process is allegedly to have occurred . [ 34 ]
Pierre - Paul Grassé , who served as Chair of evolutionary biology at Sorbonne University for thirty years and was ex-president of the French Academy of Sciences , stated : " Some contemporary biologists , as soon as they observe a mutation , talk about evolution .
They are implicitly supporting the following syllogism : mutations are the only evolutionary variations , all living beings undergo mutations , therefore all living beings evolve .... No matter how numerous they may be , mutations do not produce any kind of evolution . "
Grassé pointed out that bacteria which are the subject of study of many geneticists and molecular biologists are organisms which produce the most mutants . [ 35 ]
Grasse then points that bacteria are considered to have " stabilized " . [ 36 ]
Grassé regards the " unceasing mutations " to be " merely hereditary fluctuations around a median position ; a swing to the right , a swing to the left , but no final evolutionary effect . " [ 37 ]
In addition , Harvard biologist Ernst Mayr wrote : " It must be admitted , however , that it is a considerable strain on one ’s credulity to assume that finely balanced systems such as certain sense organs ( the eye of vertebrates , or the bird ’s feather ) could be improved by random mutations . " [ 38 ]
Creation scientists believe that mutations , natural selection , and genetic drift would not cause macroevolution . [ 39 ]
Furthermore , creation scientists assert that the life sciences as a whole support the creation model and do not support the theory of evolution . [ 40 ]
Homology involves the theory that macroevolutionary relationships can be demonstrated by the similarity in the anatomy and physiology of different organisms . [ 41 ]
An example of a homology argument is that DNA similarities between human and other living organisms is evidence for the theory of evolution . [ 42 ]
Creation scientists provide sound reasons why the homology argument is not a valid argument .
Both evolutionary scientists and young earth creation scientists believe that speciation occurs , however , young earth creation scientists state that speciation generally occurs at a much faster rate than evolutionist believe is the case . [ 43 ]
Critics of the theory of evolution state that many of today 's proponents of the evolutionary position have diluted the meaning of the term " evolution " to the point where it defined as or the definition includes change over time in the gene pool of a population over time through such processes as mutation , natural selection , and genetic drift . [ 44 ]
Dr. Jonathan Sarfati of Creation Ministries International declares concerning the diluted definition of the word " evolution " :
“ ... many evolutionary propagandists are guilty of the deceitful practice of equivocation , that is , switching the meaning of a single word ( evolution ) part way through an argument .
A common tactic , ‘ bait - and - switch , ’ is simply to produce examples of change over time , call this ‘ evolution , ’ then imply that the GTE [ General Theory of Evolution ] is thereby proven or even essential , and creation disproved .
The PBS Evolution series and the Scientific American article are full of examples of this fallacy . [ 45 ] [ 46 ] ”

Biological diversity - evolution contrasted with biblical creation science
Dr. Jonathan Sarfati wrote :
“ In contrast , creationists , starting from the Bible , believe that God created different kinds of organisms , which reproduced ‘ after their kinds ’ ( Gen. 1:11 –12 , 21 , 24–25 ) .
Each of these kinds was created with a vast amount of information .
There was enough variety in the information in the original creatures so their descendants could adapt to a wide variety of environments .
All ( sexually reproducing ) organisms contain their genetic information in paired form .
Each offspring inherits half its genetic information from its mother , and half from its father .
So there are two genes at a given position ( locus , plural loci ) coding for a particular characteristic .
An organism can be heterozygous at a given locus , meaning it carries different forms ( alleles ) of this gene ...
So there is no problem for creationists explaining that the original created kinds could each give rise to many different varieties .
In fact , the original created kinds would have had much more heterozygosity than their modern , more specialized descendants .
No wonder Ayala pointed out that most of the variation in populations arises from reshuffling of previously existing genes , not from mutations .
Many varieties can arise simply by two previously hidden recessive alleles coming together .
However , Ayala believes the genetic information came ultimately from mutations , not creation .
His belief is contrary to information theory , as shown in chapter 9 on ‘ Design ’ . [ 47 ] ”
Prominent evolutionists have indicated that the origin of life is part of the evolutionary model
Dr. Don Batten of Creation Ministries International has pointed out that prominent evolutionists , such as PZ Myers and Nick Matzke , have indicated that a naturalistic postulation of the origin of life ( often called abiogenesis ) , is part of the evolutionary model . [ 48 ]
This poses a very serious problem for the evolutionary position as the evidence clearly points life being a product of design and not through naturalistic processes . [ 49 ]
Genetic entropy
The genetic entropy theory by Cornell University Professor Dr. John Sanford on eroding genomes of all living organisms due to mutations inherited from one generation to the next is declared to be one of the major challenges to evolutionary theory .
The central part of Sanford ’s argument is that mutations , represented by spelling mistakes in DNA , are accumulating so quickly in some creatures ( and particularly in people ) that natural selection cannot stop the functional degradation of the genome , let alone drive an evolutionary process that could lead for example , from apes into people . [ 50 ]
Sanford 's book Genetic Entropy and the Mystery of the Genome explains why human DNA is inexorably deteriorating at an alarming rate , thus can not be millions of years old . [ 51 ]
Evolutionist on genetic entropy
The evolutionist Michael Lynch wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America in a December 3 , 2009 article entitled : Rate , molecular spectrum , and consequences of human mutation ( taken from the abstract ) :
“ Finally , a consideration of the long - term consequences of current human behavior for deleterious - mutation accumulation leads to the conclusion that a substantial reduction in human fitness can be expected over the next few centuries in industrialized societies unless novel means of genetic intervention are developed . " [ 52 ] ”
Evolution - Implications of Genetic Code and Processing of Biological Information
[ 53 ]
Dr. Stephen Meyer published an article favoring intelligent design in a peer reviewed science journal which had traditionally only published material advocating the evolutionary position .
Creation scientists and intelligent design advocates point out that the genetic code ( DNA code ) , genetic programs , and biological information argue for an intelligent cause in regards the origins question and assert it is one of the many problems of the theory of evolution . [ 54 ] [ 55 ]
Dr. Walt Brown states the genetic material that controls the biological processes of life is coded information and that human experience tells us that codes are created only by the result of intelligence and not merely by processes of nature . [ 54 ]
Dr. Brown also asserts that the " information stored in the genetic material of all life is a complex program .
Therefore , it appears that an unfathomable intelligence created these genetic programs . " [ 54 ]
To support his view regarding the divine origin of genetic programs Dr. Walt Brown cites the work of David Abel and Professor Jack Trevors who wrote the following :
“ No matter how many " bits " of possible combinations it has , there is no reason to call it " information " if it does n't at least have the potential of producing something useful .
What kind of information produces function ?
In computer science , we call it a " program . "
Another name for computer software is an " algorithm . "
No man -made program comes close to the technical brilliance of even Mycoplasmal genetic algorithms .
Mycoplasmas are the simplest known organism with the smallest known genome , to date .
How was its genome and other living organisms ' genomes programmed ?
- David L. Abel and Jack T. Trevors , “ Three Subsets of Sequence Complexity and Their Relevance to Biopolymeric Information , ” Theoretical Biology & Medical Modelling , Vol. 2 , 11 August 2005 , page 8 [ 56 ] ”
In the peer reviewed biology journal Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington Dr. Stephen Meyer argues that no current materialistic theory of evolution can account for the origin of the information necessary to build novel animal forms and proposed an intelligent cause as the best explanation for the origin of biological information and the higher taxa . [ 57 ]
The editor of the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington , Dr. Richard Sternberg , came under intense scrutiny and persecution for the aforementioned article published by Dr. Meyer .
Theory of evolution and little scientific consensus

Theory of evolution and little consensus and Theories of evolution
There is little scientific consensus on how macroevolution is said to have happened and the claimed mechanisms of evolutionary change , as can be seen in the following quotes :
“ When discussing organic evolution the only point of agreement seems to be : " It happened . "
Thereafter , there is little consensus , which at first sight must seem rather odd .
-( Simon Conway Morris , [ palaeontologist , Department of Earth Sciences , Cambridge University , UK ] , " Evolution : Bringing Molecules into the Fold , " Cell , Vol. 100 , pp.1-11 , January 7 , 2000 , p.11 ) [ 58 ] ”
“ " “ The history of organic life is indemonstrable ; we cannot prove a whole lot in evolutionary biology , and our findings will always be hypothesis .
There is one true evolutionary history of life , and whether we will actually ever know it is not likely .
Most importantly , we have to think about questioning underlying assumptions , whether we are dealing with molecules or anything else . ” - Jeffrey H. Schwartz , Professor of Biological Anthropology , University of Pittsburgh , February 9 , 2007 [ 59 ] ”
“ " If it is true that an influx of doubt and uncertainty actually marks periods of healthy growth in a science , then evolutionary biology is flourishing today as it seldom has flourished in the past .
For biologists collectively are less agreed upon the details of evolutionary mechanics than they were a scant decade ago .
Superficially , it seems as if we know less about evolution than we did in 1959 , the centennial year of Darwin's on the Origin of Species . "
- Niles Eldredge , " Time Frames : The Rethinking of Darwinian Evolution and the Theory of Punctuated Equilibria , " Simon & Schuster : New York NY , 1985 , p.14[60 ] ”
Pierre - Paul Grassé , who served as Chair of Evolution at Sorbonne University for thirty years and was ex-president of the French Academy of Sciences , stated the following :
“ Through use and abuse of hidden postulates , of bold , often ill - founded extrapolations , a pseudoscience has been created .
It is taking root in the very heart of biology and is leading astray many biochemists and biologists , who sincerely believe that the accuracy of fundamental concepts has been demonstrated , which is not the case ....
Today , our duty is to destroy the myth of evolution , considered as a simple , understood , and explained phenomenon which keeps rapidly unfolding before us .
Biologists must be encouraged to think about the weaknesses of the interpretations and extrapolations that theoreticians put forward or lay down as established truths .
The deceit is sometimes unconscious , but not always , since some people , owing to their sectarianism , purposely overlook reality and refuse to acknowledge the inadequacies and the falsity of their beliefs .

Evolutionary Theory and Cases of Fraud , Hoaxes and Speculation ‎
A notable case of a scientists using fraudulent material to promote the theory of evolution was the work of German scientist and atheist Ernst Haeckel .
Noted evolutionist and Stephen Gould , who held a agnostic worldview [ 62 ] and promoted the notion of non-overlapping magesteria , wrote the following regarding Ernst Haeckel 's work in a March 2000 issue of Natural History :
“ " Haeckel ’s forceful , eminently comprehensible , if not always accurate , books appeared in all major languages and surely exerted more influence than the works of any other scientist , including Darwin … in convincing people throughout the world about the validity of evolution ...
Haeckel had exaggerated the similarities [ between embryos of different species ] by idealizations and omissions .
He also , in some cases — in a procedure that can only be called fraudulent — simply copied the same figure over and over again .
… Haeckel ’s drawings never fooled expert embryologists , who recognized his fudgings right from the start .
Haeckel ’s drawings , despite their noted inaccuracies , entered into the most impenetrable and permanent of all quasi- scientific literatures : standard student textbooks of biology ...
Once ensconced in textbooks , misinformation becomes cocooned and effectively permanent , because … textbooks copy from previous texts ....
[ W ]e do , I think , have the right to be both astonished and ashamed by the century of mindless recycling that has led to the persistence of these drawings in a large number , if not a majority , of modern textbooks ! " [ 63 ] ”
An irony of history is that the March 9 , 1907 edition of the NY Times refers to Ernst Haeckel as the " celebrated Darwinian and founder of the Association for the Propagation of Ethical Atheism . " [ 64 ]
Stephen Gould continues by quoting Michael Richardson of the St. George ’s Hospital Medical School in London , who stated : " I know of at least fifty recent biology texts which use the drawings uncritically " . [ 63 ]
Lack of Any Clear Transitional Forms
See also : Evolution and the fossil record
As alluded to earlier , today there are over one hundred million identified and cataloged fossils in the world 's museums . [ 65 ]
If the evolutionary position was valid , then there should be " transitional forms " in the fossil record reflecting the intermediate life forms .
Another term for these " transitional forms " is " missing links " .
[ 66 ]
Charles Darwin wrote : " When we descend to details , we cannot prove that a single species has changed ; nor can we prove that the supposed changes are beneficial , which is the groundwork of the theory . ”
Charles Darwin admitted that his theory required the existence of " transitional forms . "
Darwin wrote : " So that the number of intermediate and transitional links , between all living and extinct species , must have been inconceivably great .
But assuredly , if this theory be true , such have lived upon the earth . " [ 67 ]
However , Darwin wrote : " Why then is not every geological formation and every strata full of such intermediate links ?
Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely - graduated organic chain ; and this perhaps , is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against my theory . " [ 68 ]
Darwin thought the lack of transitional links in his time was because " only a small portion of the surface of the earth has been geologically explored and no part with sufficient care ... " . [ 69 ]
As Charles Darwin grew older he became increasingly concerned about the lack of evidence for the theory of evolution in terms of the existence of transitional forms .
Darwin wrote , " “ When we descend to details , we cannot prove that a single species has changed ; nor can we prove that the supposed changes are beneficial , which is the groundwork of the theory . ” [ 70 ]
Scientist Dr. Michael Denton wrote regarding the fossil record :
“ " It is still , as it was in Darwin 's day , overwhelmingly true that the first representatives of all the major classes of organisms known to biology are already highly characteristic of their class when they make their initial appearance in the fossil record .
This phenomenon is particularly obvious in the case of the invertebrate fossil record .
At its first appearance in the ancient Paleozoic seas , invertebrate life was already divided into practically all the major groups with which we are familiar today . [ 71 ] ”
Creationists assert that evolutionists have had over 140 years to find a transitional fossil and nothing approaching a conclusive transitional form has ever been found and that only a handful of highly doubtful examples of transitional fossils exist . [ 72 ]
Distinguished anthropologist Sir Edmund R. Leach declared , " Missing links in the sequence of fossil evidence were a worry to Darwin .
He felt sure they would eventually turn up , but they are still missing and seem likely to remain so . " [ 73 ]
David B. Kitts of the School of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Oklahoma wrote that " Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them … " . [ 74 ]
David Raup , who was the curator of geology at the museum holding the world 's largest fossil collection , the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago , observed :
“ " [ Darwin ] was embarrassed by the fossil record because it did n't look the way he predicted it would ....
Well , we are now about 120 years after Darwin , and knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly expanded .
We now have a quarter of a million fossil species but the situation has n't changed much .
... [ W ]e have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin 's time . "
- David M. Raup , " Conflicts Between Darwin and Paleontology , " Field Museum of Natural History Bulletin 50 ( January 1979 ) : 22-23 , 24-25 . ”
One of the most famous proponents of the theory of evolution was the late Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould .
But Gould admitted :
“ The extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of paleontology .
The evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches ; the rest is inference , however reasonable , not the evidence of fossils ... We fancy ourselves as the only true students of life ’s history , yet to preserve our favored account of evolution by natural selection we view our data as so bad that we never see the very process we profess to study . [ 75 ] ”

The Fossil Record quotes
Creationists can cite quotations which assert that no solid fossil evidence for the theory of evolution position exists :
“ " ... I still think that to the unprejudiced , the fossil record of plants is in favour of special creation .

“ " We then move right off the register of objective truth into those fields of presumed biological science , like extrasensory perception or the interpretation of man 's fossil history , where to the faithful anything is possible - and where the ardent believer is sometimes able to believe several contradictory things at the same time .

Paleoanthropology
For more information please see : Paleoanthropology and Human evolution
Nebraska man was made famous by Henry Osborn of the American Museum of Natural History .
Nebraska man turned out to be nothing more than a single pig - like tooth .
Paleoanthropology is an interdisciplinary branch of anthropology that concerns itself with the origins of early humans and it examines and evaluates items such as fossils and artifacts .
[ 81 ]
Dr. David Pilbeam is a paleoanthropologist who received his Ph.D. at Yale University and Dr. Pilbeam is presently Professor of Social Sciences at Harvard University and Curator of Paleontology at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology .
In addition , Dr. Pilbeam served as an advisor for the Kenya government regarding the creation of an international institute for the study of human origins . [ 82 ]
Dr. Pilbeam wrote a review of Richard Leakey 's book Origins in the journal American Scientist :
“ ... perhaps generations of students of human evolution , including myself , have been flailing about in the dark ; that our data base is too sparse , too slippery , for it to be able to mold our theories .
Rather the theories are more statements about us and ideology than about the past .
Paleoanthropology reveals more about how humans view themselves than it does about how humans came about .
But that is heresy . [ 83 ] ”
Dr. Pilbeam wrote the following regarding the theory of evolution and paleoanthropology :
“ I am also aware of the fact that , at least in my own subject of paleoanthropology , " theory " - heavily influenced by implicit ideas almost always dominates " data " .
.... Ideas that are totally unrelated to actual fossils have dominated theory building , which in turn strongly influence the way fossils are interpreted . [ 83 ] ”
Evolutionist and Harvard professor Richard Lewontin wrote in 1995 that " Despite the excited and optimistic claims that have been made by some paleontologists , no fossil hominid species can be established as our direct ancestor .... " [ 84 ]
In the September 2005 issue of National Geographic , Joel Achenbach asserted that human evolution is a " fact " but he also candidly admitted that the field of paleoanthropology " has again become a rather glorious mess . " [ 85 ] [ 86 ]
In the same National Geographic article Harvard paleoanthropologist Dan Lieberman states , " We 're not doing a very good job of being honest about what we do n't know ... " . [ 86 ]
Concerning pictures of the supposed ancestors of man featured in science journals and the news media Boyce Rensberger wrote in the journal Science the following regarding their highly speculative nature :
“ Unfortunately , the vast majority of artist 's conceptions are based more on imagination than on evidence .
But a handful of expert natural - history artists begin with the fossil bones of a hominid and work from there ….
Much of the reconstruction , however , is guesswork .
Bones say nothing about the fleshy parts of the nose , lips , or ears .
Artists must create something between an ape and a human being ; the older the specimen is said to be , the more apelike they make it ....
Hairiness is a matter of pure conjecture . [ 87 ] [ 88 ] ”
Creation scientists concur with Dr. Pilbeam regarding the speculative nature of the field of paleoanthropology and assert there is no compelling evidence in the field of paleoanthropology for the various theories of human evolution . [ 89 ]
Microevolution vs. macroevolution
In 2011 , Dr. Grady S. McMurtry declared :
“ It is a commonly held belief of evolutionists that small changes in genetic materials ( mutations ) will ultimately produce the presumed large changes necessary for one biological organism to change into a different kind of biological organism which is commonly called macroevolution .
This belief is not valid .
Scientifically , a mutation is a copying error of previously existing information contained in the DNA : a mutation is a structural change in the hereditary material which makes the offspring different from its parents .
Dr. Grady S. McMurtry
It is acknowledged that the Laws of Genetics are conservative , they are not “ creative . ”
Genetics only copies or rearranges the previously existing information and passes it on to the next generation .
When copying information , you have only two choices ; you can only copy it perfectly or imperfectly , you cannot copy something “ more perfectly . ”
Mutations do not build one upon another beneficially .
Mutations do not create new organs ; they only modify existing organs and structures .
Mutations overwhelmingly lose information ; they do not gain it ; therefore , mutations cause changes which are contrary of evolutionary philosophy .
As a follow on , the addition of excess undirected energy will destroy the previously existing system .
Indeed , you will never get an increase in the specifications on the DNA to create new organs without the input from a greater intelligence .
Mutations affect and are affected by many genes and other intergenic information acting in combination with one another .
The addition of the accidental duplication of previously existing information is detrimental to any organism .
Mutations do produce “ microevolution , ” however , this term is far better understood as merely “ lateral adaptation , ” which is only variation within a kind , a mathematical shifting of gene frequency within a gene pool .
The shifting of gene frequencies and a loss of information cannot produce macroevolution .
As Dr. Roger Lewin commented after the 1980 University of Chicago conference entitled “ Macroevolution ” : “ The central question of the Chicago conference was whether the mechanisms underlying microevolution can be extrapolated to explain the phenomena of macroevolution . …
At the risk of doing violence to the positions of some of the people at the meeting , the answer can be given as a clear , No . ” [ Emphasis added ] Dr. Roger Lewin , “ Evolution Theory under Fire , ” Science .
Vol. 210 , 21 November 1980 . p. 883-887.[90 ] ”
In 1988 , the prominent Harvard University biologist Ernst Mayr wrote in his essay Does Microevolution Explain Macroevolution ? :
“ Among all the claims made during the evolutionary synthesis , perhaps the one that found least acceptance was the assertion that all phenomena of macroevolution can be ‘ reduced to , ' that is , explained by , microevolutionary genetic processes .
Not surprisingly , this claim was usually supported by geneticists but was widely rejected by the very biologists who dealt with macroevolution , the morphologists and paleontologists .
Many of them insisted that there is more or less complete discontinuity between the processes at the two levels — that what happens at the species level is entirely different from what happens at the level of the higher categories .
Now , 50 years later the controversy remains undecided .
... In this respect , indeed , macroevolution as a field of study is completely decoupled from microevolution . [ 91 ] ”
Evolution and the second law of thermodynamics
See also : Creation Ministries International on the second law of thermodynamics and evolution
Creation Ministries International has a great wealth of information on why the second law of thermodynamics is incompatible with the evolutionary paradigm .
Some of their key resources on this matter are :
Punctuated Equilibrium
See also : Theories of evolution
Because the fossil record is characterized by the abrupt appearance of species and stasis in the fossil record the theory of punctuated equilibrium was developed and its chief proponents were Stephen Gould , Niles Eldridge , and Steven Stanley .
According to the American Museum of Natural History the theory of Punctuated Equilibrium " asserts that evolution occurs in dramatic spurts interspersed with long periods of stasis " . [ 92 ]
Because Stephen Gould was the leading proponent of the theory of punctuated equilibrium much of the criticism of the theory has been directed towards Gould . [ 93 ] [ 94 ]
The development of a new evolutionary school of thought occurring due to the fossil record not supporting the evolutionary position was not unprecedented .
In 1930 , Austin H. Clark , an American evolutionary zoologist who wrote 630 articles and books in six languages , came up with an evolutionary hypothesis called zoogenesis which postulated that each of the major types of life forms evolved separately and independently from all the others . [ 95 ]
Prior to publishing his work entitled The New Evolution : Zoogenesis , Clark wrote in a journal article published in the Quarterly Review of Biology that " so far as concerns the major groups of animals , the creationists seem to have the better of the argument .
There is not the slightest evidence that any one of the major groups arose from any other . " [ 96 ]
In 1995 , there was an essay in the New York Review of Books by the late John Maynard Smith , a noted evolutionary biologist who was considered the dean of British neo-Darwinists , and Smith wrote the following regarding Gould 's work in respect to the theory of evolution :
“ The evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his [ Gould ’s ] work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with , but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists .
All this would not matter , were it not that he is giving non biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory . " [ 97 ] [ 98 ] ”
Noted journalist and author Robert Wright , wrote in 1996 that , “ among top - flight evolutionary biologists , Gould is considered a pest — not just a lightweight , but an actively muddled man who has warped the public 's understanding of Darwinism . ” [ 99 ] [ 100 ]
Creation scientist Dr. Jonathan Sarfati wrote regarding the implausibility of the theory of punctuated equilibrium and the implausibility of the idea of gradual evolution the following :
“ ... supporters of ‘ jerky ’ evolution saltationism and its relative , punctuated equilibria ) point out that the fossil record does not show gradualism , and that the hypothetical transitional forms would be disadvantageous .
But supporters of gradual evolution point out that large , information - increasing changes are so improbable that one would need to invoke a secular miracle .
Creationists agree with both : punctuational evolution can’t happen , and gradual evolution can’t happen — in fact , particles - to - people evolution ca n’t happen at all ! [ 101 ] ”
Implausible Explanations and the Evolutionary Position
[ 102 ] Harvard biologist Ernst Mayr wrote : " It must be admitted , however , that it is a considerable strain on one ’s credulity to assume that finely balanced systems such as certain sense organs ( the eye of vertebrates , or the bird ’s feather ) could be improved by random mutations . "
Individuals who are against the evolutionary position assert that evolutionary scientists employ extremely implausible " just so stories " to support their position and have done this since at least the time of Charles Darwin . [ 103 ] [ 104 ]
A well known example of a " just so story " is when Darwin , in his Origin of the Species , wrote a chapter entitled " Difficulties on Theory " in which he stated :
“ " In North America the black bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth , thus catching , like a whale , insects in the water .
Even in so extreme a case as this , if the supply of insects were constant , and if better adapted competitors did not already exist in the country , I can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered , by natural selection , more and more aquatic in their structure and habits , with larger and larger mouths , till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale . " [ 105 ] ”
Even the prominent evolutionist and geneticist Professor Richard Lewontin admitted the following :
“ " We take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs , in spite of its failure to fulfill many of its extravagant promises of health and life , in spite of the tolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated just - so stories , because we have a prior commitment , a commitment to materialism .
It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world , but , on the contrary , that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations , no matter how counter - intuitive , no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated .
Moreover , that materialism is an absolute , for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door . "
- Richard Lewontin , ‘ Billions and billions of demons ’ , The New York Review , January 9 , 1997 , p. 31 [ 106 ] ”
Dr. Sarfati wrote regarding the theory of evolution the following :
“ The same logic applies to the dinosaur - bird debate .
It is perfectly in order for creationists to cite Feduccia ’s devastating criticism against the idea that birds evolved ‘ ground up ’ from running dinosaurs ( the cursorial theory ) .
But the dino - to - bird advocates counter with equally powerful arguments against Feduccia ’s ‘ trees - down ’ ( arboreal ) theory .
The evidence indicates that the critics are both right — birds did not evolve either from running dinos or from tree - living mini-crocodiles .
In fact , birds did not evolve from non-birds at all ! [ 107 ] ”
Opponents to the theory of evolution commonly point to the following in nature as being implausibly created through evolutionary processes :
Lastly , biochemist Michael Behe wrote the following :
“ " Molecular evolution is not based on scientific authority .
There is no publication in the scientific literature — in prestigious journals , specialty journals , or book — that describes how molecular evolution of any real , complex , biochemical system either did occur or even might have occurred .
There are assertions that such evolution occurred , but absolutely none are supported by pertinent experiments or calculations .
Since no one knows molecular evolution by direct experience , and since there is no authority on which to base claims of knowledge , it can truly be said that — like the contention that the Eagles will win the Super Bowl this year — the assertion of Darwinian molecular evolution is merely bluster . "
- Michael J. Behe , Darwin ’s Black Box ( New York : The Free Press , 1996 ) , p. 186[ 123 ] ”
Statements of Design
Phillip E. Johnson cites Francis Crick in order to illustrate the fact that the biological world has the strong appearance of being designed :
“ " One of the world 's most famous scientists , probably the most famous living biologist , is Sir Francis Crick , the British co-discoverer of the structure of DNA , a Nobel Prize winner ...
Crick is also a fervent atheistic materialist , who propounds the particle story .
In his autobiography , Crick says very candidly biologists must remind themselves daily that what they study was not created , it evolved ; it was not designed , it evolved .
Why do they have to remind themselves of that ?
Because otherwise , the facts which are staring them in the face and trying to get their attention might break through .
What we discovered when I developed a working group of scientists , philosophers , et al. , in the United States was that living organisms look as if they were designed and they look that way because that is exactly what they are . "
- Evolution And Christian Faith by Phillip E. Johnson [ 124 ] ”
Stephen C. Meyer offers the following statement regarding the design of the biological world :
“ " During the last forty years , molecular biology has revealed a complexity and intricacy of design that exceeds anything that was imaginable during the late - nineteenth century .
We now know that organisms display any number of distinctive features of intelligently engineered high - tech systems : information storage and transfer capability ; functioning codes ; sorting and delivery systems ; regulatory and feed - back loops ; signal transduction circuitry ; and everywhere , complex , mutually - interdependent networks of parts .
Indeed , the complexity of the biomacromolecules discussed in this essay does not begin to exhaust the full complexity of living systems .
As even the staunch materialist Richard Dawkins has allowed , " Biology is the study of complicated things that give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose . "
Yet the materialistic science we have inherited from the late - nineteenth century , with its exclusive conceptual reliance on matter and energy , could neither envision nor can it now account for the biology of the information age . "
- The Origin of Life and the Death of Materialism by Stephen C. Meyer , Ph.D. [ 125 ] ”
The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states regarding a candid admission of Charles Darwin :
“ In 1885 , the Duke of Argyll recounted a conversation he had had with Charles Darwin the year before Darwin 's death :
In the course of that conversation I said to Mr. Darwin , with reference to some of his own remarkable works on the Fertilisation of Orchids , and upon The Earthworms , and various other observations he made of the wonderful contrivances for certain purposes in nature — I said it was impossible to look at these without seeing that they were the effect and the expression of Mind .
I shall never forget Mr. Darwin 's answer .
He looked at me very hard and said , “ Well , that often comes over me with overwhelming force ; but at other times , ” and he shook his head vaguely , adding , “ it seems to go away . ” ( Argyll 1885 , 244 ] [ 126 ] ”
A significant portion of atheists see their lives and the world being the product of design
Research and historical data indicate that a significant portion of atheists / agnostics often see the their lives and the world as being the product of purposeful design ( see : Atheism and purpose ) . [ 127 ]

Detractors of Evolution and the Scientific Journals
Advocates of the theory of evolution have often claimed that those who oppose the theory of evolution do n't publish their opposition to the theory of evolution in the appropriate scientific literature ( creationist scientists have peer reviewed journals which favor the creationist position ) .
[ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]
Recently , there has been articles which were favorable to the intelligent design position in scientific journals which traditionally have favored the theory of evolution . [ 131 ]
Unqualified to be a scientific theory
Karl Popper , a leading philosopher of science and originator of the falsifiability as a criterion of demarcation of science from nonscience , [ 132 ] stated that Darwinism is " not a testable scientific theory , but a metaphysical research programme . " [ 133 ]
Leading Darwinist and philosopher of science , Michael Ruse declared the concerning Popper 's statement and the actions he took after making that statement : " Since making this claim , Popper himself has modified his position somewhat ; but , disclaimers aside , I suspect that even now he does not really believe that Darwinism in its modern form is genuinely falsifiable . " [ 134 ]
The issue of the falsifiability of the evolutionary position is very important issue and although offering a poor cure to the problem that Karl Popper described , committed evolutionists Louis Charles Birch & Paul R. Ehrlich stated in the journal Nature :
“ Our theory of evolution has become , as Popper described , one which cannot be refuted by any possible observations .
Every conceivable observation can be fitted into it .
It is thus outside of empirical science but not necessarily false .
No one can think of ways in which to test it .
Ideas , either without basis or based on a few laboratory experiments carried out in extremely simplified systems , have become part of an evolutionary dogma accepted by most of us as part of our training .
The cure seems to us not to be a discarding of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory , but more skepticism about many of its tenets . [ 135 ] ”
The Swedish cytogeneticist , Antonio Lima - De-Faria , who has been knighted by the king of Sweden for his scientific achievements , noted that " there has never been a theory of evolution " .
[ 136 ] [ 137 ]
Atheism and the evolutionary paradigm are religious in nature and legal implications
See also : Suppression of alternatives to evolution and Atheism and the suppression of science
Many of the leaders of the atheist movement , such as the evolutionist and the new atheist Richard Dawkins , argue for atheism and evolution with a religious fervor ( See also : Atheism and evolution ) .
Daniel Smartt has identified seven dimensions which make up religion : narrative , experiential , social , ethical , doctrinal , ritual and material .
It is not necessary in Smartt 's model for every one of these to be present in order for something to be a religion . [ 138 ] .
However , it can be argued that all seven are present in the case of atheism . [ 139 ] [ 140 ]
Please see : Atheism : A religionand Atheism and Atheism is a religion .
Atheism is a religion and its legal implications as far as the teaching of evolution
See also : Atheism is a religion and Atheism and evolution
Atheism is a religion and naturalistic notions concerning origins are religious in nature and both have legal implications as far as evolution being taught in public schools . [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ]
John Calvert , a lawyer and intelligent design proponent wrote :
“ The Seventh Judicial Circuit of the Court of Appeals of the United States held that atheism is a religion .
Therefore , it can not be promoted by a public school .
Currently , public schools are often unwittingly promoting atheism through a dogmatic and uncritical teaching of materialistic theories of origins . [ 145 ] ”

Michael Ruse , the atheist and evolutionist science philosopher admitted , “ Evolution is a religion .
This was true of evolution in the beginning , and it is true of evolution still today . ” [ 146 ]
In the leading American science science journal Science , Michael Ruse published an article in 2003 entitled Is Evolution a Secular Religion ? [ 147 ]
Creationist opponents of evolution commonly point out that evolution is a religion and not science . [ 148 ]
For more information , please see : Evolution is a religion
Evolution as a secular origins myth
Evolution is a secular origins myth of atheists , agnostics and members of other theologically liberal religious sects ( theologically liberal religious sects often dismiss out of hand various supernatural events in history due to their hostility towards God and the supernatural ) .
See : Evolution as a secular origins myth
The religion of evolutionism is contrary to creationism . [ 149 ]
Effect on Scientific Endeavors Outside the Specific Field of Biology
See also : List of atheist and agnostic pseudosciences
Stephen Wolfram in his book A New Kind of Science has stated that the Darwinian theory of evolution has , in recent years , " increasingly been applied outside of biology . " [ 150 ]
Lysenkoism
Evolutionary theory played a prominent role in regards to atheistic communism . [ 151 ]
Communists , in particular Stalinism , favored a version of Lamarckism called Lysenkoism developed by the atheist Trofim Denisovich Lysenko . [ 152 ] Lsyenko was made member of the Supreme Soviet and head of the Institute of Genetics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences . [ 153 ] Later Lysenko became President of the All - Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences . [ 154 ]
Many geneticists were imprisoned and executed for their bourgeois science , and agricultural policies based on Lysenkoism that were adopted under the Communist leaders Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong caused famines and the death of millions . [ 155 ]
Medical Science
The theory of evolution has had a negative effect on the field of medical science .
According to Dr. Jerry Bergman the list of vestigial organs in humans has gone from 180 in 1890 to 0 in 1999 .
[ 156 ]
Furthermore , Dr. Bergman states the following :
“ Few examples of vestigial organs in humans are now offered , and the ones that are have been shown by more recent research to be completely functional ( and in many cases critically so , see Bergman and Howe ) ...
One popular book on the human body which discussed vestigial organs stated that next to circumcision ‘… tonsillectomy is the most frequently performed piece of surgery .
Doctors once thought tonsils were simply useless evolutionary leftovers and took them out thinking that it could do no harm .
Today there is considerable evidence that there are more troubles in the upper respiratory tract after tonsil removal than before , and doctors generally agree that simple enlargement of tonsils is hardly an indication for surgery ... ’[ 157 ] ”
Astronomy
Young earth creation scientist Dr. Jonathan Sarfati states that evolutionary thought has been applied to the field of astronomy .
[ 158 ]
Sarfati's claim is supported by the fact that astronomers do refer to the " evolution of the universe " .
[ 159 ]
Sarfati asserts the evolutionary view has had a negative effect on astronomy and that arguments to support the proposed evolutionary time scales of billions of years via the field of astronomy are invalid . [ 160 ]
Creationists can cite examples of scientists stating that evolutionary ideas in astronomy have failed to have any explanatory power :
“ “ “ ... most every prediction by theorists about planetary formation has been wrong . ”
Scott Tremaine , as quoted by Richard A. Kerr , “ Jupiters Like Our Own Await Planet Hunters , ” Science , Vol. 295 , 25 January 2002 , p. 605 . [ 161 ] ”
“ " Attempts to find a plausible naturalistic explanation of the origin of the Solar System began about 350 years ago but have not yet been quantitatively successful , making this one of the oldest unsolved problems in modern science . ”
- Stephen G. Brush , A History of Modern Planetary Physics , Vol. 3 ( Cambridge , UK : Cambridge University Press , 1996 ) , p. 91 . [ 161 ] ”
“ “ We do n’t understand how a single star forms , yet we want to understand how 10 billion stars form . ”
Carlos Frenk , as quoted by Robert Irion , “ Surveys Scour the Cosmic Deep , ” Science , Vol. 303 , 19 March 2004 , p. 1750 . [ 162 ] ”
“ “ We can not even show convincingly how galaxies , stars , planets , and life arose in the present universe . ”
Michael Rowan - Robinson , “ Review of the Accidental Universe , ” New Scientist , Vol. 97 , 20 January 1983 , p. 186. [ 163 ] ”
In 2001 , Cristina Chiappini wrote concering the Milky Way galaxy :
" . . . it is an elegant structure that shows both order and complexity .
. . .
The end product is especially remarkable in the light of what is believed to be the starting point : nebulous blobs of gas .
How the universe made the Milky Way from such simple beginnings is not altogether clear .
- Cristina Chiappini , " The Formation and Evolution of the Milky Way , " American Scientist ( vol. 89 , Nov./Dec. 2001 ) , p. 506 . [ 164 ]
Dr. Walt Brown provides numerous citations to the secular science literature that cite the failings of current old universe paradigm explanations in regards to the planets , stars , and galaxies .
[ 161 ] [ 162 ] [ 163 ]
Origin of Life
Evolutionary thought has had an influence on origin of life research as well .
For example , a 2004 article in the International Journal of Astrobiology is titled On the applicability of Darwinian principles to chemical evolution that led to life . [ 165 ]
It is also clear that early origin of life researcher Aleksandr Oparin who proposed materialist ideas regarding the origin of life was influenced by evolutionary thought .
[ 166 ]
However , the current naturalistic explanations for the origin of life are inadequate .
Some evolutionists try to claim that the origin of life is not a part of evolutionary paradigm , but this is not the case ( see : Origin of life ) .
Richard Dawkins and evolutionary quackery

Age of the Earth and the Theory of Evolution
As far as the evolutionary timeline posited by the evolutionary community , the various theories of evolution claim that the earth and universe are billions of years old and that macroevolutionary processes occurred over this time period .
[ 167 ] [ 168 ]
William R. Corliss was a respected cataloger of scientific anomalies and the science magazine New Scientist had an article which focused on Mr. Corliss 's career as a cataloger of scientific anomalies .
[ 169 ] Mr. Corliss cataloged scores of anomalies which challenge the old earth geology paradigm . [ 170 ] [ 171 ]
Young earth creationist hold the earth and universe is approximately 6,000 years old .
[ 167 ]
Young earth creationist scientists state the following is true : there are multiple lines of evidence pointing to a young earth and universe ; the old earth and universe paradigm has numerous anomalies and uses invalid dating methods , and there are multiple citations in the secular science literature that corroborate the implausibility of the old earth and universe paradigm ( for details see : Young Earth Creationism ) .

[ 172 ]
The [ 173 ]
Until the 1970s the scientific consensus was wrong on how lions killed their prey .
The Bible was correct regarding how lions killed their prey .
A 1997 Gallup poll indicated that 55 % of United States scientists believed that humans developed over a period of millions of years from less developed forms of life and that God had no part in the process , 40 % believed in theistic evolution , and 5 % of scientists believed that God created man fairly much in his current form at one time within the last 10,000 years . [ 174 ]
As noted earlier , in 2007 , " Discovery Institute 's Center for Science and Culture ... announced that over 700 scientists from around the world have now signed a statement expressing their skepticism about the contemporary theory of Darwinian evolution . " [ 175 ]
Poll results regarding the amount of scientists who are skeptical or opposed to the evolutionary view could be underreporting the actual amount of scientists who are skeptical of the evolutionary view or hold the creation science view .
Poll results may not be as precise as they could be as creation science organizations report widespread discrimination against scientists who hold the creation science view . [ 176 ]
On April 18 , 2008 a film documentary by Ben Stein entitled Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed ! was released to the public which documents the suppression of scientific freedom of scientists who are critical of the evolutionary position .
[ 177 ] [ 178 ]
Such suppression is not surprising given that a poll among United States scientists showed that approximately 45 % of scientists believed there was no God . [ 179 ]
In addition , a survey found that 93 % of the scientists who were members of the United States National Academy of Sciences do not believe there is a God . [ 180 ]
Given this state of affairs , a future paradigm shift from the theory of evolution to a creation science position could be slow given the worldviews of many scientists .
[ 181 ] 19th century European naturalists were wrong about ant behavior .
The Bible was correct about ant behavior .
Also , the current scientific community consensus is no guarantee of truth .
The history of science shows many examples where the scientific community consensus was in error , was scientifically unsound , or had little or no empirical basis .
For example , bloodletting was practiced from antiquity and still had many practitioners up until the late 1800s . [ 182 ]
In his essay , A Paradigm Shift : Are We Ready ? , Niranjan Kissoon , M.D. declared : " ... history is rife with examples in which our best medical judgment was flawed .
The prestigious British Medical Journal begun in 1828 chose the name Lancet to signal its scholarly intent and cutting edge therapy . " [ 183 ]
In a 1991 BMJ ( formerly called the British Medical Journal ) article , Richard Smith ( editor of BMJ at the time ) wrote : " There are 30,000 biomedical journals in the world ... Yet only about 15 % of medical interventions are supported by solid scientific evidence , David Eddy professor of health policy and management at Duke University , told a conference in Manchester last week .
This is partly because only 1 % of the articles in medical journals are scientifically sound and partly because many treatments have never been assessed at all . " [ 184 ]
Next , alchemy was at one time considered to be a legitimate scientific pursuit and was studied by such notable individuals as Isaac Newton , Robert Boyle , Roger Bacon , and Gottfried Leibniz . [ 185 ] [ 186 ]
Given the aforementioned weaknesses in the evolutionary position and given that the history of science shows there have been some notable paradigm shifts , [ 187 ] [ 188 ] the scientific consensus argument for the macroevolutionary theory certainly cannot be called an invincible argument .
In addition , biblical creationists can point out examples where the scientific community was in error and the Bible was clearly correct .
For example , until the 1970s the scientific consensus on how lions killed their prey was in error and the Bible turned out to be right in this matter . [ 189 ]
Also , for centuries the scientific community believed that snakes could not hear and the 1988 edition of The New Encyclopedia Britannica stated the snakes could not hear but that was mistaken and the Bible was correct in this matter .
[ 190 ] [ 191 ]
In addition , 19th century European naturalists were wrong concerning a matter regarding ant behavior and the Bible was correct . [ 192 ]
Many creationists such as the creationists at Creation Ministries International assert that the Bible contains knowledge that shows an understanding of scientific knowledge Bible scientific foreknowledge beyond that believed to exist at the time the Bible was composed .
[ 193 ] [ 194 ]
In addition , Christianity had a profound influence in regards to the development of modern science .

Social Effects of the Theory of Evolution
For more information please see : Social effects of the theory of evolution and Evolutionary racism and Atheism and Evolution and World War I and Darwinism and Atheism , evolution and morality and Irreligion / religion and war ‎
There have been significant and negative social ramifications of the adoption of the theory of evolution .
The theory has been foundational to Social Darwinism , Nazism and Communism and has also been a source of racism . [ 195 ]
Belief in evolution and sexual immorality
See also : Evolutionary belief and sexual immorality and Liberal Christianity and marital infidelity
Dr. Carl Wieland is the Managing Director of Creation Ministries International
In July of 2000 , Creation Ministries International reported :
“ For years , many people have scoffed at any suggestion that the evils in society could be linked with the teaching of the theory of evolution .
But new research has confirmed what Bible - believers have known all along — that the rising acceptance of Darwin ’s theory is related to declining morality in the community .
The research survey of 1535 people , conducted by the Australian National University , revealed that belief in evolution is associated with moral permissiveness .
Darwin himself apparently feared that belief in evolution by the common man would lead to social decay .
The survey showed that people who believed in evolution were more likely to be in favour of premarital sex than those who rejected Darwin ’s theory .
Another issue which highlighted the contrast between the effect of evolutionary ideas and that of biblical principles was that Darwinians were reported to be ‘ especially tolerant ’ of abortion .
In identifying the primary factors determining these differences in community attitudes , the author of the research report , Dr Jonathan Kelley , said : ‘ The single most important influence after church attendance is the theory of evolution . ’[ 196 ] ”
Also , according to atheist philosopher David Stove the theory of evolution was influential in regards to the sexual revolution . [ 197 ]

Evolution and Nazism
See also : World War I and Darwinism and Irreligion / religion and war
The staunch evolutionist Stephen Gould admitted the following :
“ Haeckel was the chief apostle of evolution in Germany ....
His evolutionary racism ; his call to the German people for racial purity and unflinching devotion to a " just " state ; his belief that harsh , inexorable laws of evolution ruled human civilization and nature alike , conferring upon favored races the right to dominate others ; the irrational mysticism that had always stood in strange communion with his brave words about objective science - all contributed to the rise of Nazism .
- Stephen J. Gould , " Ontogeny and Phylogeny , " Belknap Press : Cambridge MA , 1977 , pp.77-78 ) . [ 198 ] ”
Adolf Hitler wrote the following evolutionary racist material in his work Mein Kampf :
“ If nature does not wish that weaker individuals should mate with the stronger , she wishes even less that a superior race should intermingle with an inferior one ; because in such cases all her efforts , throughout hundreds of thousands of years , to establish an evolutionary higher stage of being , may thus be rendered futile . [ 199 ] ”
Hitler also wrote in Mein Kampf :
“ The stronger must dominate and not blend with the weaker , thus sacrificing his own greatness .
Only the born weakling can view this as cruel , but he , after all , is only a weak and limited man ; for if this law did not prevail , any conceivable higher development ( Hoherentwicklung ) of organic living beings would be unthinkable . [ 200 ] ”
Dr. Robert E.D. Clark also wrote :
“ “ Adolf Hitler ’s mind was captivated by evolutionary teaching — probably since the time he was a boy .
Evolutionary ideas — quite undisguised — lie at the basis of all that is worst in Mein Kampf — and in his public speeches . ” [ 201 ] ”
Dr. Josef Mengele 's evolutionary thinking was in accordance with social Darwinist theories that Adolph Hitler and a number of German academics found appealing .
[ 202 ] [ 203 ]
Dr. Joseph Mengele studied under the leading proponents the " unworthy life " branch of evolutionary thought .
[ 204 ]
Dr. Mengele was one of the most notorious individuals associated with Nazi death camps and the Holocaust .
[ 205 ]
Mengele obtained a infamous reputation due to his experiments on twins while at Auschwitz - Birkenau . [ 206 ]
B. Wilder - Smith wrote the following regarding Nazism and the theory of evolution :
“ One of the central planks in Nazi theory and doctrine was … evolutionary theory [ and ] … that all biology had evolved … upward , and that … less evolved types … should be actively eradicated [ and ] … that natural selection could and should be actively aided , and therefore [ the Nazis ] instituted political measures to eradicate … Jews , and … blacks , whom they considered as “ underdeveloped ” . ’[ 207 ] ”
Pulitzer Prize winning author Marilynne Robinson wrote the following regarding Hitler 's racism in the November 2006 issue of Harper ’s Magazine :
“ While it is true that persecution of the Jews has a very long history in Europe , it is also true that science in the twentieth century revived and absolutized persecution by giving it a fresh rationale —
Jewishness was not religious or cultural , but genetic .
Therefore no appeal could be made against the brute fact of a Jewish grandparent ...
There is indeed historical precedent in the Spanish Inquisition for the notion of hereditary Judaism .
But the fact that the worst religious thought of the sixteenth century can be likened to the worst scientific thought of the twentieth century hardly redounds to the credit of science . " [ 208 ] ”
As noted earlier , evolutionary ideas significantly influenced the thinking of the nineteenth and twentieth - century Communists . [ 210 ] [ 211 ]
Karl Marx wrote in a letter the following , " " Darwin 's book is very important and serves me as a basis in natural science for the class struggle in history . "
Darwin's ideas also influenced the thinking of Engels , Vladimir Lenin , and Joseph Stalin . [ 212 ]
Darwinism and communism
Governments under the banner of atheistic communism have caused the death of somewhere between 40 million to 260 million human lives .
[ 213 ] Dr. R. J. Rummel , professor emeritus of political science at the University of Hawaii , is the scholar who first coined the term democide ( death by government ) .
Dr. R. J. Rummel 's mid estimate regarding the loss of life due to communism is that communism caused the death of approximately 110,286,000 people between 1917 and 1987 . [ 214 ]
Darwinism and racism
See also : Evolutionary racism
Previously it was mentioned that evolutionary ideas contributed to the scourge of racism . [ 215 ] [ 216 ]
Charles Darwin and Thomas Huxley contributed greatly to the theory of evolution broadly being accepted in the 1900s . [ 217 ]
Darwin , Huxley , and the 19th century evolutionists were racist in sentiment and believed the white race was superior . [ 218 ]
For example , Charles Darwin wrote in his work The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex the following :
“ At some future period not very distant as measured by centuries , the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace the savage races throughout the world .
At the same time the anthropomorphous apes ... will no doubt be exterminated .
The break between man and his nearest Allies will then be wider , for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state , as we may hope , even than the Caucasian , and some ape as low as the baboon , instead of as now between the Negro or Australian and the gorilla . [ 219 ] ”
John C. Burnham wrote , in the journal Science , the following in regards to the theory of evolution and racism :
“ After 1859 , the evolutionary schema raised additional questions , particularly whether or not Afro-Americans could survive competition with their white near - relations .
The momentous answer was a resounding no ....
The African was inferior — he represented the missing link between ape and Teuton . " [ 220 ] ”
Harvard University 's Stephen Jay Gould stated , " Biological arguments for racism may have been common before 1859 , but they increased by orders of magnitude following the acceptance of evolutionary theory . " [ 221 ]
Recent racism directed at Michelle Obama was the result of evolutionary racism . [ 222 ]
Dr. Satoshi Kanazawa is an evolutionary psychologist at the London School of Economics .
Dr. Kanazawa publishes a blog on the Psychology Today website called The Scientific Fundamentalist .
In 2011 , Dr. Kanazawa published the following inappropriate comment which was later pulled by the Psychology Today website :
“ It is very interesting to note that , even though black women are objectively less physically attractive than other women , black women ( and men ) subjectively consider themselves to be far more physically attractive than others . [ 223 ] ”
Kanazawa has a " Savanna principle " hypothesis which speculates that societal problems are due to the human brain supposedly evolving in Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago in a very different environment from modern society . [ 224 ]
Darwinism and brutality in war
Historian Jacques Barzun observed how Darwinism caused the horrendous brutality of the wars leading up to WWI : " Since in every European country between 1870 and 1914 there was a war party demanding armaments , an individualist party demanding ruthless competition , an imperialist party demanding a free hand over backward peoples , a socialist party demanding the conquest of power and a racialist party demanding internal purges against aliens — all of them , when appeals to greed and glory failed , invoked Spencer and Darwin , which was to say science incarnate .

Common behavior of online evolutionists
In February of 2010 , the news organization The Telegraph reported that atheist and evolutionist Richard Dawkins was " embroiled in a bitter online battle over plans to rid his popular internet forum for atheists of foul language , insults and ' frivolous gossip ' . " [ 226 ]
Given that Wired Magazine and Vox Day declared for various reasons that atheists tend to be quarrelsome , socially challenged men , it is not surprising the online dispute was bitter .
In addition , Richard Dawkins has a reputation for being abrasive .
In 2010 , the Christian apologetics website True Free Thinker wrote :
In addition , there is a widespread problem with atheist cyberbullying on YouTube toward Christian and creationist YouTube channels .
CreationWiki has developed a web page entitled Creationist YouTube video designed to show creationists how to thwart atheist / evolutionist cyberbullies .
Creation Scientists Tend to Win the Creation - Evolution Debates
Creation scientists tend to win the Creation - Evolution debates and many have been held since the 1970's particularly in the United States ( see : Creation vs. evolution debates ) .
In August of 1979 , Dr. Henry Morris reported in an Institute for Creation Research letter the following : “ By now , practically every leading evolutionary scientist in this country has declined one or more invitations to a scientific debate on creation / evolution . ”
Morris also said regarding the creation scientist Duane Gish ( who had over 300 formal debates ) : “ At least in our judgment and that of most in the audiences , he always wins . ” [ 228 ] [ 229 ]
Generally speaking , leading evolutionists no longer debate creation scientists because creation scientists tend to win the creation vs. evolution debates ( see : Creation vs. evolution debates ) .
[ 230 ]
Also , the atheist and evolutionist Richard Dawkins has shown inconsistent and deceptive behavior concerning his refusal creation scientists .
Evolutionists and atheists inconsistency concerning debating creationists was commented on by the Christian apologetic website True Free Thinker which declared : " Interestingly enough , having noted that since some atheists refuse to debate “ creationists ” but then go on to debate some of those people but not others , it is clear that they are , in reality , being selective and making excuses for absconding from difficulties ... " [ 231 ]
Theory of Evolution , Liberalism , Atheism , and Irrationality
Theory of evolution and liberalism and Atheism and Evolution and Atheism and deception
As alluded to earlier , in the United States , CBS News reported in October of 2005 that the Americans most likely to believe only in the theory of evolution are liberals . [ 233 ]
“ The CBS News reported the following : Americans most likely to believe in only evolution are liberals ( 36 percent ) , those who rarely or never attend religious services ( 25 percent ) , and those with a college degree or higher ( 24 percent ) .
White evangelicals ( 77 percent ) , weekly churchgoers ( 74 percent ) and conservatives ( 64 percent ) , are mostly likely to say God created humans in their present form . [ 234 ] ”
Given that liberalism is so prevalent in academia , it is not entirely surprising that college graduates are indoctrinated into the evolutionary paradigm via evolutionary propaganda .
Despite the aforementioned lack of evidence for the evolutionary position and the aforementioned counter evidential nature of the evolutionary paradigm , atheists and liberals persist in advocating the evolutionary paradigm .
The continued support of the atheist and liberal community for the evolutionary paradigm is not surprising given the that the Wall Street Journal reported :
“ ... a comprehensive new study released by Baylor University yesterday , shows that traditional Christian religion greatly decreases belief in everything from the efficacy of palm readers to the usefulness of astrology .
It also shows that the irreligious and the members of more liberal Protestant denominations , far from being resistant to superstition , tend to be much more likely to believe in the paranormal and in pseudoscience than evangelical Christians ....
This is not a new finding .
In his 1983 book " The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener , " skeptic and science writer Martin Gardner cited the decline of traditional religious belief among the better educated as one of the causes for an increase in pseudoscience , cults and superstition .
He referenced a 1980 study published in the magazine Skeptical Inquirer that showed irreligious college students to be by far the most likely to embrace paranormal beliefs , while born - again Christian college students were the least likely . [ 235 ] ”

‎ Many liberals when faced with the compelling data for creation science and against the evolutionary paradigm irrationally attempt to suppress the evidence and engage in denial like the atheist Charles Darwin ( see : religious views of Charles Darwin ) who late in life is reported to often have overwhelming thoughts that the world was designed .
Creation Ministries International describes such irrational thinking in the following manner :

Ben Stein Interview with the Evolutionist Richard Dawkins
In the movie Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed , Ben Stein demonstrated the folly of evolutionism in his interview with the prominent evolutionist and atheist Richard Dawkins ( A clip of the interview has been uploaded to YouTube ) .
The Discovery Institute provides an transcript of part of the interview along with some commentary :
“ BEN STEIN : " What do you think is the possibility that Intelligent Design might turn out to be the answer to some issues in genetics or in evolution ? "
DAWKINS : " Well , it could come about in the following way .
It could be that at some earlier time , somewhere in the universe , a civilization evolved , probably by some kind of Darwinian means , probably to a very high level of technology , and designed a form of life that they seeded onto perhaps this planet .
Now , um , now that is a possibility , and an intriguing possibility .
And I suppose it 's possible that you might find evidence for that if you look at the details of biochemistry , molecular biology , you might find a signature of some sort of designer . "
Ho , ho !
That is precisely what the Raelians say : Years ago , everybody knew that the earth was flat .
Everybody knew that the sun revolved around the earth .
Today , everybody knows that life on earth is either the result of random evolution or the work of a supernatural God .
Or is it ?
In " Message from the Designers " , Rael presents us with a third option : that all life on earth was created by advanced scientists from another world .
Richard Dawkins and Rael ; " clear thinking " kindred spirits ! [ 242 ] ”
In the Ben Stein / Richard Dawkins interview , Richard Dawkins was also asked what the probability is of God 's existence is and a rationale for that estimation .
Dawkins gave a very inept reply to Ben Stein concerning this issue .
Creationist Video Interview of Richard Dawkins Being Stumped by a Creationist
A video clip featuring Richard Dawkins became widely available to the public , [ 243 ] showing Dawkins being stumped by a question from the creationist interviewer .
A shortened version has been translated into 10 languages .
The clip was part of an interview included in the video and DVD From a Frog to Prince , produced by Creation Ministries International about the genetic information required by evolution , and the interviewer is asking Dawkins for an example of genetic information arising from a mutation .
In later interviews , Dawkins claims that he was not stumped , but instead shocked when he realized that the interviewer was a creationist , and the video was edited in a way to make him look like he was unable to answer the question . [ 244 ]
However , the question came after he had that realization , and after the creationists negotiated with Dawkins and he agreed to continue . [ 245 ]
Richard Dawkins still has n't provide any examples of genetic information being created by evolution .
Methodological Naturalism Ideology In Evolutionary Thought
As mentioned earlier , evolutionary thought ( which employs methodological naturalism ) has had an influence on origin of life research as well ( for example , a 2004 article in the International Journal of Astrobiology is titled On the applicability of Darwinian principles to chemical evolution that led to life ) . [ 246 ]
The Nobel Prize winning biologist Francis Crick described himself as an agnostic with " a strong inclination towards atheism . " [ 247 ]
In 1992 , the science magazine Scientific American published an interview which explored Sir Francis Crick 's belief in the hypothesis Directed Panspermia as a proposed hypthesis for the origin of life on earth .
[ 248 ]
Directed panspermia posits concerning the question of origin of life on earth that " organisms were deliberately transmitted to the earth by intelligent beings on another planet . " [ 249 ]
Michael Behe wrote regarding the Scientific American interview the following :
“ The primary reason Crick subscribes to this unorthodox view is that he judges the undirected origin of life to be a virtually insurmountable obstacle , but he wants a naturalistic explanation . [ 250 ] ”
When commenting on the hypothesis of Directed Panspermia Creation Ministries International wrote that Francis " Crick ’s atheistic faith leads to absurd pseudoscience " . [ 251 ]

Recent uptick of Lamarckism school of evolutionary thought
As can be seen below , there has been an uptick in macroevolutionary Lamarckism pseudoscience due to microevolutionary processes / changes that have been discovered in organisms related to Lamarckism :
However , due to intellectual inertia , the evolutionist indoctrination of students into Neo-Darwinism ( also called the Modern evolutionary synthesis ) and people 's natural tendency to resist change , the neo - darwinian school of evolutionary thought is still dominant within the evolutionary biology community ( see also : Paradigm shift ) .
The weight of evidence still supports the biblical creation model ( see also : Creation science ) .

Abstract
The programming language C has been in widespread use since the early 1970s , and it is probably the language most widely used by computer science professionals .
The goal of this paper is to argue that it is time to retire C in favour of a more modern language .
The choice of a programming language is often an emotional issue which is not subject to rational discussion .
Nevertheless it is hoped to show here that there are good objective reasons why C is not a good choice for large programming projects .
These reasons are related primarily to the issues of software readability and programmer productivity .

Introduction
This note was written after I had found myself saying and writing the same things over and over again to different people .
Rather than keep repeating myself , I thought I should summarize my thoughts in a single document .
Although the title may sound frivolous , this is a serious document .
I am deeply concerned about the widespread use of C for serious computer programming .
The language has spread far beyond its intended application area .
Furthermore , the C enthusiasts seem to be largely in ignorance of the advances which have been made in language design in the last 20 years .
The misplaced loyalty to C is , in my opinion , just as serious a problem among professionals as the BASIC problem is among amateurs .
It is not my intention in this note to debate the relative merits of procedural ( e.g. Pascal or C ) , functional ( e.g. Lisp ) , and declarative languages ( e.g. Prolog ) .
That is a separate issue .
My intention , rather , is to urge people using a procedural language to give preference to high - level languages .
In what follows , I shall be using Modula - 2 as an example of a modern programming language .
This is simply because it is a language about which I can talk intelligently .
I am not suggesting that Modula - 2 is perfect ; but it at least serves to illustrate that there are languages which do not have the failings of C .
I do not consider C++ to be one such language , by the way .
The question of C++ will be considered in a later section .
For now , it is worth pointing out that almost of the criticisms of C which will be listed in this note apply equally well to C ++.
The C++ language is of course an improvement on C , but it does not solve many of the serious problems which C has .
Some background
The first C compiler , on a PDP - 11 , appeared in about 1972 .
At the time the PDP - 11 was a relatively new machine , and few programming languages were available for it ; the choice was essentially limited to assembly language , BASIC , and Fortran IV .
( Compilers and interpreters for some other languages had been written , but were not widely distributed . )
Given the obvious limitations of these languages for systems - level programming , there was a clear need for a new language .
This was also the era in which software designers were coming to accept that operating systems need not be written in assembly language .
The first version of Unix ( 1969 - 70 ) was written in assembly language , but subsequently almost all of it was rewritten in C .
To make this feasible , however , it was necessary to have a language which could bypass some of the safety checks which are built in to most high - level languages , and allow one to do things which could otherwise be done only in assembly or machine language .
This led to the concept of intermediate - level machine - oriented languages .
C was not the only such language , and certainly not the earliest .
In fact , a whole rash of machine - oriented languages appeared at about that time .
( I was the author of one such language , SGL , which was used for a number of projects within our department in the 1970s .
It was retired , as being somewhat old - fashioned , in the early 1980s . )
These languages had a strong family resemblance to one another ; not because the authors were copying from one another ( in my own case , SGL had reached a fairly advanced stage before I became aware of the existence of C ) , but because they were all influenced by the same pool of ideas which were common property at the time .
Why C became popular
The history of C is inextricably linked with the history of Unix .
The Unix operating system is itself written in C , as are the majority of utility programs which come with Unix ; and to the best of my knowledge a C compiler comes with every distribution of Unix , whereas it is harder to get compilers for other languages under Unix .
Thus , we need to look at the reasons for the rapid spread of Unix .
The obvious reasons are cost and availability .
Unix was distributed at virtually no cost , and sources were available to make it easy to port it to other systems .
A number of useful utilities were available within Unix - written in C , of course - and it was usually simpler to leave them in C than to translate them to another language .
For a Unix user who wanted to do any programming , a competence in C was almost essential .
Since then , C has remained widespread for the same reasons as why Fortran has remained widespread : once a language has built up a large user base , it develops an unstoppable momentum .
When people are asked " why do you use C? " , the most common answers are ( a ) easy availability of inexpensive compilers ; ( b ) extensive subroutine libraries and tools ; ( c ) everyone else uses it .
The ready availability of compilers , libraries , and support tools is , of course , a direct consequence of the large number of users .
And , of course , each generation of programming educators teaches students its favourite language .
Portability is also given as a reason for the popularity of C , but in my opinion this is a red herring .
A subset of C is portable , but it is almost impossible to convince programmers to stick to that subset .
The C compiler which I use can generate warning messages concerning portability , but it is no effort at all to write a non-portable program which generates no compiler warnings .
Why C remains popular
With advances in compiler technology , the original motivation for designing medium - level languages - namely , object code efficiency - has largely disappeared .
Most other machine - oriented languages which appeared at about the same time as C are now considered to be obsolete .
Why , then , has C survived ?
There is of course a belief that C is more appealing to the " macho " side of programmers , who enjoy the challenge of struggling with obscure bugs and of finding obscure and tricky ways of doing things .
The conciseness of C code is also a popular feature .
C programmers seem to feel that being able to write a statement like
**p++^=q++=*r---s
Another important factor is that initial program development is perceived to be faster in C than in a more structured language .
( I do n't agree with this belief , and will return later to this point . )
The general perception is that a lot of forward planning is necessary in a language like Modula - 2 , whereas with C one can sit down and start coding immediately , giving more immediate gratification .
Do these reasons look familiar ?
Yes , they are almost identical to the arguments which were being trotted out a few years ago in favour of BASIC .
Could it be that the current crop of C programmers are the same people who were playing with toy computers as adolescents ?
We said at the time that using BASIC as a first language would create bad habits which would be very difficult to eradicate .
Now we 're seeing the evidence of that .
Advances in language design
It would be a gargantuan task to track down and document the origin of what we know today about programming language design , and I 'm not going to do that .
Many of the good ideas first appeared in obscure languages , but did not become well - known until they were adopted into more popular languages .
What I want to do in this section is simply note a few important landmarks , as they appeared in the better - known languages .
Undoubtedly the most important step forward was the concept of a high - level language , as exemplified in Fortran and Cobol .
What these languages gave us were at least three important new principles : portability of programs across a range of machines ; the ability to tackle new problems which were just too big or too difficult in assembly language ; and the expansion of the pool of potential programmers beyond that small group willing and able to probe the obscure mysteries of how each individual processor worked .
Needless to say , there were those who felt that " real " programmers would continue to work in machine language .
Those " real " programmers are still among us , and are still arguing that their special skills and superior virtue somehow compensate for their poor productivity .
The main faults of Fortran were a certain lack of regularity , some awkward restrictions which in hindsight were seen to be unnecessary , and some features which were imposed more because of machine dependencies than for programmer convenience .
( The only justification for the three - way IF of Fortran II , for example , was that it mapped well into the machine language of a machine which is now obsolete . )
Some of these faults were corrected in Algol 60 , which in turn inspired a large number of Algol - like languages .
The main conceptual advance in Algol was probably its introduction of nesting in control structures , which in turn led to cleaner control structures .
The structured programming revolution is sometimes considered to date from Dijkstra 's famous " GOTO considered harmful " letter .
Although this is an over - simplification , it is true that the realisation that the GOTO construct was unnecessary - and even undesirable - was an important part of the discovery that programming productivity was very much linked to having well - structured and readable programs .
The effect this had on language design was a new emphasis on " economy of concept " ; that is , on having languages which were regular in design and which avoided special cases and baroque , hard to read constructs .
The important contribution of Pascal was to extend these ideas from control structures to data structures .
Although the various data structuring mechanisms had existed in earlier languages - even C has a way of declaring record structures - Pascal pulled them all together in an integrated way .
Pascal can still be considered to be a viable language , with a large number of users , but it has at least two conspicuous faults .
First , it was standardized too early , which meant that some niggling shortcomings - the crude input / output arrangements , for example - were never fixed in the language standard .
They are fixed in many implementations of Pascal , but the repairs go outside the standard and are therefore nonportable .
The second major fault is that a Pascal program must ( if one wants to conform to the standard ) exist as a single file , which makes the language unsuitable for really large programs .
More recently , there has been a lot of emphasis on issues like reusable software and efficient management of large programs .
The key idea here is modularity , and this will be discussed in the following section .
Now , where does C fit into this picture ?
The answer is that C is built around lessons which were learnt from Algol 60 and its early successors , and that it does not incorporate much that has been learnt since then .
We have learnt some new things about language design in the last 20 years , and we do know that some of the things that seemed like a good idea at the time are in fact not such good ideas .
Is it not time to move on to D , or even E ?
Modularity
In its very crudest sense , modularity means being able to break a large program into smaller , separately compiled sections .
C allows this .
Even Fortran II allowed it .
This , however , is not enough .
What modularity is really about is data encapsulation and information hiding .
The essential idea is that each module should take care of a particular sort of data , and that there should be no way of getting at that data except via the procedures provided by that module .
The implementation details of the data structures should be hidden .
There should be no way to call a procedure unless the module explicitly exports that procedure .
Most importantly , callers of a module should not need to know anything about the module except for the declarations and comments in its " visible " section .
It should be possible to develop a module without having any knowledge of the internal structure of any other module .
The advantages should be obvious .
At any given time a programmer need only be concerned with a short section of program - typically a few pages long - without having to worry about side - effects elsewhere in the program .
It is possible to work with complex data structures without having to worry about their internal detail .
It is possible to replace a module with a newer version - and this even includes the possibility of a complete overhaul of the way a data structure is implemented - without having to alter or re-check the other modules .
In a team programming situation , the coordination problems become a lot simpler .
If the hardware supports memory segmentation , then the data in each module are protected from accidental damage by other modules ( except to the extent to which pointers are passed as procedure parameters ) .
This makes errors easier to detect and to fix .
Even without hardware protection the incidence of programming errors is reduced , because error rates depend on program complexity , and a module a few pages long is far less complex than a monolithic hundred - page program .
Now , modular programming is possible in C , but only if the programmer sticks to some fairly rigid rules :
Exactly one header file per module .
The header should contain the function prototypes and typedef declarations to be exported , and nothing else ( except comments ) .
The comments in a header file should be all that an external caller needs to know about the module .
There should never be any need for writers to know anything about the module except what is contained in the header file .
Every module must import its own header file , as a consistency check .
Each module should contain # include lines for anything being imported from another module , together with comments showing what is being imported .
The comments should be kept up - to - date .
There should be no reliance on hidden imports which occur as a consequence of the nested #include lines which typically occur when a header file needs to import a type definition or a constant from elsewhere .
Function prototypes should not be used except in header files .
( This rule is needed because C has no mechanism for checking that a function is implemented in the same module as its prototype ; so that the use of a prototype can mask a " missing function " error . )
Every global variable in a module , and every function other than the functions exported via the header file , should be declared static .
The compiler warning " function call without prototype " should be enabled , and any warning should be treated as an error .
For each prototype given in a header file , the programmer should check that a non-private ( i.e. non-static , in the usual C terminology ) function with precisely the same name has its implementation in the same module .
( Unfortunately , the nature of the C language makes an automatic check impossible . )
Any use of grep should be viewed with suspicion .
If a prototype is not in the obvious place , that 's probably an error .
Ideally , programmers working in a team should not have access to one another 's source files .
They should share only object modules and header files .
And , what is worse , it takes only one programmer in a team to break the modularity of a project , and to force the rest of the team to waste time with grep and with mysterious errors caused by unexpected side - effects .
I believe it is well known that almost every programming team will include at least one bad programmer .
A modular programming language shields the good programmers from at least part of the chaos caused by the bad programmers .
C doesn't .
To complicate matters , it is easy even for good programmers to violate , by accident , the rules for proper modularity .
There is no mechanism in C for enforcing the rule that every prototype mentioned in a header file is matched by an implementation in the same module , or even for checking that the function names in the implementation module match those in the header file .
It is easy to forget to make internal functions private , since the default behaviour is back to front : the default is to make all functions exportable , whether or not a prototype is used .
It is easy , too , to lose track of what is being imported from where , because the crucial information is locked away in comments which the compiler does n't check .
The only way I know of for checking what is being imported is to comment out the #include lines temporarily , to see what error messages are produced .
In most modular programs , some or all modules will need an initialization section .
( You can't initialize data structures from outside the module , since they are n't supposed to be visible from outside the module . )
This means that the main program of a C program must arrange to call the initialization procedures in the correct order .
The correct order is bottom - up : if module MA depends on module MB , then module MB must be initialized before module MA .
Any language supporting modular programming will work this out for you , and perform the initialization in the correct order .
( It will also report circular dependencies , which in most cases reflect an error in overall program design . )
In C , you have to work this out by hand , which can be a tedious job when there are more than about a dozen modules .
In practice , I have found that it is almost impossible to avoid circular dependencies in a large C program , whereas I have rarely struck such dependencies in Modula - 2 programs .
The reason is that the Modula - 2 compiler / linker combination catches circularities at an early stage , before it has become too difficult to re-design the program .
In C , such errors do not show up until mysterious errors appear in the final testing .
The hazards of #include
I have often heard it said that the #include directive in C has essentially the same functionality as the IMPORT of Modula - 2 and similar languages .
In fact there is a profound difference , as I shall now attempt to show .
Consider a header file m2.h which contains the lines
#include < m1.h >
/* FROM m1 IMPORT stInfo */ void AddToQueue ( stInfo * p ) ;
( a ) some of the modules which import from m2 are compiled ;
( b ) as the result of a design change , the typedef defining stInfo in m1.h is altered ;
( c ) the remaining modules which import from m2 are compiled .
At this point , the overall program is in an inconsistent state , since some of the modules were compiled with an obsolete definition ; but the error will probably not be caught by the compiler or linker .
If you ever wondered why you keep having to do a " Compile All " in order to eliminate a mysterious bug , this is part of the reason .
The reason why this problem occurs in C , whereas it does not occur in languages designed for modular programming , is that a C header file is a pure text file , with no provision for containing a " last compiled " time or other mechanism for consistency checking .
( This is also why C compilers appear to be painfully slow when compared with , for example , a typical Modula - 2 compiler .
It usually takes longer to read a header file than it does to read a symbol file . )
Another nasty consequence of reading the header file literally is that information in the header file is treated as if it were in the file which contains the #include .
There is no " fire wall " around the header file .
Everything declared in one header file is automatically exported , in effect , to the header files mentioned in every following #include .
This can lead to obscure errors which depend on the order of the #include lines .
It also means that the effect of a header file is not under the full control of the person who wrote it , since its behaviour depends on what comes before it in the importing module .
Similar problems exist with other preprocessor directives , such as #define .
This point is not always fully understood : the effects of a # define persist through an entire compilation , including any included files .
There is no way in C to declare a local literal constant .
Have you ever had the experience of having the compiler report an error in a library function you 're not even calling , where the real error turns out to be a misplaced semicolon in some completely unrelated file ?
Such non-local effects make a mockery of modularity .
Another problem with #include is that it is an all - or - nothing proposition .
( This can be resolved by having multiple header files per module ; but that means putting the header files under the control of the importer , not the exporter , which creates the risk of undetected discrepancies between a module and its header file (s ) .
In any case , such a practice creates major headaches in terms of book - keeping and naming conventions . )
How many programmers read the whole of a header file before deciding to include it ?
Very few , I suspect .
The more likely situation is that the #include imports some names which the importer does n't know about .
This can be a disaster if , as sometimes happens , two functions happen to have the same name and the same parameter types .
( If you think this is unlikely , just think of the obsolete versions of software which are left around when you copy files from place to place . )
The compiler wo n't complain ; it will simply assume you were in an expansive mood and decided to write a function prototype twice .
The linker might complain , but you can't guarantee it .
As a result , it is possible to import a function which is different from the function you thought you were importing , and there is not necessarily any warning message .
Part of the problem here is that the mechanism by which the linker chooses which functions to link in has no connection with the mechanism by which the compiler checks function prototypes .
There is no way of specifying that a particular header file belongs to a particular module .
Note , too , that an unused prototype is never picked up as an error .
( This is another reason for insisting that prototypes be used only in header files , and nowhere else .
This does not solve the problem , but it reduces the amount of manual checking which has to be done . )
While this will not cause a program to run incorrectly , it adds to the confusion to be faced by future maintainers of the program .
The speed of program development
A claim that is often heard is that initial program development is fast in C because it is easy to get to the point of the " first clean compile " .
( This is also an argument which is popular with the BASIC enthusiasts . )
This property is contrasted with what happens with languages like Modula - 2 , where - it is said - a lot of forward planning is necessary before any progress is made on the coding .
The conclusion is that C programmers get more immediate feedback .
This argument is silly in at least three ways .
First , the claim relies at least partly on the fact that C compilers are more generous in accepting doubtful code than are compilers for higher - level languages .
Where is the virtue in that ?
If the compilation of code containing errors is seen as a significant step forward , you can get that in any language .
All you have to do is ignore the error messages .
Second , the " first clean compile " is a fairly meaningless measure of how far you have progressed .
It might be a significant milestone if you follow an approach to programming where the coding is not started until most of the design work has been completed , but not otherwise .
Under the " code , then debug " philosophy of programming , you still have most of your work ahead of you after the first compilation .
Finally , my own experience is that even the original statement is incorrect .
I find that I reach the " first clean compile " stage within the first few minutes of starting work .
This is because I prefer developing programs through stepwise refinement ( also known as top - down design combined with top - down coding ) .
The very first thing I compile consists of perhaps half a dozen lines of code , plus a couple of dozen lines of comments .
It is so short that it will compile without errors either immediately , or after discovering errors which are obvious and easy to repair .
What about the subdivision of a large program into modules ?
This takes a lot less forward planning than is commonly supposed .
With stepwise refinement , and with the philosophy that the function of a module is to look after a data type , one tends to discover what modules are needed as the program development proceeds .
Furthermore , true modularity makes it very easy to construct and test the program in stages , because of the property that changes in the internal details of a module can be made independently of what is happening outside that module .
In cases where I have kept a log of the time I have spent on a project , I have found that I spend about twice the time to get a C program working as to solve a problem of equivalent complexity using Modula - 2 .
The difference has nothing to do with typing speed - since the source files tend to be of about the same length - but in the time spent in debugging .
In Modula - 2 , the job is essentially complete once I have typed in the last module , and debuggers are rarely needed .
In C , a good debugger is indispensable .
To a project manager , this is a very important factor .
In a big project , the cost of paying the programmers is typically the second - biggest budget item ( after administrative overheads ) , and sometimes even the biggest .
A productivity difference of 50 % can make the difference between making a large profit or a large loss on the project .
Pointers : the GOTO of data structures
Despite all the advances which have been made in the theory and practice of data structures , pointers remain a thorn in everyone 's side .
Some languages ( e.g. Fortran , Lisp ) manage to get by without explicit pointers , but at the cost of complicating the representation of some data structures .
( In Fortran , for example , you have to simulate everything using arrays . )
For anyone working with almost any reasonably advanced application , it is hard to avoid the use of pointers .
This does not mean that we have to like them .
Pointers are responsible for a significant amount of the time spent on program debugging , and a large proportion of the complexity which makes program development difficult .
A major challenge for software designers in languages like Modula - 2 is to restrict the pointer operations to the low - level modules , so that people working with the software do n't have to deal with them .
A major , and largely unsolved , problem for language designers is to find mechanisms which save programmers the trouble of having to use pointers .
Having said that , one can also say that a distinction can be drawn between essential and inessential pointers .
An essential pointer , in the present context , is a pointer which is required in order to create and maintain a data structure .
For example , a pointer is needed to link a queue element to its successor .
( The language might or might not explicitly call it a pointer , but that is a separate issue .
Whatever the language , there must be some way of implementing the " find successor " operation . )
An inessential pointer is one which is not needed as part of implementing a data structure .
In a typical C program , the inessential pointers outnumber the essential pointers by a significant amount .
There are two reasons for this .
The first is that C traditions encourage programmers to create pointers even where equally good access methods already exist ; for example , for stepping through the elements of an array .
( Should we blame the language for the persistence of this bad habit ?
I do n't know ; I simply note that it is more prevalent among C programmers than among those who prefer other languages . )
The second reason is the C rule that all function parameters must be passed by value .
When you need the equivalent of a Pascal VAR parameter or an Ada inout parameter , the only solution is to pass a pointer .
This is a major contributor to the unreadability of C programs .
( To be fair , it should be admitted that C++ does at least provide a solution for this problem . )
The situation worsens when it becomes necessary to pass an essential pointer as an inout parameter .
In this case , a pointer to a pointer must be passed to the function , which is confusing for even the most experienced programmers .
Execution - time efficiency
There appears to be a widespread belief among C programmers that - because the language is close to machine language - a C program will produce more efficient object code than an equivalent program written in a high - level language .
I 'm not aware of any detailed study of this question , but I have seen the results of a few informal studies comparing Modula - 2 and C compilers .
The results were that the code produced by the Modula - 2 compilers was faster and more compact than that produced by the C compilers .
This should not be taken as a definitive answer , since the studies were not extensive enough , but it does indicate that C programs might not be as efficient as is generally thought .
I believe I 've also seen claims - although I can't recall the details at this distance in time - that C compilers produced better code than an assembly language programmer did .
I observed a similar phenomenon when testing my SGL compiler many years ago .
The reason in that case seemed to be that the compiler did a reasonably good job on things like register allocation , whereas one can suffer from lapses of concentration when having to concentrate too much on the fine detail .
The general rule seems to be that a high - level language compiler will out - perform a lower - level language compiler , mainly because the high - level language compiler has more scope for making decisions about how to generate the code .
If you do things in C like setting up a pointer to an array rather than using subscripts , you are taking that decision away from the compiler .
Your approach might produce more efficient code , but to be sure of that you have to know quite a lot about the instruction timings on the machine you are using , and about the code generation strategies of your compiler .
In addition , the decision is a non-portable one , potentially leading to major inefficiencies if you switch to another machine or another version of the compiler .
More importantly , the speed of a program tends to depend more on the global strategies adopted - what sort of data structures to use , what sorting algorithms to use , and so on - than the micro-efficiency issues related to precisely how each line of code is written .
When working in a low - level language like C , it becomes harder to keep track of the global issues .
It is true that C compilers produced better code , in many cases , than the Fortran compilers of the early 1970s .
This was because of the very close relationship between the C language and PDP - 11 assembly language .
( Constructs like * p++ in C have the same justification as the three - way IF of Fortran II : they exploit a special feature of the instruction set architecture of one particular processor . )
If your processor is not a PDP - 11 , this advantage is lost .
What about C++?
The language C++ is supposed to overcome some of the faults of C , and to a certain extent it does this .
It does , however , have two major drawbacks .
It is much more complex than it needs to be , which can lead programmers either to ignore the extended features or to use them in an inappropriate way .
The second problem is that the language tries to maintain compatibility with C , and in so doing retains most of the unsafe features .
This second problem means that most of the faults discussed in earlier sections are also faults of C ++.
Type checking is still minimal , and programmers are still permitted to produce weird and baroque constructs which are hard to read .
Strangest of all , there is still no support for modularity beyond the crude #include mechanism .
This is a little surprising : modular programming and object - oriented programming complement each other very nicely , and given all the effort that the designers of C++ must have had to put into the object - oriented extensions it is rather disappointing that they did not put in that slight extra effort which could have resulted in a major improvement to the language .
Some of the features related to object - oriented programming are complicated , and open to misuse by programmers who do not fully understand them .
For safety , I would prefer to see programmers learn object - oriented programming using a cleaner implementation ( e.g. Smalltalk , Modula - 3 ) before being let loose on C ++.
The ability to pass function parameters by reference is a definite bonus , but the mechanism chosen for doing this is unnecessarily messy .
The only motivation I can see for implementing it this way is to satisfy the Fortran programmers who miss the EQUIVALENCE construct .
Operator and function overloading is a mixed blessing .
In the hands of a competent programmer it can be a major virtue ; but when used by a sloppy programmer it could cause chaos .
I would feel happier about this feature if C++ compilers had some way to detect sloppy programmers .
If there is a discrepancy between a function and its prototype , is this an error , or is it a deliberate overloading ?
Most commonly it will be an error , but in some such cases the C++ compiler will make the optimistic assumption .
One has to be a little suspicious of a language improvement which increases the probability of undetected errors .
I 'm not yet sure how to feel about multiple inheritance .
It is powerful , in the same way that goto is powerful , but is it the sort of power we want ?
I have a nagging suspicion that at some time in the future our guidelines for " clean programming " will include a rule that object inheritance should always be restricted to single inheritance .
However , I 'm prepared to admit that the evidence is not yet in on this question .
In brief , C++ introduces some new problems without really solving the original problems .
The designers have opted to continue with the C tradition that " almost everything should be legal " .
In my view , this was a mistake .
Libraries vs. language features
One of the popular features of C++ is the large set of library functions which is usually distributed with it .
This is , indeed , a desirable feature , but it should not be confused with the inherent properties of the language .
Good libraries can be written for any language ; and in any case most reasonable compilers allow one to call " foreign " procedures written in other languages .
More generally , people sometimes say they like C because they like things like argc and argv , printf , and so on .
( I do n't - I 've had so much trouble with printf , sscanf , and the like that I 've been forced into writing alternative I/O formatting functions - but that 's a separate issue . )
In many cases , the functions they like , and point to as examples of " portable C " are peculiar to one particular compiler , and not even mentioned in whichever C standard they consider to be the standard standard .
The desirability or otherwise of various library routines is a legitimate subject for debate , but it is an issue separate from that of language properties .
There is just one way in which these functions differ as a result of genuine language differences from the procedures available with other languages , and that is the C rule which permits functions with variable numbers and types of parameters .
While this feature does have certain advantages , it necessarily involves a relaxation of type checking by the compiler .
I personally have wasted hours of valuable debugging time over things like printing out a long int with a format appropriate to an int , and then not being able to discover why my computations were producing the wrong value .
It would have been much faster , even if slightly more verbose , to call type - safe procedures .
Concluding remarks
Nothing in this document should be interpreted as a criticism of the original designers of C. I happen to believe that the language was an excellent invention for its time .
I am simply suggesting that there have been some advances in the art and science of software design since that time , and that we ought to be taking advantage of them .
I am not so naive as to expect that diatribes such as this will cause the language to die out .
Loyalty to a language is very largely an emotional issue which is not subject to rational debate .
I would hope , however , that I can convince at least some people to re-think their positions .
I recognise , too , that factors other than the inherent quality of a language can be important .
Compiler availability is one such factor .
Re-use of existing software is another ; it can dictate the continued use of a language even when it is clearly not the best choice on other grounds .
( Indeed , I continue to use the language myself for some projects , mainly for this reason . )
What we need to guard against , however , is making inappropriate choices through simple inertia .

Will writes this morning about the one issue that could derail the excitement over a possible White House run by former Senator Fred Thompson ; his support for McCain - Feingold :
In 1996 , Thompson worked successfully , unfortunately , to preserve the ( currently collapsing ) system of public financing of presidential campaigns .
His arguments were replete with all the rhetoric standard among advocates of government regulation of political speech : Government regulation of politics is necessary to dispel “ cynicism ” about government ( has that worked ? ) , to create a “ level playing field ” and to prevent politics from being “ awash with money ” ( Congressional Record , May 20 , 1996 ) .
In a news release that day he warned of money from “ special interests ” and asserted that the checkoff system “ flat out worked ” because in 1994 , 24 million taxpayers checked the “ yes ” box on their Form 1040 , thereby directing that $ 3 of their income tax bill go to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund .
He asserted that “ on average , 20 percent of Americans participate in the checkoff . ”
Well .
In 1994 , according to the IRS , the checkoff was used on 16.3 million , or 14 percent , of the 114.8 million individual tax returns , so a landslide of 86 percent of forms were filed by taxpayers who rejected participation .
Today , use of the checkoff has sunk to just 9.6 percent .
Its unpopularity is unsurprising , given that it has allowed a small minority to divert , in a bookkeeping dodge , $ 1.3 billion of federal revenue to fund the dissemination of political views that many taxpayers disapprove of as much as they disapprove of public funding of politics .
A blind man suffering déjà vu .
It sounds like a contradiction in terms - but the first case study of its kind has turned the whole theory of déjà vu on its head .
Traditionally it was thought images from one eye were delayed , arriving in the brain microseconds after images from the other eye - causing a sensation that something was being seen for the second time .
But University of Leeds researchers report for the first time the case of a blind person experiencing déjà vu through smell , hearing and touch .
The University is a world - leader in déjà vu research .
The ground - breaking work of the University 's Institute of Psychological Sciences has been widely published in both the scientific and the news media .
Their work is particularly aimed at understanding chronic déjà vu , where patients are constantly plagued by the feeling of having " been here before " .
In a new paper published in the journal Brain and Cognition* , researchers Akira O'Connor and Chris Moulin relate how mundane experiences - undoing a jacket zip while hearing a particular piece of music ; hearing a snatch of conversation while holding a plate in the school dining hall - were examples of how deja experiences were triggered in the blind subject .
" It is the first time this has been reported in scientific literature , " said O'Connor .
" It 's useful because it provides a concrete case study which contradicts the theory of optical pathway delay .
Eventually we would like to talk to more blind people , though there 's no reason to believe this man 's experiences are abnormal or different to those of others .
" Optical pathway delay is a quite antiquated theory , but still widely believed - and was the basis for the déjà vu sequences in Joseph Heller 's novel Catch - 22 .
But this provides strong evidence that optical pathway delay is not the explanation for déjà vu .
The findings are so obvious , so intuitive , that it 's remarkable this research has never been done before . "
O'Connor admits that to the person experiencing déjà vu , it feels almost inexplicable .
" And because it feels so subjective , psychology , in striving for objectivity , has tended to shy away from it .
But psychologists have gone some way to illuminating things like the ' tip of my tongue ' sensation when you can't think of a particular word .
We just wanted to get to the same sort of understanding for déjà vu . "
O'Connor 's thesis , due to be completed next year , examines the experimental induction of déjà vu through hypnosis .
" We now believe that deja experiences are caused when an area of the brain that deals with familiarity gets disrupted , " he said .
In one experiment , students are asked to remember words , then hypnotised to make them forget - and then shown the same word again to induce a feeling that they have seen it before .
Around half said this brought on a sensation similar to déjà vu - half of whom said it was definitely déjà vu .
O'Connor would like to take the research further : " It would be really neat to do some neuro - imaging on people during genuine spontaneous déjà vu experiences - but it 's very difficult to get them to have them on demand ... "

In summary , the shock model is a simple and intuitive model that is making use of both the production profile and the discovery curve .
In this essay , the method is applied on the world conventional crude oil production ( crude oil + condensate ) and the ASPO backdated discovery data .
Interestingly , the derived Reserve to Production ratio ( R/P ) seems to match the values obtained when using the proven reserve numbers ( BP ) once corrected for Middle - East spurious reserve revisions ( in 1985 , 1988 and 1990 ) .
In addition , R/ P values are presently at a record low levels and below what have been observed during the previous oil shocks .
WebHubbleTelescope , a long time TOD poster , has been one of the most active in the blogosphere in the area of oil production modeling .
He has advocated a more physically based approach instead of a heuristic curve fitting approach such as the Hubbert Linearization .
He proposed an original method , the so called Shock Model , that has a clear physical interpretation and that is making use of both the production profile and the discovery data .
I think that a review of the Shock Model is long overdue .
From Discovery to Reserves
The Shock Model is described in details on Mobjectivist .
It is based on the following three equations :
where : D Discovery ( backdated ) T Instantaneous gross reserve addition R Oil reserves E Extraction rate or shock function P Annual oil production h Build , h Fallow , h Mature Exponential functions
The first equation will create reserve additions from the initial discovery numbers ( backdated ) .
The second equation is the reserve evolution equation and dictates how reserves will change over time from the cumulative addition of new reserves and consumption .
The three filtering functions involved in the computation of the instantaneous reserve addition T ( t ) are exponential distribution functions where λ is the mean time period implied by each process .
The main reason behind this filtering process is to simulate the different steps ( Fallow , Build and Maturation ) involved in developing an oil field as shown on Figure 1 .
Fig 1 .
Timeframe for the development of an oil field1 .
The result of the three convolution operations is equivalent to one convolution with a Gamma distribution :
On Figure 2 , we can see an original discovery impulse is being spread out on a large time period .
Fig 2 .
The filtering operation by three successive Exponential distributions is equivalent to a Gamma distribution
The convolution by a Gamma function will smooth and shift the original discovery curve by 2 λ .
Using the ASPO backdated discovery curve ( Figure 3 ) , we get a shifted and smooth reserve curve .
Fig 3 . Effect of the succesive convolutions on the original backdated discovery curves ( ASPO ) .
The question is how to choose a correct value for λ.
WebHubbleTelescope is proposing λ =8 years .
Higher values for λ will increase the degree of smoothing and the time lag between peak discovery and peak reserves .
If you compare the simulated reserve curve with the actual proven reserve numbers ( Figure 4 ) , you can see that for λ=3 the reserve curve is matching closely the proven reserve numbers ( once corrected for Middle - East increase ) .
Fig 4 . Simulated oil reserves R for different values of λ .
Estimating the shock function
In reality , the extraction rate E is not a constant and presents large fluctuations especially during oil shocks .
In WHT 's original method , the shock function E(t ) is set manually which is not an easy task in my opinion .
I propose to estimate the shock function by literally tracking the instantaneous oil production using a bootstrap filter .
I have previously applied this technique with good results .
In a nutshell , the boostrap filter find the optimal value for E(t ) at each time t by stochastically exploring a set of possible values and weighting them according to how well observed production levels are predicted ( the technical term is Sequential Importance Resampling or SIR ) .
A result of this approach for λ=3 years is shown on Figure 5 , we can see how closely the production levels are reproduced by the model .
Fig 5 . World production for crude oil + condensate 2 .
The figure below is the estimated shock function E( t ) with the proposed technique .
The shock function is assumed constant in the future and equals to the last estimated value .
Fig 6 . Shock function E( t ) estimated by the bootstrap filter ( with λ= 3 years ) .

Forecasting ability
In my opinion , the model has limited predictive abilities because it cannot predict correctly future extraction rate values ( i.e. the shock function E is unknown in the future ) .
WHT has made the following prediction for crude oil + NGL .
Fig 7 .
World production forecast ( crude oil + NGL ) .
This forecast includes NGL production which I do n't think is appropriate because the model is based on conventional oil discoveries .
On Figure 8 , we can see the application of the shock model for different time intervals assuming that the extraction rate remains constant in the future and equals to the last estimated value .
Predicted production levels are falling immediately because E( t ) should increase in order to maintain or increase production .
In part II , I will propose a simple solution to deal with this problem .
Fig 8 .
Different world production forecasts for crude oil + condensate .
It 's interesting to compare the inverse of the estimated extraction rate ( 1/ E ( t ) ) , which is equal to the reserve to production ratio ( R/P ) , and fluctuations in nominal crude oil prices :
When R/P values are below 30 years , prices are increasing .
This was the case in 1970 at the time when demand for oil was very strong and energy efficiency not part of the vocabulary .
A lowering of consumption after 1985 ( mainly a combination of economic slowdown , energy conservation , drilling frenzy , ... ) has contributed in an increase in the R/P values .
The recent increase in price since 2003 corresponds also to current R/P values below the 30 years threshold minimum ( 27.6 years ) observed in the 70s .
The ASPO discovery data is probably underestimating some significant amount of reserve growth that has occured in the late 90s hence the premature fall of the simulated R/P curve around 2000 .
The R/P values given by the model are surprisingly closed to the R/P computed from proven reserves ( BP ) once corrected from large reserve additions in middle - east countries ( red circles ) .
In order for the R/ P value to come back above 30 years , either reserves need to increase significantly or crude oil consumption needs to decrease significantly .
Fig 9 .
Crude oil prices are inflation adjusted ( nominal prices ) .
The red dotted vertical line is the year 2007 .
In Part II , I will look at the modelisation of reserve growth and a new way to improve the predictive ability of the shock model .

I ’m getting heartily fed up of people banging on about Domain Specific Languages .
It seems that every time someone writes a Ruby library that uses class methods , symbols and hashes reasonably sensibly they get delusions of grandeur and call the result a Domain Specific Language ( or maybe an ‘ embedded ’ DSL ) .
In a sense , they ’re right , but it ’s a pretty compromised language simply because you ’re stuck with the Ruby parser .
Scheme and Lisp hackers probably look at ( say ) ActiveRecord and sneer .
Heck , even Perl programmers have grounds for getting their sneer on
Now , before any Ruby programmers go getting on their high horse about Perl programmers being indisciplined louts , may I refer you to Getopt : : Euclid , an alternative to Perl ’s Getopt : : Long library .
Getopt , or something like it , is pretty much a universal among programming languages .
It ’s the library that makes it ‘ easy ’ to write commandline programs with unix style switches .
It ’s often one of those functions that ends up taking an ugly argument string which defines all the possible flags your command could have .
As interfaces go , it ’s often actively user hostile - the argument string is a DSL , but it ’s one that took its design cues from the notorious sendmail.cf .
So , Damian Conway fixed it .
To use Getopt : : Euclid you just import the library and then write your command ’s documentation using Perl ’s inline POD with a couple of extra Euclidean extensions and you ’re done .
Getopt :: Euclid treats your documentation as its specification and builds its option parser from that .
Now that ’s what I call a DSL .
Entirely embedded in the Domain Specific ( natural ) Language of documenting a command line program .
Damian ’s a genius at this sort of thing .
Check out List :: Maker , where he finds a little used part of perl ’s syntax and wedges in a bunch of cunning ways of building lists , including something that looks remarkably like list comprehensions .
And this is in Perl 5 ; the version of the language that does n’t have explicity support for syntax modification .
Another example of the kind of thing that ’s possible without monkeying with the parser is the stuff Jifty ( originally JFDI ) , in particular the way Jifty Schemas work .
What ’s my point ?
I ’m not saying do n’t take the time to make your interfaces ‘ language like ’ .
However , there ’s a lot to be learned from the way other languages have approached the idea of the DSL or ‘ little ’ language .
Implementing something like Jifty ’s Schema ’s in Perl is far from easy ( though the techniques needed are getting better understood all the time ) and involve ferreting around in dusty corners of an already arcane syntax , but the beauty of getting it right is that you simply do n’t have to care about how its implemented .
The neat bit , the bit that ’s worth pinching is the syntax of the resulting DSLs …
Oh yes , and , while you ’re about it , take a look at what Why the Lucky Stiff is doing with hpricot , definitely one of those libraries that goes out of its way to make life easy for its users .
WASHINGTON , D.C. , May 15 , 2007  --
After a frustrating search for a new " war czar " to oversee the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , ABC News has learned that President Bush has chosen the Pentagon 's director of operations , Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute , for the role .
Watch " World News With Charles Gibson " at 6:30 p.m. EDT for more on this story
In the newly created position of assistant to the president and deputy national security adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan policy and implementation , Lute would have the power to direct the Pentagon , State Department and other agencies involved in the two conflicts .
Lute would report directly to the president and to National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley .
Filling the position had become a priority for the White House , after a handful of retired generals told the White House they did not want the job .
Among them , retired Marine Corps four - star Gen. Jack Sheehan , who proved an embarrassment to the White House after he wrote an op - ed piece in the Washington Post saying there were " huge shortcomings " in the White House view of the strategy in Iraq .
" What I found in discussions with current and former members of this administration , " wrote Sheehan , " is that there is no agreed upon strategic view of the Iraq problem or the region . "
Lute is a widely respected officer , but is by no means a high - profile player in Washington .
Before assuming his position at the Pentagon , he was the director of operations for Central Command while Gen. John Abizaid was the commander .
A West Point graduate who holds a masters degree from Harvard University , Lute also fought in Operation Desert Storm in the 1991 Gulf War .
Lute must gain congressional approval before he can assume the position .
He 'll likely have two deputies -- one for policy ( a civilian ) , one for implementation ( an officer ) .

One of the easiest and best tasting ways of enjoying fruit in the summer is to make a crisp .
They are also good for using up less than perfect fruit .
I 've been making at least one crisp a week this summer , starting with apricots , then sunset coloured mixes of apricots and plums , then peaches .
The latest amazing local fruit to turn up at the markets has been bunches of very round and purple seedless grapes .
They are eaten by squeezing them out of their sour skins and have a deep grape flavour .
I 've never made anything with cooked grapes before but wanted to try them in a crisp .
Making a crisp is more of a technique than a recipe : peel and chop fruit into the pan ; add a little sweetener ; add minute tapioca to thicken ; make and sprinkle the topping ; bake .
I do n't use a lot of sugar for either the filling or the topping ; it is meant to be a breakfast or snack , not dessert .
I peeled a large bunch of grapes into a glass pan ( 8X8 pan would work ) and drizzled them with 2 tbs honey .
I figured I had about three and a half cups of filling plus juice , so stirred in two heaping tablespoons of minute tapioca .
The grapes were really juicy so I put them in the oven to bake for ten minutes at 350 degrees , covered with foil .
( If your filling is too juicy when you put on the topping , the topping will sink into it . )
Meanwhile I rubbed together the crisp topping .
An estimate of the ingredients : 1 cup flour , 1 / 2 cup large flake oatmeal , 2 tbs icing sugar , 2 tbs butter , 1/2 tsp salt .
I took the crisp , which was starting to thicken , out of the oven , sprinkled the topping over the surface and returned the pan to the oven to bubble away for another ten minutes .
A perfect - consistency crisp is when the filling just starts to bubble over the sides , like so .

While working on the ZIPScribble map , I started to wonder how to untangle the beautifully scribbly lines , and finding the shortest path through all ZIP codes .
In computer science , this is called the Travelling Salesman Problem ( TSP ) , and so I decided to make this the Travelling Presidential Candidate Map .
The TSP is a very hard problem to solve , and would have taken forever for the over 37000 points on the map , even when using a very efficient algorithm .
So I had the idea of using a Hilbert curve to get an approximation .
A Hilbert curve is a recursive space - filling curve that provides a linear path through all locations in a square .
Here is one level of it , in the next level each line segment is replaced by a more coplex curve , etc .
I was not the first one to have the idea of using a Hilbert curve for this task , and the existing work shows that this solution is typically only 75 % optimal .
But that is good enough for my purposes , and it proved quick enough to implement and run a rather naive implementation of ( about 10 minutes on a 1.67GHz Apple PowerBook ) .
( Travelling Presidential Candidate Map PDF )
The Travelling Presidential Candidate Map ( TPC ) does not look nearly as interesting as the ZIPScribble .
There are hardly any crossing lines , which makes the image appear a lot lighter and less interesting .
It also loses quite a bit of the information in the original map , which nicely showed the borders between clusters of ZIP codes , which also defined state borders .
( Travelling Presidential Candidate Map Color PDF )
It does gain from adding more information though , like coloring the states .
Its slightly flimsy appearance does not change , however .
The thin lines also make it harder to see the colors , especially in the small “ thumbnails ” on this page .

Finally , the map with the added borders to better see where the path crosses state lines .
This is not quite as interesting as with the ZIPScribble map , since there are no emergent patterns , but still .
( Travelling Presidential Candidate Map Color with Names PDF )
This map is a lot more technical and lacks the slightly artsy appearance of the ZIPScribble Map .
It does gain from added information , quite in contrast to the other one .
The path through all ZIP codes is – not surprisingly – not all that interesting .
If you are running for president , you might find it useful , though .
After a comment below , I calculated the actual savings of the TPC Map as compared to the standard ZIPScribble Map .
If you are a scientist working for private industry , it helps to invent something useful .
But if you 're a scientist trying to get funding from the government , you 're better off telling the world how horrible things are .
And once people are scared , they pay attention .
They may even demand the government give you more money to solve the problem .
In the late ' 80s and early '90s , the media used a few small studies of babies born of cocaine - addicted mothers to convince America that thousands of children were permanently damaged .
Dr. Ira Chasnoff , of the National Association for Perinatal Addiction Research and Education , after studying only 23 babies , reported that mothers were delivering babies who " could not respond to them emotionally . "
He told People magazine the infants " could n't respond to a human voice . "
This led to a frenzy of stories on " crack babies . "
Many people still believe " crack babies " are handicapped for life .
It is n't true .
It turns out there is no proof that crack babies do worse than anyone else .
In fact , they do better , on average , than children born of alcoholic mothers .
Nevertheless , Rolling Stone told us these children were " like no others . "
They were " automatons , " " oblivious to affection , " and " the damage does n't go away . "
Education magazines warned that soon these children would reach the schools , which would be unable to control them .
It was terrifying news — thousands of children likely to grow up wild and dangerous .
It was n't until several years later that the myth started to unravel .
Emory University psychologist Claire Coles had her graduate students spend hours observing " crack babies " and normal babies .
Her students did not see what Chasnoff had seen .
In fact , they could n't tell which children had been exposed to cocaine .
Coles told me , " They could n't really tell whether they were looking at the effects of cocaine or the effects of alcohol or the effects of poverty , and everybody ignored that .
They just said , ' This is cocaine . ' "
How could that happen ?
" Well , " Coles said , " they wanted to get published . "
It is easier to get your work published , and , more importantly , funded by the taxpayers , if you find something dramatic .
Coles said , " If you go to an agency and say , ' I do n't think there 's a big problem here , I 'd like you to give me $ 1 million , ' the probability for getting the money is very low . "
It 's also easier to get funded if what you conclude feeds someone 's political agenda .
The idea of crack babies was perfect .
It met the needs of liberals and conservatives .
Conservatives wanted to demonize cocaine users .
Liberals wanted more money for social programs .
When Dr. Coles dared suggest that crack babies were not permanently damaged , she was attacked by politicians , called incompetent , accused of making data up or advocating drug abuse .
Dr. Chasnoff , who helped start the scare , did not receive similar criticism .
After his scare was shown to have been exaggerated , he denied that he had pushed any agenda : " Neither I nor any of my colleagues were ever pushing junk science .
Is everything we thought then — do we know that every bit of that is correct now ?
Well , obviously , the answer is no .
But that 's the process of science . "
He said People and Rolling Stone exaggerated the implications of his research — took him " out of context . "
Perhaps .
Journalists hype risks constantly .
But Chasnoff did n't ask the magazines to correct or clarify their reports .
So people continued expecting the crack babies — the real human beings who had to grow up with that label — to be walking disasters .
Next time you hear dire " scientific " warnings — and demands to surrender more control over your life to the government in order to avert disaster — remember the crack babies .
The only disaster coming may be an activist - induced panic .
Think about that when you hear dire predictions about global warming or avian flu .

One paper said Iranians ' ancestors were shown as " dumb savages "
The Hollywood film , which has broken US box office records , is a retelling of a battle in which a small Greek army resisted a Persian invasion .
Javad Shamaqdari , a cultural advisor to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said it was " plundering Iran 's historic past and insulting this civilization " .
He branded the film " psychological warfare " against Tehran and its people .
But Iranian culture was strong enough to withstand the assault , Mr Shamaqdari insisted .
" American cultural officials thought they could get mental satisfaction by plundering Iran 's historic past and insulting this civilization , " he said .
" Following the Islamic Revolution in Iran , Hollywood and cultural authorities in the US initiated studies to figure out how to attack Iranian culture .
" Certainly , the recent movie is a product of such studies . "
Daily newspaper Ayandeh - No carried the headline " Hollywood declares war on Iranians " .
The film achieved the best ever March opening in North America
Three MPs in the Iranian parliament have also written to the foreign ministry to protest against the production and screening of this " anti-Iranian Hollywood film " .
The film has already proved a major box office hit in the US where it earned almost $ 71 m ( £ 36.8 m ) in its first weekend , making it the best ever March opening in North American cinemas .
This is not the first time Iran has protested over its portrayal in films made in the West .
There was outrage over the 2004 epic Alexander which showed the Macedonian general easily conquering the Persian Empire .
First , I want to thank everyone for the input into my hypothesis for the Stages of Rightie Reaction to a Republican Scandal .
I definitely want to re-work this into something more ambitious .
If anyone knows a good cartoonist / illustrator , chase ’em my way .
Along these lines , I want to share with you this charming email received this morning from Greg S. :
How come , as a journalist , you failed to report that Janet Reno demanded the resignations of all federal prosecutors ?
The NYT ran the story on 3/23/93 .
I guess itâ€™s only political when a Republican culls the herd .
You should have no problem getting a job in the New York area .
You bozoâ€™s all think and act alike , Iâ€™m sure some going out of business newspaper will pick you up .
Here is my response :
Greg :
How come you ca n’t read ?
I ’ve brought up the Janet Reno episode several times in the past few weeks .
The last time I mentioned it was yesterday , in this post .
I also brought it up on March 9 in this post .
I wrote about it extensively in these posts , which I urge you to read : January 18 : ” U.S. Attorneys :
It ’s the Replacing , Stupid ”
In the post linked I dug some stories from 1993 about Janet Reno ’s firing of the attorneys out of the New York Times archives and quoted from them at length .
You really should read it and educate yourself about what really happened , because you are embarrassing yourself by being ignorant of the facts .
February 16 : “ Drooling Idiot Alert ”
The “ drooling idiot ” post was inspired by a comment I had received from some other pea-brain rightie who demanded to know why I did n’t report that Janet Reno had asked for the resignation of all federal prosecutors .
What was hysterically funny about that was that the drooling idiot had made this comment to a post in which I had extensively discussed Janet Reno ’s firing of the attorneys .
BTW , why is it you righties all have the reading comprehension level of gnats ?
I also mentioned the Janet Reno episode on January 19 .
You can apologize to me whenever you ’re ready .
Of course , he ’s not going to apologize .
He ’ll slink off somewhere , whining that I was mean to him .
Righties are so pathetic .
But this encounter made me think about where this kind of reaction falls on the “ reaction ” scale .
It ’s so typical I definitely need to work it in somewhere .
As I have explained at great length already , it is standard procedure for a new administration to ask for the resignations of the the former president ’s attorneys , particularly if the former president was from the other party .
U.S. attorneys serve for four - year terms , so as a rule when a new administration begins their terms are about to expire , anyway .
George W. Bush asked for the resignations of most of Clinton ’s attorneys , and replaced them with his own appointees , in 2001 .
[ Update : I just found this paragraph in an Associated Press story —
When the party in the White House changes hands , it is common for the new president to fire all the sitting U.S. attorneys , as Ronald Reagan did in 1981 and Bill Clinton in 1993 .
By contrast , Bush allowed some to stay on the job for several months when he took office in 2001 , although all were replaced eventually .
In 1993 , the Dems should have been shrieking “ Reagan did it , too ! ” ]
As I have said before , replacing U.S. attorneys is not , in itself , scandalous .
However , as explained at length in the posts linked above , the circumstances surrounding the recent replacements make these replacements grossly unethical if not illegal .
The Right Wing Noise Machine raised a huge stink when Janet Reno made the very routine and long anticipated request for the resignation of the Republican - appointed attorneys , which was all of them .
( The Clinton Administration , for some reason , allowed one prosecutor to stay over — Michael Chertoff .
Very weird .
There ’s probably a story behind that . )
The Machine pretended there was something sinister about the firing of the attorneys and accused Bill Clinton of getting rid of all of them just to interfere with an investigation of Rep. Dan Rostenkowski .
( The investigation was not stopped ; Rostenkowski would be indicted in 1994 . )
This huge stink was just part of their ongoing campaign to smear , bash , discredit , and destroy the Clinton Administration any way it could , honest or dishonest .
The Right ’s knuckle - dragging followers dutifully got all worked up about it , and we see now that many of them still are .
ABC News is reporting that Senator Hillary Clinton is calling for the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
Righties who reacted with “ nyah nyah Clinton did it to ” ( Stage 4 ) include : Macsmind ( who , remarkably , somehow connects the U.S. attorneys to then - First Lady Clinton ’s health care proposals ) , Gateway Pundit , Betsy Newmark , and the Wall Street Journal editorial page .
Congratulations to the first three for being brainless stooges , and to WSJ for so diligently doing its job as a propaganda machine .
A clue about how these replacings are different — the Seattle Times reports today :
Former Washington state Republican Party Chairman Chris Vance acknowledged Tuesday that he contacted then - U.S. Attorney John McKay to inquire about the status of federal investigations into the 2004 governor ’s race while the outcome was still in dispute .
Vance also spoke regularly with presidential adviser Karl Rove ’s aides about the election , which Democrat Christine Gregoire ultimately won by 129 votes over Republican Dino Rossi .
But Vance said he does n’t recall discussing with the White House McKay ’s performance or Republicans ’ desires for a formal federal investigation .
… …
Vance is one of at least two Republican officials who called McKay to inquire about a possible investigation by his office into the governor ’s race . …
… Vance said he felt compelled to approach McKay as a fellow Republican .
“ Republican activists were furious because they felt that you had a Republican secretary of state [ Sam Reed ] , a Republican county prosecutor in Norm Maleng and a Republican U.S. attorney , but still they saw the governorship slipping away , and they were just angry , ” Vance said .
Combine that story with this March 7 story from the Seattle Post - Ingelligencer , and it ’s hard not to conclude that McKay ’s firing was punishment for not convening a grand jury and seeking indictments against Democrats in the Gregoire election .
McKay says he could n’t find enough evidence of voter fraud to convene a grand jury ; apparently , that was no excuse .
From an editorial in today ’s New York Times :
Among the documents is e-mail sent to Ms. Miers by Kyle Sampson , Mr. Gonzalesâ€™s chief of staff , ranking United States attorneys on factors like â€œexhibited loyalty .
â€ Small wonder , then that United States Attorney Carol Lam of San Diego was fired .
She had put one Republican congressman , Duke Cunningham , in jail and had opened an inquiry that put others at risk , along with party donors .
More disturbing details have come out about Mr. Iglesiasâ€™s firing .
We knew he was ousted six weeks after Senator Pete Domenici , Republican of New Mexico , made a wildly inappropriate phone call in which he asked if Mr. Iglesias intended to indict Democrats before last Novemberâ€™s election in a high - profile corruption scandal .
We now know that Mr. Domenici took his complaints to Mr. Bush .
After Mr. Iglesias was fired , the deputy White House counsel , William Kelley , wrote in an e-mail note that Mr. Domeniciâ€™s chief of staff was â€œhappy as a clam.â€ 
Another e-mail note , from Mr. Sampson , said Mr. Domenici was â€ œnot even waiting for Iglesiasâ€™s body to coolâ€ before getting his list of preferred replacements to the White House . …
… The Justice Department has been saying that it is committed to putting Senate - confirmed United States attorneys in every jurisdiction .
But the newly released documents make it clear that the department was making an end run around the Senate â€ ” for baldly political reasons .
Congress should broaden the investigation to determine whether any other prosecutors were forced out for not caving in to political pressure â€ ” or kept on because they did .
There was , for example , the decision by United States Attorney Chris Christie of New Jersey to open an investigation of Senator Bob Menendez just before his hotly contested re-election last November .
Republicans , who would have held the Senate if Mr. Menendez had lost , used the news for attack ads .
Then there was the career United States attorney in Guam who was removed by Mr. Bush in 2002 after he started investigating the superlobbyist Jack Abramoff .
The prosecutor was replaced .
The investigation was dropped .
In mid-December 2006 , Mr. Gonzalesâ€™s aide , Mr. Sampson , wrote to a White House counterpart that using the Patriot Act to fire the Arkansas prosecutor and replace him with Mr. Roveâ€™s man was risky â€ ” Congress could revoke the authority .
But , he wrote , â€ œif we donâ€™t ever exercise it , then whatâ€™s the point of having it ?â€ 
Sort of how I ’m feeling about impeachment power these days .
Update : McClatchy Newspapers explains —
Mass firings of U.S. attorneys are fairly common when a new president takes office , but not in a second - term administration .
Prosecutors are usually appointed for four - year terms , but they are usually allowed to stay on the job if the president who appointed them is re-elected .
Even as they planned mass firings by the Bush White House , Justice Department officials acknowledged it would be unusual for the president to oust his own appointees .
Although Bill Clinton ordered the wholesale removal of U.S. attorneys when he took office to remove Republican holdovers , his replacement appointees stayed for his second term .
Ronald Reagan also kept his appointees for his second term .
… … Nonetheless , Bush aide Dan Bartlett noted Clinton ’s first term firings in defending Bush ’s second term dismissals .
“ Those discretionary decisions made by a president , by an administration , are often done , ” he told reporters Tuesday .

> dice = sum [ 1/36 .* return ( i , j ) | i This corresponds to the usual distribution you expect from rolling two dice .
As we know , under normal circumstances , the outcome of one die is does n't depend on the other - in other words they are independent .
We can express this independence mathematically as follows .
First make the distribution for one die : > die = sum [ 1/6 .* return i | i
Now we can write code to make two independent die rolls : > two_rolls = do > a b return ( a , b ) We find that dice = two_rolls .
We can make this more generic by defining a joint distribution as follows : > tensor dist1 dist2 = do > a b return ( a , b ) So tensor die die = dice .
( This operation is actually a tensor product . )
So now we can give a definition : if we have a distribution on ( a , b ) , then the first and second components are said to be independent if the distribution can be written as tensor dist1 dist2 for some choice of dist1 and dist2 .
But so far I 've only been talking about the probability monad .
What about the quantum monad Q ?
In that case the notion is almost identical , except the language is inverted .
In that case , a distribution on ( a , b ) is said to be entangled if it can't be written as tensor state1 state2 .
Despite all of the mystification in the popular literature , that 's all it means .
So why is entanglement important ?
One of the key ideas is this .
Suppose we have a process that acts only one one part of a combined system .
In other words , consider something like this : > apply_part f x = do > ( a , b ) b ' return ( a , b ' )
If the two subcomponents are independent ( or unentangled ) so that x = tensor dist1 dist2 then apply_part f x = tensor dist1 ( dist2 >>= f ) .
In other words , if we 're dealing with a distribution like tensor dist1 dist2 , and we 're interested in studying operations on the second component , then we can completely ignore the first component during the process .
> coin = 0.75 .* return True + 0.25 .* return False > f x = 0.125 .* return x + 0.875 .* return ( not x ) > ex1 = collect ( tensor coin ( coin >>= f ) ) > ex2 = collect ( apply_part f ( tensor coin coin ) ) ex1 = ex2 .
Now suppose we have a combined system consisting of two parts : some subsystem , and its environment , ie .
something of type ( Environment , Subsystem ) .
Then as long as the environment and the subsystem are independent , we can study the subsystem as if the environment were n't there .
But now suppose information can ' leak ' out from the subsystem .
For example consider a process like : > a `xor` b = a /=b > process x = do > ( e , s ) let e' = e `xor` s > return ( e ' , s ) Because there is some flow from s to e' , there is no guarantee that process x has independent subparts .
As a result , we can no longer treat s as an independent subsystem , and theorems that are true about an independent s no longer hold .
For example , define : > rotate :: Float -> Bool -> Q Bool > rotate theta
True = let theta ' = theta :+ 0 > in cos ( theta ' / 2 ) .* return
True - sin ( theta ' /2 ) .* return False > rotate theta
False = let theta ' = theta :+ 0 > in cos ( theta ' / 2 ) .* return False + sin ( theta ' /2 ) .* return True
We know that return True >>= rotate ( pi/10 ) >>= rotate ( - pi/10 ) gives us back the state we started with .
Similarly , with > pure x = do > ( a , b ) b' b'' return ( a , b' ' ) pure acts as the identity on the second component .
In particular , pure ( e , True ) is the same as tensor e ( return True ) because the terms involving false cancel out .
But if we have a ' leak ' as in : > impure x = do > ( a , b ) b' a ' b'' return ( a ' , b' ' ) and consider impure ( e , True ) we end up with something where the False terms do n't cancel out .
Compare collect $ pure $ return ( False , False ) with collect $ impure $ return ( False , False ) .
We 're familiar with the idea that something flowing into a system might mess it up .
But here we have the situation that information flowing out of a physical system can also mess it up .
Any kind of entanglement between a system and its environment is called decoherence .
And what I 've shown is that interactions between a system and its environment can cause a physical system to ' decohere ' , even if the direction of interaction appears to be only outwards .
And that 's one reason why quantum computing is so hard .
Not only must nothing in the environment affect our qubits , neither must any information about our qubits leave the system before we 're ready to have them do so .
Anyway , now I 'm equipped to start writing code to simulate quantum error correction ...
Update : Tried to reuse some of this code and found a bug which I 've now fixed .
Sorry if this pops it to the front of various feeds .
It 's an old post .
Labels : haskell , physics , quantum
Before I can do anything more sophisticated with my code for probability theory and quantum mechanics I need to talk about a couple of related subjects - independence and entanglement .
Again , I 'm using the fact that formally , quantum mechanics is almost identical to probability theory , to kill two birds with one stone .
So firstly , here 's the probability / quantum code that I need from before :
Now consider this probability distribution :
Laaaaadies and Gentlemen !
Welcome to the Main Event !
In corner one we have the 6 time champion " The FCC " and in corner two we have the underdog " The FAA . "
Fighters , bow to each other ; I want a clean fight .
Ready ?
Set ?
Fight !
Just over six months ago the FCC lifted its ban on wireless device usage while in flight .
However , it was understood that the FAA would still have to reverse its ban as well .
The decision has been made and the FAA will not reverse its ban , at least not entirely .
The wireless devices being discussed here range from cell phones and Blackberries to WiFi .
Currently the only option for in - flight communication available from most airlines is over - priced satellite phones that are n't exactly the cream of the crop when it comes to clarity .
Want to check your email ?
Too bad , you 'll just have to wait until you land in London ... in thirteen hours .
Why are these devices banned ?
The FCC had originally implemented the ban because of the risk of interference between the devices and crucial on - board systems such as navigation and communications .
Nobody wants to end up in the middle of the ocean just because your friend had to SMS you and tell you about how you missed Jenny kissing Tommy at the park earlier that day .
However , as these devices mature and proliferate two things have become obvious .
The first being that the interference risks are either not as bad as once thought or the device manufacturers are finding new ways of reducing the risk .
The second is that the demand for wireless is continuing to grow .
Joe Schmoe wants the ability to wirelessly email his / her friends to tell them that he / she is floating 30,000 feet above the earth and is sitting next to a really annoying overweight woman in a funny puse shirt .
However , even with those two items in mind , the FAA still does n't feel it 's safe to lift the ban on all devices .
They will only lift bans on devices that are proven to not cause any negative effects to communications and navigation systems .
" If an air carrier is willing to take the time and incur the expense of testing and verifying that the cell phone usage presents no in - flight interference problems , our rules allow an air carrier to permit such devices , " Nicholas Sabatini , associate administrator for aviation safety said .
Why this falls into the laps of individual corporations is beyond me .
The FAA is tasked with keeping the public safe while flying , so why are they relying on the individual airlines to get involved ?
Does the FBI make civilians track down federal criminals and then make the arrest once the hard work is done ?
No , so the FAA 's approach seems like a cop-out .
With that being said , the FAA has allowed certain equipment to be tested in production flights in a limited scope .
United Airlines was given permission to install the Boeing Connexion WiFi system on their Boeing 757 aircraft .
The purpose of the Connexion system is to give passengers in - flight internet access .
Sabatini warned that going through the testing cycle is rather challenging because of the constant changing cellphone technology and increasingly complex navigation systems ( the FAA is moving everyone to satellite navigation . )
And of course we can't forget about the ever - present annoyance factor .
Imagine all the endless " hey , I 'M ON A PLANE " phone calls you 'll have the pleasure of listening to every flight ; absolute heaven for the likes of Dom Joly .
mcjoan mentioned it in today 's Midday Open Thread , and diarist Troutfishing has linked to the video of John McCain singing " Bomb bomb bomb , bomb bomb Iran , " ( to the tune of the Beach Boys ' " Barbara Ann " ) .
I was hoping the story was a joke .
It was n't .
Here 's the video :
Yeah , this man really needs to have his finger on the button .
NOT .
SAO PAULO ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict ’s hard - nosed defense of traditional teachings on his first visit to Latin America inspired conservatives but critics said he was out of touch with reality in a region where the Church is losing influence and followers .
The 80 - year - old Pope railed against premarital sex , abortion rights and the rise of Pentecostalism during his five days in Brazil , the world ’s largest Roman Catholic country .
To expand the Church , bishops must return to traditional proselytizing and resist temptations to offer flashy services to young people or support leftist politics in a region plagued by poverty , he said .
Conservatives commended the Pope for restoring purity to the Church ’s principles , even if it meant alienating potential newcomers .
His detractors called him hopelessly out of touch in a time of globalization , gay marriage and AIDS .
“ The Catholic population in Latin America will continue to disagree with church norms that are impossible to put into practice -- like not using condoms or having premarital sex , ” said Maria Jose Rosado - Nunes , professor of sociology at Sao Paulo ’s Catholic University .
Brazil ’s government hands out millions of free condoms each year to help prevent the spread of AIDS under a program lauded by the United Nations .
The Catholic Church tells young people they should practice abstinence -- a stance critics call dangerous and unrealistic .
“ The position of the Church on the use of condoms is criminal , ” Fernando de Barros e Silva , a columnist for the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper , said on Monday .
The Pope ’s efforts to reinforce traditional values could push even more people out of the Church in Latin America , home to almost half of the world ’s Catholics , but conservatives said commitment to the Church ’s roots is more important than the number of faithful .
“ He does n’t worry about a marketing strategy that will greatly increase the number of Catholics , but instead a qualitative improvement in the fidelity to Church teachings , ” the conservative newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo said in an editorial .
Most bishops said the Pope , who ended his visit on Sunday night , correctly upheld long - established Church positions and that his message , though stern , was one of peace and love .
“ Nothing that the Pope said should be interpreted as arm twisting , but instead as a kiss for Latin America , ” said Bishop Antonio Celso Queiroz of Sao Paulo state .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , who met the Pope twice during his stay , avoided discussing the sensitive issue of abortion rights but liked his message about fighting poverty .
“ The Pope showed a great amount of concern about the social problems of Brazil , and he spoke out on several occasions against criminality , violence , and the social abandonment to which the poor of the world are subjected , ” Lula said in his weekly radio address on Monday .
“ So I think his behavior was very dignified , and I would say it was beneficial for us , the Brazilian people . ”
These are some vital issues you should look at based on the information on the site sacramentocreditrepair.com to avoid tricky credit repair organizations .
The office you ’re thinking about ought to have participation in the Ethical Consumer Research Association ( ECRA ) or a comparable administrative association .
You are regularly encouraged to pick organizations that are bought into the BBB ( Better Business Bureau ) when you are searching for a company .
When you ’re hunting down great credit repair associations , organizations who are ECRA individuals are an astounding decision .
This body has its own particular stringent sets of principles and any business that gets their endorsement will give you their best companies .
The individuals from this association are required to keep up the most astounding moral benchmarks in managing their customers .
This ensures you , the shopper , from unscrupulous and sub-standard practices .
Before searching for help , instruct yourself concerning what credit repair is about .
A great many people who are bamboozled out of their well - deserved cash while they are searching routes out of money related stick , do n’t know anything about what repair of credit includes .
You have to realize what these companies can improve the situation you and what they ca n ’t do .
You can recognize offices who offer false guarantees just when you unmistakably comprehend this distinction .
For instance , nobody can evacuate negative comments entered on your credit report if these can be confirmed .
You will discover numerous such credit repair organizations disclosing to you that they can give you a perfect credit report inside a month or less .
Think deliberately ; is this lawfully conceivable ?
If not – and it plainly is n’t – would regardless you need to seek such unscrupulous strategies ?
Maintain a strategic distance from spontaneous offers you get through email .
It ’s not destiny that sent you an email offering to repair your credit when you are urgently searching for help .
These are false organizations that acquire your email address through different deceptive strategies , and are conveying a great many spam messages with the expectation that they will “ get ” some penniless soul whom they can drain dry !
Be careful with such messages .
In 99.9 percent of cases , these are false organizations searching for their next casualty .
Appropriate credit repair organizations will send their offers through bulletins or messages simply after you have picked in to get them .
It is unlawful to make “ another personality . ”
This is one tremendous false notion that numerous individuals accept , essentially because it would appear to tackle every one of their issues .
This conviction is expected essentially to an absence of learning about credit repair .
Be that as it may , this training – called “ Document isolation ” – is illicit !
Your FICO assessment is an impression of your whole monetary history up to the present time .
How is it conceivable to secure “ another ” financial record ?
What ’s more ,
If you do , would you not have a few inquiries regarding legitimateness ?
Do you understand now that the credit repair organizations that offer you such an exit from your issues are fakes ?
Requesting complete installment forthright should raise a “ warning . ”
As per Government Law , you need a natty gritty composed contract with the office
Previously and the installment is to be after companies have been finished .
What ’s more , you have the privilege to cross out inside three days .
There are organizations that do charge an underlying expense for a credit investigation , and from that point , charge month to month expenses as they proceed with the activity of catching up with a question in regards to mistaken data in your credit report .
If a company requests their whole expense be paid ahead of time , they are likely doing as such because they understand you wo n’t be slanted to pay later when you find that they ca n’t convey on their guarantees .
Such organizations are deceitful , and you would do well to dodge them !
Repairing your FICO assessment and credit report requires some serious energy .
As talked about previously , a credit company can’t repair your credit overnight by any legitimate means , nor evacuate anything in your record as a consumer if that it is confirmed by the credit agencies .
Ideally : it will take around two , perhaps three months to unravel the less difficult issues , by having off base data erased from your credit report , and by changing your budgetary propensities by reliably paying bills and obligations in an opportune way .
More huge things ( for instance , repossessions , dispossessions and so on . ) well , even given the absolute best budgetary company , stay on the report for a long time .
Insolvencies will remain on the report for a long time .
“ Ensures ” that these can be expelled overnight demonstrate misrepresentation .
No agreement , no compensation !
Many individuals could abstain from being duped if they somehow happened to demand that there be an agreement in composing , and concurring with the law , this is your right .
False organizations favor there to be no agreement , and if there is one you can expect that data , ( for example , the expenses and so on . ) will be fragmented .
You can take in a great deal of these offices by taking a gander at their agreement .
If that they do n’t offer an agreement for any reason at all , stop your dealings with them in a flash .
If that certifications are offered , watch out !
Not even the best and most experienced organizations can ensure the aftereffects of their credit repair companies .
They can guarantee you – after they contemplate your report – that they will enhance your score by any accessible legitimate means .
Be that as it may , in the matter of credit repair results can never be ensured .
Sadly , it ’s the idea of individuals to be pulled in to the company that discloses to them what they want to hear and employs them as opposed to a company that is being honest .
Try not to fall into this trap !
Despite the fact that you may want to be informed that positive outcomes are ensured , any company that guarantees such outcomes is n’t reliable .
Search for advising companies .
Most legitimate credit repair organizations will offer free advising companies .
If the company that you are thinking about to connect with does not , take a stab at looking somewhat more profound .
It wo n’t be a reliable office .
A decent and dependable company will urge its customers to end up proficient in credit repair .
The companies they offer are concerning those issues that require proceeded and meticulous follow - up to ensure the errors on your credit report have all been evacuated .
Wrong counsel is a warning !
A few offices will instruct you to debate each injurious record on your report by saying “ this record is n’t mine . ”
In spite of the fact that the outcomes might be a higher FICO assessment at present , the lender whose advance had been questioned may counter it at a later date , and the agency will in this manner examine and check it .
Given the horrifyingly poor record keeping propensities for the credit agencies , there is a high likelihood that every one of the points of interest of anything on your credit report may not be exact .
In any case , credit repair organizations that encourage you to assert “ this is n’t my record ” if that you are sure that it is , are not to be trusted .
As should be obvious , there are sufficient warnings en route to caution against conceivable extortion .
Preceding looking for assistance from a credit repair company , you ought to instruct yourself on issues relating to credit , including taking in the significance of the expressions “ credit report ” and “ financial assessment . ”
You likewise need to know the base material laws previously you go for a credit repair help .
A decent begin is to look at the FTC Agency of Buyer Assurance and the Moral Credit Repair Union .
A U.S. engineer has devised a seemingly foolproof and cheap way to encrypt messages using the natural noise caused by electrons flowing along a wire .
Data messages can be sent intermittently and camouflaged by this ' thermal noise . '
It appears to be better than quantum key distribution ( QKD ) technology .
The engineer is Laszlo Kish of Texas A&M University .
In his plan the sender and receiver both have the same pair of resistors attached to the physical cable ; one produces a high resistance , the other a low one .
As a voltage passes along the wire so - called thermal noise is generated and its amount varies with the resistance on the wire .
At either end of the line a fast random choices of resistor are made and a monitor at the other end detects high or low noise if the resistor at that end is the same .
A medium noise level is detected if different resistors are chosen at each end .
This happens one half of the time and a single digit messages can be sent in this period .
The message is a binary one or zero depending upon which end is reading the message and whether its resistor choice is high or low , meaning the choice at the other end is the opposite , which signals ' 1 ' or ' 0 ' .
To snoopers eavesdropping on the line it just appears that the thermal noise level varies randomly .
If they do realize that medium noise levels signal a message they do n't know the binary digit value because they do n't know the resistor setting at either end of the line .
Thirdly , the very act of tapping the line alters the thermal noise level so the fact of the eavesdropping is detectable .
It seems almost ridiculously simple and secure .
A prototype device has been built by Kish and his team .
With its 99.98 percent message reception accuracy and 2,000 kilometer distance QKD technology is out - performed .
The team calculated that fewer than one two thousandth of the bits sent were actually vulnerable to snoopers .
QKD technology is based on optical fibres carrying photons between quantum encryption devices .
Device message reception accuracy is adversely affected by vibration , heat and dust , and they are much more expensive than the estimated US $ 100 of a Kish device .
QKD technology has been proposed as a highly secure way of sending encryption keys between parties wishing to send and receive data securely .
Kish technology appears to have the edge and , if it fast enough , might even be used for sending the raw data itself .
Commercial testing and , if the result is positive , production might take as little as two to three years .
When news came out this weekend that Dem senators were working on a plan to rescind the authorization of the Iraq war , I know my hopes were raised just a tiny bit .
Apparently for naught :
In the Senate , the armed services and foreign relations committee chairmen are writing a fifth Democratic proposal on Iraq aimed at getting U.S. troops out of combat operations while retaining a mission of training and support for Iraqi security forces .
Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman , and Sen. Joseph Biden , D - Del. , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman , may offer their plan — in the form of a nonbinding resolution — as an amendment to the Surface Transportation and Rail Security Act , S 184 .
It is unclear how they will be able to overcome the main hurdle — the need for 60 votes to cut off debate in the 100 - member Senate — that has blocked a final vote on other Iraq - related legislation .
Yet another non-binding resolution .
Just what we need .
Senator Feingold responds :
I am working to fix the new proposal drafted by several Senate Democrats , which at this point basically reads like a new authorization .
I will not vote for anything that the President could read as an authorization for continuing with a large military campaign in Iraq .
Deauthorizing the President ’s failed Iraq policy may be an appropriate next step if done right , but the ultimate goal needs to be using our Constitutionally - granted power of the purse to bring this catastrophe to an end .
At this point , the Senate is a lost cause .
The margins are too narrow and the political will among Dems too buffeted by that narrow margin .
I have tremendous respect for Senator Feingold and his efforts , but any plan for defunding this occupation is going to have to come from the House .
And the news from that side of the Hill is discouraging :
House Democratic leaders are backing away from a plan to scale back U.S. involvement in the Iraq war by using Congress ' most powerful tool -- withholding money in the budget .
Instead , party officials said Tuesday , leaders are weighing a proposal that would attempt to embarrass Bush into abandoning his war strategy .
Under a plan discussed behind closed doors , Democrats probably would fund President Bush 's entire $ 93.4 billion request for war spending this year but require that any troops sent into battle that do n't meet certain standards receive a presidential waiver and that Congress be notified of the shortcoming .
The compromise is an attempt to please members who want to end the war immediately by cutting funding and others who do not want to appear as though Democrats are turning their back on troops .
All due respect to those members , you will only appear that you are turning your back on the troops if you do n't do everything in your power to get them the hell out of Iraq .
That will have to come from some effort at defunding , whether it 's Feingold 's approach or the Wu / Ackerman approach that caps funding and sets a redeployment date .
But any approach that will move us forward will have to come from the House , and it will require leadership that gets the Blue Dog Dems in line .
If Web readers in Britain were intrigued by the headline “ Details Emerge in British Terror Case , ” which sat on top of The New York Times ’s home page much of yesterday , they would have been disappointed with a click .
“ On advice of legal counsel , this article is unavailable to readers of nytimes.com in Britain , ” is the message they would have seen .
“ This arises from the requirement in British law that prohibits publication of prejudicial information about the defendants prior to trial . ”
In adapting technology intended for targeted advertising to keep the article out of Britain , The Times addressed one of the concerns of news organizations publishing online : how to avoid running afoul of local publishing laws .
“ I think we have to take every case on its own facts , ” said George Freeman , vice president and assistant general counsel of The New York Times Company .
“ But we ’re dealing with a country that , while it does n’t have a First Amendment , it does have a free press , and it ’s our position that we ought to respect that country ’s laws . ”
How to Reduce the Risk of the Coronavirus in Your Vehicle
The vehicles we drive , rent and ride in are all susceptible to spreading the coronavirus if the proper precautions are not taken .
With that in mind , here are the best ways to clean and disinfect your vehicle or the ones you ride in .
Senate Judiciary Committee members Feingold , Schumer , Kennedy , and Durbin have sent an interesting query to Alberto Gonzales , ( e- mailed release , no link ) :
Dear Mr. Attorney General :
In very dramatic testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday , former Deputy Attorney General James Comey testified that in March 2004 , when you served as White House Counsel , you were involved in " an effort to take advantage of a very sick man , " referring to then - Attorney General John Ashcroft .
Specifically , Mr. Comey testified that you and former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card went to Mr. Ashcroft 's bedside at George Washington Hospital , where he was in intensive care , in an effort to get him to agree to certify the legality of a classified program that he and Mr. Comey , who was serving as acting Attorney General at the time , had concluded should not be so certified .
Mr. Comey stated that when the Administration decided to go forward with reauthorizing this classified program without that certification , he and several other Justice Department officials , including possibly Attorney General Ashcroft himself , were ready to tender their resignations .
You testified last year before both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Judiciary Committee about this incident .
On February 6 , 2006 , at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing , you were asked whether Mr. Comey and others at the Justice Department had raised concerns about the NSA wiretapping program .
You stated in response that the disagreement that occurred was not related to the wiretapping program confirmed by the President in December 2005 , which was the topic of the hearing .
The following is a transcript excerpt from that hearing :
Senator Schumer .
Let me ask you about some specific reports .
It has been reported by multiple news outlets that the former number two man in the Justice Department , the premier terrorism prosecutor , Jim Comey , expressed grave reservations about the NSA program and at least once refused to give it his blessing .
Is that true ?
Attorney General Gonzales .
Senator , here is a response that I feel that I can give with respect to recent speculation or stories about disagreements .
There has not been any serious disagreement , including – and I think this is accurate – there has not been any serious disagreement about the program that the President has confirmed .
There have been disagreements about other matters regarding operations , which I can not get into .
I will also say – Senator Schumer .
But there was some – I am sorry to cut you off , but there was some dissent within the administration , and Jim Comey did express at some point – that is all I asked you – some reservations .
Attorney General Gonzales .
The point I want to make is that , to my knowledge , none of the reservations dealt with the program that we are talking about today .
They dealt with operational capabilities that we are not talking about today .... Senator Schumer .
But you are telling us that none of these people expressed any reservations about the ultimate program .
Is that right ?
Attorney General Gonzales .
Senator , I want to be very careful here .
Because of course I am here only testifying about what the President has confirmed .
And with respect to what the President has confirmed , I believe – I do not believe that these DOJ officials that you are identifying had concerns about this program .
In addition , on April 6 , 2006 , in answer to a question from then House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner about the hospital visit , which had been reported in the press , you responded : " Mr. Chairman , what I can say – and I 'm sure this will not be acceptable , but let me say it anyway – is that I have testified before that the disagreement that existed does not relate to the program the President confirmed in December to the American people . "
We ask for your prompt response to the following question :
In light of Mr. Comey 's testimony yesterday , do you stand by your 2006 Senate and House testimony , or do you wish to revise it ?
PJ8C , $ 299 -- new batch available now PJ8C flies in Bobcat 52
I 've fitted a PJ8C into a Chinese ARF Bobcat 52 and started the test - flights .
Because the engine is mounted part - way inside the fuselage , I had to add some ducts so that it can breathe .
Originally I tried to use some low - drag NACA ducts but they did n't supply enough air so I added scoops , which improved things but the engine is still starving for air .
The next step is some internal ducting to direct the incoming air towards the engine 's intake .
But enjoy the video of progress to date : How fast ?
Here 's the latest video of my PJ8C - powered Long -EZ ARF flying .
I swapped out the original first - prototype for the second prototype on which all production engines are based .
This is now one seriously - fast RC model .
There are many turbine - powered models costing thousands of dollars which can't keep up with this low - cost jet - powered ARF and instead of using expensive , harder to get jet - fuel mixed expensive turbine oil , the PJ8C runs on regular gasoline from the pump at your local garage .
Or you can watch it in high quality by clicking this link : Very fast PJ8C - powered Long-EZ ARF
See how the PJ8C is made
Quite a few folks have asked to see how the PJ8C is made so I 've created a page with a few pictures and a brief description of how I build these engines .
If you 're curious , check out the How the PJ8C is made page .
How do pulsejets work ?
Although I 've written a lot about pulsejet engines , one of the questions I still get asked most often is " how do they work " .
To answer this I 've created the following YouTube video .
I hope it will explain all .
Limited number of new PJ8C ceramic - coated engines available
I have a small quantity of the new redesigned PJ8C engines and other accessories for sale .
There 's never been a cheaper way to get into jet - powered RC model flying .
Ceramic coating and pulsejets
One of the big problems with pulsejet engines is that they run very , very hot -- soemthing that often limits their application and reduces their operation life .
To help reduce this problem , I 'm now using a ceramic coating ( which the manufacturer claims is also used by NASA ) on the inside of my engines which protects the metal from exposure to hot combustion gases and also provides a measure of insulation -- effectively improving efficiency and reducing external operating temperatures .
More to follow on this ...
The new PJ8 takes to the air ( update )
An updated version of my PJ8 design has been test - flown in a cheap Chinese Long - EZ ARF .
( and a special version for the BobCat 50 ARF should be ready in a week or two ) .
The fuel - bubble issues have been sorted now and I have been able to enjoy some much longer flights with the PJ8 / Long - EZ combination .
As you can see in the new video ( below ) , the PJ8 is a good match for the Long - EZ airframe .
The reed valve that has now done quite a few flights and much static ground - running ( while fixing up the fuel system ) finally expired on this flight - you can year it starting to sound a bit odd near the end of the flight before I cut the engine .
Because the Long - EZ does n't have a tail , it was very easy to modify for pulsejet power .
More video of the Long - EZ will be posted soon and the updated plans will be added to my Pulsejet Book .
At last , ECU for pulsejets
An interesting project I 've been working recently is an Engine Control Unit for pulsejet engines .
Lots of folks have talked about using electronics to provide better control of pulsejet engines but , to the best of my knowledge , nobody has actually done so to date , or at least not until now .
The circuit you see in this picture is a rough and ready ( but fully functional ) prototype of my pulsejet ECU system .
Although it looks a bit like a bird 's - nest of wires and components , this ECU does some very clever stuff .
For example , it actually listens to each combustion cycle using a transducer .
That information ( along with other data such as temperature , mass - flow and thrust ) is constantly monitored and used to fine - tune the engine 's operation and ensure maximum performance is achieved at all points on the power - curve .
The ECU also supports fully automated start / restart and shutdown for engines using gas and / or liquid fuel .
Right now I 'm designing the final circuit board which will see all that mess condensed down to a unit about the size of a credit - card .
Stay tuned for more information and some video of the ECU in action .
I 'm back !
After a long time away from my pulsejet projects I 'm back !
This site will be getting a major facelift pretty soon and I 'll be showing you some of the cool stuff I 've been working on in the pulsejet area .
I 'm currently preparing a new XJet prototype that will be shipped off to a university for testing and validation of the performance , this being the final step before commercial production .
And I 've also been very busy writing my book which is chock - full of stuff that any tech - head will find both entertaining and interesting .
If you missed it , I see that the epsiode of ScrapHeap Challenge in which I appeared as an " expert " and directed a team of Navy engineers in their task of building and racing a pulse - jet powered vehicle has been uploaded to YouTube .

The biggest , meanest pulsejet dragster ever !
UPDATE : we 've had our first short runs in the dragster and it is , in a word , " frightening " !
And here , as promised , are a few pictures of the tentative first few runs .
One thing that immediately became apparent however , is that if the engines do lose synchronization , there 's a definite tendency for the exhaust of one to be ingested by the other , resulting in a premature flame - out .
This problem will be significantly reduced when the augmentors are added but in the meantime , a simple dividing plate between the two intake pipes seems to have dramatically reduced the magnitude of the problem -- albeit while making the engines less likely to sync - up in the first place .
It 's been quite a while since I updated this website but I 've been very busy in the workshop .
Here 's a picture of what I 've currently got under construction :
Early tests on Jet A1 indicate that this thrust can be lifted to around 180 lbs each and , with the addition of an augmentor , a figure of around 220 lbs of static thrust per engine should be possible -- for a total of 440 lbs .
The entire vehicle currently weighs in at under 180 lbs so I 'm expecting some pretty impressive acceleration and speed .
I 'll be posting more pictures in the next week or so .
Note that this engine design has been licensed to a New Zealand company ( SimpleJets ) who have already started manufacturing .

TV Crews All Over The Place
Over the past six weeks or so I 've had TV crews here on a fairly regular basis .
They 've been filming a couple of items on me and my jet engine activities .
Unfortunately , this footage is unlikely to be seen outside of New Zealand but we did some really cool night - runs with the JetKart that looked very impressive .
This shot in particular shows how a vortex forms in the exhaust of the pulsejet during the exhaust phase .
I 'll post some more pictures from these night - shoots in a week or so when I 've had a chance to dump it onto my computer .
Kids , do not try this at home -- I am just crazy

Starting The New Pulsejet Engine
Despite what you see at the top of this page there is no need to worry , no bald people were harmed during the starting of this engine but it sure looks spectacular do n't you think ?
Fortunately , after a bit of tweaking , this engine now starts without the need for any kind of forced air -- amazing but true .
Here 's a very short video clip ( 1.1MB MPEG ) that shows how it can be started simply by turning on the fuel .
You can also see how much power this engine has by the way it flattens the grass in front of it .
Note that the full plans and extra constructional information for this engine are included in the final draft of my pulsejet book .

New Valve - head Design for Traditional Pulsejets
While X - jet development remains stalled due to a lack of funding , I 've been applying my mind to the improvement of traditional pulsejet engines and have just posted a new page ( NOW WITH PICTURES ) that details another innovation .
This new valve - head and injection system has proven to be a very successful way of increasing the power , efficiency and valve - life of traditional petal - valve pulsejet designs as well as allowing the direct - injection of liquid fuels without the need for an expensive high - pressure pump .
As with the Blast Ring ( which this new system effectively replaces ) , I 'm placing this new design into the public domain so that others can use it freely .
It is simple enough that it could be fitted to almost any existing petal - valved pulsejet , including engines such as the Dynajet , Tiger Jet and others .
Feel free to use this design in your own engines , all I ask is a little attribution where relevant .

I have never been very excited about the concept of " net neutrality . "
Various bills in Congress trying to enforce this strike me as Trojan horses for regulation of the Internet , and are at best the attempts by one segment of the population to enforce their vision of the Internet via the coercive power of the government .
But more on this in a second .
The City of Boston has a free municipal Wi -Fi network ( I aired some of my objections to this here ) .
By using this " free " wi - fi network ( which is free only in the sense that you paid for it via taxes rather than use fees ) you apparently must accept government filtering of the content , which caused Boing - Boing to get blocked the other day , for some " arbitrary and capricious " reasons .
Readers may remember I already dinged Boston once when it used its government power to try to block free competitors .
So despite all the panic that evil capitalist broadband suppliers will somehow block or skew content from certain content suppliers , it turns out that the government , acting as broadband supplier , is the first to do so .
Fortunately , Bostonians have many free competitors to the municipal service that provide uncensored access to the Internet .
But without those private options , they would be enjoying the Chinese Internet experience .
Which gets us back to the issue of accountability .
In short , socialists distrust individual self - interest and the market as accountability tools , and believe the government is much more accountable , and therefore trustworthy , than any private institution .
What amazes be is that anyone with a working knowledge of history can continue to believe this .
Take any issue :
Corruption ?
Sure there was Enron and Worldcom , but any crimes at these institutions are trivial compared in both magnitude and frequency to the financial abuses of government .
Take pensions as one example .
Maybe 10 - 20 out of 500 of the companies in the DJIA have underfunded pensions , with some money put away but not enough .
But probably 99 out of every 100 municipalities you can name have underfunded pensions , and in most cases these not only have too little money put away , they have ZERO !
Worker health ?
Almost all private work environments are incredibly safe -- the very fact that we are worried about carpal tunnel syndrome should tell you something .
But what about in the past ?
Well , take one of the highest profile cases of worker harm , that of long - term asbestos exposure .
A huge number of the worst asbestos cases are people exposed in government naval yards .
Government naval yards , for decades , eschewed basic worker protections from asbestos that were common in private industry .
Environment ?
One only has to look at the superfund site list and see that government sites are represented way out of proportion to their economic activity .
This is not to say their are not god-awful private sites , created either through ignorance or willful disregard , but you will find that the government was at least as active a polluter as even the worst private polluters .
Or look around today , at water quality .
The number of private contributors to water problems is nearly nil .
Most modern water pollution problems are caused by governments ( Boston 's " solution " to piping raw sewage into the harbor was to ... lay a longer pipe and dump it further out in the ocean ) .
Monopoly ?
It is hard to find , in history , any stable private monopolies .
Perhaps the most famous , Standard Oil , was losing market share rapidly due to private forces at the time of its breakup .
Government monopolies , however , can last forever despite high prices and crappy services .
Just look at public education .
Commerce ?
Those who are frequent readers will know that I buy some product from the government , and they are by far my worst , hardest to deal with , and most abusive vendor .
Getting back to the issue of net neutrality , let 's take a look at what accountability - enforcement tools a private individual has over a private vs. a public broadband supplier .
If I do n't like my private broadband supplier , I can make a phone call and switch to one of several others .
Time elapsed : About 30 minutes .
If I do n't like my public broadband supplier , I could switch to a private company .
But this is really a libertarian end - around to the socialist problem .
To be fair , we need to look at a pure socialist system and evaluate the accountability tools in this system .
So , assuming the government entity has enforced a monopoly position for itself ( like in education or the postal service ) , I would have to muster a grass roots campaign and likely millions of dollars to force any changes through an entrenched and brain - dead legislative body .
Time elapsed : From 3 years to never .

This is one of those inside the beltway observations that you might have missed , but is actually quite important .
ThinkProgress , the blog for the Center for American Progress ( CAP ) , the organization run by President Clinton ’s former chief of staff John Podesta , published a stern commentary today in opposition to the Iraq war supplemental agreement negotiated by Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi .
ThinkProgress notes that “ this victory for President Bush is a defeat for the American people . ”
They go on to say that congressional leaders , including Nancy Pelosi , “ need to live up to their word , ” and that “ anyone who supports accountability for President Bush ’s Iraq policy must reject this blank check for war . ”
ThinkProgress would n’t take this bold a position on the most important legislation in America today , in opposition to the Democratic leadership in the House and Senate , without the Center for American Progress ’s approval .
And you ’d better believe that the Center is n’t going to approve of such an important statement of policy without John Podesta personally signing off .
The man was the former White House chief of staff – we can assume he does n’t miss details .
Things get even more interesting when you consider that inside the beltway CAP is perceived by many , rightly or wrongly , as a front for Hillary ’s presidential run .
And there is no way , in my view , that CAP ’s position on the supplemental helps Hillary ( who would prefer to remain perpetually obtuse when it comes to Iraq ) .
Podesta is a big deal in Washington .
If he ’s not happy with this “ compromise , ” to the point of publicly challenging Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid , and putting Hillary in an awfully uncomfortable position , then that means discontent with the way the Democratic party leadership is handling Iraq goes far deeper than a few “ crazy ” bloggers or the party ’s supposedly - liberal base .
Bush met with Dobson and conservative Christian leaders to rally support for Iran policy Max Blumenthal
Published : Monday May 14 , 2007 Print This Email This President George W. Bush met privately with Focus on the Family Founder and Chairman James Dobson and approximately a dozen Christian right leaders last week to rally support for his policies on Iraq , Iran and the so - called " war on terror . "
 I was invited to go to Washington DC to meet with President Bush in the White House along with 12 or 13 other leaders of the pro-family movement , " Dobson disclosed on his radio program Monday .
 And the topic of the discussion that day was Iraq , Iran and international terrorism .
And we were together for 90 minutes and it was very enlightening and in some ways disturbing too . "
Details of the meeting were disclosed by Dobson during Monday 's edition of his Focus on the Family radio program .
Dobson described Bush as upbeat and determined and convinced , adding ,  I wish the American people could have sat in on that meeting we had . 
Dobson went on to enumerate a series of meetings convened by Christian right leaders in Washington to discuss the supposedly existential threat to the United States from a nuclear Iran .
 I heard about this danger [ from Iran ] not only at the White House but from other pro-family leaders that I met during that week in Washington , " he said .
 Many people in a position to know are talking about the possibility of losing a city to nuclear or biological or chemical attack .
And if we can lose one we can lose ten .
" If we can lose ten we can lose a hundred , " he added , especially if North Korea and Russia and China pile on .
Later in his broadcast , during a discussion about Iran with author and self - proclaimed prophecy expert  Joel Rosenberg , Dobson drew a parallel between current Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad and Adolf Hitler .
 The world looked at Hitler and just did n't believe him and tried to appease him the way we 're hearing in Washington today ,  Dobson remarked .
 You know , the President seems to me does understand this , as I told you from that meeting I had with him the other day , but even there it feels like somebody ought to be standing up and saying ,  We are being threatened and we are going to meet this with force -- whatever 's necessary .
Dobson continued ,  Some of our listeners might not like that but I tell you , if we did n't stand up to Hitler , we'd be speaking German today . 
$ 1.6 Million Bugatti Veyron Smashed
The world 's fastest , most powerful , and most expensive street - legal production car has seen its first crash .
Monday , March 05 , 2007
Here at WreckedExotics.com , we know it 's only a matter of time before every make and model of exotic car is eventually involved in an accident .
In the case of the Bugatti Veyron , it took longer than expected ( 18 months to be exact ) .
300 Bugatti Veyrons were produced by September 2005 , making it the most expensive and fastest production car in history .
With an MSRP of $ 1.6 million , only a privelaged few could ever dream of owning this supercar .
Even with the $ 1.6 million price tag , this still did n't cover the cost of producing the car , estimated at $ 6 - 7 million per vehicle .
Volkswagen ( owner of Bugatti ) , says the Veyron was not meant to be a money maker , but rather used as a test - bed for advancements in technology and engineering .
The unnamed driver is said to have lost control of the 1,000 hp , 253 mph supercar when it hit a patch of standing water on the B375 near Shepperton , United Kingdom .
The four - wheel drive Veyron then aquaplaned and crashed nose first into a ditch by the side of the road .
It is not known whether any other vehicles were involved although Surrey Police have no record of the accident , suggesting the driver arranged himself for the car to be recovered .
Doubtless the embarrassed owner is lying low and contemplating the sort of repair bill only a wrecked $ 1.6 million supercar can create .
One source told WreckedExotics.com the owner had the car delivered on Wednesday , February 28th .
This accident took place three days later on Saturday , March 3rd .
Below is a photo of the same car taken in London prior to the crash :
Although this is the first " official " wreck of the Bugatti Veyron , a prototype vehicle was destroyed during testing back in 2003 .
It 's surprising it took so long for a Veyron to be involved in an accident .
300 of these cars have been on the road since September 2005 .
For comparison , there were 400 Enzos produced and at least 5 of them have been destroyed since September 2005 .
Perhaps Veyron owners are more careful or simply drive their cars a lot less than other supercar owners .
One thing is for sure though , this wo n't be the last Veyron to be wrecked .

Washington
FOR the past several months , I ’ve been wrapping up lengthy interviews with Washington counterterrorism officials with a fundamental question : “ Do you know the difference between a Sunni and a Shiite ? ”
A “ gotcha ” question ?
Perhaps .
But if knowing your enemy is the most basic rule of war , I do n’t think it ’s out of bounds .
And as I quickly explain to my subjects , I ’m not looking for theological explanations , just the basics :
Who ’s on what side today , and what does each want ?
After all , would n’t British counterterrorism officials responsible for Northern Ireland know the difference between Catholics and Protestants ?
In a remotely similar but far more lethal vein , the 1,400 - year Sunni -Shiite rivalry is playing out in the streets of Baghdad , raising the specter of a breakup of Iraq into antagonistic states , one backed by Shiite Iran and the other by Saudi Arabia and other Sunni states .
A complete collapse in Iraq could provide a haven for Al Qaeda operatives within striking distance of Israel , even Europe .
And the nature of the threat from Iran , a potential nuclear power with protégés in the Gulf states , northern Saudi Arabia , Lebanon and the Palestinian territories , is entirely different from that of Al Qaeda .
It seems silly to have to argue that officials responsible for counterterrorism should be able to recognize opportunities for pitting these rivals against each other .
The air strike was one of several in Gaza on Saturday night
At least one rocket hit the car as the cameraman was filming , knocking him unconscious , while the second man received serious leg wounds .
The Reuters car was clearly marked all over as a media vehicle .
The Israeli army said the car had not been identified as press and expressed regret that journalists had been hurt .
The agency named its cameraman as Fadel Shana and the other man wounded as local website journalist Sabbah Hmaida .
Two Palestinian bystanders were also injured in the attack .
A Hamas militant was killed in a separate Israeli air strike on Gaza later on Saturday .
' English , Arabic and Hebrew '
Israeli ground forces backed by helicopters were conducting an operation inside the Gaza Strip on Saturday evening , near the Karni crossing .
" During the operation , there was an aerial attack on a suspicious vehicle that drove in a suspicious manner right by the forces and in between the Palestinian militant posts , " Israeli army spokeswoman Capt Noa Meir said .
" This car was not identified by the army as a press vehicle .
If journalists were hurt , we regret it . "
The Reuters armoured car was clearly labelled as a media vehicle , with signs on all sides , including the roof .
According to the Associated Press , the white sports utility vehicle was emblazoned with the Reuters logo and had " TV " and " Press " written on it in English , Arabic and Hebrew .
The front seats of the car were covered in blood , much of the inside of the vehicle was torn by shrapnel and one of the bullet - proof windows was completely destroyed , the agency says .
Mohammed Dawdi , head of the local journalists ' union , described the attack as a " cold - blooded crime " .
The Israelis have been conducting operations against militants in the Gaza Strip for two months .
The campaign was sparked by the capture of an Israeli soldier on 25 June .
At The Scientist , a long article describes possible “ fixes ” to the problem of human aging :
In the absence of planned form and designed function , what we have is a living machine that appears well thought out , but which fails when operated beyond its biological warranty period .
Some anatomic fixes could make a difference in aging populations : …
Anyone who understands how time takes its toll on the body and mind , however , will recognize that designing a human body built to last requires far more substantive changes than meddling with simple anatomy .
So we ’ve asked our experts to fiddle with physiology and tinker with the inner mechanics of life at its most basic biologic level .
Although it is inevitable , for now , that all systems in the body experience some level of functional decline with the passage of time , not all components of the body degrade at the same rate .
Furthermore , some structures are more vulnerable than others .
The authors of the article interviewed a number of experts in several aspects of the biology of aging ( skewed a little heavily toward neuroscientists ) , and then summarized their speculations on the prospects for slowing or preventing aging via engineered interventions in a wide variety of molecular phenomena , cell types and organ systems .
Some of the ideas are quite consistent with cutting - edge thinking in biogerontology ( e.g. , manipulating autophagy and protein degradation to help clear damaged macromolecules more efficiently , or uncoupling olfaction from downstream signals in order to simulate the effects of calorie restriction ) whereas others are kind of eh ( e.g. , “ Stronger , more resilient enamel might stave off [ tooth ] decay , ” but if that fails let ’s install a third row of teeth to come in at middle age , since after all those four wisdom teeth are n’t enough of a pain in the ass ) .
For each proposed fix , there ’s a clear statement of the problem being addressed , a potential solution or two , and then a paragraph about possible complications and tradeoffs that might result .
Overall , I think the piece is a very thoughtful lay - level treatment of the provocative idea that we might someday make germ - line modifications to human beings ( as opposed to treating people with pharmaceuticals or medical procedures , either prophylactically or remedially ) in order to combat age - related decline and mortality .
The reader commentary is worth checking out as well , not because it ’s particularly informative but because it distills some of the opposition that confront life - extension - motivated biogerontologists — even those who are n’t committed to making germ - line modifications to the human organism , as most of the arguments here are directed against extending the lifespan , rather than the means by which this extension might be achieved .
Among the commenters are the folks who do n’t see the point in living longer ( then do n’t ) ; those who either profoundly misunderstand evolutionary theory or idolize the concept of species - level evolution as a moral good ; the infamous “ think of the children ” argument ; and — of course — invocations of God , who apparently wants us all to die so that we can join Him and Jebus up in Heaven .
If one happens to be a pro-life - extension biogerontologist , their rants provide a refreshing bit of evidence that you ’re on the right side .

Columnist Ron
Hart explains why libertarians have such a hard time finding a home in either party :
Democrats realize that they are a utopian theoretical party that is more about making people feel good – most importantly , themselves .
They tax and vilify the most productive members of society and go through the motions of redistributing wealth .
They are beholden to an odd collection of interests that most Americans do not like .
The bad news for us is that liberal Democrats take money from the most productive part of society and , after they take their cut , distribute a fraction of it to its least productive members .
By doing so , they validate this part of societys ’ lethargy and allows them to continue to further wallow in their victimhood .
The more they convince folks they are victims , the better voting bloc the Democrats have .
Clearly , Democrats do not want people to succeed , because they then become Republicans .
But that does n’t mean the Republicans are any better :
After their third bourbon , Republicans will tell you that George Bush has set the party back 20 years .
He did so by going against the very fundamental beliefs of the GOP : limited government , less spending , privacy and individual rights .
Bush has blurred the line between church and state , folding to the religious right faster than a British soldier in Iran .
He has us in what can only be viewed as a religious war and it is increasingly apparent that he spun intelligence to get us in this mess .
He also signed into law a non-market - driven prescription drug bill that is the second largest entitlement in history .
The traditional minimal government conservatives such as Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan have been replaced by a new breed of big government “ conservatives , ” entrenched Republicans who seek to use their power to reshape citizens thinking toward their own religious and world views .
They do not heed Goldwater ’s maxim that legislators should consider before any decision is made whether they are “ maximizing freedom . ”
The only Republican in office that I ’m aware of that does that on a consistent basis is Ron Paul .
And he is far from being the mainstream of his party .
The truth is that , in both parties , politicians say what they think they need to say to appease their supporters .
In the Democratic Party , those supporters are typically union leaders and other activists of a decidedly socialist bent .
Thus you get the disaster that is Democratic economic policy .
In the Republicans case , politicians pander to the social conservatives and thus pending more time worrying about who ’s sleeping with who than about taking control of the out - of - control ship that is the Government of the United States .
It ’s possible things will change , but I do n’t see it happening soon .

Carnival in Rio has been called the world ’s most famous party .
A million tourists join millions of Rio de Janeiro citizens ( “ cariocas “ ) in enthusiastic revelry spanning several day .
Carnival takes place during the days preceding Ash Wednesday , the first of 40 meatless fasting days preceding Easter ( Carnival derives from “ carne vale ” meaning “ farewell to meat “ ) .
Here are the official schedules for the next several years :
– 2008 Feb 02 to 05
– 2009 Feb 21 to 24

Republican quotes KKK founder on House floor
Roll Call reports today that a House Republican delivered a foreign policy speech yesterday in which he quoted Nathan Bedford Forrest , founder of the KKK .
On Monday , Rep. Ted Poe took to the House floor to discuss foreign policy matters .
To make a point , the Texas Republican invoked the words of Civil War Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest : “ Git thar fustest with the mostest . ”
The quotation got some floor watchers ’ attention pretty quickly .
Forrest is a controversial figure who was one of the Klan ’s first grand wizards .
Although the Civil War hero ( if you were a Confederate , that is ) ultimately abandoned the Klan for its violent tactics , he continues to kick up dust .
“ Controversial figure ” does n’t quite cut it .
Most lists of the worst Americans in U.S. history include Nathan Bedford Forrest near the top .
That ’s what happens when someone creates the KKK to terrorize freed slaves and their allies , after taking up arms against the United States .
What on earth would possess a GOP lawmaker to quote Forrest on the House floor ?
Poe ’s spokesperson told Roll Call , “ The reference to Forrest was used in an historical context comparing the request to Congress for support of the Confederate troops to the request that is being made today by our Generals in Iraq . ”
First , the comparison does n’t make any sense .
Second , when one bolsters their argument with the words of one of the most controversial Americans ever , rationalizing it as a historical comparison is unpersuasive .
Should n’t this be a bigger deal ?
Given all of the racial problems of the Republican Party , is n’t it rather scandalous for a Republican lawmaker to rely on the words of the founder of the KKK ?
Post Script : And , just as an aside , the quote Poe used was wrong .
[ A] ccording to historians , Forrest did n’t really say the line that ’s so often attributed to him .
“ Do not , under any circumstances whatever , quote Forrest as saying ‘ fustest ’ and ‘ mostest ’ , ” Civil War scholar Bruce Catton wrote in his 1971 book , “ The Civil War . ” Catton wrote that Forrest actually believed the essence of strategy — and the proper quote — was “ to git thar fust with the most men . ”
What ’s worse than quoting the founder of the KKK on the House floor ?
Quoting him incorrectly .
Update : ThinkProgress has the video .
Moore 's like many security researchers who gin up publicity for the software flaws they find , as he did with his bug - a - day stunt highlighting browser weaknesses in July .
But he goes further , as one of the main forces behind the Metasploit Project , which posts a free , open source platform that makes it easier to develop and test code that can take advantage of software vulnerabilities .
Included are more than 150 examples of such code ready to exploit flaws .
Do n't cry to Moore
The Metasploit Web site serves as a mental gymnasium for security pros--and cons , since it makes no effort to discern one from the other - - looking for ways to break into IT systems .
The latest effort , eVade - o- Matic , is designed to disguise malicious JavaScript that 's used to attack browsers ; it takes normal JavaScript that programmers write into a Web page and makes it look different each time the page is launched .
That can foil software defenses that rely on lists of known malware .
Metasploit 's self - proclaimed quest is to help IT pros verify the security of the software they buy or write .
" Without exploit code , penetration testers can't do their jobs , [ intrusion - detection system ] developers can't create reliable signatures , and network administrators have to blindly trust that a patch installation actually worked , " says Moore , a developer and researcher for the site he helped launch in 2003 .
Moore 's work amounts to that of an arms dealer or gun maker :
His wares can be used to protect or endanger people .
He 's not interested in controlling how his goods are used .
Moore and his Metasploit colleagues are used to blurring the line between improving security and creating insecurity .
Moore last month created an exploit of the now - patched Vector Markup Language , or VML , vulnerability in Internet Explorer .
That exploit was undetected by 26 virus - scanning engines , including those from Kaspersky , McAfee , Microsoft , and Symantec .
Earlier this year , Moore created a zero - day exploit -- one unleashed before there 's a known remedy -- to take advantage of a vulnerability in Microsoft 's Windows Metafile .
That prompted Microsoft to take the rare step of releasing a patch five days ahead of its software - patch schedule .
Moore added to his prestige and forced Microsoft to fix its problem sooner , but he also left Internet Explorer more vulnerable than if he'd worked discreetly with Microsoft .
' As White Hat As You Get '
Moore 's a celebrity in the security community .
His presentation at the Black Hat Conference in Las Vegas this summer was packed as he discussed the latest version of Metasploit vulnerability - testing software .
There are two ways to look at Moore and his ilk :
They give malicious hackers better ability to attack customers of Microsoft and other popular products ; or they show tough love to software companies so they 'll produce more - secure products .
A Hacker Site 's Highlight Reel 2003
Metasploit founded , giving exploit code to the masses 2004
Metasploit 2.0's graphic interface makes it easier to use 2006
Metasploit becomes a limited liability company , protects intellectual property from commercial use Version 3 of the Metasploit due , with Windows interface to make it easier yet to use
He 's even well regarded by some -- not all -- in Microsoft 's Security Technology Unit , which had Moore speak at its " Blue Hat " conferences , designed to give Microsoft programmers a wake - up call to the kind of hacking their work will endure .
However , one manager of a product successfully broken with his tools , who 's no longer with Microsoft , called Moore the " spawn of the devil " and " Hitler 's driver . "
There 's definitely some smiling through gritted teeth when Metasploit comes knocking .
An open source community , Metasploit is governed by Moore and researcher Matt Miller , aka " Skape , " with exploit code contributed by programmers from around the world .
" The Metasploit staff does n't enforce anyone 's idea of ' responsible disclosure , ' and each of us have our own policies for when to release an exploit based on the patch time line , " Moore says .
This summer , Moore placed the browser community in his crosshairs , dubbing July as his " month of browser bugs " and promising to publish a new exploit for a major browser every day .
Moore estimates he discovered 80 to 120 flaws in browsers during the month .
Mozilla responded quickly and tested certain areas of its code , using tools Metasploit developed .
" They even sent me a T - shirt , " Moore says .
Opera also responded weekly .
No T - shirt from Apple , though .
It did n't respond to Safari bugs Metasploit published , though the company in September patched one problem Moore flagged .
Not The Only Rogue In Town
Plenty of penetration - testing tools similar to Metasploit are for sale , complete with lots of exploit code , from companies like Argeniss , Core Security , Gleg , Immunity , and Saint .
There are hardware - based testing boxes from companies such as Moore 's employer , Breaking Point Systems .
However , as an open source project , Metasploit is more controversial because it 's more widely accessible .
The same can be said for milw0rm.com , another site that provides free exploit code downloads .
" Similar professional exploitation tools , such as Core Impact and Canvas , already existed for wealthy users on all sides of the ethical spectrum , " writes the hacker Fyodor , in ranking vulnerability tools on his Web site , Insecure.org .
" Metasploit simply brought this capability to the masses . "
TAKE OUR POLL Metasploit : Help Or Menace ?
: Metasploit publishes tools to automate developing exploits that take advantage of security holes in software products .
Is that right ?
Making the product easier to use makes it accessible to more people , good or bad .
Moore 's not tied in knots about that .
" Admins cry , ' You can break into my systems now , ' " he says .
" Well , you should patch your systems . "

Q&A : Why Metasploit Publishes Hacker Tools
In recent years I have noticed that we both like superheroes very much .
I enjoy reading comics starring people who have powers other people can only dream of , while you like to make movies about them .
I appreciate that very much .
Most comics look great , but there 's nothing like seeing my favorite heroes in action , helped by all that money you pump into the movie versions .
I loved seeing Superman fly through the sky last summer to catch that space shuttle before it would hit earth .
It looked really kick - ass , just like the rest of the movie , and I was really proud of what you had done with it .
In the past you liked to have your own way with my favorite heroes , adding elements that were n't in the books , but which you thought were cool .
I know I can sometimes be a real pain when I 'm defending the original vision of the creators of these heroes , but you have to admit that your version of Catwoman looked like you had your ten year old nephew design the new outfit for her .
Since you have so many new superhero - movies planned for us , I thought I would write you this letter to give you a few tips on making a really good superhero movie , you know , without pissing off the fans .
I know you 're a bit scared by the fans sometimes , but if you would just humour us a bit more , you will find that we are not that bad at all .
Hey , if you make the movies really special , I promise you that we will even go see them more than once and buy the DVD .
Do we have a deal ?
Okay , here are my tips :
1. Read the comic before you start making the movie !
I know that it can be tempting .
With all those superhero movies making so much money , how can you resist making more ?
It does not really help , however , if you just randomly pick the superheroes that you think are the coollest , without knowing much beforehand , other than the fact that the hero has superpowers and his books get bought a lot .
If you know beforehand what you are getting yourselves into , you are better prepared to turn the movie into something great , and not just a superhero movie that feels exactly like every other superhero movie out there .
2 . Let your screenwriter read the comic !
This ons is even more important than the first one .
I know that the studio and the director mess with the script as much as they want , but the screenwriter is the guy who has to build the foundation .
If he does not know what he is writing about , how is anybody else involved with the movie going to know ?
Why not let them read every book ever made about a certain superhero , so that he can look for the best storylines to make into a movie ?
It 's not like he is going to complain .
Who would n't want to make money reading comic books all day ?
I would !
Hey , here 's a thought : why not let the screenwriter have a few talks with the people who write the comic ?
Or let them work together ?
3 . Do n't change too much !
Let 's say that you have read the comics , and that your screenwriter has also read the comics .
There 's a chance that you now get ideas that do n't have anything to do with the real comic , but which you think would be ' cool ' .
Do n't .
You have no idea what is cool .
If there 's a superhero out there who is loved by the fans , and whose books fly off the shelves , then that is a cool superhero .
That knowledge should be enough for you .
Do n't try to change the secret recipe that makes the hero so cool .
It just pisses everybody off .
4 . Hire directors who love the comic , or who at least know more than : ' He 's a guy in a spandex outfit '
Maybe you are shrugging your shoulders now and wondering why I 'm making such a fuss , but if you have a director who is passionate about the characters , you most of the times have a great movie .
Better yet : a great movie that will make you a lot of money !
Look at Batman Begins .
Or the X - Men movies .
And if you do n't believe me : look at Catwoman !
5 . Let your actors read at least a few years of issues
Maybe you are thinking now : " Why would they ?
They can read the script ! "
But since we both know that character development is something you do n't like to see in a superhero movie , it might be a good idea if you let the actors at least get an idea of where a character is coming from , and what his real motivation is .
6 . Do n't use words like ' new interpretation ' , they make us nervous !
If you want to make a new interpretation of a famous superhero who we all know and love , then why do n't you just invent your own and leave our favorites alone ?
7 . Do n't start thinking about sequels until you have finished the first one
More and more often , first movies are used as just the introduction for what is supposed to be a whole series of movies .
Everybody involved with The Fantastic Four used to say that all the time , and it pisses us off .
Because what if you make a movie about our favorite superhero , and it's not so good because you just wanted to establish the setting , and it turns out nobody is really interested in it and it does n't make any money , because it did n't have any depth .
8 . Do n't start hyping the movie before you greenlight it
This is really cruel of you .
In order to drum up interest in your movie as early as possible , so the fans can start buzzing about it , you just throw around names of superheroes you have bought the rights of , without actually having done anything with it yet .
And in most of these cases , nothing will ever happen .
Where is the Flash - movie ?
Aquaman ?
Watchmen ?
On second thought , maybe you should just leave that last one alone .
Remember how you murdered League of Extraordinary Gentlemen ?
9 . Do n't make the movies too serious
Yeah yeah yeah , I know that you love to portray superheroes as lonely , tortured souls , and sometimes we dig that kind of story .
But we also read comic books because they are fun , you know ?
We want great visuals , big fights and spectacular action scenes .
We do n't want angsty psycholigical babble .
I hope you wo n't mess up The Hulk a second time ...
10 . Treat Wonder Woman with respect
I 'm serious .
We let Catwoman slide because Batman Begins was so cool , but if you also mess up Wonder Woman , there will be thousands of angry fans at your door , and things wo n't be pretty .
So : leave the costume alone , do n't let Sandra Bullock play her ( no disrespect for her , but she just is n't Wonder Woman ) , do n't mess with her backstory and do n't mess with her costume .
Yeah , I know I said that last thing twice , but it 's important that she does not just look majestic and beautiful , but she 's also supposed to be hot , get it ?
I mean , even Superman is in love with her !

Have you ever wanted to learn to program , but just never had the time or money to invest in programming applications ?
Well Microsoft released a version of their programming apps for free .
In this tutorial , we are going to walkthrough installing VB 2005 Express Edition from Microsoft so that you can try to learn VB to help your create some applications .
After that you can continue on to the next tutorial to familiarize yourself with the interface .
Many people feel that VB is dumb language to learn because it is slow .
Well while VB is slow , I feel that VB can give you a good understanding of how programming works , which will help you learn more advanced languages , such as C++ or Java .
Now then , let ’s get started :
Go to the following link : http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/vb/ to download click on the download button at the top of the page , that is shown below :
Next , a window displaying the programming languages will be displayed .
Pick English within the Visual Basic 2005 Window as shown below :
Next , the download box comes up ( if you are using IE you may have to tell it to allow the file to be downloaded , by clicking on the bar at the top and clicking on “ Allow File ” ) , click on run to download the file to a temp folder .
The file we are downloading is not actually the application ; it is a tool that will download the application for us .
Once done downloading you will most likely see this :
Click on run to begin the installation and downloading of VB .
Once the file is done unpacking , it will launch the following screen :
This window just welcomes us to the setup .
If you would like to send anonymous information about your setup to MS , go ahead and check that box .
It will send info such as , hardware specs , time taken to install , options selected , and ect .
Click on next when we are ready to continue .
This is the EULA window .
Scroll through it or print it out to read through later .
Check the box that says you accept and then click on next .
This allows us to check what addition optional components we would like installed .
The top one will download the entire MSDN Library ( help files ) to your computer .
I think this is unnecessary b/ c the entire MSDN files are available through the web help .
It integrates web help into the help within the application , so you really do n’t benefit from it .
The bottom will download files to operate an SQL server to try out programs that use a database .
If you do n’t feel that you will ever want to do that , then do n’t download it .
Once you are ready to continue , click on next .
This window allows us to tell the installer where to put the system files .
Also it reminds you to be connected to the internet before continuing .
Once ready , click on next to continue .
This window is the downloading window .
This will download all needed components and then continue with the installation .
Once there are all check marks underneath the left column you can disconnect from the internet .
Once the downloads complete , it will begin installing the application (s ) .
It may need to reboot several times during installation .
It will automatically resume installation once a reboot has been completed .
Upon restarting , you might see this window before it starts installing again :
This is normal .
Once the install is completed you will see the following :
This window gives you the chance to register now .
Registration is free and MUST be done within 30 days or the software will de-activate .
They just require your name , e-mail , and address .
Once you are done , click on finish , and then you are ready to begin using the app .
Thank - you for viewing this tutorial .
Flush twice .
It 's required at Calvin College 's Vincent and Helen Bunker Interpretive Center 's restrooms ; once before , once after .
The flushed water , which is the consistency of a bubble bath , washes waste to an underground room .
There , preserve manager Cheryl Hoogewind and I climb up on a metal receptacle and look into a huge bin of waste that smells pleasantly of wood chips .
This compost will eventually be spread as fertilizer on the college grounds .
Above us in the 5,000 - square - foot building , a student - designed solar photovoltaic system generates electricity from sunlight ; meanwhile , gray water from drinking fountains and sinks nourishes plants lining the classroom windowsills .
It 's all part of the Bunker Center 's environmental sustainability .
Integrating creation care with academics is a growing emphasis on Christian campuses around the country .
According to Paul Corts , president of the interdenominational Council for Christian Colleges and Universities ( CCCU ) , about 40 of 105 North American member schools have adopted significant green initiatives .
These vary considerably , from multimillion - dollar sustainable " villages " and student volunteer educational programs to majors in environmental studies and recycling pop cans in school cafeterias .
There is also national action .
Last November , 30 Christian college students met in Washington , D.C. , to present elected officials with the Evangelical Youth Climate Initiative ( EYCI ) , signed by 1,500 Christian students .
EYCI is an independent effort of young evangelicals to follow up on last February 's Evangelical Climate Initiative ( ECI ) , signed by 86 Christian leaders ( including 39 Christian college presidents ) .

Hybridizing Java
by Bruce Eckel
January 31 , 2007
Summary
The Java backlash has been building up steam , and we ’re starting to see some fundamental shifts because of it .

Several of Bruce Tate ’s books focused on the flaws in Java and the need to let go of some of the ideas that have n’t worked out .
And blogs like this and this have been appearing more frequently .
And of course there ’s Steve Jobs now - famous quote ( referring to the iPhone ) : “ Java ’s not worth building in .
Nobody uses Java anymore .
It ’s this big heavyweight ball and chain . ”
This backlash has only been necessary because of Sun ’s death grip on the idea of ubiquitous , omniscient Java .
It was admirable once , but a language only evolves if its designers and advocates can acknowledge problems .
Pretending that a language is successful in places where it ’s not is just denial .
Some adaptations have occurred .
Finally admitting that EJBs have cost the world enormously , the EJB3 team took lessons from Hibernate and Spring , but not enough to really fix the problem .
Most people seem to find that Hibernate and Spring are still simpler and more straightforward than EJB3 , so the lack of a rush back to a technology that had such a heavy cost in the past should n’t be a surprise .
Java 5 was a tacit admission that Microsoft was doing some very interesting things with C# , and proposed features in Java 7 support the idea that Java is now playing catch - up with C# 3.0 .
Competition is good , and Java is not dead .
It continues to evolve , and the appearance of new languages built on the JVM , like JRuby , Scala and Groovy , is a sign of vitality in the world of Java .
The Web is a Mess
Seeing possibilities is great , but the downside is that it can be hard to acknowledge when something is n’t working .
The concept of the web was visionary , but much of the web is a failure .
Yes , we ’ve been able to force it to work .
But it could hardly be said to “ work well . ”
In particular , applications of any complexity using HTML , CSS and JavaScript are difficult and expensive to develop , and it seems virtually impossible to get identical appearances across browsers .
Even simple pages look different because of font issues .
If you use Firefox , how many sites do you visit that are at least partially unreadable because they ’ve been created only for Internet Explorer ( IE ) ?
It seems to me that things are getting worse ; I ’m seeing more , not less sites that do n’t work right with Firefox … to the point that I ’m seriously considering going back to IE .
The noble promise of CSS has not panned out .
After years , it ’s still implemented inconsistently across browsers .
As long as you ’re using HTML and CSS , you ’ll always wonder if what you ’ve created is going to produce an unpleasant effect on different browsers .
Browsers other than IE or Firefox can often get it even worse .
JavaScript has been around since , effectively , the beginning of the Web , but the browser wars made JavaScript inconsistent and thus painful to use .
A key part of Ajax is that someone has gone to the trouble of figuring out cross-platform JavaScript issues so you can ignore the often radical inconsistencies between different browsers .
There are two problems with this approach .
The first is that JavaScript is limited in what it can do .
Although Ajax is an excellent hack that gets the last bit of mileage from JavaScript , it is nonetheless a hack , and the end is in sight .
The second problem is that you are relying on Ajax libraries to handle cross - browser issues .
If you want to write your own code , you must become an expert on those issues , and at that point much of the leverage of Ajax goes away .
Ajax improves the experience a lot , but it has limits and I suspect we ’ve already seen most of the tricks that Ajax is going to offer .
Even more impressive is the Google Web Toolkit ( GWT ) which translates type - checked Java into cross-platform JavaScript in order to speed the development process .
You write code in Java , and GWT compiles it into cross - browser JavaScript .
JavaScript , then , becomes the intermediate code that will run on all platforms .
But it took Google ’s brain trust to solve the problems that should n’t have happened in the first place .
And if the library you need is n’t there , you must , again , be a cross- platform JavaScript expert in order to write new code .
As brilliant as GWT is , I think it will still run out of gas due to the inherent limitations of JavaScript and browsers .
We do see relatively amazing Ajax - based tools like GMail and the other Google tools which are slowly seducing me ( but I repeat : it took Google to create those , not Joe garage - programmer ) .
Very nice , but is this the best you ever want to see on the web ?
You ’re seeing , if not the limit , then very close to it in those applications , and even then they do n’t work consistently ( yes , I know Google tools are “ still in beta ” ) .
In GMail , for example , you ’re supposed to be able to press keys like ‘r ’ to reply to a message .
Sometimes this works , often it does n’t , to the point where it ’s maddening .
And more and more often , when I use web applications like GMail , my “ control - c ” copy operation stops working .
It could be Windows , Firefox , JavaScript or something else but it seems to be associated with web apps and it ’s been happening for at least a year .
And frankly I do n’t care why it ’s happening , and neither does any other consumer .
When things this simple are broken , the outlook is not promising .
How much effort must we expend to compensate for the long sequence of misguided decisions that has produced today ’s web ?
Rich Internet Applications
At some point we must ask why Java applets have n’t become ubiquitous on the internet as the client - side standard for RIAs ( Rich Internet Applications ) .
This is an especially poignant question because Gosling and team justified rushing Java out the door ( thus casting in stone many poorly - considered decisions ) so that it could enable the internet revolution .
That ’s why the AWT and Applets were thrown in at the last second , reportedly taking a month from conception to completion .
Bill Venners quotes Patrick Naughton as saying : “ It was a timing issue , there was only about a three - month window in which the whole Java phenomenon could have happened .
We barely made it . ”
I ’ve heard that argument before , [ 1 ] and this attitude always seems to be a mistake when building programming languages .
You ’re creating the fundamental architecture that you hope people will adopt and use for many years .
This is the place that requires careful thought , not rushing .
I can see why the Green Team took this attitude : it ’s the Microsoft Way .
Throw a product out there in order to get your foot in the window .
The product does n’t have to be perfect ; it just has to hold the market space .
Over time , you can fix up any flaws that occurred from rushing the thing out .
It ’s the marketing version of agile methods .
This approach is workable for dynamic languages .
One of the most popular languages ever , Visual Basic , has evolved over the years .
Python has fixed some things that would even break old code , in order to clean up the language .
Reportedly Ruby is planning to do the same thing .
But for static languages with a large code base ( verbose languages in particular ) , fixing things up does n’t seem to work so well .
All the code must be recompiled and possibly changed — although I would argue that Java could have taken the Python approach : just do n’t upgrade if you do n’t want to change .
There are lots of companies that do n’t upgrade to newer Java versions , anyway .
The Installation Problem
So Java has been around for 10 years and applets are not the primary way that we interact with the web .
I think the main reason for this is the installation problem , another area of Java that was n’t well thought - out .
In fact , why do we like Ajax ?
It ’s clearly not because JavaScript is so easy to work with — JavaScript cross- platform problems are the reason people have avoided it in the past .
Ajax is popular because we know that the necessary software for the client side is already installed .
Someone had to figure out how to deal with the cross- platform issues for JavaScript first , but if JRE installation was trivial , everyone might have just created Java applets .
But they did n’t , applets are not ubiquitous , and everyone got excited about Ajax instead .
So Ajax became the favored technology for RIAs .
Although it ’s gotten significantly better with ECMAScript standardization , I would still rather program with Java than JavaScript , the main reason being inconsistency .
Maybe in eight years the current version of ECMAScript will be standard across almost all browsers .
But the current version of JavaScript , despite the random implementations , is already available , and there are zero installation issues .
I think that ’s a fairly good proof that the reason Java has n’t taken over as the RIA language of choice is the installation problem .
Various fixes have been attempted for Java over the years , but I think the basic issue is that whoever is trying to solve the installation problem is someone who has a more inward technical focus rather than what ’s really needed : an outward user - experience focus .
For example , I was stymied by early Linux distributions because of the challenge of installation .
About once a year , I would try to install Linux , and it would immediately start asking me questions .
Only a hard - core Linux geek would know the answers to these questions .
I could n’t even fake my way through , so I would give up and try again the next year .
Then Red Hat came along ( at least , I think they were the first to focus on the installation experience ) and set it up to install Linux without asking questions , or at least to give me reasonable defaults .
That ’s when Linux started becoming popular ( more recently , Ubuntu seems to have taken the lead in solving the Linux friendliness problem ) .
Installing the JRE requires the end user to answer questions .
To a techie , the answer to these questions is easy or obvious , but to the rest of the web users , questions frighten them during installation .
Here ’s an article , and comments , that illustrates the problem with Java installations .
Although this article is primarily complaining about updates , there is also a lot of confusion about keeping old versions of Java around .
Here ’s another “ installation matters ” blog .
JNLP , a.k.a.
Java WebStart , was supposed to solve some of these problems to create easy - install desktop applications .
I think the reason that JNLP has n’t become commonly used can be summed up by looking at https://aerith.dev.java.net/, a page for one of the flagship “ Cool JavaOne Demos . ”
If you click on the JNLP version link on that page , it will appear to start up , downloading a bunch of stuff and asking you questions .
And then it does nothing .
No error messages or any information to tell you what happened .
Repeated attempts yield the same results , only faster because the requisite files have already been downloaded .
At least , that was my experience .
If it worked for you , I ’d say that ’s even worse — it randomly works on some platforms and not others .
How do you debug such a thing ?
It ’s not impossible to build GUI applications with Java , but it ’s been 10 years and there are still installation hiccups with applets , Java WebStart , and regular applications .
After 10 years , people do n’t trust it anymore .
If it ’s not there after 10 years , then I ’m going to go out on a limb and say that someone does n’t consider this problem important enough to fix .
And even if they did , there have been so many bad experiences among consumers that it would take years to get the trust back .
Experience with Java Applets and Applications
The initial user experience with AWT did a lot to dampen the enthusiasm about Sun ’s Java fanfare , and I do n’t think applets ever recovered .
As a result , Java never became mainstream for RIAs .
Even now , I ’ve had bad experiences trying to run Java applets from a web site .
They just fail , with no clue as to what ’s gone wrong .
Worse , they can sometimes leave cruft behind that has even prevented Firefox from opening new windows , until I reboot the machine .
A common response to the “ applets are dead ” statement is “ No they ’re not .
I still use them . ”
Applets are n’t useless ; people still create very impressive things with them .
The Java Posse highlights one or more applets each week .
The statement should instead read , “ Applets are dead for Web RIAs . ”
The installation process for the JRE and for any particular applet is not reliable enough for anyone to depend on them for a general - purpose website .
Desktop applications have also suffered , and left bad marks on Java in general , further sullying applets by association .
I had an experience with a Java product called Memorex exPressit .
The UI was terrible and buggy .
I had a contrasting experience with the Logitech IO pen support software ( written in . NET ) , which worked cleanly and looked nice .
You could argue that the Memorex programmer (s ) were just inexperienced , but the Logitech software was just a small application that worked well without , it seems , any Herculean efforts on the part of the programmer (s ) , whereas it ’s hard to think of any application that I use on a regular basis that ’s written in Java .
Eclipse is a brilliant piece of software , but I think “ Herculean effort ” applies .
Consider Corel ’s attempt to create a word processor using Java ( I do n’t remember whether they were trying to port WordPerfect or write something from scratch ) .
It was obviously too early to try it , since all they had was the AWT .
But only obvious in hindsight — if you were listening to Sun ’s marketing hype at the time , it was the right choice .
Shrugging it off as no big deal does n’t work , because this kind of failure scares people away from doing things in Java .
OpenOffice is not written in Java , but in C ++.
I do n’t believe it was because the programmers wanted to struggle with the cross - platform issues presented by C ++.
It was speed , and perhaps the need to more directly control the underlying platform .
Despite the party line that has always come out of Sun ( Many years ago , I attended a press conference where Gosling stated that “ Java has always been as fast or faster than C++ , ” something that puzzles me to this day ) , Java is not the right solution for all problems .
Not Cross - Platform Enough
I struggled for years to deal with cross-platform problems for products like the Hands - On Java CD .
It ’s effectively the same as the RIA problem , because I want installation to be as easy as possible , I want everything to work seamlessly the first time , and I do n’t want to be forced to deal with platform issues .
Often my solutions would work , but sometimes customers would email saying that it was n’t working on their machine , and I had no idea what the problem was .
The best I could do is say “ try it on a different machine , ” and often that solved the problem … whatever the problem was .
I never want to hear things like this ; I just want everything to work .
My primary goal has been to create a slide - and - audio content delivery system , like you see in the Hands - On Java CD ROM or Thinking in C .
Java , with its promise of write - once , run everywhere , was an attractive contender .
Unfortunately there were , at least at the time , significant delays in Linux support ( and to a lesser degree , Mac support ) .
Linux and Mac users may be in the minority , but they are vocal .
The show - stopper was Java ’s lack of support for MP3s and multimedia in general .
As Dick Wall of the Java Posse has pointed out numerous times , the Java Media Framework ( JMF ) has been virtually ignored for many years .
At the time I made my initial decisions , there was no support for any kind of compressed sound format ( I would have been willing to use something other than MP3 ) .
Even now the only support for MP3s is through open - source software , which is great in concept , but I do n’t want to test it and discover platform issues — again , I just want it to work ; the only thing I want to hear from customers is “ great ! ”
It seemed like the only thing that might work was the RealPlayer , so I used that for the HOJ CD , 2nd edition .
But the RealPlayer installation process is always trying to trick you into buying the paid version ; I must tell people how to find the free version .
And it ’s intrusive — it takes over MP3s even though you tell it not to .
And for all that , the RealPlayer is unreliable .
The installation occasionally causes problems , and I get emails from people .
I generally have no idea what ’s causing the problem — which is frustrating — and the customer is usually convinced that there ’s something wrong with the CD .
The Daily Show , for years , used RealPlayer and it was not only painful because it was always starting and stopping ( you could n’t download everything beforehand ; it forced you to stream ) , but it always had these streaks on the left side of the picture .
Now Comedy Central has changed to a new system but that only works intermittently .
So I end up just waiting for them to be posted on YouTube .
The Flash Solution
So here ’s my question .
Allow for a moment the possibility that , after 10 years , Java is not going to take over the world of RIAs .
Further allow that Ajax is just “ how JavaScript was supposed to work in the first place , ” but that the limitations imposed by browsers , HTML and CSS committees seem unlikely to let it expand beyond its current bounds .
What are we going to use to build RIAs ?
In my own search , I ’d really like such a system to solve not just some , but all of my UI problems .
If I ’m going to go to the trouble of learning it , I do n’t want to run into a wall just when I start to develop some speed .
That ’s happened plenty of times already .
The only obvious solution is Flash .
Flash has always been all about cross-platform multimedia experiences and user interfaces .
People are very familiar and comfortable with Flash , and it is installed on almost all machines in the world .
It ’s trusted , stable and reliable .
Installation is a no- brainer for everyone .
You do n’t have to answer questions or do anything special ; it just works .
That ’s why it ’s already ubiquitous .
Current and future versions of Flash are now released concurrently for the three main platforms ( yes , except for 64 - bit Linux , but they ’re working on it and that user base typically has more than one computer , and so has alternatives in the meantime ) .
The standard Flash installation plays MP3s and various types of video , so you ’re not stuck with “ write - once , run everywhere … except for multimedia . ”
And you ca n’t deny that Flash produces very pleasing user interfaces .
What did Flickr and Picasa both use ?
Not Java , not Ajax , but Flash .
Google videos , written with Ajax , must not have been going anywhere because they bought YouTube , which uses Flash .
Even the most die - hard Swing fan secretly wishes their UI could look this good , especially without all the extra work Swing would require .
There ’s a very impressive Flash web app called Gliffy that imitates Visio ( this was created with OpenLaszlo , which I ’ll mention later ) .
No one could even think of creating something like that with Ajax , although someone did an imitation of the much simpler Microsoft Paint using HTML , CSS and JavaScript .
Very impressive , but you get the sense that this is close to the limit of what those technologies can do , whereas Flash would just be getting started .
Plus the Paint clone is a bit slow and clunky and the UI is inconsistent across browsers .
While amazing things have been accomplished within the confines of JavaScript with technologies like Ajax , JSON , GWT etc. , these are nonetheless confines .
We bump up against their limits every day , and those limits are not going away .
Solving the UI problem
One of the difficulties of GUI programming is choosing a GUI library .
Sometimes there ’s a standard library , but that can change .
In Java , we started with AWT , which turned out to be a mistake so we had to be patient as Swing was developed , until IBM and Eclipse came along and offered us the additional choice of SWT .
In Python , there are many GUI libraries , including the built - in Tkinter ( which reduces the installation problem ) , WxPython , Qt , and more .
Windows - specific libraries have similar choices , but if you want to create cross- platform applications , those libraries are n’t available .
If you explore these GUI libraries , as I have , you run the risk of getting broad knowledge that is not particularly deep .
Each library requires significant effort to learn , and each seems to have its own philosophy regarding the activities that should be easy , and those that should only be possible .
Each one looks at the world of GUI programming in a different way .
I ’d like to be able to learn one solution and use it for all my applications .
That way I could stop learning about GUI solutions and start acquiring some depth .
Ideally , this will be a real programming language with consistent results across all platforms .
I believe that to solve the user interface problem , we need the equivalent of a domain - specific language dedicated to the user experience .
For me , Flash - based technologies like Flex are the best solution to this problem .
( Full disclosure : I ’m in the process of working out a consulting contract with Adobe , to help them teach people about Flex .
But long before this , I became convinced that Flash , and Flex in particular , was the best solution for the user - interface problem , and I began writing this article long before Adobe expressed interest in my assistance ) .
What is Flex ?
Traditionally , Flash content and applications have been created with the Flash authoring tool , currently called Flash 8 Professional ( it ’s confusing , but the decision to give the name of the tool the same name as the runtime was made ten years ago ) .
There was also a tool called Macromedia Director , a multimedia production tool for CD - ROMs , which predates Flash and outputs a format called Shockwave that runs in a Plug - In / ActiveX control much like Flash content , but is an entirely different control .
Shockwave had its heyday , and it is still widely used , especially for games , but Flash is much lighter weight and achieved mainstream adoption far beyond Director .
Flex is a way to develop Flash applications by programming .
It includes a declarative XML language called MXML for laying out user interfaces , and a programming language called ActionScript , which is a superset of ECMAScript ( that is , standardized JavaScript ) , with extra features like optional static type checking .
ActionScript is a single language that works across all platforms , so you do n’t have to worry about differences .
Because it is based on ECMAScript , your JavaScript knowledge is not lost .
All MXML components are actually written in ActionScript , which is what you use if you want to write your own components .
Flex applications compile directly into SWFs ( Flash binaries ) , which are then Just - In - Time ( JIT ) compiled by the Flash runtime , for extra speed .
Cost was one of the main things that originally held me back from using Flex , primarily because of readers who were unwilling or unable to pay it .
In the initial versions of Flex , you had to buy the server edition just to create static SWFs .
The server edition is designed for dynamic content , and is certainly worth the money for larger organizations that are creating dynamic SWFs from databases and the like .
But there was no reasonable entry point for people who just wanted to experiment with it .
It was hard for me to recommend it if the average person did n’t have a reasonable experimentation path , including creating static SWFs to deliver from their own server .
Now , however , you can download the free command - line Flex compiler to create static SWFs , and you can deliver these from your web site without paying any fees .
The compiler , framework , and debugger are all free , so there ’s no reason to avoid using Flex .
You can buy the Flex Builder IDE to help you create Flex apps .
This is built on top of the Eclipse platform ( instead of creating a new GUI development system from scratch — a wise approach ) .
It has the usual sorts of things we ’ve come to expect , like auto completion , context help , debugging , and even a GUI layout tool .
The layout tool can give you a quick start when you ’re beginning a design , although I found it more valuable to hand - tune the code once the rough draft of the design was in place .
Here ’s something else that caused me trouble in the past : although the Flash player for Windows and the Mac have always been on the same release schedule , Flash for Linux has formerly been released quite a bit later .
I did n’t know this until I put out the first beta of the Thinking in C eSeminar , and got complaints from Linux and Mac people about it .
After some investigation , I decided to back - port the application ( which is n’t that fancy , and does n’t make use of any features that do n’t exist in Flash 7 ) .
This seemed to be the best solution for me , because I did n’t have to wait for a final release of the newer version of Flash , and in particular I did n’t have to worry about Linux .
One of my main goals for using Flash in the first place was to make the use of this application transparent across platforms , and to reduce any installation issues to a minimum .
However , with Flash 9 and beyond , all the players will be released within weeks of each other , and this policy should hold for future versions of Flash .
So now you do n’t have to worry about complaints from anyone .
Build your UI with Flex , and it will “ just work . ”
Flex as a DSL for Graphics
One of the most appealing things about Flex is that Flash was created with the idea of UI first .
In a very real sense , it ’s a domain - specific language ( DSL ) for graphics , multimedia , and UIs , whereas most other solutions have been languages with UI libraries tacked on afterwards .
Because of this design goal , Flex and Flash provide a complete , unlimited , flexible tool to build user experiences .
From the standpoint of a programmer ’s time investment , you can learn a single language for building UIs without worrying about running into problems or limitations later — issues like :
Installation problems
Constraints on what you can create
Sudden steep climbs in the learning curve
There are plenty of fancy components that you can just drop in and use — the Flex Framework ( part of the free download ) comes with over 100 components .
There ’s an active marketplace for component creators , both open - source and payware .
One such library comes from Adobe : the Flex Charting Components ( in the few hundred dollar range ) , but there are also competing charting components .
One of the more interesting aspects of Ajax , of course , is the “ A ” for “ asynchronous . ”
This allows information to flow between client and server without doing a whole page refresh .
For Flash , a much more sophisticated version of this is provided by Flex Data Services , a publish / subscribe API for data management .
Flex Data Services automatically performs caching and updating between client and server , to produce an optimal experience without forcing you to write extra code .
This allows you to work with real - time data , build collaborative applications , and perform enterprise messaging integration .
You can use Flex Data Services on a single CPU for free ; if your application requires multiple CPUs you ’re considered an enterprise and the licensing fee kicks in .
You can learn more about Flex Data Services here .
Earlier I mentioned Gliffy , which was built using OpenLaszlo .
OpenLaszlo was especially attractive before the Flex compiler and framework became free .
However , the OpenLaszlo group has decided that they will accommodate the lowest common denominator technologies by targeting DHTML combined with Flash , and this incorporates the limitations of DHTML .
The reason Flex is compelling to me is that it allows me to take advantage of things I ca n’t do in the normal browser and those things produce the same results , everywhere .
On top of this , Flex is magnitudes faster than OpenLaszlo because it takes advantage of the JIT compiler in Flash 9 .
Since Flex is now free , there ’s no reason not to go to the source .
Flex on the Desktop
Of course , if my dream is to be able to learn a single GUI system in depth , is Flex the right tool , since it was originally designed for web RIAs ?
A Flex UI can initiate communication with its server , or any other server it chooses .
A server cannot initiate communication with a Flex UI , which makes sense because of security ( it would be effectively the same as having an open port on your machine ) .
However , a Flex UI is not limited to communicating with a server .
It can also communicate with a local application .
Thus , you can create an application in any language you prefer , even a dynamic language like Python or Ruby , and use Flex to build a beautiful UI .
Adobe is developing a new tool called Apollo , a cross -OS runtime that allows you to use Flex to create desktop RIAs .
This means that your Flex skills can be further employed for creating smooth desktop applications , but it also means that you can more easily build applications that will work on both web and desktop ( I ’ve seen expensive and difficult - to - use tools that allow other languages to do this ) .
Hybridizing Java
It ’s clear that we ca n’t wait for Sun to fix all of Java ’s problems .
Open - sourcing Java might , eventually , have a huge impact on repairing Java ’s deficiencies .
For example , work on the JMF might get resurrected .
Maybe installation issues will even be fixed someday .
The possibilities might be limitless , but if you need to solve problems now , then the solution is to hybridize parts of the language .
We do this already .
You do n’t insist on using a Java database for an application ; you use a specialized system like MySQL or Oracle .
Sun is directly supporting the development of JRuby for hybrid Java / JRuby programming .
We are seeing other special - purpose languages arise to solve specialized problems .
Why insist on using a Java library for UI if a specialized system solves the problem better ?
As shown in the TurboGears - Flex demo I created with James Ward , it ’s possible to use a language like Python ( or Java , Ruby , C# , etc. ) as a back - end and build your user interface using Flex .
This can even be achieved for desktop applications ( even more so with the upcoming Apollo tool ) .
You can learn all about Flex , and download it , at http://www.flex.org/.
This is an incredibly comprehensive site with lots of examples , tutorials and screencasts .
They even have an online Flex compiler for instant experimentation .
There ’s an in - depth presentation that James Ward gave about developing with Flex .
And here is a screencast that I did with James Ward , that shows how to use Flex as a front - end for Java server applications .
You can now create a low - cost , powerful combination of Java on the server ( which can of course be running Linux on commodity hardware ) and an interactive Flash interface on the client .

In particular , when I took the necessary time to write Thinking in Java , many , many people said “ there are hundreds of Java books out already , you ’ve missed the window , it ’s not worth it . ”

THE EMERGING DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY ?…. Matt Yglesias is right : this is an interesting chart .
( It ’s too big to post on the blog , so you ’ll have to click on the link to see it . )
The theory behind it , I guess , is that the political climate when you ’re age 20 affects your party preference for your entire life .
The hypothesis would go something like this : popular presidents produce a swing among 20 - year - olds to their own party , and unpopular ones produce a swing in the other direction .
A look at the chart suggests this is almost true .
If you push the whole thing forward by about four years , so that you ’re looking at 24 - year - olds , it looks to me like the administrations of FDR , Truman , Kennedy / Johnson , and Clinton produced swings toward Democrats , while Jimmy Carter did n’t .
Likewise , Eisenhower , Reagan , and Bush Sr. produced swings toward Republicans , while Nixon / Ford , and Bush Jr. did n’t .
The political climate during your early 20s seems to scar you for life .
Of course , what ’s really most remarkable about the chart is the fantastic shift toward the Democrats in the 20 - 30 age group .
The delta among this cohort between Democrats and Republicans is about +15 in the Democrats ’ favor , a bigger number than even the Vietnam / Watergate generation .
It looks to me like the Christian right ’s social neanderthalism is causing the Republican Party to lose a generation forever .
The US has refused to join an international treaty to cut emissions
In a report , they say global warming poses a serious threat to national security , as the US could be drawn into wars over water and other conflicts .
They appear to criticise President George W Bush 's refusal to join an international treaty to cut emissions .
Among the 11 authors are ex-Army chief of staff Gordon Sullivan and Mr Bush 's ex-Mid-East peace envoy Anthony Zinni .
The report says the US " must become a more constructive partner " with other nations to fight global warming and deal with its consequences .
It warns that over the next 30 to 40 years , there will be conflicts over water resources , as well as increased instability resulting from rising sea levels and global warming - related refugees .
" The chaos that results can be an incubator of civil strife , genocide and the growth of terrorism , " the 35 - page report predicts .
' Pay now - or later '
Writing in the report , Gen Zinni , a former commander of US Central Command , says : " It 's not hard to make the connection between climate change and instability , or climate change and terrorism . "
He adds : " We will pay for this one way or another .
We will pay to reduce greenhouse gas emissions today , and we 'll have to take an economic hit of some kind .
" Or we will pay the price later in military terms .
And that will involve human lives .
There will be a human toll . "
The report was issued by a Virginia - based national security think - tank , The CNA Corporation , and was written by six retired admirals and five retired generals .
Climate scientists broadly endorsed the report .
But Stanford scientist Terry Root , a joint author of this month 's international scientific report on the effects of global warming on life on Earth , said its timescale might be too alarmist , as some of the predicted events - while likely to occur - could take longer than 30 years to happen .
The Dan Brown code
Approximately three people still have n't read Dan Brown 's The Da Vinci Code : Mark Liberman , David Lupher , and reportedly at least one other person ( as yet unidentified ) . *
Regrettably , neither Barbara nor I are able to claim that the third non-reader is one of us .
What can I say by way of excuse for this ?
I found the book was on sale really cheap in CostCo when we were about to leave on a trip to Europe .
I bought it for the long , long flights that lay ahead of us , without knowing much about it except that it was supposed to be an intellectual mystery with cryptography and symbology and stuff and the blurbs said it was great .
I did n't open it , I just grabbed one off a pallet of about 500 copies .
Barbara was between mysteries at the time , so she grabbed it from me and rapidly read it over the next couple of days before we even left for the airport .
I asked hopefully what it was like .
She scowled and said something about the Hardy Boys .
My heart sank ; I understood her to mean it was pathetic but possibly of interest to the 11 - year - old market .
By the time we were on our plane she had made sure that her flight bag contained a new novel by Menking Hannell , and over southern Oregon she told me it was great as usual .
Unfortunately I had no better idea of what to do with my time , so I opened The Da Vinci Code .
I am still trying to come up with a fully convincing account of just what it was about his very first sentence , indeed the very first word , that told me instantly that I was in for a very bad time stylistically .
The Da Vinci Code may well be the only novel ever written that begins with the word renowned .
Here is the paragraph with which the book opens .
The scene ( says a dateline under the chapter heading , ' Prologue ' ) is the Louvre , late at night :
Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum 's Grand Gallery .
He lunged for the nearest painting he could see , a Caravaggio .
Grabbing the gilded frame , the seventy - six - year - old man heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and Saunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas .
I think what enabled the first word to tip me off that I was about to spend a number of hours in the company of one of the worst prose stylists in the history of literature was this .
Putting curriculum vitae details into complex modifiers on proper names or definite descriptions is what you do in journalistic stories about deaths ; you just do n't do it in describing an event in a narrative .
So this might be reasonable text for the opening of a newspaper report the next day :
Renowned curator Jacques Saunière died last night in the Louvre at the age of 76 .
But Brown packs such details into the first two words of an action sequence  details of not only his protagonist 's profession but also his prestige in the field .
It does n't work here .
It has the ring of utter ineptitude .
The details have no relevance , of course , to what is being narrated ( Saunière is fleeing an attacker and pulls down the painting to trigger the alarm system and the security gates ) .
We could have deduced that he would be fairly well known in the museum trade from the fact that he was curating at the Louvre .
The writing goes on in similar vein , committing style and word choice blunders in almost every paragraph ( sometimes every line ) .
Look at the phrase " the seventy - six - year - old man " .
It 's a complete let - down : we knew he was a man  the anaphoric pronoun " he " had just been used to refer to him .
( This is perhaps where " curator " could have been slipped in for the first time , without " renowned " , if the passage were rewritten . )
Look at " heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and Saunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas . "
We do n't need to know it 's a masterpiece ( it 's a Caravaggio hanging in the Louvre , that should be enough in the way of credentials , for heaven 's sake ) .
Surely " toward him " feels better than " toward himself " ( though I guess both are grammatical here ) .
Surely " tore from the wall " should be " tore away from the wall " .
Surely a single man can't fall into a heap ( there 's only him , that 's not a heap ) .
And why repeat the name " Saunière " here instead of the pronoun " he " ?
Who else is around ?
( Caravaggio has n't been mentioned ; " a Caravaggio " uses the name as an attributive modifier with conventionally elided head noun " painting " .
That is n't a mention of the man . )
Well , actually , there is someone else around , but we only learn that three paragraphs down , after " a thundering iron gate " has fallen ( by the way , it 's the fall that makes a thundering noise : there 's no such thing as a thundering gate ) .
" The curator " ( his profession is now named a second time in case you missed it ) " ... crawled out from under the canvas and scanned the cavernous space for someplace to hide " ( the colloquial American " someplace " seems very odd here as compared with standard " somewhere " ) .
Then :
A voice spoke , chillingly close .
" Do not move . "
On his hands and knees , the curator froze , turning his head slowly .
Only fifteen feet away , outside the sealed gate , the mountainous silhouette of his attacker stared through the iron bars .
He was broad and tall , with ghost - pale skin and thinning white hair .
His irises were pink with dark red pupils .
Just count the infelicities here .
A voice does n't speak a person speaks ; a voice is what a person speaks with .
" Chillingly close " would be right in your ear , whereas this voice is fifteen feet away behind the thundering gate .
The curator ( do we really need to be told his profession a third time ? ) cannot slowly turn his head if he has frozen ; freezing ( as a voluntary human action ) means temporarily ceasing all muscular movements .
And crucially , a silhouette does not stare !
A silhouette is a shadow .
If Saunière can see the man 's pale skin , thinning hair , iris color , and red pupils ( all at fifteen feet ) , the man cannot possibly be in silhouette .
Brown 's writing is not just bad ; it is staggeringly , clumsily , thoughtlessly , almost ingeniously bad .
In some passages scarcely a word or phrase seems to have been carefully selected or compared with alternatives .
I slogged through 454 pages of this syntactic swill , and it never gets much better .
Why did I keep reading ?
Because London Heathrow is a long way from San Francisco International , and airline magazines are thin , and two - month - old Hollywood drivel on a small screen hanging two seats in front of my row did not appeal , that 's why .
And why did I keep the book instead of dropping it into a Heathrow trash bin ?
Because it seemed to me to be such a fund of lessons in how not to write .
I do n't think I 'd want to say these things about a first - time novelist , it would seem a cruel blow to a budding career .
But Dan Brown is all over the best - seller lists now .
In paperback and hardback , and in many languages , he is a phenomenon .
He is up there with the Stephen Kings and the John Grishams and nothing I say can conceivably harm him .
He is a huge , blockbuster , worldwide success who can go anywhere he wants and need never work again .
And he writes like the kind of freshman student who makes you want to give up the whole idea of teaching .
Never mind the ridiculous plot and the stupid anagrams and puzzle clues as the book proceeds , this is a terrible , terrible example of the thriller - writer 's craft .
Which brings us to the question of the blurbs .
" Dan Brown has to be one of the best , smartest , and most accomplished writers in the country , " said Nelson DeMille , a bestselling author who has himself hit the # 1 spot in the New York Times list .
Unbelievable mendacity .
And there are four other similar pieces of praise on the back cover .
Together those blurbs convinced me to put this piece of garbage on the CostCo cart along with the the 72 - pack of toilet rolls .
Thriller writers must have a code of honor that requires that they all praise each other 's new novels , a kind of omerta that enjoins them to silence about the fact that some fellow member of the guild has given evidence of total stylistic cluelessness .
A fraternal code of silence .
We could call it ... the Da Vinci code ; or the Dan Brown code .

* The third non-reader was unknown when this post was first drafted , but it has since been edited , and as of today ( May 2 , 2004 ) I can confirm that Bill Poser and Danny Yee are both claiming not to have read The Da Vinci Code .
Fair enough .
So at least four people have not read it .
I just wish one of them was me .

Beautiful code , test - first Jamis 37 comments
Latest by danielle
I was talking with a friend recently and discovered we have a failing in common : we both have a tendency towards a peculiar form of perfectionism .
He was telling me how he feels like he has to sit and tweak his code over and over until it not only acts right , but looks right .
It can not be merely functional , it must be beautiful , as well .
I ’d never before thought about it , but I realized that the way I keep this tendency from dominating me is to write my code test - first .
I constrain the behavior of my unborn code with tests , and find that it leaves me free to consider the esthetics of the solution as I work .
Otherwise , I have to waste effort playing with the cotton - candy cloud of requirements , making sure the code I ’m writing is satisfying those nebulous demands , and that in turn distracts from the higher - level concerns .
This has the side - effect of making me happier and more productive in my job .
When the code I ’m working in is ugly , or messy , I ’m less inclined to do good work there .
It ’s like having to hang a picture in a messy room — what does it matter if the picture is a little crooked , in the midst of so much chaos ?
It ’s demoralizing .
On the other hand , if the code is clean , concise , and attractive , I will work harder to keep the code in that state .
I ’m happier doing it , too .
My morale remains high .
I encouraged my friend to give test - first development a try , for a month .
If you have n’t tried it for at least a full month , you ought to take the challenge , too .
Ms Miers been a trusted and loyal adviser to Mr Bush
White House spokesman Tony Snow said President George W Bush reluctantly accepted her resignation , which takes effect on 31 January .
Mr Snow said a search for a successor was under way .
Mr Bush nominated Ms Miers in October 2005 to the Supreme Court , but she had to drop out after lawmakers questioned her qualifications .
Asked why she was quitting her job , Mr Snow said that " basically , she has been here six years " .
" As somebody said earlier today ' She put 12 years of service into six years , ' " Mr Snow said .
Court debacle
Ms Miers - who has no judicial experience - was nominated by President Bush to the Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor .
But she was forced to withdraw as a nominee after coming in for criticism from both Democrats and Republicans .
She was reprimanded by Senators for giving " incomplete to insulting " answers to written questions .
In a letter confirming her decision to withdraw from the nomination process , Ms Miers wrote that continuing to seek Senate approval would prove to be a burden on the White House .
The withdrawal of Ms Miers was seen as a significant blow President Bush at the time .
' Straightforward advice '
Ms Miers has been a trusted and loyal adviser to Mr Bush since the 1980s .
The two met in Texas , where she was his personal lawyer , then served on his gubernatorial campaign in 1994 and again during his presidential election of 2000 .
Officially described as deputy chief of staff for policy , Ms Miers has been serving as President Bush 's top legal counsel since November 2004 .
At the time of her appointment , Mr Bush said he relied on her for " straightforward advice " .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Tuesday March 20 2007
The proposal from the Department for Education and Skills for monitoring children from birth to age five applies only to England and not to the whole of Britain , as stated in error in the report below .
Babies will be assessed on their gurgling , babbling and toe - playing abilities when they are a few months old under a legally enforced national curriculum for children from birth to five published by the government yesterday .
Every nursery , childminder and reception class in Britain will have to monitor children 's progress towards a set of 69 government - set " early learning goals " , recording them against more than 500 development milestones as they go .
At five , each child will be assessed against 13 scales based on the learning goals and their score , called an early years profile , must be passed to the Department for Education and Skills .
When children enter compulsory schooling , they should be able to read simple sentences using a phonics - based approach , count reliably up to 10 and sing simple songs from memory , as well as respecting others ' beliefs and learning to share and take turns .
The Early Years Foundation Curriculum , which comes into effect from September 2008 , replaces non-statutory guidance already in place .
If nurseries or other care providers want to opt out of the new requirements , for example because they follow an educational philosophy that introduces reading at a later age , they will have to apply for an exemption , and would have to forfeit any state funding .
The Department for Education and Skills 's framework immediately came under attack from the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations ( NCPTA ) and from the Tories for taking an excessively prescriptive approach and targeting children far too young .
Margaret Morrissey of the NCPTA said : " I think it 's really sad that we have reached the point now where instead of reducing children 's stress we have increased it ...
It worries me that we are expecting children to reach these targets when they have not even had their first birthday . "
Anne McIntosh , shadow minister for children , condemned the framework as " formalised learning for very small children " that risked damaging youngsters ' development .
She said : " It is inappropriate to have such detailed inspection of children this young .
We should leave it to the professional judgment of teachers .
These new targets mark an unprecedented supervision of children from birth to primary school , and I do not think that they are necessary or will work .
Every child is different and develops at different stages in different ways . "
The DfES says the framework is a means of ensuring high standards of early education and care that will reassure parents that their child 's development is being supported , no matter what form of childcare or pre-school education they use .
Beverley Hughes , the children 's minister , denied the goals would lead to a " tickbox approach " to assessing children , though she acknowledged this had happened under the previous system .
She rejected suggestions that a 92 - page set of practice guidance featuring 513 skills and attitudes children should acquire which accompanies the framework was excessively detailed .
" I do n't think it is prescriptive .
I think the examples we have got in there are really what brings it to life for practitioners . "
She said the framework document was intended for nursery staff to make sure they adopt a " rigorous approach " .
" The children 's experience will be free , it will be based on play , it will be rich , " Ms Hughes said .
" But the professionals behind that are required to have a thinking approach to the care of other people 's children . "
Scrutiny
According to the practice guidance , babies from birth to 11 months should be assessed for " the different ways babies communicate , such as gurgling when happy " .
As they begin to scrutinise the skills children need for writing , carers should note the interest infants show in " the marks they make when they rub a rusk round the tray of a feeding chair " .
In preparation for learning about numbers , babies will be monitored on whether they enjoy " finding their nose , eyes or tummy " .
Childcare groups broadly welcomed the framework but warned that moves to support children 's development by close observation could be jeopardised by government rules stating that one member of staff can look after up to 13 children aged three and over .
Steve Alexander , chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance , the country 's largest voluntary provider of childcare said : " We retain our strong view that the staff to child ratio of 1:13 ... is too low and should be 1:8 .
This point has particular pertinence given the framework stipulates that assessments through the foundation stage take the form of observation via ' look , listen and note ' . "
Purnima Tanuku , chief executive of National Day Nurseries Association , said : " We question how practitioners will be able to give children the right support they need to progress in their learning and development with such a high ratio . "
Now pay attention :
What your offspring should be doing - and when
Birth - 11 months
· Communicate in a variety of ways including crying , gurgling , babbling and screaming
· Play with their own fingers and toes and focus on objects around them
· Discover mark - making by chance , noticing , for instance , that trailing a finger through spilt juice changes it
Eight - 20 months :
· Become absorbed in putting objects in and out of containers
· Get to know and enjoy daily routines , such as getting up time , meal times , nappy time and bed time
16 - 26 months :
· Begin to move to music , listen to or join in with rhymes or songs
· Express feelings within warm , mutual , affirmative relationships
· Make random marks with their fingers and some tools
22 -36 months :
· Have some understanding of the numbers one and two , especially when the quantity is important for them
· Show increasing control in holding and using hammers , books , beaters and mark - making tools
30 - 50 months
· Be able to use simple statements and questions often linked to gestures
· Form friendships with other children
40 - 60 + months
· Understand what is right , what is wrong and have a conception of why this is

The brain appears to process information more chaotically than has long been assumed .
This is demonstrated by a new study conducted by scientists at the University of Bonn .
The passing on of information from neuron to neuron does not , they show , occur exclusively at the synapses , i.e. the junctions between the nerve cell extensions .
Rather , it seems that the neurons release their chemical messengers along the entire length of these extensions and , in this way , excite the neighbouring cells .
The findings of the study are of huge significance since they explode fundamental notions about the way our brain works .
Moreover , they might contribute to the development of new medical drugs .
The study is due to appear shortly in the prestigious academic journals Nature Neuroscience and has already been posted online ( doi: 10.1038/nn1850 ) .
Until now everything seemed quite clear .
Nerve cells receive their signals by means of little " arms " , known as dendrites .
Dendrites pass on the electrical impulses to the cell body , or soma , where they are processed .
The component responsible for " distributing " the result is the axon .
Axons are long cable - like projections of the cell along which the electrical signals pass until they meet , at a synapse , the dendritic arm of another neuron .
The synapse presents an insurmountable barrier to the neuron 's electrical pulses .
The brain overcomes this obstruction by means of an amazing signal conversion : the synapse releases chemical messengers , known as neurotransmitters , which diffuse to the dendrites .
There , they dock onto specific receptors and generate new electrical impulses .
" It was previously thought that neurotransmitters are only released at synapses , " points out Dr. Dirk Dietrich at Bonn University .
" But our findings indicate that this is not the case . "
The messenger attracts insulating cells
Together with his colleagues Dr. Maria Kukley and Dr. Estibaliz Capetillo - Zarate , Dietrich has conducted a careful examination of the " white matter " in the brain of rats .
This substance contains the " cable ducts " linking the right and left halves of the brain .
They consist essentially of axons and ancillary cells .
There are no dendrites or even synapses here .
" So it is not a place where we would expect to see the release of messengers , " the neuroscientist explains .
Yet it is in the white matter that the scientists have made a remarkable discovery .
As soon as an electrical impulse runs through an axon cable , tiny bubbles containing glutamate travel to the axon membrane and release their content into the brain .
Glutamate is one of the most important neurotransmitters , being released when signal transmission occurs at synapses .
The researchers were able to demonstrate that certain cells in the white matter react to glutamate : the precursor to what are known as oligodendrocytes .
Oligodendrocytes are the brain 's " insulating cells " .
They produce the myelin , a sort of fatty layer that surrounds the axons and ensures rapid retransmission of signals .
" It is likely that insulating cells are guided by the glutamate to locate axons and envelope them in a layer of myelin , " says Dirk Dietrich .
As soon as the axons leave the white " cable duct " they enter the brain 's grey matter where they encounter their receptor dendrites .
Here , the information is passed on at the synapses to the receptor cells .
" We think , however , that on their way though the grey matter the axons probably release glutamate at other points apart from the synapses , " Dietrich speculates .
" Nerve cells and dendrites are closely packed together here .
So the axon could not only excite the actual receptor but also numerous other nerve cells . "
If this hypothesis is correct , the accepted scientific understanding of the way neurons communicate , which has prevailed for over a hundred years , will have to be revised .
In 1897 Sir Charles Sherrington first put forward the idea that chemical messengers are only released at " synapses " , a term he coined .
According to the founder of modern neurophysiology this means that nerve cells can only communicate with a small number of other nerve cells , i.e. only with those with which they are connected via synapses .
This concept is the basis of the notion that neuronal information in the brain , somewhat like electricity in a computer , only spreads directionally in the brain , following specific ordered circuits .
Too much glutamate is the death of cells
There is , however , also an aspect to the research team 's discovery that is of considerable medical interest .
It has long been known that in the event of oxygen deficiency or a severe epileptic fit , large numbers of insulating cells in the white matter are destroyed .
The trigger for this damage is our old friend , the neurotransmitter glutamate .
" Nobody knew until now where the glutamate actually comes from , " says Dr. Dietrich .
" Our results might open the door to totally new therapeutic options . "
After all , drugs have already been developed that prevent glutamate bubbles from discharging their load into the brain .
Indeed , Bonn 's neuroscientists now know precisely which receptors of the insulating cells are stimulated by the neurotransmitter – another starting point for developing new drugs .
Yet , why can glutamate sometimes be so dangerous ?
When an epileptic fit occurs , the nerve cells " fire " very rapidly and fiercely .
In this event so many impulses run through the axons that large quantities of glutamate are released all at once .
" In these concentrations the neurotransmitter damages the insulating cells , " says Dietrich .
" It 's the dosage that makes it harmful . "

Dairy cows feed at a farm in central Washington in this December , 24 , 2003 file photo .
The largest U.S. dairy processor and distributor said even if food products from cloned animals become a reality , it will not sell milk from animals that have been cloned because of ongoing consumer concerns .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The largest U.S. dairy processor and distributor said even if food products from cloned animals become a reality , it will not sell milk from animals that have been cloned because of ongoing consumer concerns .
Dean Foods Co. said late on Thursday that several surveys have shown their U.S. customers are not interested in buying milk or milk products that come from cloned animals .
“ Our decision not to accept this milk is based on meeting our consumers ’ expectations , ” the company said in a statement .
“ We see no consumer benefit from this technology . ”
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration tentatively ruled late last year that milk and meat from some cloned animals are safe to eat , bringing the controversial technology closer to American grocery carts .
Dean said if the FDA approves the sale of milk from clones it will work with its dairy farmers to ensure the milk they supply to the company does not come from those animals .
Proponents have touted cloned animals as safe and hope the technology will create animals that produce more milk , better meat and are more disease - resistant .
Opinion polls , however , show consumers are more wary .
A survey by the International Food Information Council found that more than half of consumers were unlikely to buy food made from cloned animals , no matter what the government says .
Cloning animals involves taking the nuclei of cells from adults and fusing them into egg cells that are implanted into a surrogate mother .
Hundreds of livestock animals already have been cloned , but producers and the nascent industry have voluntarily agreed not to sell any foods from these animals until the FDA decision is finalized .
GREEN RIVER , Utah —
Great spellers come in all types , from egotistical showoffs to loners who find sanctuary in the forest of words .
Kunal Sah , a 13 - year - old eighth - grader , is an angry speller .
He lives with his uncle and aunt at the Ramada Limited Motel in this tough former railroad town in eastern Utah .
Kunal is making himself into a great speller by way of unhappiness and the immense pressure he feels to reunite his family , which was blown across two continents when his parents were sent back to India last year after being denied political asylum .
He said he cried every day after his parents left , then as the spelling bee season started and he began winning — ultimately reaching the regional competition and becoming one of three students from Utah who will be going to Washington at the end of this month for the Scripps National Spelling Bee — he began to put his frustration into words .
Capturing the spotlight at the bee , he said , could draw attention to his parents ’ case .
Image Kunal Sahs parents had been seeking political asylum in the United States , but last year they were sent back to India .

The Indian news media have already taken notice .
An article in March in The Indian Express , an English - language daily newspaper , tried to capture the family ’s mix of pride and pain under the headline : “ Spelling bee whiz in U.S. motel room , parents in Bihar Village . ”

Last week , Dupont , the chemical giant , slashed employee pension benefits by two - thirds .
Furthermore , new Dupont workers wo n't get a guaranteed pension at all — and no health care after retirement .
It 's part of Dupont 's new “ Die Young ” program , I hear .
Dupont is not in financial straits .
Rather , the slash attack on its workers ' pensions was aimed at adding a crucial three cents a share to company earnings , from $ 3.11 per share to $ 3.14 .
So Happy Labor Day .
And this week , the government made it official :
For the first time since the Labor Department began
measuring how the American pie is sliced , those in the top fifth of the wealth scale
are now gobbling up over half ( 50.4 % ) of our nation 's annual income .
So Happy Labor Day .
We do n't even get to lick the plates .
While 15.9 % of us do n't have health insurance ( a record , Mr. President ! ) , even those of us who have it , do n't have it : we 're spending 36 % more per family out of pocket on medical costs since the new regime took power in Washington .
If you 've actually tried to collect from your insurance company , you know what I mean .
So Happy Labor Day .
But if you think I have nothing nice to say about George W. Bush , let me report that the USA now has more millionaires than ever — 7.4 million !
And over the past decade , the number of billionaires has more than tripled , 341 of them !
If that does n't make you feel like you 're missing out , this should : You , Mr. Median , are earning , after inflation , a little less than you earned when Richard Nixon reigned .
Median household income — and most of us are “ median ” — is down .
Way down .
Since the Bush Putsch in 2000 , median income has fallen 5.9 % .
Mr. Bush and friends are offering us an “ ownership ” society .
But he did n't mention who already owns it .
The richest fifth of America owns 83 % of all shares in the stock market .
But that 's a bit misleading because most of that , 53 % of all the stock , is owned by just one percent of American households .
And what does the Wealthy One Percent want ?
Answer : more wealth .
Where will they get it ?
As with a tube of toothpaste , they 're squeezing it from the bottom .
Median paychecks have gone down by 5.9 % during the current regime , but Americans in the bottom fifth have seen their incomes sliced by 20 % .
At the other end , CEO pay at the Fortune 500 has bloated by 51 % during the first four years of the Bush regime to an average of $ 8.1 million per annum .
So who 's winning ?
It 's a crude indicator , but let 's take a peek at the Class War body count .
When Reagan took power in 1980 , the One Percent possessed 33 % of America 's wealth as measured by capital income .
By 2006 , the One Percent has swallowed over half of all America 's assets , from sea to shining sea .
One hundred fifty million Americans altogether own less than 3 % of all private assets .
Yes , American middle - class house values are up , but we 're blowing that gain to stay alive .
Edward Wolff , the New York University expert on income , explained to me that , “ The middle class is mortgaging itself to death . ”
As a result of mortgaging our new equity , 60 % of all households have seen a decline in net worth .
Is America getting poorer ?
No , just its people , We the Median .
In fact , we are producing an astonishing amount of new wealth in the USA .
We are a lean , mean production machine .
Output per worker in BushAmerica zoomed by 15 % over four years through 2004 .
Problem is , although worker productivity keeps rising , the producers are getting less and less of it .
The gap between what we produce and what we get is widening like an alligator 's jaw .
The more you work , the less you get .
It used to be that as the economic pie got bigger , everyone 's slice got bigger too .
No more .
The One Percent have swallowed your share before you can get your fork in .
The loot Dupont sucked from its employees ' retirement funds will be put to good use .
It will more than cover the cost of the company directors ' decision to hike the pension set aside for CEO Charles Holliday to $ 2.1 million a year .
And that 's fair , I suppose : Holliday 's a winning general in the class war .
And should n't the winners of war get the spoils ?
Of course , there are killjoys who cling to that Calvinist - Marxist belief that a system forever fattening the richest cannot continue without end .
Professor Michael Zweig , Director of the State University of New York 's Center for Study of Working Class Life , put it in culinary terms : “ Today 's pig is tomorrow 's bacon . ”

Venezuela and Cuba want to put Mr Posada on trial
The judge accused the US government of " fraud , deceit , and trickery " in its handling of the case .
Posada , 79 , was detained in May 2005 after entering the US illegally .
A former CIA employee , he is wanted in Venezuela and Cuba over the downing of a Cuban airliner in 1976 in which 73 people died .
He denies involvement .
The judge 's surprise decision leaves Posada 's fate in doubt , though US authorities have ruled out returning him to Cuba or Venezuela .
Cuban anger
" I am free , " Posada exclaimed on a Miami - based radio station after the ruling , according to the AFP news agency .
" Thank God , you , all of my brothers , the people in Cuba ... for this victory , " he said .
Cuba reacted with anger at news that he had been cleared on Tuesday .
The government 's tactics in this case are so grossly shocking and so outrageous as to violate the universal sense of justice
Judge Kathleen Cardone
" This decision is an outrage to the Cuban people and to the nations that lost 73 of their sons and daughters in the heinous 1976 attack that blew up a civilian Cubana de Aviación aircraft off the coast of Barbados , " a government statement said .
Havana accused the US of applying double standards in its war on terror because Posada was once employed by the CIA .
" The terrorist 's release has been concocted by the White House as compensation for Posada Carriles not to reveal what he knows , not to talk about the countless secrets he keeps on his protracted period as an agent of the US special services , " the statement said .
Venezuelan leaders have also accused the US of treating Posada with kid gloves because of his CIA past .
Posada was released on bail last month , but had been due to go on trial next Monday .
However , US district judge Kathleen Cardone dismissed the immigration fraud indictment in a court in El Paso , Texas .
Manipulating evidence
Posada 's lawyer , Felipe Millan , said his client had been " tricked " by the government .
Judge Cardone agreed .
" In addition to engaging in fraud , deceit and trickery , this court finds the government 's tactics in this case are so grossly shocking and so outrageous as to violate the universal sense of justice , " she wrote in her ruling .
" As a result , this court is left with no choice but to dismiss the indictment . "
She accused officials of manipulating the evidence against Posada , namely by not telling him that what he thought was an immigration interview was actually a criminal interrogation .
Speaking after the ruling , US justice department spokesman Dean Boyd said : " We 're reviewing the decision . "
A veteran anti-communist , Posada was jailed in Venezuela over the airliner bombing , but escaped from jail in 1985 during an appeal against his conviction .
He was then jailed in Panama in 2000 for plotting the assassination of his arch - enemy Cuban leader Fidel Castro , but was pardoned and released four years later .
US authorities are also reported to be investigating whether Posada was involved in the bombing of a Havana hotel , in 1997 , that killed an Italian tourist .

No one knows for sure , but it 's believed that as much as 40 % of the military budget goes to private contractors including private armies .
There are thousands of private mercenaries operating on behalf of the US in Iraq and elsewhere around the world .
Nearly 1,000 have been killed in Iraq alone , but their casualties are not counted .
Nor has Congress been able to discover exactly how many mercenaries the US employs there .
One of these firms , Blackwater USA , a big supporter of George Bush , is now deploying in the US .
They were present in New Orleans after the levee collapses .
I want to announce a couple of significant changes regarding compensation at Whole Foods Market .
First , as you know , we have a salary - cap policy , which limits the total cash compensation that can be paid to any team member .
The board of directors has voted to raise the salary cap from 14 times the average pay to 19 times the average pay , effective immediately … .
We are raising the salary cap for one reason only –to make the compensation to our executives more competitive in the marketplace … .
Everyone on the Whole Foods leadership team ( except for me ) has been approached multiple times by “ headhunters ” with job offers to leave Whole Foods and go to work for our competitors .
Raising the salary cap has become necessary to help ensure the retention of our key leadership … .
This increase to 19 times the average pay remains far , far below what the typical Fortune 500 company pays its executives … .
The average CEO received 431 times as much as their average employee received in 2004 , while Whole Foods ’ CEO ( me ) received only 14 times the average employee pay in cash compensation .
Most large companies also pay their executives large amounts of stock options in addition to large salaries and cash bonuses .
The average corporation in the United States distributes 75 % of their total stock options to only 5 top executives … .
At Whole Foods , the exact opposite is true :
The top 16 executives have received 7 % of all the options granted while the other 93 % of the options have been distributed throughout the entire company .
The second part of today ’s announcement has to do with my own compensation … .
The tremendous success of Whole Foods Market has provided me with far more money than I ever dreamed I ’d have and far more than is necessary for either my financial security or personal happiness … .
I am now 53 years old and I have reached a place in my life where I no longer want to work for money , but simply for the joy of the work itself and to better answer the call to service that I feel so clearly in my own heart .
Beginning on January 1 , 2007 , my salary will be reduced to $ 1 , and I will no longer take any other cash compensation … .
The intention of the board of directors is for Whole Foods Market to donate all of the future stock options I would be eligible to receive to our two company foundations .
One other important item to communicate to you is , in light of my decision to forego any future [ pay ] , our board of directors has decided that Whole Foods Market will contribute $ 100,000 annually to a new Global Team Member Emergency Fund .
This money will be distributed to team members throughout the company based on need … .
The first $ 100,000 will be deposited on January 1 , 2007 , and requests will be considered after that date .
With much love ,
John Mackey
Washington Post :
The chart was the first step in an effort to identify U.S. attorneys who should be removed .
Two prosecutors who received the same ranking as Fitzgerald were later fired , documents show .
The ranking placed Fitzgerald below " strong U.S. Attorneys . . . who exhibited loyalty " to the administration but above " weak U.S. Attorneys who . . . chafed against Administration initiatives , etc. , " according to Justice documents .
U.S. Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald was ranked among prosecutors who had " not distinguished themselves " on a Justice Department chart sent to the White House in March 2005 , when he was in the midst of leading the CIA leak investigation that resulted in the perjury conviction of a vice presidential aide , administration officials said yesterday .
Fitzgerald 's ranking adds another dimension to the prosecutor firings , which began as a White House proposal to remove all 93 U.S. attorneys after the 2004 elections and evolved into the coordinated dismissal of eight last year , a move that has infuriated lawmakers and led to calls for Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales to resign .[.. ]
The March 2005 chart ranking Fitzgerald and other prosecutors was drawn up by Gonzales aide D. Kyle Sampson and sent to then - White House counsel Harriet Miers .
The reference to Fitzgerald is in a portion of the memo that Justice has refused to turn over to Congress , officials told The Washington Post , speaking on the condition of anonymity because Fitzgerald 's ranking has not been made public .[.. ]
Sampson resigned as Gonzales 's chief of staff last week , and his attorney declined to comment yesterday .
Mary Jo White , who supervised Fitzgerald when she served as the U.S. attorney in Manhattan and who has criticized the firings , said ranking him as a middling prosecutor " lacks total credibility across the board . "
" He is probably the best prosecutor in the nation -- certainly one of them , " said White , who worked in the Clinton and Bush administrations .
" It casts total doubt on the whole process .
It 's kind of the icing on the cake . "
Here is the speech that United States Senator Robert Byrd ( D - West Virginia ) gave on the floor of the Senate on February 12 , 2003 .
This speech was given during the military mobilization for the 2003 Iraq War , where the United States and a few allies , most notably the United Kingdom ( but specifically not France or Germany ) invaded Iraq , in order to overthrow Saddam Hussein and rid the world of this threat to global security .
Or so the administration of President George W. Bush wanted us to believe .
Most of the Democrats at the time were strangely , almost cowardly , silent , including eventual presidential candidate John Kerry , who ought to have known better .
There were few mainstream Democrats who spoke out strongly against the war , before it happened .
Byrd was one , and he spoke to try to shake the nation out of the war fever that was building .
Sadly , he failed .
And over 1,000 U.S. and coalition soldiers and tens of thousands of non-combatant Iraqi civilians have died .
Hussein is in prison , but the neo- conservative pipe dream of using Iraq to spread democracy throughout the Middle East seems a long time off .
To contemplate war is to think about the most horrible of human experiences .
On this February day , as this nation stands at the brink of battle , every American on some level must be contemplating the horrors of war .
Yet , this Chamber is , for the most part , silent -- ominously , dreadfully silent .
There is no debate , no discussion , no attempt to lay out for the nation the pros and cons of this particular war .
There is nothing .
We stand passively mute in the United States Senate , paralyzed by our own uncertainty , seemingly stunned by the sheer turmoil of events .
Only on the editorial pages of our newspapers is there much substantive discussion of the prudence or imprudence of engaging in this particular war .
And this is no small conflagration we contemplate .
This is no simple attempt to defang a villain .
No .
This coming battle , if it materializes , represents a turning point in U.S. foreign policy and possibly a turning point in the recent history of the world .
This nation is about to embark upon the first test of a revolutionary doctrine applied in an extraordinary way at an unfortunate time .
The doctrine of preemption -- the idea that the United States or any other nation can legitimately attack a nation that is not imminently threatening but may be threatening in the future -- is a radical new twist on the traditional idea of self - defense .
It appears to be in contravention of international law and the U.N. Charter .
And it is being tested at a time of worldwide terrorism , making many countries around the globe wonder if they will soon be on our -- or some other nation 's -- hit list .
High - level administration figures recently refused to take nuclear weapons off of the table when discussing a possible attack against Iraq .
What could be more destabilizing and unwise than this type of uncertainty , particularly in a world where globalism has tied the vital economic and security interests of many nations so closely together ?
There are huge cracks emerging in our time - honored alliances , and U.S. intentions are suddenly subject to damaging worldwide speculation .
Anti-Americanism based on mistrust , misinformation , suspicion , and alarming rhetoric from U.S. leaders is fracturing the once solid alliance against global terrorism which existed after September 11 .
Here at home , people are warned of imminent terrorist attacks with little guidance as to when or where such attacks might occur .
Family members are being called to active military duty , with no idea of the duration of their stay or what horrors they may face .
Communities are being left with less than adequate police and fire protection .
Other essential services are also short - staffed .
The mood of the nation is grim .
The economy is stumbling .
Fuel prices are rising and may soon spike higher .
This administration , now in power for a little over two years , must be judged on its record .
I believe that that record is dismal .
In that scant two years , this administration has squandered a large projected surplus of some $ 5.6 trillion over the next decade and taken us to projected deficits as far as the eye can see .
This administration 's domestic policy has put many of our states in dire financial condition , underfunding scores of essential programs for our people .
This administration has fostered policies which have slowed economic growth .
This administration has ignored urgent matters such as the crisis in healthcare for our elderly .
This administration has been slow to provide adequate funding for homeland security .
This administration has been reluctant to better protect our long and porous borders .
In foreign policy , this administration has failed to find Osama bin Laden .
In fact , just yesterday we heard from him again marshaling his forces and urging them to kill .
This administration has split traditional alliances , possibly crippling , for all time , international order - keeping entities like the United Nations and NATO .
This administration has called into question the traditional worldwide perception of the United States as well - intentioned peacekeeper .
This administration has turned the patient art of diplomacy into threats , labeling , and name calling of the sort that reflects quite poorly on the intelligence and sensitivity of our leaders , and which will have consequences for years to come .
Calling heads of state pygmies , labeling whole countries as evil , denigrating powerful European allies as irrelevant -- these types of crude insensitivities can do our great nation no good .
We may have massive military might , but we cannot fight a global war on terrorism alone .
We need the cooperation and friendship of our time - honored allies as well as the newer - found friends whom we can attract with our wealth .
Our awesome military machine will do us little good if we suffer another devastating attack on our homeland which severely damages our economy .
Our military manpower is already stretched thin and we will need the augmenting support of those nations who can supply troop strength , not just sign letters cheering us on .
The war in Afghanistan has cost us $ 37 billion so far , yet there is evidence that terrorism may already be starting to regain its hold in that region .
We have not found bin Laden , and unless we secure the peace in Afghanistan , the dark dens of terrorism may yet again flourish in that remote and devastated land .
Pakistan as well is at risk of destabilizing forces .
This administration has not finished the first war against terrorism and yet it is eager to embark on another conflict with perils much greater than those in Afghanistan .
Is our attention span that short ?
Have we not learned that after winning the war one must always secure the peace ?
And yet we hear little about the aftermath of war in Iraq .
In the absence of plans , speculation abroad is rife .
Will we seize Iraq 's oil fields , becoming an occupying power which controls the price and supply of that nation 's oil for the foreseeable future ?
To whom do we propose to hand the reins of power after Saddam Hussein ?
Will our war inflame the Muslim world resulting in devastating attacks on Israel ?
Will Israel retaliate with its own nuclear arsenal ?
Will the Jordanian and Saudi Arabian governments be toppled by radicals , bolstered by Iran which has much closer ties to terrorism than Iraq ?
Could a disruption of the world 's oil supply lead to a worldwide recession ?
Has our senselessly bellicose language and our callous disregard of the interests and opinions of other nations increased the global race to join the nuclear club and made proliferation an even more lucrative practice for nations which need the income ?
In only the space of two short years this reckless and arrogant administration has initiated policies which may reap disastrous consequences for years .
One can understand the anger and shock of any president after the savage attacks of Sept. 11 .
One can appreciate the frustration of having only a shadow to chase and an amorphous , fleeting enemy on which it is nearly impossible to exact retribution .
But to turn one 's frustration and anger into the kind of extremely destabilizing and dangerous foreign policy debacle that the world is currently witnessing is inexcusable from any administration charged with the awesome power and responsibility of guiding the destiny of the greatest superpower on the planet .
Frankly many of the pronouncements made by this administration are outrageous .
There is no other word .
Yet this chamber is hauntingly silent .
On what is possibly the eve of horrific infliction of death and destruction on the population of the nation of Iraq -- a population , I might add , of which over 50 percent is under age 15 -- this chamber is silent .
On what is possibly only days before we send thousands of our own citizens to face unimagined horrors of chemical and biological warfare -- this chamber is silent .
On the eve of what could possibly be a vicious terrorist attack in retaliation for our attack on Iraq , it is business as usual in the United States Senate .
We are truly " sleepwalking through history . "
In my heart of hearts I pray that this great nation and its good and trusting citizens are not in for a rudest of awakenings .
To engage in war is always to pick a wild card .
And war must always be a last resort , not a first choice .
I truly must question the judgment of any president who can say that a massive unprovoked military attack on a nation which is over 50 percent children is " in the highest moral traditions of our country . "
This war is not necessary at this time .
Pressure appears to be having a good result in Iraq .
Our mistake was to put ourselves in a corner so quickly .
Our challenge is to now find a graceful way out of a box of our own making .
Perhaps there is still a way if we allow more time .

No red flag warning to the brain , bladder , or the boy .
No time to ponder or prevent the Hoover Dam from spillage .
It just happened as if for that split second my bladder was its own entity , with no relations to the rest of my body .
Now , depending on whose shoes you want to wear , you can find this obscure incident : A ) horrendously hilariousB ) a tad bit disturbingC ) appallingly traumatic .
The poor fellow bypassed A & B , and found the whole occurrence distressing .
My emotions were a compilation of all of the above , in this sequence .
HilariousHonestly , how often does a girl get to say , “ Oh him , yeah , I peed on him ”
He may have been kissed , raped , groped , spanked , stabbed , poured hot wax on by other girls , but this little woman has permanent claims to a secret spot on his body and mattress .
And unless he trades it in for another , he will always have reminiscence of my urine , which by the way smells like Black velvet roses on a warm spring afternoon .
Slightly disturbing .
Funny this is , if it ’s a one time deal .
I ca n’t imagine having to lose bodily fluids of this magnitude every single time I engage in intercourse .
Might as well equip me with warning labels , mark me with an X , wrap me up with yellow tape and label me “ Caution , very very slippery when wet ” Funny ?
Yes , because there should be a first for everything .
Funny all the time ?
No .
Not if this becomes a chronic dilemma .
And in this case , sex would require an entire different wardrobe - Good - bye lingerie and hello raincoats .
Post Trauma .
With a two day delay , the trauma stews .
What if in the mist of my selfish pleasures , we busted pipes that will eternally prevent me from procreating ?
I am a psychotic overprotective mother of my female organs .
Chop off all my appendages , poke out my eyeballs , and I may forgive you .
Destroy the functionality of my vagina and there will be hell to pay for three generations .
The slightest bump , discoloration , pain , change in pubic hair texture will have me flying to my OB / Gyn .
My only fear in life is being barren ; not being able to bear my own children .
The day I learn that I am infertile will be the day I shoot President Bush , and then jump off a bridge .
All my years of absolute safe sex with a non-promiscuity average of 1 sex partner per 3.5 years , thrown away in exchange for a night of mediocre ecstasy .
I gloat that I have never contracted an STD , during my 14 years of activity .
No , I have never even had a urinary or yeast infection , and yes , I have an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder when it comes to my vagina .
I boast that a man ’s penile flesh has never been granted the pleasure of tasting my inner vaginal walls without a rubber interface ; all these precautions to eliminate every risk of sterility .
If I did indeed do significant damage , these unnecessary measures become futile , pointless , wasted .
Fear cradled me that night as I cried myself to sleep .
( 3 days later at the doctor ’s office ) “ What can I do for you today , Ms. XYZ ? ”
The doctor asked , not making eye contact .
“ I think I have a bladder problem .
Well , I hope its urinary incontinence , ” I replied .
“ Do you urinate in your pants ? ” He asked .
“ No , but I urinate a lot . ”
[ Do n’t forget to tell him that you picked up a new hobby of peeing on boys ]
“ Do you drink a lot of diuretics ? ” he robotically asked again .
“ Yes , coffee and I drink a lot of water , ” I replied .
“ That ’s why you pee a lot . "
He condescendingly replied , " Do you urinate when you laugh ? " “ No , " I replied .
“ Do you urinate when you do strenuous activities ? ” [ Hmmm , define strenuous activity for me , Doc ? ]
“ No , ” I said .
“ Then you do n’t have a urinary incontinence .
You ’re too young to have a bladder problem .
Was that all you were here for ?
”
“ No , well , I was hoping that I had a bladder problem , because I think I might have a sexual dysfunction , or worse , I might have destroyed my chances of having children . ”
The doctor looked confused , so I explicitly retold the scenario packing in as much details as I could , as if all the specifics would assist him in my diagnosis and treatment .
I think he had a kick out of it .
“ Was that your first orgasm ?
Females can involuntarily lose control of their bladder during the first climatic experience . ”
[ Uh , Doc , you ’re talking to a woman whose record high is 13 at one time , whose average is 3 per session .
That ’s 3 orgasms x 3 times a week average x 52 wks a year x 14 years = 6,552 give - or - take orgasms which = a lot of cumming !
]
“ No , I ’ve climaxed in the past before , ” I modestly stated .
“ How often ? ” [ What the fuck , am I at a clinic or on a sex hotline with a balding perv ? ]
“ Define often ?
I once had an orgasm while running on a treadmill , ” I responded with humor .
The doctor did n’t laugh .
He did n’t even look at me , so that I can indicate that I was just joking .
[ No joke .
This by the way did happen . ]
I guess they do n’t educate doctors on ice breaking rapport in medical school .
“ Can I theorize my problem for you ? ” I said abruptly , trying to change the topic .
“ Go for it , ” he reply quickly to forget my earlier comment .
“ I know that you know that I have a posterior uterus .
[ My womb curves towards my back , instead of forward like most females .
I guess I am special like that ] .
Therefore , during penetration , could it be that my bladder in squished beneath the inner curvature of my uterus with no where to go , all a while being poked by a penis not meant for my longitudinally challenged vagina and voila a wet surprise for the fellow . ”
I made the doctor smile .
“ Nice Try .
No , that ’s not the case .
First of all , your bladder in not underneath your uterus .
It rests on top of it .
Right here . ”
He poked at the location .
[ Well I felt fucken dumb , so much for that A grade in anatomy ] .
“ Did you have intercourse with a full bladder ? ” he continued .
“ I do n’t think so . ” I really do n’t recall .
“ Because pressure on a full bladder can induce involuntary urination .
Were you fully aroused ?
” This I remembered .
Foreplay was inadequate .
“ No I was n’t .
Can this be the problem ?
[ But I ’ve had sex before not aroused and unconscious ] .
“ Yes it can be problematic .
Most males can not urinate when their penis is erect .
The blood flow prevents urination .
Females are no different .
Females have a spongy muscular structure anterior to their vagina wall where most people believe the G - spot to be .
If that area is not engorged with blood flow in order to increase rigidity , your sex partner can actually induce friction upon the bladder through the vaginal wall .
Your bladder was tickled from the inside out .
” Okay , that makes sense .
“ Will it disrupt my ability to have children ? ” I asked , because that ’s my main concern .
“ Why should it ?
It has nothing to do with your reproductive system . "
“ But will continuous sex with this particular person have long term detrimental affects for my reproductive abilities ?
I was here last time for pains remember ?
” “ I know that and you asked the same question .
Your vagina is a very elastic structure ... ”
The doctor proceeded before I decided to cut him off .
[ No shit Sherlock ! ] “ Yeah , but it ’s not pitless ! ” .
I boldly replied like a smart - ass would .
“ What if that ’s my cervix crying for help and sending signals to my bladder to pee on the intruder .
What if that ’s my fight - or - flight mechanism kicking in because my cervix is being bruised up … again . ”
He laughed this time .
[ Yes , I made the lame - o Doctor laugh ] .
“ You ’re fine , fertile and able .
You are still young and your sex health and history is very good .
I do n’t think you will have problems conceiving . ” [ Easy for you to say , Doc ]
“ Sorry , I have OCD of the vagina .
I am strange , when it comes to having future children ” .
“ Do you masturbate ? ” [ Man , here we go again with perverse 1-900 questions .
I am going to start charging a dollar a minute ] .
“ Why ? ” Annoyed and baffled at such a random question .
“ Because masturbation can trigger vaginal muscle weakness , if it ’s frequently done . ” .
“ I do masturbate . ”
[ How else do you think I can keep my numbers so low ? ]
“ How often ? ” [ I am not going to disclose that . ]
“ Often enough . ” I stoically replied .
“ How do you masturbate ? ” [ Well doc , I only masturbate with my top - of - line , state - of - the - art , glow in the dark , waterproof , bulletproof , battery acid proof 2005 Hitachi magic wand that comes equipped with 20 speeds , 3 different types of motions and revolving internal beads for added pleasures . ]
“ A standard vibrator . ” I lied .
“ Because chronic masturbation with a vibrator can fatigue your vaginal walls making it weak to stimulation .
The energy from it can be overwhelming .
If this occurs , blood flow wo n’t be adequate in times of intercourse .
I think this might be the chief problem for you .
Did you masturbated the day of intercourse ?
It could be that your vagina is fatigued from the earlier stimulation .
” Holy shit !
I remembered I did . “ Yes , coincidentally , I did doctor .
So we found the problem ?
” “ Well , it could be this , and everything else I mentioned earlier : full bladder , not enough stimulation , fatigued vaginal walls , chronic masturbation , etc .
“ So I should n’t self - pleasure myself anymore ?
But it ’s so natural ! ” I whined .
“ Yes , if you manually stimulate yourself , not if you use a man -made plastic stick that operates on AA batteries . ”
[ The guy ’s got a point ] .
“ But have you seen my skinny fingers ? ” I held up my indices for him to see , still trying to be funny .
He paused , stopped writing in my chart , stared at me , looked at my fingers and said , “ Use two .
” He is funny after all .
So there !
This orgasmic woman , who will be at the heights of her sexual peaks , is throwing in the towel .
Cold turkey !
Yes sirree , this born - again virgin will be practicing a life of celibacy from men and man-made gadgets .
And although I commend the surge of recent emails from all the brave male souls wanting to cure my sexual problem , by volunteering themselves as subjects , I will have to apologetically decline .
I am sorry , kind hearts , I do n’t doubt your altruistic Good Samaritan ways , just your desperate attempts to get laid .
From now on it ’s just going to be me , myself and my two fingers .
Maybe three .
Until I am ready to make babies , applications will not be accepted either .
Yes , this little woman is signing off , ( aka Master PEE , PEE Diddy , the URINATOR , the GOLDEN SHOWER child ) .
To B.O.B , my ( Battery Operated Boyfriend ) , the love of my life : May you rest in peace .
You will be missed .
I had a chance to visit 7 World Trade Center today , the newest office high rise to open in New York .
Instead of having up and down buttons outside the elevators , there ’s a numeric keypad , where you key in the floor number you ’re going to .
Then an LED display tells you which elevator to wait for .
Once you get in the elevator , you do n’t have to press any buttons ( and there are none to press ) .
This is more efficient than the old system , in which two people who were going to the same floor might have taken separate elevators , adding an unnecessary trip .
Presumably , during the early morning rush , it is able to clump people going to nearby floors into the same elevator , thus getting more people to their destinations faster by intelligently optimizing elevator schedules on - the - fly , instead of letting any arbitrary person force any arbitrary elevator to take them to any arbitrary floor .
Can you guess the usability bug ?
( select this paragraph for the answer : )
People who are n’t used to the new system come into the lobby and see an elevator with an open door .
They jump into it , and then get stuck going to some random floor because they can’t key in their destination once they ’re inside .
( end )
In that old Jack Lemmon / Shirley MacLaine movie The Apartment , a 1950 ’s - era accounting firm accomplishes the same trick by putting human operators ( “ elevator girls ” ) in each and every elevator , and having a human traffic director in the lobby direct people to the elevator that will go to their floor .

Beginnings
Like many other scientists and engineers who have ended up founding companies , I did n’t leave Caltech as an entrepreneur .
I had no training in business ; after my sophomore year of college I did n’t take any courses outside of chemistry , math , and physics .
My career as an entrepreneur happened quite by accident .
And it ran counter to early predictions .
When I was graduating from Caltech with my PhD in chemistry in 1954 , I interviewed for jobs with several companies , one of which was Dow Chemical .
Dow was interested in setting up a research laboratory in California , and they thought I might be someone they could send to headquarters in Midland , Michigan , to train to come back here in some kind of managerial role .
So they sent me to a psychologist to see how this would fit .
The psychologist said I was OK technically but I ’d never manage anything .
Dow did end up offering me a job in Midland , but the transfer back to California was no longer a part of it .
There is such a thing as a natural - born entrepeneur …
But the accidental entrepreneur like me has to fall into the opportunity or be pushed into it .
I did n’t go to Midland after all , but went instead to the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University , which has roughly the same relationship to Johns Hopkins that JPL has to Caltech , and where I could continue to do basic research in areas related to what I had done before .
But I found myself calculating the cost per word in the articles we published and wondering if the taxpayers were really getting their money ’s worth at $ 5 per word .
Just as I was starting to worry about the taxpayers , the group I was working in was , for various reasons , breaking apart .
So I decided to look for something that had a bit more of a practical bent , and at the same time see if I could get myself back to California .
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory interviewed me and offered me a job , but I decided I did n’t want to take the spectre of exploding nuclear bombs , so I turned it down .
Then one evening I got a call from Bill Shockley , who had gotten my name from Lawrence Livermore ’s list of people who had turned them down .
Now , Shockley is a name that has a Caltech association .
After earning his BS here in 1932 he went on to invent the transistor .
He had been working at Bell Laboratories , and now he wanted to set up a semiconductor company out on the West Coast ( a lot of Caltech connections here – the operation was financed by Arnold Beckman ) with the idea of making a cheap silicon transistor .
Shockley knew that a chemist was useful in the semiconductor business ; they had chemists at Bell Labs , where they did useful things .
And I was a chemist , so Shockley caught up with me .
Still not an entrepreneur , I decided to join this operation .
I was employee number 18 .
This was a startup operation .
All of us except Shockley were young scientists , in our late twenties .
I had no management experience or training .
Unfortunately , neither did Shockley .
He had run a research group at Bell Laboratories , but this was to be an enterprise rather than a research group , and he had no real experience in running a company .
I suppose maybe I should have been suspicious when none of the people who had worked with him at Bell Labs joined his new venture , but I did n’t even begin to think about that then .
Shockley was phenomenal from the point of view of his physical intuition .
One of my colleagues claimed Shockley could see electrons .
He had a tremendous feeling for what was going on , say , in silicon , but he had some peculiar ideas for motivating people .
For example , the company had something we dubbed the PhD production line .
One day he told a group of us : “ I ’m not sure you ’re suited for this kind of a business .
We ’re going to find out .
You ’re going to go out there and set up a production line and run it .
You know , do the operation , not direct it . ”
This did n’t go over especially well , because the group dutifully tried to operate a production line on a product that was still in the early stages of development .
He also set up a secret project .
Those of us who were n’t involved could n’t know what it was , although Shockley did let us know that it was potentially as important as the invention of the transistor .
In such a small entrepreneurial group , having in - people and out - people created some dissension , the sort of thing that makes it hard to keep everybody working together as a team .
As another illustration of his motivating skills , one day Shockley asked a group of us what we would like to do to make the job more interesting .
Would we like to publish some papers ?
We said , “ OK , ” so as a way of satisfying this demand he went home that night and worked out the theory of an effect in semiconductors .
He came back the next day and said , “ Here .
Flesh this out and put your name on it and publish it . ”
Finally , the beginning of the end , as far as morale was concerned , occurred when we had a minor problem in the company and Shockley decided that the entire staff was going to have to take lie detector tests to find out who was responsible for it .
Then he switched from his original idea of building a cheap silicon transistor to building a rather obscure device known as a four - layer diode .
We viewed this with considerable concern , because some of us did n’t understand exactly where the four - layer diode fit in .
One day , when Arnold Beckman came around to talk to the group , Shockley made some closing remarks , just out of the blue , indicating that he could take his staff and go someplace else if Beckman was n’t enthusiastic about what was happening there .
So , given all these problems , we decided that we had to go around Shockley to solve them .
A group of us contacted Beckman and sat down with him through a series of dinners to try to work out a position for Shockley , in which he could give us the benefit of his technical insights but not of his management philosophy .
We were thinking in terms of a professorship at Stanford .
By that time , he had won a Nobel Prize , and Nobel Prize winners can get a professorship almost anywhere .
What we did n’t appreciate is that it ’s awfully hard to push a Nobel Prize winner aside .
Beckman decided ( as the result of advice he had received elsewhere ) that he really could n’t do this to Shockley .
We were told essentially that Shockley was in charge , and if we did n’t like it we probably ought to look at doing something else .
We felt we had burned our bridges so badly by that time that we clearly had to leave , and we started to look at alternatives .
( Shockley ’s company held on for a few years , was acquired by Clevite Corporation , and died eventually . )
Setting Up Fairchild Corporation
Each of the eight of us invested $ 500 in this startup …
Fairchild put up some $ 1.3 million to get us going , and we started Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation .
And this is where I finally became an entrepreneur .
One of our group had a friend at Hayden Stone , a New York investment banking house .
He wrote the friend a letter saying that there was a group of eight of us here that really enjoyed working together , but that we were leaving our current employment , and did he think that some company might like to hire all of us .
The investment bankers said , “ Wait a minute , ” and sent one of the partners , Bud Coyle , and a young Harvard MBA named Arthur Rock out from New York to visit with us .
They talked to us and said : “ You do n’t want to look for a company to hire you ; you want to set up your own company . ”
That did n’t sound bad .
By doing that we could stay where we were .
We had all bought houses by then ( they were affordable in California at that time ) , and we would n’t have to move .
It seemed a lot easier , so we said , “ OK ; fine ; let ’s do it , ” and they said they would find backing for us .
So we sat down with The Wall Street Journal , and went through the New York Stock Exchange listings , company by company , to identify which ones we thought might be interested in supporting a semiconductor venture .
We identified 30 - some companies , and Arthur and Bud went out and contacted every one of them .
They all turned it down without even talking to us .
Then , quite by accident , Arthur and Bud ran into Sherman Fairchild , who happened to be a technology buff ; he really loved new technology .
He introduced them to the chairman of Fairchild Camera and Instrument , who was willing to take a shot at supporting this new company .
Each of the eight of us invested $ 500 in this start - up .
That may not sound like much now , but it was a month ’s salary in 1957 .
Fairchild put up some $ 1.3 million to get us going , and we started Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation .
We still were n’t really quite entrepreneurs , but we had learned something along the way .
We had learned from the Shockley experience that none of us knew how to run a company , so the first thing we had to do was to hire our own boss – essentially hire somebody to run the company .
We advertised for a general manager .
Now , when you advertise for a general manager for something like this , what you find is that every salesman in the country is convinced that he can run a company .
But buried among all the responses from salesmen was one from Ed Baldwin , the engineering manager for the Hughes semiconductor operation .
In the mid-fifties , Hughes was making diodes and was one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world .
Baldwin came and told us a lot of things we did n’t know , so we decided that he was the right guy to bring in to run our company for us .
We hired him , and he taught us a variety of things that we had n’t learned before – since most of us had not even worked for a successful manufacturing company .
He taught us that the different parts of the organization should be established with different responsibilities ; for example , you have to set up the manufacturing operation separate from the development laboratory .
You have to engineer and specify manufacturing processes , which is completely different from getting something to work once in the laboratory .
He even taught us that we should bring in a marketing manager , which we did .
And everything was working fine : the development and preproduction engineering for our processes and first products was complete ; we had a thick process - spec book that recorded all the detailed recipes ; and we had interested customers .
Then one day we came to work and discovered that Baldwin , along with a group of the people that he had suggested we hire , were leaving to set up a competing semiconductor company down the road .
This was the first of the Silicon Valley spin - offs that we suffered .
Running the Company
Our first transistor took two mask steps , and that was a fairly significant development operation .
We never really quite understood this .
Baldwin had the same potential equity participation that we did ; but he never invested his $ 500 so he never got the stock .
He did n’t consider Fairchild Semiconductor his company , and since he wanted his own company , he left us .
( He and his group also left with the “ recipes ” ; eventually they had to return the copy of the spec book to us . )
After our initial feelings of shock and betrayal , we sat down and discussed what we should do .
Should we go out and hire another guy to come in and run the company ?
We decided instead that we would try to go it alone with one of our own .
So Bob Noyce , who was the one of us with the most semiconductor industry experience , became general manager .
I took a sideways step to his previous position as director of research and development .
Besides what Baldwin had walked off with , we had a few other ideas coming along at that time .
One of them was something called a planar transistor , created by Jean Hoerni , a Caltech post - doc whom Shockley had recruited .
In fact , I had joined Shockley for the trip down to Pasadena to recruit him .
Jean was a theoretician , and so was not very useful at the time we were setting up the original facility at Fairchild , building furnaces and all that kind of stuff .
He just sat in his office , scribbling things on a piece of paper , and he came up with this idea for building a transistor with the silicon oxide layer left on top over the junctions .
Where the silicon junctions come to the surface of the silicon is a very sensitive area , which we used to expose and had to work awfully hard to keep clean .
Hoerni said , “ Why not leave the oxide on there ? ”
The conventional wisdom from Bell Laboratories had been that by the time you got done , the oxide was so dirty that you wanted to get rid of it .
Nobody had ever tried leaving the oxide on .
We could n’t try it either , because it required making four mask steps , each indexed with respect to the next with very high precision – a technology that did n’t exist .
Our first transistor took two mask steps , and that was a fairly significant development operation .
So we could n’t even try Jean ’s idea until a year and a half or so after we had gone into business .
When we finally got around to trying it , it turned out to be a great idea ; it solved all the previous surface problems .
Then we wondered what else we might do with this planar technology .
Bob Noyce came up with the two key inventions to make a practical integrated circuit : by leaving the oxide on , one could run interconnections as metal films over the top of its devices ; and one could also put structures inside the silicon that isolated one transistor from the other .
Noyce and Kilby , who was at Texas Instruments , are often considered co-inventors of the integrated circuit .
In fact , they did dramatically different things .
Kilby built a laboratory model – a little circuit with transistors and resistors – by etching long , thin semiconductor structures , all connected by tiny wires .
It really was n’t a practical production process .
What Bob did was to take the idea of the integrated circuit – this planar technology – and come up with a way of building a practical device .
Turning the First Stone
Literally dozens of companies came out of the Fairchild experience .
Not only did the technology come out of it , but Fairchild also served as a successful and encouraging example of entrepreneurship – the if - that - jerk - can - do - it - so - can - I syndrome .
It turned out that the world really wanted some of these new devices , which led to some management challenges .
We did n’t have any idea of the magnitude of the opportunity we were dealing with .
We were still a bunch of guys in a laboratory , somewhat amazed that people actually wanted to buy our products .
We had n’t thought about expanding , but here again our theoretician , Jean Hoerni , had early on made a contribution by designing the layout of our facility to allow for what we presumed to be sufficient expansion – an extra furnace here , more nitrogen cylinders there .
But we had little notion of the impact of our discovery .
Here we had developed and engineered the first integrated circuits , the first family of logic circuits – very simple devices with simple gates and flip flops – and put them into production .
I remember calling the senior people in the laboratory together and saying , “ OK , we ’ve done integrated circuits .
What ’ll we do next ? ”
And we started looking for all the peculiar physical effects we could find to see what new devices we could invent .
We had no idea at all that we had turned the first stone on something that was going to be an $ 80 billion business .
As a result of our ignorance , we sent our profits back to the parent company on the East Coast rather than asking to reinvest them in expanding Fairchild Semiconductor more rapidly .
Now , its not clear that we could have expanded a lot more rapidly even if we had tried , because there were significant limitations on the management crew we had .
We were all still going through on - the - job training .
We were mining an extremely rich vein of technology , but the mining company was too small to handle what was going on .
The net result was what I call the “ Silicon - Valley effect ” : every new idea that came along created at least one new company .
Literally dozens of companies came out of the Fairchild experience .
Not only did the technology come out of it , but Fairchild also served as a successful and encouraging example of entrepreneurship – the if - that - jerk - can - do - it - so - can - I syndrome .
While we were learning on the job , Fairchild grew to be about a $ 150 million business and some 30,000 employees by the late sixties .
It was a fairly significant corporation by the time we were done .
But things began to deteriorate – partly , I think , because it was controlled by an East Coast company .
The West Coast tail was not very effective at wagging the East Coast dog .
Fairchild developed some management problems .
In fact , the board fired two chief executive officers within a six - month period , and was running the company with a three - man committee as the board of directors .
Clearly the direction of the company was going to change .
When Bob Noyce ( who was the logical internal candidate to become chief executive of the parent company , Fairchild Camera ) saw that he would be bypassed for the job , he decided to leave .
I felt that new management would probably change the nature of the company significantly .
I decided I ’d rather leave before any changes , than after .
So the two of us set off to do something else .
We had really come a long way at Fairchild .
We had also made a tremendous number of mistakes , and we had squandered opportunities along the way .
It was excellent on - the - job training , but there probably is a more efficient way of training entrepreneurs than by letting them make all the mistakes .
Fortunately , good products make up for a lot of problems in an organization , and I think that was what happened in our case .
When Bob and I started looking around for business opportunities , we identified one that we thought would minimize the advantages of the established companies , such as Texas Instruments , Fairchild , and the others .
This opportunity was one that would change the leverage .
The semiconductor industry had gotten to the point by then where having large , low - cost assembly plants in Southeast Asia was very important competitively .
But technology was capable of making a more complex chip than we were capable of defining .
If you identified a complex circuit function , it tended to be unique ; it might be used only once in every computer , so the unit volume did not allow you to amortize the design cost .
The net result was that relatively simple circuits were still being made , even as the technology continued to evolve .
We thought we saw in semiconductor memory an opportunity to make a product of almost arbitrary complexity that could be used in all digital systems , and that would change the leverage from low - cost assembly back to cleverness in processing silicon .
We started our business on this idea .
Now , this was at a time when venture capital was at a peak .
Bob Noyce called Arthur Rock and said , “ Hey , we want to set up a new company .
Would you help us raise the money ? ”
Arthur said sure , and that was the commitment of our first round of financing .
We wrote a single page business plan .
It was very general .
It said we were going to work with silicon ; we were going to do diffusion and other similar processes and make interesting products .
The Birth of Intel
At Fairchild we had no idea that we needed an organization – that we had to set up a manufacturing department and an engineering department and a sales force .
Then we started looking at technologies that would be appropriate for the business we were undertaking .
In retrospect , I call it our “ Goldilocks ” technology strategy .
We pursued three different directions .
One was a particular kind of bipolar transistor , called a Schottky bipolar , that was different from what was being used then .
It turned out that the technology worked just beautifully , better than anyone could have expected .
In fact , it worked so well , that competitors were able to copy it rapidly .
That was technology that was too easy .
We chose another technology for assembling a lot of memory chips in one package – flipping them over and doing an advanced type of assembly .
We ’re still working on that one , 25 years later .
That one was too hard .
Fortunately , we also chose a third one – a new version of the MOS ( metal oxide semiconductor ) technology called silicon - gate MOS .
Here the transistor ’s “ gate ” electrode that previously was made of a metal ( usually aluminum ) – the M in MOS – was replaced by a film of silicon that had several important advantages for device switching speed and packing density on the silicon wafer surface .
And that one was just right .
By concentrating on this one technology and focusing our attention on a couple of difficult problems with it , we were able to solve the problems and get on with it .
But the established companies that were tending their main business and doing new process development on the side , did n’t have time to focus on solving the problems and took several years to get going on it .
Our initial estimate was that we had five years to grow big enough to prevent the existing companies from putting us out of business .
In fact , we had seven years before the big companies got into our technology .
Fortunately , very much by luck , we had hit on a technology that had just the right degree of difficulty for a successful start - up .
This was how lntel began .
At Intel , we decided not to make the same kind of mistakes that we had made at Fairchild .
At Fairchild , for example , we used industrial distributors to sell a good portion of our products – we sold them to a distributor ; the distributor sold them to the final customer .
We recorded the sale when the product went to the distributor .
But in our business , prices only go down .
The only question is whether they go down at 20 percent per year or at 80 percent per year .
Once at Fairchild , for example , when we had our distributors well stocked with our products , Motorola introduced a competitive device at a significantly lower price .
To match their prices , we would have had to reverse sales revenue we had already counted and to take a terrible hit on our profit - and - loss statement , which we did n’t think we could afford .
So we sat there and watched our market share deteriorate while that inventory sold out .
We decided we would n’t let this happen at Intel .
We do n’t take credit for a sale when we sell a product to our distributor , but only when it has moved off his shelves to the final customer .
This was a bit of “ technology ” that we had to sell to our accounting firm , because it had been done previously .
But it turned out to solve that particular problem very well .
It is now standard industry practice .
From my own point of view , I had grown very frustrated running a laboratory at Fairchild .
As the manufacturing group grew more competent technically , they were less willing to listen to the people in the laboratory as the experts .
So when we came up with some new idea in the laboratory – for example , stable MOS devices – we had great difficulty transferring the detailed instructions to manufacturing .
We were much more effective in transferring new technology to the spin - off companies than we were internally .
To avoid that problem at Intel , and to promote maximum efficiency of transfer from development to manufacturing , we decided not to set up a separate laboratory .
We ’ve set up a variety of different kinds of mechanisms and organizations along the way to make the development - to - manufacturing transfer as efficient as possible , even at a sacrifice in efficiency of either the manufacturing or the development process individually .
This has minimized spin - offs , because we design our development specifically to transfer into the factory ; so we do n’t have the problem of developing technology and ideas that we have no place for .
Technology transfer is always difficult .
We have tried to minimize the need to transfer it .
From the beginning at Intel , we planned on being big .
Since we had already been fairly successful at Fairchild , anything less successful in our new venture would have been a disappointment .
So , at the very beginning we recruited a staff that had high potential and that we thought would be around to run the company for some time .
This is an opportunity that many start - ups miss .
There is no better chance to train managers than in a start - up , where they have the opportunity to see the entire company as it grows .
It starts small and simple ; one can see all the operations as they get bigger .
I think that people looking at start - ups , venture capitalists in particular , ought to push very strongly not to squander the opportunity to develop management during that time period .
We also tried to minimize bureaucracy .
When we started Intel , for example , each one of us took an area of technology as his own .
And instead of purchase requisitions , we gave our engineers purchase order forms , so they could work with the equipment supplier directly and just hand the salesman a purchase order .
This shocked some of the vendors , but it was a very effective , no - bureaucracy way of getting going .
Unfortunately , we ca n’t do that today any more , but at the time , when we were a fairly small company , it worked very well .
Another thing we had learned along the way was to raise money before we needed it .
One thing you find out after a little bit of experience as an entrepreneur is that the bank will lend you money as long as you do n’t need it .
You can sell stock as long as you really do n’t have to .
With good advice from directors such as Arthur Rock , we have always had plenty of capital on hand , so that we have n’t been hindered in our ability to raise more .
At Fairchild we had no idea that we needed an organization – that we had to set up a manufacturing department and an engineering department and a sales force .
All these things sound logical , but they take a while to figure out .
And one of the most important elements in an entrepreneurial organization is people management .
There are a lot of things that I ’ve learned very late in life about managing people , and if I could go back again to the beginning of Intel , I would do many things differently .
For example , I have come to appreciate the value of regular one - on - one meetings with subordinates , where the subordinate controls the meeting agenda .
Such sessions are very efficient for transferring information in both directions .
Top 10 Company
“ What the heck would anyone want a computer for in his home ? ”
I suppose I ca n’t end without bragging a bit about Intel .
We just completed our 25th year ; our revenue was $ 8.8 billion , and our earnings were over $ 2 billion .
That puts us at least in the top 20 and maybe in the top 10 of the world ’s most profitable companies .
We have steadily increased our lead as the largest semiconductor manufacturer and have more than 30,000 employees worldwide .
But there are some things I ’m not quite so proud of that have come along with it .
In 1984 , for example , we hit a peak of 26,000 employees ; in 1986 we were down to under 18,000 .
Laying off 8,000 employees is not a very pleasant task , and it ’s something I think could have been avoided had Intel management been a bit more careful and perceptive .
And I can look back at a few missed opportunities .
Some we missed by default .
I remember talking with venture capitalist Bill Davidow , when he worked for Intel , about an engineering workstation .
Intel sold something we called a “ development system , ” which was a special - purpose computer for the engineer .
We imagined that the engineer in the future would have a single computer on his desk , and we talked about what it ought to be .
But even though we talked about it , we were too darned busy doing other things , and we never got around to moving in that direction .
So we missed that chance completely .
I suppose I could also look at the PC as an opportunity we missed .
Long before Apple , one of our engineers came to me with the suggestion that Intel ought to build a computer for the home .
And I asked him , “ What the heck would anyone want a computer for in his home ? ” ( I still sometimes wonder , in spite of having a few of them . )
The only example he could come up with was something for the housewife to put her recipes on .
I could imagine Betty at the stove cooking , poking at her computer to read the recipe .
It seemed ridiculous !
Well , perhaps we did n’t miss that opportunity after all , because we do make a profit out of the PC business – not by being in it , but by serving it .
And that may be the best way .
We missed other opportunities by poor execution .
One that really bothers me is that in 1985 we were driven out of the dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) business , the business in which we had made our first significant profits and which had gotten us started as a successful company .
But we were driven out partly because we did n’t execute a couple of generations of products very well , and partly because Japanese dumping drove us out .
Different economics for the Japanese companies allowed them to run their factories and sell their products far below cost .
But it still bothers me that we could n’t compete successfully in a business we had created .
Now , I do n’t mind missing an opportunity because we tried and failed .
We took some fairly aggressive and not always successful steps toward producing computer products early in the company ’s life – for example , the 432 .
The 432 was probably the first 32 - bit microprocessor ; it was hardware designed to execute object - oriented software ; the hardware and software were designed together and had many advanced features .
At the time that we designed the system , the technology was n’t quite ready for such complexity , and in order to get all the functionality on the chip , we had to sacrifice performance .
It ended up being so slow it could do hardly anything , and we had to abandon it .
But at least it was an aggressive shot – one that we just did n’t target correctly .
Another shot that misfired was digital watches .
We were the first company in the liquid - crystal , digital - watch business .
We hoped the watch was a path to a portable digital product that could be expanded to do much more than tell time .
Other companies entering the electronic - watch market drove prices through the floor .
The business opportunity we saw was completely destroyed , if it ever really existed .
I still have my $ 15 - million watch , along with memories of Microma Watch , a division of Intel .
It wakes me up in the morning ; it has a good alarm system on it , and liquid - crystal displays last for at least 20 years .
In retrospect , there are a lot of things we could have done better along the way , but we did enough right to grow a fairly large company .
The world has really been changing , too , during this time period .
Industry here and abroad has enjoyed huge improvements in efficiency .
For example , I mentioned earlier that we had 26,000 employees in 1984 .
We just passed 26,000 employees again during this last year , and the company is five times as big in revenue as it was then .
The competition today is a lot stronger than it was in the past .
A start - up company today probably can’t afford the sort of on - the - job training that we could .
Learning by Trial and Error
Most of what I learned as an entrepreneur was by trial and error , but I think a lot of this really could have been learned more efficiently .
There is such a thing as a natural - born entrepreneur , for whom the entrepreneurial urge drives everything , and who can make a business out of almost anything .
But the accidental entrepreneur like me has to fall into the opportunity or be pushed into it .
Then the entrepreneurial spirit eventually catches on .
To me the opportunities to start a company are few and far between .
Things have to line up right .
I ’m not the sort of entrepreneur who can just say , “ I ’m going to start a company .
Let ’s look for an opportunity . ”
In my entire career I think I ’ve seen only about three ideas come by that I would consider a basis on which to try to start an enterprise .
But starting a company is certainly exciting , and building a successful enterprise is satisfying and rewarding .
Most of what I learned as an entrepreneur was by trial and error , but I think a lot of this really could have been learned more efficiently .
I think a place like Caltech could offer an opportunity to avoid the need for trial and error in a lot of this .
Broadening the education to include some instruction in business – a little bit about finance and organizations – would certainly be useful , and I think a course in this direction would probably be a significant addition to the curriculum .
But a technical education is probably the best start for an entrepreneur in a high - tech business .
And it ’s important to remember one other thing that is essential for any entrepreneurial organization : do what you do well .
Look at other things as incremental opportunities , but do n’t change the basis of what you do well .
For Caltech , what it does well is train the best scientists and engineers in the world .
My advice to Caltech is this : help students a bit if they want to move in entrepreneurial directions , but do n’t change the basic nature of a Caltech education .

You ’ve no doubt heard of the five stages of grief ( denial , anger , bargaining , depression , and acceptance ) .
I ’ve come to realize something like that goes on among righties whenever a new Republican scandal washes ashore .
I propose that the five stages of reaction to a scandal are :
1. Ignoring
2. Belittling
3. Blaming the Media
4. Evoking Bill Clinton .
5. Boredom
That last stage allows the sufferer to return to stage 1 and ignore the issue .
Also note that righties do n’t necessarily go through these stages in order or even one stage at a time .
This is a working hypothesis ; I might choose to revise the list in the future .
Let me know what you think .
Anyway , I ’ve been surfing about looking at reaction to the U.S. attorney scandal to find examples .
Here we are :
Macsmind is at Stage 2 , Belittling :
Business as usual folks , nothing to see here .
Fact is that they werenâ€™t doing their job ( note this was suspected democrat voter fraud – like that never happens ) – so ( for those slow of mind ) that means bye , bye .
John Hawkins of Right Wing News is even deeper into Stage 2 , if that ’s possible :
So basically , this whole non-scandal scandal is over one guy who was dragging in feet in investigating voter fraud .
Yet , the White House is taking it on the chin .
In our current model , “ belittling ” is just a nudge away from “ ignoring . ”
The bloggers are noting that something happened , but they mentally edit out parts of the story ; such as , the lack of evidence of Republican allegations of voter fraud and the fact that some of the purged attorneys were pressured to bring indictments against Democrats before the midterm elections .
For example , see this March 7 story about former U.S. attorney John McKay of Washington State , who was pressured by a congressman about voter fraud allegations in the election of Governor Chris Gregoire , and also accused by the White House of “ mishandling ” an investigation into the alleged fraud .
Asked if his failure to convene a grand jury in the election probe was the reason he was denied a judgeship , McKay said he did not know .
But he said he was confident he and his staff had handled the case properly , adding that there was no evidence of voter fraud despite widespread complaints by Republicans in Washington state and the nation ’s capital .
“ Frankly , it did n’t matter to me what people thought , ” McKay told a House Judiciary subcommittee .
“ There was no evidence of voter fraud . ”
No evidence ?
A mere technicality .
The Dems must be guilty because , well , they ’re Dems .
Sister Toljah and the Flopping Ace seem to be at Stages 2 and 3 at the same time .
This is the Ace :
They were not doing their job .
Their appointments were stripped .
But the left and our MSM want to bombard us with the appearance of evil .
Now , one could argue that “ blaming the media ” and “ belittling ” are pretty close to the same thing , and maybe I should roll them into one stage .
But sometimes “ blaming the media ” can be so much more .
Remember Jamil Hussein ?
Mascmind and Dan Collins at Protein Wisdom are at Stage 4 , Evoking Bill Clinton , recalling the Great Purge of U.S. Attorneys by Janet Reno in 1993 .
I explained here why that is n’t relevant .
Mr. Hawkins also provides a fascinating twist on Stage 4 :
What they should be doing is exactly what the Clinton Administration would be doing in a situation like this , relentlessly and savagely attacking the other side , calling it a political witch hunt , and telling the public that this is exactly why we can’t have bipartisanship in Washington , because these jerks keep pulling stunts like this .
This whole thing is a big joke , but because the Bush Administration is still , STILL , for the most sticking with this “ new tone , ” mush and letting the Democrats use them as punching bags , the joke is on the Bushies .
In some cases “ evoking Bill Clinton ” means just the basic “ Clinton did it , too ” excuse , which is the foundation of all conservative ethics .
Righties seem to think that Bill Clinton is the measure of all morals , and that they ca n’t be accused of doing anything wrong if Clinton did the same thing .
But Mr. Hawkins ’s post is a lovely example of psychological projection , either conscious or unconscious .
David Neiwert at Orcinus has written some great posts on this , such as here and here .
So “ evoking Bill Clinton ” describes a wide and complex range of behaviors .
James Joyner skipped to Stage 5 :
For whatever reason , Iâ€™ve had trouble mustering an interest in the brouhaha over Attorney General Alberto Gonzalezâ€™ firing of some U.S. attorneys for â€œpolitical reasons .â€ 
Itâ€™s been the topic of much discussion in the blogosphere and the halls of Congress but just hasnâ€™t inspired me to write anything .
Front page stories in todayâ€™s NYT and WaPo , which have inspired another mini- surge in blog outrage , continue to leave me yawning .
I wrote in January 2006 that “ When cornered , righties will either fall back on â€ œDemsâ€ ( or â€ œClintonâ€ ) â€œdid it too , â€  or else feign boredom .
( Yawn .
So Washington is corrupt .
Who cares ? ) . ”
It ’s where they go when their only other option is admitting the truth .
It is worthy of note that the bulk of the Right Blogosphere only recently moved out of Stage 1 .
You know a Republican scandal is getting long legs when that happens .

Councils in England could soon be allowed to charge residents for the amount of rubbish they throw away .
But what effect have " pay as you throw " systems had in other countries ?
Lokeren 's paying system was unpopular with residents at first
When I visited the Flanders town of Lokeren - half - way between Antwerp and Ghent - I was following in the footsteps of environment minister Ben Bradshaw .
He went with a team of officials last year to see how this part of Belgium recycles more than 70 % of its household waste .
In Lokeren itself , the rate is nearly 80 % - more than three times that in England as a whole .
So how do the Flemish do it ?
Not long ago the cost of rubbish collection and disposal was " hidden " in the main local tax - as it is in Britain .
But a few years ago the Flemish moved to a system where people pay a separate annual waste fee .
In Lokeren , it 's set at 80 euros ( £ 56 ) .
On top of that , they pay variable charges based on the weight and volume of waste they leave for collection .
Chipped bin
The idea is to encourage people to produce less waste and recycle more .
For the keenest recyclers , the total final bill for the year including the fixed charge can be as little as £ 70 .
Suspicious householders even weighed their bins on their bathroom scales because they did n't trust the council 's measurement
For those who do n't control their waste , it can climb to nearly £ 180 .
The bins are weighed before and after they 're emptied on the truck and the weights recorded in the cab .
The system also reads a microchip under the bin lid which identifies it as belonging to that household .
Some papers have dubbed this the " spy in the bin " , but it can't see what you throw away , it merely confirms that the bin is yours .
Fly - tipping fears
At first , some families were hostile .
Suspicious householders even weighed their bins on their bathroom scales because they did n't trust the council 's measurement .
Compost heaps can help reduce the amount of waste Now , though , the vast majority accept the system as the best way of encouraging recycling and helping the environment .
Although people were given the chance to buy locks for their bins to stop neighbours dumping their rubbish in them , only 300 out of 40,000 households asked for one .
There was no significant rise in fly - tipping , and where illegal dumps did spring up the council quickly pounced on them and put up warning notices .
Chicken solution
One family I met said the payment - by - weight system had changed their behaviour .
They now tend to buy food with less packaging , like fresh fruit and vegetables .
Councils are under enormous pressure to reduce their waste mountain
And because they are also charged for food and garden waste - though at a lower rate than other rubbish - they avoid using the green bin at all through a mixture of composting and using chickens , which gobble up much of their left - over food .
The local authority has even arranged with local poultry dealers to give discounts on hens bought for this purpose .
Dirk Strubbe , who runs municipal waste services for six Flemish councils , admitted there was some resistance to payment by weight when it was first proposed .
He emphasised that the public must be on board first .
" A large communication project has to be established to convince the population before you begin pay - as - you - throw , " he said .
Pilot schemes
The British government is expected to publish its long - awaited waste strategy review soon .
There 's speculation it may talk about giving councils in England the power to introduce variable waste charging .
Some councils are already piloting the technology .
Given that the tax on dumping in landfill is increasing by leaps and bounds - Chancellor Gordon Brown announcing another increase of £ 8 a ton in his Budget - councils are under enormous pressure to reduce their waste mountain .
So it would n't be surprising if , given the chance , some councils follow the lead countries like Belgium have given .

What are these ?
SpeakEasy , a tiny provider of voice and data services , is about to be swallowed up by BestBuy .
SpeakEasy is the Seattle - based ISP that won the hearts and minds of net geeks several years ago by allowing them to freely share their Internet connections , while other , bigger ISPs spent their time trying to quash " rogue " Wi -Fi hotspots , which they regarded as a form of theft .
The purchase , by a bix - box electronics retailer , is a bit like Yahoo buying out Flickr or Google swallowing up Writely – it 's just a bummer , man , for people who like to wave the flag of net independence .
More puzzling is the acquisition price – $ 97 million in cash , or just 1.2 times the company 's 2006 revenue of $ 80 million .
Now I 'm not in the M&A business , and this question might just reveal my naivete , but is n't that awfully cheap for a successful niche ISP with 40,000 customers ?
My guess is that Speakeasy 's investors , which include 3i , Cornerstone Ventures , Granite Ventures , BB Capital , the Intel Communications Fund , Matthew G. Norton , and Ares Management , are bailing out .
We 'll have more as we dig it up .
Stay tuned .
I have written previously about the “ psychics ” so popular in our culture , whose pretense of being able to speak to the dead and otherwise gain knowledge through supernatural powers wins them wealth and accolades from a credulous public and a shallow , sensationalist media , despite the total lack of convincing evidence to date that any of them can do what they say they can do .
One of the worst of the lot is Sylvia Browne .
After agreeing on national television to take James Randi ’s million - dollar challenge to prove her powers , she subsequently reneged on that agreement and has been avoiding it ever since .
Browne ’s alleged powers have failed her spectacularly on numerous instances , including when she erroneously claimed on the air that the victims of the Sago mine catastrophe would be found alive , although ultimately 11 of the 12 perished , and when she falsely told Shawn Hornbeck ’s grieving parents that their son was dead , when in reality he had been alive all the time and was rescued from his kidnapper several weeks ago .
She also wrongly predicted the discovery of a nicotine addiction vaccine , the return of American soldiers from Iraq , and the electoral defeat of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California , and told a 9/11 widow that her firefighter husband had drowned , in addition to many other errors .
In the past , blunders such as these would have made little difference : skeptics would have dutifully cataloged them and pointed them out to anyone who would listen , their effort would have been almost totally ignored by the masses who idolized psychic claimants like Browne , and media pundits and book publishers would have dismissed these annoying facts and continued to seek out and promote Browne and others like her .
After all , what really matters in popular culture is not the truth or accuracy of a person ’s claims , but only whether enough people believe those claims and are willing to support them – with their votes , their wallets , or whatever else .
The lack of widespread understanding of the principles of critical thinking in our society makes it easy for psychic claims to take root .
People ’s desire to believe in supernatural powers and an afterlife leads them to concentrate on the hits and forget the misses .
And media empires driven by profit and spectacle have no interest in debunking popular delusions and fallacies , but only in showing people what they most want to see , which will attract the most eyeballs and therefore the most advertiser dollars .
As I said , that was the way it was in the past .
To a large extent , that is the way it still is .
But there are some very encouraging signs that skepticism and critical thinking are finally gaining a foothold , however tenuous , in the media .
On several recent occasions , Browne ’s claims were forcefully challenged on national television – mostly by James Randi , to whose tireless efforts we all owe a debt of gratitude – on shows such as Anderson Cooper 360 and Larry King Live , and it seems she is feeling the heat .
Hence , the blustery legal threat letter Browne ’s lawyers have sent to StopSylviaBrowne.com , an excellent website that keeps track of her blunders .
The letter claims that “ Sylvia Browne ” is a registered trademark and that the anti-Browne website is infringing her trademark by using it .
These claims are , of course , utter and complete nonsense .
The bedrock legal principle of fair use specifically protects the use of trademarked names and logos for purposes of commentary , criticism and parody , as Stanford University ’s page on fair use explains :
If you are commenting upon or critiquing a copyrighted work — for instance , writing a book review — fair use principles allow you to reproduce some of the work to achieve your purposes .
Browne ’s threat letter is an especially risible and ridiculous disregard for the principles of fair use .
If claims like this were accepted by the court system , it would be impossible to criticize any person or corporation that held a trademark on its name , because merely to mention that name without permission would be an infringement of the trademark holder ’s rights .
Such a dramatically expansive interpretation of the law would completely destroy the right of free speech .
But , as I said , that is not the law .
Browne ’s claims are without legal foundation , something of which her lawyers must be well aware .
Clearly , the letter was not sent out of a realistic hope of prevailing in court , but rather was sent in the hope that their target did not know his rights and would back down in the face of intimidating language by a much larger and better - funded adversary .
( It brings to mind the incident when Fox News sued political humorist Al Franken over his book Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them : A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right , with Fox asserting that it owned the three words “ fair and balanced ” and that those words could not be used in that order without its permission .
This claim actually did go to court , and was promptly laughed back out of it by the judge . )
Fortunately , that was not the case .
Robert Lancaster , the author of StopSylviaBrowne.com , is well aware of his rights and has held firm , for which I commend him .
His courageous and principled defense of the truth against cowardly tactics of intimidation deserves to be widely known , which is why I have written this entry .
It also needs to be more widely known that Sylvia Browne is so fearful of open criticism and exposure of her blunders that she would rather try to silence her critics with lawsuits than respond to them .
Such tactics are reprehensible and deserve nothing but scorn from good citizens and friends of free speech everywhere .
Addendum : After posting this , I found a resource from the invaluable Electronic Frontier Foundation , a steadfast defender of online free speech , addressing the exact claim made by Browne ’s lawyers and pointing out that settled precedent flatly contradicts it :

As Jason Wall sees it , success is all about having a ball .
Since 1998 , Wall has been topping car antennas with happy faces , 8 - balls and even cowgirls - complete with braids and hats .
Wall is president and CEO of In - Concept Inc. , the company behind Antennaballs.com , which manufactures more than 500,000 custom antenna balls per month .
Based in Glendale , California , Antennaballs.com owes its success to one “ man ” : Jack .
It all started when Wall saw a Jack In The Box fast - food commercial in mid-1997 that said the company had sold more than 3 million antenna balls .
Sensing opportunity , Wall came up with a few designs he thought would penetrate the auto accessory and novelty industries .
The designs stuck .
After selling four million balls through local gas stations and convenience stores , Wall recently landed some major national accounts , including AutoZone , Circle K and Wal - Mart , and he ’s negotiating licensing deals with Universal Studios .
With sales of $ 1.15 million for 1999 ( one year after he started his business ) , Wall attributes timeliness to his overnight success .
Six years later , Jason Wall is a multimillionaire .
But it was n’t all easy .
First , in 1999 Coolballs.com -DDS , Co. , a division of Self Reliant Systems , Inc. has filed a lawsuit against Wally Balls , L.L.C. , Jason Wall , and IN - Concept , Inc .
The amended complaint alleged copyright infringement , false designation of origin and unfair competition relating to Coolballs ' ( R ) proprietary antenna ball designs .
After the issue was resolved HappyBalls.com , online retailer of antenna ball toppers , and In - Concept , Inc. , ( www.AntennaBalls.com), developer and distributor of custom antenna toppers , announced an agreement to join forces in January of 2006 .
“ This alliance is a perfect fit , ” says Jeremy Turner , founder and owner of the Florida - based HappyBalls.com .
“ Our website carries over 500 unique and collectible antenna toppers , ” says Turner .
“ This partnership will create one of the largest antenna ball manufacturing and distribution companies in the United States . "
“ The next time you are driving down the road , look at people ’s antennas , ” says Turner , “ You will be amazed at how many antenna balls are out there .
Companies seeking effective advertising methods should consider the low cost of antenna toppers , ” he says .
“ At its peak , Union 76 sold 4 million antenna toppers each year , and if you saw one of their antenna toppers , their advertising message worked - and it worked well .
This is viral marketing at its best , ” Turner says .
“ You can get your message across much more cost effectively with four million antenna balls than just one 30 - second television commercial .
Your customers and potential customers carry your advertisement with them wherever they go for the entire world to see - a constant reminder of your product or service , ” says Turner .
“ It ’s very easy to think of a good idea , ” Jason Wall says .
“ But I think success really comes down to execution and perseverance . ”

“ ALL warfare is based on deception ” , wrote Sun Tzu , a Chinese military strategist who lived 2,500 years ago and remains influential in China today .
The recent revelation by the Americans that China had destroyed an ageing weather satellite with a missile has certainly caused surprise and confusion .
Why should a country so insistent that its rise threatens no - one stage such an open display of its ability to challenge American power in space ?
China had been fuelling the mystery by neither confirming nor denying America 's assertion on January 18th that the Chinese satellite was blown up about 500 miles above earth by a medium - range ballistic missile a week earlier .
Then on January 23rd a spokesman for China 's foreign ministry confirmed the satellite had been shot down .
It was the first experiment of its kind by any country in more than 20 years ( though there have been vague rumours of others ) .
America itself , as well as the former Soviet Union , are the only other countries to have tested anti-satellite weapons .
Only two days after the apparently successful test , China 's prime minister Wen Jiabao arrived in the Philippine city of Cebu to attend a regional summit .
While there he called on fellow leaders to help China build a “ harmonious East Asia ” .
The test , however , has created widespread unease .
Some of Mr Wen 's interlocutors in Cebu , including Australia , Japan and South Korea , have since joined a chorus of Western criticism .
The Americans , with their heavy dependence on military satellites and their commitment to help Taiwan defend itself from any attack by China , have the most to worry about .
China has never admitted to having an anti-satellite weapons programme .
But since the 1990s , Western experts believe China has become increasingly alarmed by the military advantage enjoyed by America thanks to its satellites .
China is also worried that its strategic nuclear arsenal could be rendered useless by American efforts to build a missile defence system that includes space - based components .
America has long suspected China of developing anti-satellite technology .
Last September reports emerged that China had been pointing high - powered lasers at American spy satellites passing over its territory .
The apparent aim was to test an ability to blind them .
A Pentagon report last May noted China 's “ rapid and relatively smooth rise as an emerging space power ” , with plans for its own manned space station by 2020 .
China 's intention , it seems , is to show that American supremacy in space is not unassailable .
It also has a more immediate goal .
In 2002 , China and Russia proposed a treaty banning the deployment of weapons in space or attacks against space - based objects .
China 's concern was that the American missile defence system would lead to increasing use of space for military purposes and fuel an arms race .
The Americans have refused to negotiate , saying such a treaty would be unenforceable and would only give an advantage to countries ( for which read , China ) that are trying hide their efforts to develop weapons for use in space .
By destroying one of its own weather satellites , China might have been trying to force the Americans to the table .
If so , it was a risky strategy .
The test is likely to reinforce perceptions in America of China as an emerging threat .
Japan and Taiwan will also be rattled .
On January 22nd Taiwan — apparently trying to reinforce international opprobrium directed at its rival — said China had deployed some 900 missiles on the coast facing the island in recent years .
Last August it had put the figure at 820 .
The test is unlikely to foster closer co-operation between the American and Chinese civilian space programmes .
Last September , in a sign of tentative warming between the two sides , Michael Griffin of NASA paid the first trip to China by a head of the American government 's space agency .
But China will have made no friends in NASA by littering space with fragments from the explosion that could threaten other spacecraft .
“ If your opponent is of choleric temper , seek to irritate him ” , said Sun Tzu .
China has certainly succeeded in that .
Billions of pounds are being spent on the fight against AIDS in developing countries .
In this week 's British Medical Journal , two experts go head to head over whether we are spending too much .
HIV is receiving relatively too much money , with much of it used inefficiently and sometimes counterproductively , argues Roger England , Chairman of Health Systems Workshop .
Data show that 21 % of health aid was allocated to HIV in 2004 , up from 8 % in 2000 .
It could now exceed a quarter .
Yet HIV constitutes only 5 % of the burden of disease in low and middle income countries as measured by disability adjusted life years lost ( DALYs ) .
It causes 2.8 million deaths a year worldwide -- fewer than the number of stillbirths , and much less than half the number of infant deaths .
More deaths are attributable to diabetes than to HIV .
Furthermore , HIV interventions are not cost effective enough to justify this disproportionate spending , he writes .
Much HIV money could be spent with more certain benefits on , for example , bed nets , immunisation , or family planning .
Money is also wasted in areas that reflect the interests of those on the AIDS industry payroll more than evidence .
He believes that the money could be more effective if used to strengthen public health systems rather than focusing on disease - specific programmes .
AIDS is widely acknowledged as a public health crisis and current spending is woefully inadequate , argue Paul de Lay and colleagues at the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS ( UNAIDS ) .
Resources currently pledged are only half of what is needed for a comprehensive response .
For instance , in 2006 , $ 9bn was available for the AIDS response but the real need was estimated at $ 15 bn .
Poor coordination between different stakeholders in affected countries also impedes effective spending .
This is compounded by weak institutions and regulatory policies , poor governance , and in some cases corruption .
They argue that the response to AIDS needs to be seen in the context of international commitments to the millennium development goals , which also call for progress across many other developmental priorities .
HIV threatens many of these goals , especially those related to poverty and health .
The cost of inaction against AIDS is huge , far greater than for any other public health crisis , they say .
Current costs are so high because of the inadequacy of previous investments , but they will be higher tomorrow if we continue to underinvest .
Many of our readers know that in the middle of Moscow , right on the Red Square , next to the Kremlin there is a Lenin ’s tomb , called “ mausoleum ” .
There , inside , mummy of Lenin lies .
Really , not only Egyptians made mummies but Soviet authorities decided to make a mummy of Lenin as a symbol of Soviet Era and October Revolution .
This Lenin ’s tomb was a real shrine for all the Russian people who came all over the vast Russia to visit the Red Square and mausoleum .
There were alway long lines on entrance , people had to wait a few hours as minimum in order to enter and take a fast glance of Lenin , or the piece of what 70 years ago was called Lenin .
Nowadays many people demand to remove the body or the mummy from the middle of the Red Square and bury it , but still there are many people brought up in communist style who are against this so powers afraid on making some sheer action on the tomb .
And because its all made of flesh and bones , at least it was made of it , it needs some cleaning and service a few times a year .
Here we have some screenshots from Russian TV channel where the operation of regular service on Lenin ’s mummy was shown .
Please be informed that some of the pics may be a little bit not a nice thing to look at .
Buda ’s Wagon .
A Brief History of the Car Bomb
The car bomb was invented in the US and was used to devastating effect by Mario Buda , an anarchist who exploded his horse - drawn wagon on Wall Street in 1920 , thus prompting the title to Buda ’s Wagon , a new book by often controversial and politically radical Mike Davis .
Buda was the first car bomber , his progeny are many .
The Zionist Stern Gang used car bombs in the late 1940 ’s to blow up buildings in Palestine in an attempt to drive out the British and terrorize Palestinians .
The Irgun and Haganah , underground Zionist groups labeled as terrorists by the British , quickly followed suit .
The use of car bombs by Zionists represented a major step forward both in the lethality of the bombs and their use as political weapons .
However , Palestinians and Arabs soon learned the technology and responded with the same , prompting one of the founders of Israel , Ben-Gurion , to say after the bombing of a Haganah headquarters , “ I could n’t forget that ‘ our ’ thugs and murderers had blazed this trail . ”
Prophetic words indeed .
Car bombs do n’t care who use them , and Davis details how the technology to create them travels from one hot zone to the next , as their practitioners spread the knowledge worldwide .
Instrumental in the spread of car bombing techniques from the 1980 ’s onward was the lunatic Bill Casey of the CIA and ISI , the shadowy secret police of Pakistan who are considered among the best in the world and are a power unto themselves .
Car bombs are often successfully used by hardliners in a dispute to destroy the possibility of peace talks .
Sow enough chaos , terror , and hatred , and peace negotiations often collapse .
This has been a precise goal at times by Zionists , the LTTE in Sri Lanka , the IRA , and many others .
Other times , car bombs can be used to force concessions , like with IRA bombings in London in the 1990’s .
The bombs were deliberately targeted to damage the faltering British insurance companies , and it did indeed cost the companies billions of dollars and nearly cratered Lloyds of London .
That blowing up a building in an urban area , killing innocents , will often cause mass reaction against your political aims is something that escapes car bombers .
Or maybe , blood - crazed with visions of retribution , they do n’t care .
Sometimes the car bombers are rival drug cartels or organized crime factions .
Then , of course , there is little political motive .
Car bombs can achieve spectacular political results .
Witness the Hezbollah bombings in Lebanon in the 80’s that destroyed a US barracks dubbed the “ Beirut Hilton ” and a French barracks as well .
In both cases these large buildings ( the French barracks was nine floors ) were blown off their foundations , which gives some idea of the immense force of the explosions .
These bombings led directly to the immediate US withdrawal from Lebanon .
Davis makes it clear that car bombs , while sometimes achieving short - term gains , generally lead to increased violence from the the other side ( or sides ) thus creating ever more mayhem and dead innocents .
Using Iraq as an example , some car bombs are aimed at US forces , others are specifically used to create Sunni - Shia divisions .
Islamic hardliners use car bombs to reinforce sectarian divisions because they do not want nationalism to occur because that would mean they ’d then have no power base .
Doubtless many other players there do n’t want nationalism either .
Davis closes by saying
All sides , moreover , now play by Old Testament rules and every laser - guided missile falling on an apartment house in southern Beirut or a mud-walled compound in Kandahar is a future suicide truck bomb headed for the center of Tel Aviv or perhaps downtown Los Angeles .
Buda ’s wagon truly has become the hot rod of the apocalypse .
Car bombs are an example of how small groups operating in diffuse networks can produce devastating effects against much larger foes .
This is what John Robb talks about in his new book Brave New War : The Next Stage of Terrorism and the End of Globalization , which will be the topic of my next book review .
He blogs about this at Global Guerrillas and at his personal blog .

Is it fair to say that finding a soul mate is pretty important ?
If so , online dating sites should be full of sparkling bon mots , as people try to woo prospects .
As a dater on Match.com , you have two key ways to communicate something quickly about yourself : a picture and a headline .
The pic , of course , should embrace the social norm and be from 10 years and 20 pounds ago .
With the headline , you can start from scratch .
Given the stakes , these headlines should really zing .
They do n’t .
We examined more than 1,000 Match.com ads–from men and women , old and young .
Our search yielded headlines like this one : “ Hey . ” Folks , if your opening line is “ Hey , ” you better be hot .
Another said “ Looking for love . ”
Well , duh , you ’re on Match.com .
At least two - thirds of the headlines said nothing –and did it poorly .
Why do these headlines suck so much ?
Fear .
Fear of saying too much .
Fear of saying something clever that someone might think is stupid .
Fear of saying something revealing that might turn someone off .
The headlines try desperately not to exclude anyone .
In doing so , they succeed at boring everyone .
The “ Hey ” phenomenon is rampant in the corporate world .
Branding is nothing more than a company ’s personal ad , and companies are as bad at it as singles .
Gap , for example , is the “ Hey ” of fashion , thus its recent woes .
And Ford Motor Co. –who , exactly , does it want to date ?
Brands with enough scale think they can get away with being generically likable .
And some can , at least for a little while .
Everyone else has to be ready to turn some people off .
Consider Honest Tea , a fast - growing indie beverage expected to hit $ 25 million in sales this year .
Its tagline ?
“ Real Tea . Real Taste. Honest . ”
In other words , “ Hey . ” ( Or do some tea drinkers seethe at the very notion of Real Taste ? )
If anything , the fear of being disliked afflicts marketers more acutely than daters , because the stakes are higher .
“ Most marketers feel that if they make a bold statement , they risk not just alienating customers–but also their boss , and their boss ’s boss , ” says Charles Rosen , founding partner of Amalgamated ad agency .
“ That fear takes the edge off of all communications . ”
First -- and most importantly -- Reagan never balanced a budget .
In fact , Reagan never came close to balancing a budget .
For all of his talk about hating big government , Reagan did a fair amount of solid work in creating a bigger federal government .
Here 's a graph of the Federal expenditures and receipts for 1981 to 1989 .
Notice that the receipts scale on the right has a lower scale than the expenditures scale on the left .
Also notice that federal expenditures almost doubled under his unique brand of fiscal conservatism .
The end result of all of this spending splurge is a massive increase in government debt .
Here 's a graph of total federal debt outstanding .
And here 's a chart of the year over year percentage change in total debt outstanding .
At least he was consistent .
The bottom line is Reagan loved to charge his policies on the national credit card .
And those " record tax revenues " were n't that extraordinary either .
In fact , his tax cuts never even came close to paying for themselves .
Let 's compare the increase in Reagan 's tax revenues to the periods immediately before and after his presidency .
March 1975 - January 1980
Tax Revenues increased from $ 158.0 billion to $ 284.2 billion .
This is an overall increase of 79 % .
During this period , the capital gains rate increased from 45 % to 50 % in about 1977 ( I'm eyeballing the chart ) .
Over this period the inflation level increased from 52.7 to 82.7 or an increase of 30 % .
This makes the overall increase in tax revenues from individuals 49 % .
November 1982 to July 1990
Tax Revenues increased from $ 356.0 billion to $ 598 .
This is an overall increase of 67 % .
During this period , the capital gains rate increased from 50 % to 18 % in the early 1980s .
The top marginal rate decreased from 70 % to 50 % in about 1983 .
( I 'm eyeballing the chart )
Over this period the inflation level increased from 98.0 to 130.4 or an increase of 33 % .
This makes the overall increase in tax revenues from individuals 34 % .
March 1991 -- March 2001
Tax Revenues increased from $ 578 billion to $ 1,296.6 .
This is an overall increase of 124 % .
During this period , the capital gains rate decreased from 30 % to 20 % in the early 1997 .
The top marginal rate increased from 30 % to 40 % in the early to mid 1990s .
( I 'm eyeballing the chart )
Over this period the inflation level increased from 135.0 to 176.2 or an increase of 31 % .
This makes the overall increase in tax revenues from individuals 93 % .
If the Republican candidates want to claim the mantle of Reagan -- go ahead .
It 's not that impressive .
But let 's make sure the whole story gets told , shall we ?
Radix Sort Revisited
Pierre Terdiman
Last revision : 04.01.2000
In every decent programmer ’s toolbox lies a strange weapon called a Radix Sort .
Where does it come from ?
Who invented it ?
I do n’t know .
As far as I can remember it was there , fast , easy , effective .
Really effective .
So unbelievably useful I ’ve never really understood why people would want to use something else .
The reasons ?
Most of the time , they tell me about floats , negative values , and why their new quick - sort code rocks .
Enough , I ’m tired .
Although the standard Radix Sort does n’t work very well with floating point values , this is something actually very easy to fix .
In this little article I will review the standard Radix Sort algorithm , and enhance it so that :
- it sorts negative floats as well
- it has reduced complexity for bytes and words
- it uses temporal coherence
- it supports sorting on multiple keys
Motivation
Is it worth writing anything in 2000 about a sort routine ?
Does n’t everyone already have one ?
Are n’t those things already well known ?
Everyone knows how to sort negative floats with a Radix , do n’t you think ?
Well , that ’s what I would ’ve said some weeks ago .
But I recently wandered on Ming C. Lin ’s homepage [ 2 ] , and began to read her courses .
Here ’s what I found :
« Counting sort and radix sort are good for integers .
For floating point numbers , try bucket sort or other comparison - based methods » ( 21 sept . 1999 ) [ 3 ]
As you see this is not very old … I read more of the courses , read some older papers about collision detection , and it appeared my own way of dealing with a specific part of this problem was ( at least from a theoretical point of view ) faster than the official one .
Hence , I think this article will be useful for beginners as well as for experienced programmers .
Review of the Radix Sort
A Radix Sort is an apparently bizarre sort routine which manages to sort values without actually performing any comparisons on input data .
That ’s why this sort routine breaks the theoretical lower bound of the O ( N * logN ) complexity , which only applies for comparison - based sorts .
Radix is O ( k* N ) , with k = 4 most of the time , and although this is not an in - place sort ( i.e. it uses extra storage ) it is so much faster than any other sorting methods it has become a very popular way of sorting data .
The algorithm
What is a radix , anyway ?
Roughly we can say a radix is a position in a number .
In the decimal system , a radix is just a digit in a decimal number .
For example the number « 42 » has two digits , or two radices , which are 4 and 2 .
In hexadecimal the radix is 8 bits wide .
For example the hexadecimal number 0xAB has two radices , A and B . The Radix Sort gets its name from those radices , because the method first sorts the input values according to their first radix , then according to the second one , and so on .
The Radix Sort is then a multipass sort , and the number of passes equals the number of radices in the input values .
For example you ’ll need 4 passes to sort standard 32 bits integers , since in hexadecimal the radix is a byte .
By the way that ’s why the Radix Sort is often called Byte Sort .
How does it work ?
Say you want to sort some bytes , for example those ones :
54 , 18 , 2 , 128 , 3
The idea behind the Radix Sort is to read input values and immediately store them at the right place .
Have a look at that sample code :
unsigned char InputValues [ ] = { 54 , 18 , 2 , 128 , 3 } ;
int SortedBuffer [ 256 ] ;
memset ( SortedBuffer , - 1 , 256*sizeof( int ) ) ; //
Fill with –1
for ( int i=0 ; i < 5 ; i++) { for ( int i=0 ; i < 5 ;i++ ) {
unsigned char c = InputValues [i ] ;
SortedBuffer[c ] = c ; SortedBuffer[c ] = c ;
}
// Now you can read SortedBuffer and get values back in sorted order
You may think this example is stupid – it is !
– but it nicely introduces the ideas we ’ll have to deal with .
What do we need to change in that code , in order for it to become useful ?
First we need to get rid of the empty destination locations , so that the destination buffer ( called SortedBuffer in our example ) has the same size as the input buffer ( i.e. enough for 5 values , no more ) .
We also need a way to handle collisions – collisions in the hash - table sense of the word , i.e. we must be able to deal with two equal input values and know how to store both of them in the final buffer .
Luckily enough , both problems are solved by the same solution : an offset table .
The offset table is a 256 - entries table telling us , for each possible input byte , where we should store the result .
It is usually built in two passes , one to compute the distribution of bytes in the input flow ( i.e. histograms , or counters ) , another one to create the offset table according to this distribution .
This sample code creates the counters :
int Counters [ 256 ] ;
memset ( Counters , 0 , 256*sizeof( int ) ) ; //
Set all counters to 0
for ( i =0 ; i < NbItems ; i++) { //
Loop over the input array
unsigned char c = InputValues [i ] ; //
Get current byte …
Counters[c ] ++ ; // … and update counter
}
We can now create the offset table :
int OffsetTable [ 256 ] ; int OffsetTable [ 256 ] ;
OffsetTable [ 0 ] = 0 ; OffsetTable [ 0 ] = 0 ;
for(i=1;i<256 ;i++ ) {
OffsetTable [i ] = OffsetTable [ i- 1 ] + Counters [ i - 1 ] ;
}
Now , for each input byte , we can get the right offset back thanks to this table , put the input byte at the right place in the destination buffer , increase the offset , and repeat the sequence for the next byte .
For example :
unsigned char c = InputValues [i ] ;
DestinationBuffer[OffsetTable[c ] ++ ] = c ;
The destination buffer wo n’t have any empty locations : we have enough room in it for the same number of values as in the input buffer , no more .
Thanks to the offsets we know exactly where we must store them , and whenever an empty location would have existed in our first example , here it does n’t appear because no offset actually maps that empty location .
Collisions are not a problem either because offsets are increased each time we use one of them .
If we have two identical bytes in input , the first one will be put in Destination Buffer [ Offset ] , Offset will be increased , and the next one will then fall in DestinationBuffer [ Offset +1 ] .
Radix sort is stable by the way , which means two same values in input will be in the same order in output .
This last point is very important to understand the next step : how can we extend the process in order to sort not only bytes but also words , dwords , or event character strings ?
This is actually very simple : we just have to sort again according to the next radix .
Recall a radix actually is a byte in the values to sort .
The first radix is the LSB ( Least Significant Byte ) .
The last one must be the MSB ( Most Significant Byte ) .
Between those two , we perform all necessary passes .
The second pass does n’t destroy what has been done in the first one because the sorting method is stable .
Example : say we want to sort those hexadecimal values :
0xBC , 0xAB , 0xBA , 0xAC , 0xBB , 0xAA
The first pass leads to :
0xBA
0xAA
0xAB
0xBB
0xBC
0xAC
Note that the list is sorted according to the last column ( ie the LSB which is the first radix ) .
The second pass will sort this list according to the first column ( ie the MSB , our second radix ) and since the sorting method is stable , the 3 numbers 0xAA , 0xAB and 0xAC which share the same MSB will be found in output in the same order as in input .
And since the input order has been determined by the first sorting pass , eh , it ’s already sorted according to the LSB , and here we are with the final sorted list :
0xAA
0xAB
0xAC
0xBA
0xBB
0xBC
Radix selection is performed by shifting and ANDing the input value according to the pass number :
unsigned char Radix = ( InputValues [ i ] >>( Pass < < 3 ) ) & 0xFF ;
… where pass begins to 0 and gets increased for each new pass .
Sorting floating point values
Ok , that was the standard Radix Sort , as most of us knew it on old 16 bits computers .
What happened then , was the following : one day , we all switched to 80486 ( or Pentium ) and suddenly we had floats .
At first sight , a Radix Sort ca n’t deal with floats : the inner structure of a float is n’t obvious , you do n’t really see how to shift them or AND a value with them ( the algorithm involves such an operation , as seen just above ) , you do n’t even know how to do it .
The first step is to learn how a floating - point value is actually built .
This is well known nowadays : the first bit is the sign bit , the next 8 bits are the biased exponent , and the 23 last ones are the mantissa .
The exponent is always positive thanks to the bias .
Chris
Hecker once wrote a good introduction paper to the numerous floating - points tricks you can afford on Intel processors [ 1 ] .
Let ’s quote him :
« Because the exponent are always positive ( and are in more significant bits than the mantissa ) , large numbers compare greater than small numbers even when the floating - point values are compared as normal integer bits .
The sign bit throws a monkey wrench in this , but it works great for single - signed values . »
I could n’t have said that better .
And from this point , it is easy to see why it works with positive floats .
Let ’s define a function IR ( x ) as the integer representation of any floating - point value x .
For example the floating - point value 42.0 has a binary representation of 0x42280000 .
In other words :
IR ( 42.0 ) = 0x42280000
The Radix Sort works with positive floats because for any floating - point values x and y ,
x > y >0 => IR ( x ) > IR (y )
Hence x and y will be treated by the sorting code as IR ( x ) and IR(y ) , and the final order will be correct .
This is easy to check : just cast your float pointer into integer pointer and ask your code to sort your array of positive floats !
It works .
Well , it does n’t work on DEC Alpha because the float format is different , but that ’s another story : it works provided you use IEEE floats , which means it works on PC , on Dreamcast , and so on .
Entering the negative zone
Things begin to be painful with negative floats .
Recall the float inner structure : the sign bit is just the most significant one , and the only difference between x and –x is that sign bit .
On one hand , this provides us with an ultra - fast fabs ( ) routine ( just one bit to clear ) :
inline float fabs ( float x ) {
return ( float& ) ( ( unsigned int& ) x ) &0x7 fffffff ;
}
On the other hand , we ’re in trouble because for any floating - point values x and y ,
x <y < 0 => IR ( x ) > IR (y )
What does it mean ?
Simple : the sorting code goes berserk , and sees our two negative floats as huge positive integers .
Here ’s what could be the possible output of a standard Radix Sort on 10 arbitrary floats :
2083.000000
2785.000000
8080.000000
10116.000000
10578.000000
12974.000000
-660.000000
-4906.000000
- 10050.000000
-16343.000000
Not really what we want , and that ’s why people usually say a Radix Sort does n’t work with negative floats .
Oh , well .
Let ’s make it work then !
A nice and obvious thing to see is that the negative values are sorted anyway , they ’re just at the wrong place ( after the positive ones ) and in the wrong order ( big negative values are listed after the little ones ) .
The first possible hack is something like the « brute - force way of life » : read the sorted buffer in search of the first negative value ( sublinear time ) , deduct from its position the number of negative floating - points values , copy all the positive floats at their right place in another buffer , then copy the remaining negative values in reverse order at the beginning of the new buffer .
Ouch !
It works , but it ’s quite ugly .
Moreover , if you ’re sorting a lot of values ( I ’m doing all my tests with 10000 ) , this is far from optimal .
The elegant way is to tackle the problem before actually sorting the values .
First of all , we want to know how many negative values we ’re dealing with .
No need to read the input or output buffers once again : we actually already have this information , hidden in the counters .
For integers as for floats , sign is determined by the most significant bit .
So , what we want is just the number of entities whose most significant bit is 1 .
In our radix - process , those are to be found in the 128 last entries of the last counter .
All we have to do is to sum them up :
NbNegativeValues = 0 ;
for( i=128 ;i<256 ;i++ ) {
NbNegativeValues += LastCounter[i ] ;
}
That is elegant .
Of course if you ’re sorting less than 128 values , you ’d better stick to the brute - force solution .
But a Radix Sort , due to the initial overhead , is not something to use blindly on little data sets .
If you use it as I do , for example to sort your alpha - blended polygons ( which are numerous nowadays ) , I assume the second method is a definitive winner .
Now comes the delicate part : we want to patch our offsets so that the final order is correct .
We must fix two things , remember ?
The wrong place and the wrong order .
The easiest way is to take full control of the offsets by introducing a specific piece of code in the fourth pass of our sorting process .
Once we ’re isolated , we ’re free to tweak our offsets the way we want .
Fixing offsets for positive values is a piece of cake .
Let M be the number of negative values previously computed , we must assure positive floats begin after M negative ones .
Fixing the wrong place is then done by forcing the first positive offset to be M :
Offset [ 0 ] = M ;
Since the order was right for positive floats , we ’re done .
Now for negative values .
Recall from the result example of sorted floats that the very last sorted value ( - 16343.0 ) is the biggest negative float , or in other words it should be the very first sorted one .
We can force that quite simply by clearing the offset relative to the very last value :
Offset [ 255 ] = 0 ;
From this point , we want the remaining negative values to go in increasing order , i.e. we must reverse the order of the initial Radix Sort .
This is the most delicate part , which implies computing the offsets in a totally hacked way :
for( i=0 ;i<127 ;i++ ) {
Offset [ 254-i ] = Offset [ 255 -i ] + LastCounter [ 255 -i ] ;
}
This code computes the offsets ranging from 254 - 0 to 254 - 126 , i.e. from 254 to 128 , or in other words the offsets relative to negative values .
Computing them in reverse order , starting from Offset [ 255 ] ( which is null ) , allows our final list of sorted negative floats to be in the right order .
The only little thing we must take care of is the way we update our offsets for negative values … .
For positive ones offsets were increased .
For negative ones they must be decreased .
That is painful because our sorting loop must detect whether we ’re handling a positive or negative value before updating the offset .
Well .
Usually I live with that .
The corresponding code path is only used for the last sorting pass , and in practice the detection is nearly CPU - time free .
Despite the crual lack of elegance , it sorts your negative floating - point values in linear time , and that ’s what matters .
Reducing the complexity
The Radix Sort has a linear complexity of O ( k * N ) .
The crude algorithm uses one pass to create counters , and 4 passes to sort 32 bits values according to 4 different radices .
Hence the complexity is O ( 5 * N ) , this is the best as well as the worst running time for this algorithm , which always runs in constant time .
Nevertheless the information gathered by the very first pass can be used to improve things quite a bit .
For example when sorting words instead of dwords , the two last passes are useless since all involved bytes are null – in other words , none of those two passes will change the order in which the list already is .
The idea then , is to detect those pathological cases and take advantage of them .
When a sorting pass is useless , we can just skip it .
How can we detect that the pass is useless ?
Of course we could trust the user , and our sorting code could have an input parameter , telling us to only perform one or two passes .
But we can do better than that .
This parameter can be computed in a very cheap way thanks to the counters we already have : we just have to check whether one of them is equal to the number of input values or not .
If it is , then all bytes are the same for this pass and we can safely skip it .
If it is n’t , well , we just do the normal job .
Detection is very cheap since we only need to check 256 values in the worst case .
In most cases we can immediately keep the pass ( a counter is not null and not equal to the number of values ) or discard it ( a counter is equal to the number of values ) .
This is a very nice feature for our Radix Sort : now it automatically adapts itself to the input values .
Hence , complexity is reduced to O ( 3 * N ) to sort words , and O ( 2 * N ) to sort bytes .
Running time is also reduced for floating - point values sharing the same mantissa , or the same sign and exponent fields .
It actually happens more often than one may think !
Temporal coherence
When input values are already sorted , even a simple Bubble Sort runs faster than a Radix Sort , because the Bubble Sort reads data once and immediately exits .
In this case , the Radix Sort reads data once to create the counters , then again and again to actually sort the values .
To take advantage of temporal coherence in our Radix Sort , we can do a very little modification in the code which creates the counters .
Since we already have to read the input buffer , there ’s a very little price to pay to be able to detect already sorted input values .
We just have to keep comparing the current input value to the previous one , and update some flag telling us we need sorting or not .
Once again , this is performed in the already existing first loop , so the overhead is negligible : only a few assembler instructions .
And now we can say when the input buffer is already sorted , and just exit in those cases .
Temporal coherence has a very interesting side - effect : the possibility to automatically support multiple sort keys .
Say you ’re working on a MAX exporter , and you want to transform MAX native data into something more hardware - friendly .
You ’ll end up dealing with a bunch of faces you ’ll need to sort according to their rendering properties .
For example each face may have a material ID and a smoothing group dword .
The ideal sort - key would then be a 64 bits qword : the 32 bits material ID followed by 32 smoothing groups bits .
With a standard routine you can sort according to the first key ( e.g. the material ID ) , which leads to multiple groups of faces sharing the same material .
Then , most of the time you call the sort routine again for each group to finish the job .
This is not very elegant , and it quickly becomes a real mess when you have 3 , 4 or even more rendering properties for each face .
Our enhanced Radix Sort automatically takes advantage of temporal coherence , i.e. uses information from the previous sort to initiate the new one .
As a result , all you have to do is to call the sort routine multiple times without doing anything between the calls .
It just gets sorted in one line , as in the following code example .
// say you have N faces to sort
udword * MaterialID ; // a list of N material Ids
udword * SmGrps ; // a list of N smoothing groups
udword *
Whatever ; // a list of N rendering properties
// Create a Radix Sorter
RadixSorter Core ;
// Multiple sorts
Core .
Sort ( MaterialID , N ) . Sort ( SmGrps , N ) . Sort ( Whatever , N ) ;
//
Get a list of N sorted indices , according to all rendering properties
udword * SortedList = Core.GetIndices ( ) ;
Applications
Once your Radix Sort correctly handles floating - point values , there are tons of ways you can use it in Computer Graphics .
Here are two obvious examples :
- Sorting transparent polygons : the correct display of alpha - blended polygons requires you sort them before sending them to the hardware , unless you use a ONE - ONE blending mode .
Some people rely on a Bubble Sort to do that , because the temporal coherence usually makes it very efficient for this kind of stuff ( polygons are almost already sorted from one frame to another ) .
But a Bubble Sort is evil because it may lead to O ( N^2 ) complexity .
A Radix Sort is way safer , and can moreover also use temporal coherence .
- Collision detection : in Ming C. Lin ’s GDC ’2000 presentation about collision detection [ 4 ] , you can find a chapter entitled « Use of sorting methods » which states the sweep - and - prune algorithm should use an initial quick - sort , then rely on temporal coherence to achieve linear running time .
Actually my own sweep - and - prune code uses an enhanced Radix Sort and always runs in O ( N ) , with or without temporal coherence .
The code is simpler than the one included in standard collision detection packages such as V - Collide , it ’s easier to understand , and theoretically runs just as fast .
The now linear sweep - and - prune technique may also be extended to handle generic collisions of dynamic objects .
For example it may be very efficient to handle inter-collisions between particles .
Source code
This article comes with a fully working enhanced Radix Sort ( here ! ) , written in C++ for ease of use .
Some years ago it was worth recoding it in assembly language , unrolling some loops and so on .
Nowadays I just use this piece of C++ code and let it go .

When driving on the motorway , have you ever wondered about ( and cursed ) the fact that cars in the other lane seem to be getting ahead faster than you ?
You might be inclined to account for this by invoking Murphy 's Law ( " If anything can go wrong , it will " , discovered by Edward A. Murphy , Jr , in 1949 ) .
However , a recent paper in Nature by Redelmeier and Tibshirani seeks a deeper explanation .
According to the authors , drivers suffer from systematic illusions causing them to mistakenly think they would have been better off in the next lane .
In this Plus article , we show that their argument fails to take into account an important observation selection effect - namely that cars in the next lane actually do go faster !
All the other cars are faster than me ...
©freefoto.com
In their paper , Redelmeier and Tibshirani present some evidence that drivers on Canadian roadways think that the next lane is typically faster .
( You can read their paper for more about this ) .
They seek to explain the drivers ' perceptions by appealing to a variety of psychological factors .
For example :
" A driver is more likely to glance at the next lane for comparison when he is relatively idle while moving slowly " ;
" Differential surveillance can occur because drivers look forwards rather than backwards , so vehicles that are overtaken become invisible very quickly , whereas vehicles that overtake the index driver remain conspicuous for much longer " ; and
" Human psychology may make being overtaken ( losing ) seem more salient than the corresponding gains . "
The authors recommend that drivers should be educated about these effects in order to reduce the temptation to switch lanes repeatedly .
This would reduce the risk of accidents , which are often caused by poor lane changes .
While all these psychological illusions might indeed occur , there is a more straightforward explanation for the drivers ' persistent suspicion that cars in the next lane are moving faster .
Observation Selection Effects
How big is the smallest fish in the pond ?
You take your wide - meshed fishing net and catch one hundred fishes , every one of which is greater than six inches long .
Does this evidence support the hypothesis that no fish in the pond is much less than six inches long ?
Not if your wide - meshed net can't actually catch smaller fish .
The limitations of your data collection process affect the inferences you can draw from the data .
In the case of the fish - size - estimation problem , a selection effect - the net 's being able to sample only the big fish - invalidates any attempt to extrapolate from the catch to the population remaining in the water .
Had your net had a finer mesh , allowing it to sample randomly from all the fish , then finding a hundred fishes all greater than a foot long would have been good evidence that few if any fish remaining were much smaller .
In the fish net example , a selection effect is introduced by the fact that the instrument you used to collect data sampled from only a subset of the target population .
Analogously , there are selection effects that arise not from the limitations of the measuring device , but from the fact that all observations require the existence of an appropriately positioned observer .
Such an observation selection effect can be seen when asking " For a randomly selected driver , are the cars in the lane next to them actually going faster ? " .
Cars in the next lane do go faster
In general there is a higher density of cars in the slow lane .
©freefoto.com
One frequent cause of why a lane ( or a section of a lane ) is slow is that there are too many cars in it .
Even if the ultimate cause is something else ( for example , road works ) there is nonetheless typically a negative correlation between the speed of a lane and how densely packed it is with vehicles .
Cars travelling at higher speeds are usually separated by longer distances than slower cars , which tend to bunch up .
This leads to a higher density of cars in lanes travelling at slow speeds , meaning that over a given stretch of road there are likely to be more cars in the slower lane (s ) than in the faster lane (s ) .
This in turn means that , when driving on a two lane ( or more ) road system , more of the average driver 's time is spent in the slower lane (s ) .
An important idea in the theory of observation selection effects is that observers should reason as if they were a random sample from the set of all observers .
This means that when making observations of the speed of cars in the next lane , it is important to consider yourself as a random observer , and think about what implications this has on your observation .
If you are driving on the motorway and think of your present observation as a random sample from all the observations made by all the drivers , then chances are that your observation will be made from the viewpoint that most drivers have , which is the viewpoint of the slow - moving lane ( where more cars are likely to be ) .
In other words , appearances are faithful : more often than not , the " next " lane is actually faster !
Furthermore , even when two lanes have the same average speed , it can be advantageous to switch lanes .
This is because what affects a driver who wants to reach her destination as quickly as possible is not the average speed of the lane as a whole , but rather the speed of the section extending maybe a couple of miles forwards from her current position .
More often than not , the next lane has a higher average speed at this scale than does her present lane .
On average , there is therefore a benefit to switching lanes ( which of course has to be balanced against the increased levels of effort and risk involved ) .
A high ' diffusion ' rate means that more cars are changing lanes .
©freefoto.com
Adopting a thermodynamics perspective , it is easy to see that ( at least in the ideal case ) increasing the " diffusion rate " ( that is , the probability of lane - switching ) will speed the approach to " equilibrium " ( where there are equal velocities in both lanes ) , thereby increasing the road 's throughput and the number of vehicles that reach their destinations per unit time .
To summarise , in understanding this problem we must not ignore its inherent observation selection effect .
This resides in the fact that when we randomly select a driver and ask her whether she thinks the next lane is faster , more often than not we will have selected a driver from the lane which is in fact slower and more densely packed .
When we realize this , we see that no case has been made for recommending that drivers change lanes less frequently in order to speed up overall traffic flow .
Why are we here ?
The theory of observation selection effects is a relatively recent development , and it may have implications in a number of other fields ( see Nick 's new book ) .
One example is evolutionary biology , where observation selection effects must be taken into account when addressing questions such as the probability of intelligent life developing on any given earth - like planet .
We know that intelligent life evolved on Earth .
Naively , one might think that this piece of evidence suggests that life is likely to evolve on most Earth - like planets , but that would overlook an observation selection effect .
No matter how small the proportion of all Earth - like planets that evolve intelligent life , we must be from a planet that did ( or we must be able to trace our origin to a planet that did , if we were born in a space colony ) in order to be an observer ourselves .
Our evidence - that intelligent life arose on our planet - is therefore predicted equally well by the hypothesis that intelligent life is very improbable even on Earth - like planets , as it is by the hypothesis that intelligent life is highly probable on Earth - like planets .
The evidence does not distinguish between the two hypotheses ( provided that in both hypotheses intelligent life could have evolved somewhere ) .
Another example comes from cosmology , where observation selection effects are crucial considerations in deriving empirical predictions from so - called multiverse theories , according to which our universe is but one out of a vast ensemble of physically real universes out there .
Anthropic reasoning , the theory of how to detect , diagnose and cure the biases of observation selection effects , is a philosophical goldmine .
Few fields are so rich in empirical implications , touch on so many important scientific questions , pose such intricate paradoxes , and contain such generous quantities of conceptual and methodological confusion that need to be sorted out .
Working in this area is a lot of intellectual fun .
The mathematics used in this field , such as conditional probabilities and Bayes ' Theorem , are covered by fairly elementary arithmetic and probability theory .
The topic of observation selection effects is extremely complex , yet the difficulty lies not in the maths , but in grasping and analysing the underlying principles .

Cheney tells agency that Vice President 's office is not part of the executive branch Michael Roston
Published : Thursday June 21 , 2007 Print This Email This The Office of Vice President Dick Cheney told an agency within the National Archives that for purposes of securing classified information , the Vice President 's office is not an ' entity within the executive branch ' according to a letter released Thursday by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
" The Oversight Committee has learned that over the objections of the National Archives , you exempted the Office of the Vice President from the presidential executive order that establishes a uniform , government - wide system for safeguarding classified national security information , " Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , the Committee 's chairman , wrote in a letter to Cheney .
" Your decision to exempt your office from the President 's order is problematic because it could place national security secrets at risk .
It is also hard to understand given the history of security breaches involving officials in your office . "
Waxman noted that Cheney 's office had declared itself not affected by an executive order amended by President George W. Bush in 2003 regarding classification and declassification of government materials .
" Your position was that your office ' does not believe it is included in the definition of ' agency ' as set forth in the Order ' and ' does not consider itself an ' entity within the executive branch ' that comes into the possession of classified information , ' " a National Archives official claims Cheney chief of staff David Addington wrote to him .
The Vice President 's office 's refusal to comply with the executive order and the National Archives 's request prompted the National Archives to file a complaint with the Attorney General 's office .
But the Justice Department has not followed up on the Archives 's request .
In response , Waxman issued a set of questions to which he requested answers by July 12 .
The full set of documents from Waxman 's office can be found at the Oversight Committee 's website .
Open Source Paradigm Shift
by Tim O'Reilly
June 2004
This article is based on a talk that I first gave at Warburg - Pincus ' annual technology conference in May of 2003 .
Since then , I have delivered versions of the talk more than twenty times , at locations ranging from the O'Reilly Open Source Convention , the UK Unix User 's Group , Microsoft Research in the UK , IBM Hursley , British Telecom , Red Hat 's internal " all - hands " meeting , and BEA 's eWorld conference .
I finally wrote it down as an article for an upcoming book on open source , " Perspectives on Free and Open Source Software , " edited by J. Feller , B. Fitzgerald , S. Hissam , and K. R. Lakhani and to be published by MIT Press in 2005 .
In 1962 , Thomas Kuhn published a groundbreaking book entitled The Structure of Scientific Revolutions .
In it , he argued that the progress of science is not gradual but ( much as we now think of biological evolution ) , a kind of punctuated equilibrium , with moments of epochal change .
When Copernicus explained the movements of the planets by postulating that they moved around the sun rather than the earth , or when Darwin introduced his ideas about the origin of species , they were doing more than just building on past discoveries , or explaining new experimental data .
A truly profound scientific breakthrough , Kuhn notes , " is seldom or never just an increment to what is already known .
Its assimilation requires the reconstruction of prior theory and the re-evaluation of prior fact , an intrinsically revolutionary process that is seldom completed by a single man and never overnight . " [ 1 ]
Kuhn referred to these revolutionary processes in science as " paradigm shifts " , a term that has now entered the language to describe any profound change in our frame of reference .
Paradigm shifts occur from time to time in business as well as in science .
And as with scientific revolutions , they are often hard fought , and the ideas underlying them not widely accepted until long after they were first introduced .
What 's more , they often have implications that go far beyond the insights of their creators .
One such paradigm shift occurred with the introduction of the standardized architecture of the IBM personal computer in 1981 .
In a huge departure from previous industry practice , IBM chose to build its computer from off the shelf components , and to open up its design for cloning by other manufacturers .
As a result , the IBM personal computer architecture became the standard , over time displacing not only other personal computer designs , but over the next two decades , minicomputers and mainframes .
However , the executives at IBM failed to understand the full consequences of their decision .
At the time , IBM 's market share in computers far exceeded Microsoft 's dominance of the desktop operating system market today .
Software was a small part of the computer industry , a necessary part of an integrated computer , often bundled rather than sold separately .
What independent software companies did exist were clearly satellite to their chosen hardware platform .
So when it came time to provide an operating system for the new machine , IBM decided to license it from a small company called Microsoft , giving away the right to resell the software to the small part of the market that IBM did not control .
As cloned personal computers were built by thousands of manufacturers large and small , IBM lost its leadership in the new market .
Software became the new sun that the industry revolved around ; Microsoft , not IBM , became the most important company in the computer industry .
But that 's not the only lesson from this story .
In the initial competition for leadership of the personal computer market , companies vied to " enhance " the personal computer standard , adding support for new peripherals , faster buses , and other proprietary technical innovations .
Their executives , trained in the previous , hardware - dominated computer industry , acted on the lessons of the old paradigm .
The most intransigent , such as Digital 's Ken Olson , derided the PC as a toy , and refused to enter the market until too late .
But even pioneers like Compaq , whose initial success was driven by the introduction of " luggable " computers , the ancestor of today 's laptop , were ultimately misled by old lessons that no longer applied in the new paradigm .
It took an outsider , Michael Dell , who began his company selling mail order PCs from a college dorm room , to realize that a standardized PC was a commodity , and that marketplace advantage came not from building a better PC , but from building one that was good enough , lowering the cost of production by embracing standards , and seeking advantage in areas such as marketing , distribution , and logistics .
In the end , it was Dell , not IBM or Compaq , who became the largest PC hardware vendor .
Meanwhile , Intel , another company that made a bold bet on the new commodity platform , abandoned its memory chip business as indefensible and made a commitment to be the more complex brains of the new design .
The fact that most of the PCs built today bear an " Intel Inside " logo reminds us of the fact that even within a commodity architecture , there are opportunities for proprietary advantage .
What does all this have to do with open source software , you might ask ?
My premise is that free and open source developers are in much the same position today that IBM was in 1981 when it changed the rules of the computer industry , but failed to understand the consequences of the change , allowing others to reap the benefits .
Most existing proprietary software vendors are no better off , playing by the old rules while the new rules are reshaping the industry around them .
I have a simple test that I use in my talks to see if my audience of computer industry professionals is thinking with the old paradigm or the new .
" How many of you use Linux ? " I ask .
Depending on the venue , 20 - 80 % of the audience might raise its hands .
" How many of you use Google ? "
Every hand in the room goes up .
And the light begins to dawn .
Every one of them uses Google 's massive complex of 100,000 Linux servers , but they were blinded to the answer by a mindset in which " the software you use " is defined as the software running on the computer in front of you .
Most of the " killer apps " of the Internet , applications used by hundreds of millions of people , run on Linux or FreeBSD .
But the operating system , as formerly defined , is to these applications only a component of a larger system .
Their true platform is the Internet .
It is in studying these next - generation applications that we can begin to understand the true long - term significance of the open source paradigm shift .
If open source pioneers are to benefit from the revolution we 've unleashed , we must look through the foreground elements of the free and open source movements , and understand more deeply both the causes and consequences of the revolution .
Artificial intelligence pioneer Ray Kurzweil once said , " I 'm an inventor .
I became interested in long - term trends because an invention has to make sense in the world in which it is finished , not the world in which it is started . " [ 2 ]
I find it useful to see open source as an expression of three deep , long - term trends :
Long term trends like these " three Cs " , rather than the Free Software Manifesto or The Open Source Definition , should be the lens through which we understand the changes that are being unleashed .
In his essay , Some Implications of Software Commodification , Dave Stutz writes :
The word commodity is used today to represent fodder for industrial processes : things or substances that are found to be valuable as basic building blocks for many different purposes .
Because of their very general value , they are typically used in large quantities and in many different ways .
Commodities are always sourced by more than one producer , and consumers may substitute one producer 's product for another 's with impunity .
Because commodities are fungible in this way , they are defined by uniform quality standards to which they must conform .
These quality standards help to avoid adulteration , and also facilitate quick and easy valuation , which in turn fosters productivity gains .
Software commoditization has been driven by standards , in particular by the rise of communications - oriented systems such as the Internet , which depend on shared protocols , and define the interfaces and datatypes shared between cooperating components rather than the internals of those components .
Such systems necessarily consist of replaceable parts .
A web server such as Apache or Microsoft 's IIS , or browsers such as Internet Explorer , Netscape Navigator , or Mozilla , are all easily swappable , because in order to function , they must implement the HTTP protocol and the HTML data format .
Sendmail can be replaced by Exim or Postfix or Microsoft Exchange because all must support email exchange protocols such as SMTP , POP and IMAP .
Microsoft Outlook can easily be replaced by Eudora , or Pine , or Mozilla mail , or a web mail client such as Yahoo !
Mail for the same reason .
( In this regard , it 's worth noting that Unix , the system on which Linux is based , also has a communications - centric architecture .
In The Unix Programming Environment , Kernighan and Pike eloquently describe how Unix programs should be written as small pieces designed to cooperate in " pipelines " , reading and writing ASCII files rather than proprietary data formats .
Eric Raymond gives a contemporary expression of this theme in his book , The Art of Unix Programming . )
Note that in a communications - centric environment with standard protocols , both proprietary and open source software become commodities .
Microsoft 's Internet Explorer web browser is just as much a commodity as the open source Apache web server , because both are constrained by the open standards of the web .
( If Microsoft had managed to gain dominant market share at both ends of the protocol pipeline between web browser and server , it would be another matter !
See How the Web was almost won for my discussion of that subject .
This example makes clear one of the important roles that open source does play in " keeping standards honest " .
This role is being recognized by organizations like the W3C , which are increasingly reluctant to endorse standards that have only proprietary or patent - encumbered implementations . )
What 's more , even software that starts out proprietary eventually becomes standardized and ultimately commodified .
Dave Stutz eloquently describes this process in an essay entitled The Natural History of Software Platforms :
It occurs through a hardening of the external shell presented by the platform over time .
As a platform succeeds in the marketplace , its APIs , UI , feature - set , file formats , and customization interfaces ossify and become more and more difficult to change .
( They may , in fact , ossify so far as to literally harden into hardware appliances ! )
The process of ossification makes successful platforms easy targets for cloners , and cloning is what spells the beginning of the end for platform profit margins .
Consistent with this view , the cloning of Microsoft 's Windows and Office franchises has been a major objective of the Free and Open Source communities .
In the past , Microsoft has been successful at rebuffing cloning attempts by continually revising APIs and file formats , but the writing is on the wall .
Ubiquity drives standardization , and gratuitous innovation in defense of monopoly is rejected by users .
What are some of the implications of software commoditization ?
One might be tempted to see only the devaluation of something that was once a locus of enormous value .
Thus , Red Hat founder Bob Young once remarked , " My goal is to shrink the size of the operating system market " .
( Red Hat however aimed to own a large part of that smaller market ! )
Defenders of the status quo , such as Microsoft VP Jim Allchin , have made statements such as " open source is an intellectual property destroyer " , and paint a bleak picture in which a great industry is destroyed , with nothing to take its place .
On the surface , Allchin appears to be right .
Linux now generates tens of billions of dollars in server hardware related revenue , with the software revenues merely a rounding error .
Despite Linux 's emerging dominance in the server market , Red Hat , the largest Linux distribution company , has annual revenues of only $ 126 million , versus Microsoft 's $ 32 billion .
A huge amount of software value appears to have vaporized .
But is it value or overhead ?
Open source advocates like to say they 're not destroying actual value , but rather squeezing inefficiencies out of the system .
When competition drives down prices , efficiency and average wealth levels go up .
Firms unable to adapt to the new price levels undergo what the economist E.F. Schumpeter called " creative destruction " , but what was " lost " returns manyfold as higher productivity and new opportunities .
Microsoft benefited , along with consumers , from the last round of " creative destruction " as PC hardware was commoditized .
This time around , Microsoft sees the commoditization of operating systems , databases , web servers and browsers , and related software as destructive to its core business .
But that destruction has created the opportunity for the killer applications of the Internet era .
Yahoo ! , Google , Amazon , eBay -- to mention only a few -- are the beneficiaries .
And so I prefer to take the view of Clayton Christensen , the author of The Innovator 's Dilemma and The Innovator 's Solution .
In a recent article in Harvard Business Review , he articulates " the law of conservation of attractive profits " as follows :
When attractive profits disappear at one stage in the value chain because a product becomes modular and commoditized , the opportunity to earn attractive profits with proprietary products will usually emerge at an adjacent stage . [ 3 ]
We see Christensen 's thesis clearly at work in the paradigm shifts I 'm discussing here .
[ 4 ]
Just as IBM 's commoditization of the basic design of the personal computer led to opportunities for attractive profits " up the stack " in software , new fortunes are being made up the stack from the commodity open source software that underlies the Internet , in a new class of proprietary applications that I have elsewhere referred to as " infoware " .
Sites such as Google , Amazon , and salesforce.com provide the most serious challenge to the traditional understanding of free and open source software .
Here are applications built on top of Linux , but they are fiercely proprietary .
What 's more , even when using and modifying software distributed under the most restrictive of free software licenses , the GPL , these sites are not constrained by any of its provisions , all of which are conditioned on the old paradigm .
The GPL 's protections are triggered by the act of software distribution , yet web - based application vendors never distribute any software : it is simply performed on the Internet 's global stage , delivered as a service rather than as a packaged software application .
But even more importantly , even if these sites gave out their source code , users would not easily be able to create a full copy of the running application !
The application is a dynamically updated database whose utility comes from its completeness and concurrency , and in many cases , from the network effect of its participating users .
( To be sure , there would be many benefits to users were some of Google 's algorithms public rather than secret , or Amazon 's One - Click available to all , but the point remains : an instance of all of Google 's source code would not give you Google , unless you were also able to build the capability to crawl and mirror the entire web in the same way that Google does . )
And the opportunities are not merely up the stack .
There are huge proprietary opportunities hidden inside the system .
Christensen notes :
Attractive profits . . . move elsewhere in the value chain , often to subsystems from which the modular product is assembled .
This is because it is improvements in the subsystems , rather than the modular product 's architecture , that drives the assembler 's ability to move upmarket towards more attractive profit margins .
Hence , the subsystems become decommoditized and attractively profitable .
We saw this pattern in the PC market with most PCs now bearing the brand " Intel Inside " ; the Internet could just as easily be branded " Cisco Inside " .
But these " Intel Inside " business opportunities are not always obvious , nor are they necessarily in proprietary hardware or software .
The open source BIND ( Berkeley Internet Name Daemon ) package used to run the Domain Name System ( DNS ) provides an important demonstration .
The business model for most of the Internet 's commodity software turned out not to be selling that software ( despite shrinkwrapped offerings from vendors such as NetManage and Spry , now long gone ) , but in services based on that software .
Most of those businesses -- the Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) , who essentially resell access to the TCP / IP protocol suite and to email and web servers -- turned out to be low margin businesses .
There was one notable exception .
BIND is probably the single most mission - critical program on the Internet , yet its maintainer has scraped by for the past two decades on donations and consulting fees .
Meanwhile , domain name registration -- an information service based on the software -- became a business generating hundreds of millions of dollars a year , a virtual monopoly for Network Solutions , which was handed the business on government contract before anyone realized just how valuable it would be .
The Intel Inside opportunity of the DNS was not a software opportunity at all , but the service of managing the namespace used by the software .
By a historical accident , the business model became separated from the software .
That services based on software would be a dominant business model for open source software was recognized in The Cathedral & the Bazaar , Eric Raymond 's seminal work on the movement .
But in practice , most early open source entrepreneurs focused on services associated with the maintenance and support of the software , rather than true software as a service .
( That is to say , software as a service is not service in support of software , but software in support of user - facing services ! )
Dell gives us a final lesson for today 's software industry .
Much as the commoditization of PC hardware drove down IBM 's outsize margins but vastly increased the size of the market , creating enormous value for users , and vast opportunities for a new ecosystem of computer manufacturers for whom the lower margins of the PC still made business sense , the commoditization of software will actually expand the software market .
And as Christensen notes , in this type of market , the drivers of success " become speed to market and the ability responsively and conveniently to give customers exactly what they need , when they need it . " [ 5 ]
Following this logic , I believe that the process of building custom distributions will emerge as one of the key competitive differentiators among Linux vendors .
Much as a Dell must be an arbitrageur of the various contract manufacturers vying to produce fungible components at the lowest price , a Linux vendor will need to manage the ever changing constellation of software suppliers whose asynchronous product releases provide the raw materials for Linux distributions .
Companies like Debian founder Ian Murdock 's Progeny Systems already see this as the heart of their business , but even old - line Linux vendors like SuSe and new entrants like Sun tout their release engineering expertise as a competitive advantage . [ 6 ]
But even the most successful of these Linux distribution vendors will never achieve the revenues or profitability of today 's software giants like Microsoft or Oracle , unless they leverage some of the other lessons of history .
As demonstrated by both the PC hardware market and the ISP industry ( which as noted above is a service business built on the commodity protocols and applications of the Internet ) , commodity businesses are low margin for most of the players .
Unless companies find value up the stack or through an " Intel Inside " opportunity , they must compete only through speed and responsiveness , and that 's a challenging way to maintain a pricing advantage in a commodity market .
Early observers of the commodity nature of Linux , such as Red Hat 's founder Bob Young , believed that advantage was to be found in building a strong brand .
That 's certainly necessary , but it 's not sufficient .
It 's even possible that contract manufacturers such as Flextronix , which work behind the scenes as industry suppliers rather than branded customer - facing entities , may provide a better analogy than Dell for some Linux vendors .
In conclusion , software itself is no longer the primary locus of value in the computer industry .
The commoditization of software drives value to services enabled by that software .
New business models are required .
To understand the nature of competitive advantage in the new paradigm , we should look not to Linux , but to the Internet , which has already shown signs of how the open source story will play out .
The most common version of the history of free software begins with Richard Stallman 's ethically - motivated 1984 revolt against proprietary software .
It is an appealing story centered on a charismatic figure , and leads straight into a narrative in which the license he wrote -- the GPL -- is the centerpiece .
But like most open source advocates , who tell a broader story about building better software through transparency and code sharing , I prefer to start the history with the style of software development that was normal in the early computer industry and academia .
Because software was not seen as the primary source of value , source code was freely shared throughout the early computer industry .
The Unix software tradition provides a good example .
Unix was developed at Bell Labs , and was shared freely with university software researchers , who contributed many of the utilities and features we take for granted today .
The fact that Unix was provided under a license that later allowed ATT to shut down the party when it decided it wanted to commecialize Unix , leading ultimately to the rise of BSD Unix and Linux as free alternatives , should not blind us to the fact that the early , collaborative development preceded the adoption of an open source licensing model .
Open source licensing began as an attempt to preserve a culture of sharing , and only later led to an expanded awareness of the value of that sharing .
For the roots of open source in the Unix community , you can look to the research orientation of many of the original participants .
As Bill Joy noted in his keynote at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention in 1999 , in science , you share your data so other people can reproduce your results .
And at Berkeley , he said , we thought of ourselves as computer scientists . [ 7 ]
But perhaps even more important was the fragmented nature of the early Unix hardware market .
With hundreds of competing computer architectures , the only way to distribute software was as source !
No one had access to all the machines to produce the necessary binaries .
( This demonstrates the aptness of another of Christensen 's " laws " , the law of conservation of modularity .
Because PC hardware was standardized and modular , it was possible to concentrate value and uniqueness in software .
But because Unix hardware was unique and proprietary , software had to be made more open and modular . )
This software source code exchange culture grew from its research beginnings , but it became the hallmark of a large segment of the software industry because of the rise of computer networking .
Much of the role of open source in the development of the Internet is well known :
The most widely used TCP / IP protocol implementation was developed as part of Berkeley networking ;
Bind runs the DNS , without which none of the web sites we depend on would be reachable ; sendmail is the heart of the Internet email backbone ; Apache is the dominant web server ;
Perl the dominant language for creating dynamic sites ; etc .
Less often considered is the role of Usenet in mothering the Net we now know .
Much of what drove public adoption of the Internet was in fact Usenet , that vast distributed bulletin board .
You " signed up " for Usenet by finding a neighbor willing to give you a newsfeed .
This was a true collaborative network , where mail and news were relayed from one cooperating site to another , often taking days to travel from one end of the Net to another .
Hub sites formed an ad - hoc backbone , but everything was voluntary .
Rick Adams , who created UUnet , which was the first major commercial ISP , was a free software author ( though he never subscribed to any of the free software ideals -- it was simply an expedient way to distribute software he wanted to use ) .
He was the author of B News ( at the time the dominant Usenet news server ) as well as SLIP ( Serial Line IP ) , the first implementation of TCP / IP for dialup lines .
But more importantly for the history of the Net , Rick was also the hostmaster of the world 's largest Usenet hub .
He realized that the voluntary Usenet was becoming unworkable , and that people would pay for reliable , well - connected access .
UUnet started out as a nonprofit , and for several years , much more of its business was based on the earlier UUCP ( Unix - Unix Copy Protocol ) dialup network than on TCP / IP .
As the Internet caught on , UUNet and others like it helped bring the Internet to the masses .
But at the end of the day , the commercial Internet industry started out of a need to provide infrastructure for the completely collaborative UUCPnet and Usenet .
The UUCPnet and Usenet were used for email ( the first killer app of the Internet ) , but also for software distribution and collaborative tech support .
When Larry Wall ( later famous as the author of Perl ) introduced the patch program in 1984 , the ponderous process of sending around 9 - track tapes of source code was replaced by the transmission of " patches " -- editing scripts that update existing source files .
Add in Richard Stallman 's Gnu C compiler ( gcc ) , and early source code control systems like RCS ( eventually replaced by CVS and now Subversion ) , and you had a situation where anyone could share and update free software .
The early Usenet was as much a " Napster " for shared software as it was a place for conversation .
The mechanisms that the early developers used to spread and support their work became the basis for a cultural phenomenon that reached far beyond the tech sector .
The heart of that phenomenon was the use of wide - area networking technology to connect people around interests , rather than through geographical location or company affiliation .
This was the beginning of a massive cultural shift that we 're still seeing today .
This cultural shift may have had its first flowering with open source software , but it is not intrinsically tied to the use of free and open source licenses and philosophies .
In 1999 , together with with Brian Behlendorf of the Apache project , O'Reilly founded a company called CollabNet to commercialize not the Apache product but the Apache process .
Unlike many other OSS projects , Apache was n't founded by a single visionary developer but by a group of users who'd been abandoned by their original " vendor " ( NCSA ) and who agreed to work together to maintain a tool they depended on .
Apache gives us lessons about intentional wide - area collaborative software development that can be applied even by companies that have n't fully embraced open source licensing practices .
For example , it is possible to apply open source collaborative principles inside a large company , even without the intention to release the resulting software to the outside world .
While CollabNet is best known for hosting high profile corporate - sponsored open source projects like OpenOffice.org , its largest customer is actually HP 's printer division , where CollabNet 's SourceCast platform is used to help more than 3000 internal developers share their code within the corporate firewall .
Other customers use open - source - inspired development practices to share code with their customers or business partners , or to manage distributed worldwide development teams .
But an even more compelling story comes from that archetype of proprietary software , Microsoft .
Far too few people know the story of the origin of ASP .
NET .
As told to me by its creators , Mark Anders and Scott Guthrie , the two of them wanted to re-engineer Microsoft 's ASP product to make it XML - aware .
They were told that doing so would break backwards compatibility , and the decision was made to stick with the old architecture .
But when Anders and Guthrie had a month between projects , they hacked up their vision anyway , just to see where it would go .
Others within Microsoft heard about their work , found it useful , and adopted pieces of it .
Some six or nine months later , they had a call from Bill Gates : " I 'd like to see your project . "
In short , one of Microsoft 's flagship products was born as an internal " code fork " , the result of two developers " scratching their own itch " , and spread within Microsoft in much the same way as open source projects spread on the open Internet .
It appears that open source is the " natural language " of a networked community .
Given enough developers and a network to connect them , open - source - style development behavior emerges .
If you take the position that open source licensing is a means of encouraging Internet - enabled collaboration , and focus on the end rather than the means , you 'll open a much larger tent .
You 'll see the threads that tie together not just traditional open source projects , but also collaborative " computing grid " projects like SETI@home , user reviews on amazon.com , technologies like collaborative filtering , new ideas about marketing such as those expressed in The Cluetrain Manifesto , weblogs , and the way that Internet message boards can now move the stock market .
What started out as a software development methodology is increasingly becoming a facet of every field , as network - enabled conversations become a principal carrier of new ideas .
I 'm particularly struck by how collaboration is central to the success and differentiation of the leading Internet applications .
EBay is an obvious example , almost the definition of a " network effects " business , in which competitive advantage is gained from the critical mass of buyers and sellers .
New entrants into the auction business have a hard time competing , because there is no reason for either buyers or sellers to go to a second - tier player .
Amazon is perhaps even more interesting .
Unlike eBay , whose constellation of products is provided by its users , and changes dynamically day to day , products identical to those Amazon sells are available from other vendors .
Yet Amazon seems to enjoy an order - of - magnitude advantage over those other vendors .
Why ?
Perhaps it is merely better execution , better pricing , better service , better branding .
But one clear differentiator is the superior way that Amazon has leveraged its user community .
In my talks , I give a simple demonstration .
I do a search for products in one of my publishing areas , JavaScript .
On amazon.com , the search produces a complex page with four main areas .
On the top is a block showing the three " most popular " products .
Down below is a longer search listing that allows the customer to list products by criteria such as best - selling , highest - rated , by price , or simply alphabetically .
On the right and the left are user - generated " ListMania " lists .
These lists allow customers to share their own recommendations for other titles related to the given subject .
The section labeled " most popular " might not jump out at first .
But as a vendor who sells to amazon.com , I know that it is the result of a complex , proprietary algorithm that combines not just sales but also the number and quality of user reviews , user recommendations for alternative products , links from ListMania lists , " also bought " associations , and all the other things that Amazon refers to as the " flow " around products .
The particular search that I like to demonstrate is usually topped by my own JavaScript : The Definitive Guide .
The book has 192 reviews , averaging 4 1/2 stars .
Those reviews are among the more than ten million user reviews contributed by amazon.com customers .
Now contrast the # 2 player in online books , barnesandnoble.com .
The top result is a book published by Barnes & Noble itself , and there is no evidence of user - supplied content .
JavaScript : The Definitive Guide has only 18 comments , the order - of - magnitude difference in user participation closely mirroring the order - of - magnitude difference in sales .
Amazon does n't have a natural network - effect advantage like eBay , but they 've built one by architecting their site for user participation .
Everything from user reviews , alternative product recommendations , ListMania , and the Associates program , which allows users to earn commissions for recommending books , encourages users to collaborate in enhancing the site .
Amazon Web Services , introduced in 2001 , take the story even further , allowing users to build alternate interfaces and specialized shopping experiences ( as well as other unexpected applications ) using Amazon 's data and commerce engine as a back end .
Amazon 's distance from competitors , and the security it enjoys as a market leader , is driven by the value added by its users .
If , as Eric Raymond said in The Cathedral & the Bazaar , one of the secrets of open source is " treating your users as co-developers " , Amazon has learned this secret .
But note that it 's completely independent of open source licensing practices !
We start to see that what has been presented as a rigidly constrained model for open source may consist of a bundle of competencies , not all of which will always be found together .
Google makes a more subtle case for the network - effect story .
Google 's initial innovation was the PageRank algorithm , which leverages the collective preferences of web users , expressed by their hyperlinks to sites , to produce better search results .
In Google 's case , the user participation is extrinsic to the company and its product , and so can be copied by competitors .
If this analysis is correct , Google 's long - term success will depend on finding additional ways to leverage user - created value as a key part of their offering .
Services such as orkut and Gmail suggest that this lesson is not lost on them .
Now consider a counter - example .
MapQuest is another pioneer that created an innovative type of web application that almost every Internet user relies on .
Yet the market is shared fairly evenly between MapQuest ( now owned by AOL ) , maps.yahoo.com , and maps.msn.com ( powered by MapPoint ) .
All three provide a commodity - business powered by standardized software and databases .
None of them have made a concerted effort to leverage user - supplied content , or engage their users in building out the application .
( Note also that all three are enabling an Intel - Inside style opportunity for data suppliers such as NAVTEQ , now planning a multi-billion dollar IPO ! )
The Architecture of Participation I 've come to use the term " the architecture of participation " to describe the nature of systems that are designed for user contribution .
Larry Lessig 's book , Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace , which he characterizes as an extended meditation on Mitch Kapor 's maxim , " architecture is politics " , made the case that we need to pay attention to the architecture of systems if we want to understand their effects .
I immediately thought of Kernighan and Pike 's description of the Unix software tools philosophy referred to above .
I also recalled an unpublished portion of the interview we did with Linus Torvalds to create his essay for the 1998 book , Open Sources .
Linus too expressed a sense that architecture may be more important than source code .
" I could n't do what I did with Linux for Windows , even if I had the source code .
The architecture just would n't support it . "
Too much of the windows source code consists of interdependent , tightly coupled layers for a single developer to drop in a replacement module .
And of course , the Internet and the World Wide Web have this participatory architecture in spades .
As outlined above in the section on software commoditization , any system designed around communications protocols is intrinsically designed for participation .
Anyone can create a participating , first - class component .
In addition , the IETF , the Internet standards process , has a great many similarities with an open source software project .
The only substantial difference is that the IETF 's output is a standards document rather than a code module .
Especially in the early years , anyone could participate , simply by joining a mailing list and having something to say , or by showing up to one of the three annual face - to - face meetings .
Standards were decided by participating individuals , irrespective of their company affiliations .
The very name for proposed Internet standards , RFCs ( Request for Comments ) , reflects the participatory design of the Net .
Though commercial participation was welcomed and encouraged , companies , like individuals , were expected to compete on the basis of their ideas and implementations , not their money or disproportional representation .
The IETF approach is where open source and open standards meet .
And while there are successful open source projects like Sendmail , which are largely the creation of a single individual , and have a monolithic architecture , those that have built large development communities have done so because they have a modular architecture that allows easy participation by independent or loosely coordinated developers .
The use of Perl , for example , exploded along with CPAN , the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network , and Perl 's module system , which allowed anyone to enhance the language with specialized functions , and make them available to other users .
The web , however , took the idea of participation to a new level , because it opened that participation not just to software developers but to all users of the system .
It has always baffled and disappointed me that the open source community has not claimed the web as one of its greatest success stories .
If you asked most end users , they are most likely to associate the web with proprietary clients such as Microsoft 's Internet Explorer than with the revolutionary open source architecture that made the web possible .
That 's a PR failure !
Tim Berners - Lee 's original web implementation was not just open source , it was public domain .
NCSA 's web server and Mosaic browser were not technically open source , but source was freely available .
While the move of the NCSA team to Netscape sought to take key parts of the web infrastructure to the proprietary side , and the Microsoft - Netscape battles made it appear that the web was primarily a proprietary software battleground , we should know better .
Apache , the phoenix that grew from the NCSA server , kept the open vision alive , keeping the standards honest , and not succumbing to proprietary embrace - and - extend strategies .
But even more significantly , HTML , the language of web pages , opened participation to ordinary users , not just software developers .
The " View Source " menu item migrated from Tim Berners - Lee 's original browser , to Mosaic , and then on to Netscape Navigator and even Microsoft 's Internet Explorer .
Though no one thinks of HTML as an open source technology , its openness was absolutely key to the explosive spread of the web .
Barriers to entry for " amateurs " were low , because anyone could look " over the shoulder " of anyone else producing a web page .
Dynamic content created with interpreted languages continued the trend toward transparency .
And more germane to my argument here , the fundamental architecture of hyperlinking ensures that the value of the web is created by its users .
In this context , it 's worth noting an observation originally made by Clay Shirky in a talk at O'Reilly 's 2001 P2P and Web Services Conference ( now renamed the Emerging Technology Conference ) , entitled " Listening to Napster . "
There are three ways to build a large database , said Clay .
The first , demonstrated by Yahoo ! , is to pay people to do it .
The second , inspired by lessons from the open source community , is to get volunteers to perform the same task .
The Open Directory Project , an open source Yahoo !
competitor , is the result .
( Wikipedia provides another example . )
But Napster demonstrates a third way .
Because Napster set its defaults to automatically share any music that was downloaded , every user automatically helped to build the value of the shared database .
This architectural insight may actually be more central to the success of open source than the more frequently cited appeal to volunteerism .
The architecture of Linux , the Internet , and the World Wide Web are such that users pursuing their own " selfish " interests build collective value as an automatic byproduct .
In other words , these technologies demonstrate some of the same network effect as eBay and Napster , simply through the way that they have been designed .
These projects can be seen to have a natural architecture of participation .
But as Amazon demonstrates , by consistent effort ( as well as economic incentives such as the Associates program ) , it is possible to overlay such an architecture on a system that would not normally seem to possess it .
The last of my three Cs , customizability , is an essential concomitant of software as a service .
It 's especially important to highlight this aspect because it illustrates just why dynamically typed languages like Perl , Python , and PHP , so - often denigrated by old - paradigm software developers as mere " scripting languages " , are so important on today 's software scene .
As I wrote in my 1997 essay , Hardware , Software and Infoware :
If you look at a large web site like Yahoo ! , you 'll see that behind the scenes , an army of administrators and programmers are continually rebuilding the product .
Dynamic content is n't just automatically generated , it is also often hand - tailored , typically using an array of quick and dirty scripting tools .
" We do n't create content at Yahoo !
We aggregate it , " says Jeffrey Friedl , author of the book Mastering Regular Expressions and a full - time Perl programmer at Yahoo !
" We have feeds from thousands of sources , each with its own format .
We do massive amounts of ' feed processing ' to clean this stuff up or to find out where to put it on Yahoo ! "
For example , to link appropriate news stories to tickers at finance .
yahoo.com , Friedl needed to write a " name recognition " program able to search for more than 15,000 company names .
Perl 's ability to analyze free - form text with powerful regular expressions was what made that possible .
Perl has been referred to as " the duct tape of the Internet " , and like duct tape , dynamic languages like Perl are important to web sites like Yahoo !
and Amazon for the same reason that duct tape is important not just to heating system repairmen but to anyone who wants to hold together a rapidly changing installation .
Go to any lecture or stage play , and you 'll see microphone cords and other wiring held down by duct tape .
We 're used to thinking of software as an artifact rather than a process .
And to be sure , even in the new paradigm , there are software artifacts , programs and commodity components that must be engineered to exacting specifications because they will be used again and again .
But it is in the area of software that is not commoditized , the " glue " that ties together components , the scripts for managing data and machines , and all the areas that need frequent change or rapid prototyping , that dynamic languages shine .
Sites like Google , Amazon , or eBay -- especially those reflecting the dynamic of user participation -- are not just products , they are processes .
I like to tell people the story of the Mechanical Turk , a 1770 hoax that pretended to be a mechanical chess playing machine .
The secret , of course , was that a man was hidden inside .
The Turk actually played a small role in the history of computing .
When Charles Babbage played against the Turk in 1820 ( and lost ) , he saw through the hoax , but was moved to wonder whether a true computing machine would be possible .
Now , in an ironic circle , applications once more have people hidden inside them .
Take a copy of Microsoft Word and a compatible computer , and it will still run ten years from now .
But without the constant crawls to keep the search engine fresh , the constant product updates at an Amazon or eBay , the administrators who keep it all running , the editors and designers who integrate vendor - and user - supplied content into the interface , and in the case of some sites , even the warehouse staff who deliver the products , the Internet - era application no longer performs its function .
This is truly not the software business as it was even a decade ago .
Of course , there have always been enterprise software businesses with this characteristic .
( American Airlines ' Sabre reservations system is an obvious example . )
But only now have they become the dominant paradigm for new computer - related businesses .
The first generation of any new technology is typically seen as an extension to the previous generations .
And so , through the 1990s , most people experienced the Internet as an extension or add - on to the personal computer .
Email and web browsing were powerful add - ons , to be sure , and they gave added impetus to a personal computer industry that was running out of steam .
( Open source advocates can take ironic note of the fact that many of the most important features of Microsoft 's new operating system releases since Windows 95 have been designed to emulate Internet functionality originally created by open source developers . )
But now , we 're starting to see the shape of a very different future .
Napster brought us peer - to - peer file sharing , Seti@home introduced millions of people to the idea of distributed computation , and now web services are starting to make even huge database - backed sites like Amazon or Google appear to act like components of an even larger system .
Vendors such as IBM and HP bandy about terms like " computing on demand " and " pervasive computing " .
The boundaries between cell phones , wirelessly connected laptops , and even consumer devices like the iPod or TiVO , are all blurring .
Each now gets a large part of its value from software that resides elsewhere .
Dave Stutz characterizes this as software above the level of a single device . [ 8 ]
Building the Internet Operating System
I like to say that we 're entering the stage where we are going to treat the Internet as if it were a single virtual computer .
To do that , we 'll need to create an Internet operating system .
The large question before us is this :
What kind of operating system is it going to be ?
The lesson of Microsoft is that if you leverage insight into a new paradigm , you will find the secret that will give you control over the industry , the " one ring to rule them all " , so to speak .
Contender after contender has set out to dethrone Microsoft and take that ring from them , only to fail .
But the lesson of open source and the Internet is that we can build an operating system that is designed from the ground up as " small pieces loosely joined " , with an architecture that makes it easy for anyone to participate in building the value of the system .
The values of the free and open source community are an important part of its paradigm .
Just as the Copernican revolution was part of a broader social revolution that turned society away from hierarchy and received knowledge , and instead sparked a spirit of inquiry and knowledge sharing , open source is part of a communications revolution designed to maximize the free sharing of ideas expressed in code .
But free software advocates go too far when they eschew any limits on sharing , and define the movement by adherence to a restrictive set of software licensing practices .
The open source movement has made a concerted effort to be more inclusive .
Eric Raymond describes
The Open Source Definition as a " provocation to thought " , a " social contract . . . and an invitation to join the network of those who adhere to it . " [ 9 ]
But even though the open source movement is much more business friendly and supports the right of developers to choose non-free licenses , it still uses the presence of software licenses that enforce sharing as its litmus test .
The lessons of previous paradigm shifts show us a more subtle and powerful story than one that merely pits a gift culture against a monetary culture , and a community of sharers versus those who choose not to participate .
Instead , we see a dynamic migration of value , in which things that were once kept for private advantage are now shared freely , and things that were once thought incidental become the locus of enormous value .
It 's easy for free and open source advocates to see this dynamic as a fall from grace , a hoarding of value that should be shared with all .
But a historical view tells us that the commoditization of older technologies and the crystallization of value in new technologies is part of a process that advances the industry and creates more value for all .
What is essential is to find a balance , in which we as an industry create more value than we capture as individual participants , enriching the commons that allows for further development by others .
I cannot say where things are going to end .
But as Alan Kay once said , " The best way to predict the future is to invent it . " [ 10 ]
Where we go next is up to all of us .
Conclusion
The Open Source Definition and works such as The Cathedral & the Bazaar tried to codify the fundamental principles of open source .
But as Kuhn notes , speaking of scientific pioneers who opened new fields of study :
Their achievement was sufficiently unprecedented to attract an enduring group of adherents away from competing modes of scientific activity .
Simultaneously , it was sufficiently open ended to leave all sorts of problems for the redefined group of practitioners to resolve .
Achievements that share these two characteristics , I shall refer to as " paradigms " . [ 11 ]
In short , if it is sufficiently robust an innovation to qualify as a new paradigm , the open source story is far from over , and its lessons far from completely understood .
Rather than thinking of open source only as a set of software licenses and associated software development practices , we do better to think of it as a field of scientific and economic inquiry , one with many historical precedents , and part of a broader social and economic story .
We must understand the impact of such factors as standards and their effect on commoditization , system architecture and network effects , and the development practices associated with software as a service .
We must study these factors when they appear in proprietary software as well as when they appear in traditional open source projects .
We must understand the ways in which the means by which software is deployed changes the way in which it is created and used .
We must also see how the same principles that led to early source code sharing may impact other fields of collaborative activity .
Only when we stop measuring open source by what activities are excluded from the definition , and begin to study its fellow travelers on the road to the future , will we understand its true impact and be fully prepared to embrace the new paradigm .

The benefits of open source are analogous to the benefits brought by the free flow of ideas through other forms of information dissemination .

Sadly , I ’m speaking literally :
Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was in intensive care with a suspected skull fracture on Wednesday after what he says was a brutal attack by President Robert Mugabe ’s police .
Images of a battered Tsvangirai appearing in court have fueled world outrage over a crackdown on political protests by Mugabe ’s government and its treatment of opponents .
…
Tsvangirai , speaking to a radio reporter from his hospital bed , said he was attacked after arriving at a police station to check on supporters who had been detained with him on Sunday when the government broke up a planned prayer vigil .
“ It was almost as if they were waiting for me , ” he said in remarks broadcast on South Africa ’s national radio .
“ Before I could even settle down I was subjected to a lot of beatings , in fact it was random beatings , but I think the intention was to inflict as much harm as they could . ”
Sept. 11 , 2001 was undoubtedly one of the darkest and deadliest days in United States history .
Al - Qaida 's attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center killed 2,976 people , and the country recoiled in horror as we witnessed the death of thousands of Americans when the towers fell .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
In the five years since that shattering day , the government has spent billions on anti-terrorism projects , instituted a color - coded alert system that has never been green , banned fingernail clippers and water bottles from airplanes , launched a pre-emptive war on false pretenses , and advised citizens to stock up on duct tape and plastic sheeting .
But despite the never - ending litany of warnings and endless stories of half - baked plots foiled , how likely are you , statistically speaking , to die from a terrorist attack ?
Comparing official mortality data with the number of Americans who have been killed inside the United States by terrorism since the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma reveals that scores of threats are far more likely to kill an American than any terrorist — at least , statistically speaking .
In fact , your appendix is more likely to kill you than al - Qaida is .
With that in mind , here 's a handy ranking of the various dangers confronting America , based on the number of mortalities in each category throughout the 11 - year period spanning 1995 through 2005 ( extrapolated from best available data ) .
S E V E R E Driving off the road : 254,419 Falling : 146,542 Accidental poisoning : 140,327 H I G H Dying from work : 59,730 Walking down the street : 52,000 .

可変長引数マク ロ
可変長引数関数とは、皆さんお馴染みの printf 属、scanf 属関数の引数である、アレである。フツーの関数は引数の数が固定されており、いくつでも引数を勝手に渡せる、という仕様は例外である。あと、execl(3 ) や Ｘツールキットで使われる XtVaCreateManagedWidget ( )
などの場合も、やはり引数がいくつでも渡せるが、この場合には最後の引数が
NULL じゃないといけない、という制限があったりする。こういう妙チクリンな関数はどうやって実装しているのだろう？？？
stdarg.h とか varargs.h につい て
変な見出しである。実はかつてはこういうヘッダファイルがインクルードディレクトリに存在し、その中にこういう可変長引数を扱うためのマクロが入っていたのである。しかし、どういうわけか最近の標準的なヘッダファイルのセットの中には入っていない。これらは別にユーザプログラムとしてマクロを書いても良いものであり、これが可変長引数を実現する上で大変役立つのである。
たとえば printf ( 3 ) をラップする関数を書いてみたいとする。つまり、printf(3 ) の可変長引数をそのままに引数として受けて、printf(3 ) に引数をそのまま渡して、アボートする関数、名付けて fatal ( ) を実装してみよう。これは次のようになる。
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdarg.h > void fatal ( char * fmt , ... ) { va_list argp ; va_start ( argp , fmt ) ; vfprintf ( stdout , fmt , argp ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; }
呼び出しは普通の printf ( 3 ) に準じて出来る。たとえば次の通り。
fatal ( " fatal : %s %d %g
" , " test " , 10 , 3.1415 ) ;
しかし、実は現在の Linux では大変面妖なことに、 / usr / include を見ても stdarg.h などというファイルはないのである。実はこの stdarg.h というファイルは 、
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/include/stdarg.h
などという妙なところ（要するに gcc が内部的に利用するライブラリ）にあるのである。これは要するに、言語仕様（「 , ... 」
などという引数定義）とも関わりがあり、しかもターゲットマシンによって微妙に実装が違うという厄介なものであるからであろう。（ちなみに stdarg.h は ANSI -C 版であり、varargs.h はそれよりも古い UNIX で使われていたもの。 ）
さて、もう少し丁寧に先程のソースを見ていこう。
まず fatal ( ) の引数定義である。 「 char * fmt , ... 」 などという妙な定義がされている。第１引数の char * fmt はともかくとして、 「 ...
」が、これこそが可変長引数（というか、正確には「引数のチェックをしない」こと）の宣言なのである。じゃあ、完全に引数が不定である関数が定義できるか、というとそうではない。少なくとも１つの固定引数がなくてはならないのである。言い替えれば、最低１つ引数があることが保証されれば、それ以降は「 ... 」で宣言をして不定個の引数にできるのである。これは va_start マクロを使うために絶対に必要なことなのである。
次の 「 va_list argp ; 」 という宣言は大したものではない。どうせ va_list は void * か char * あたりを typedef したものに過ぎない 。
次の「 va_start ( argp , fmt ) ; 」は問題だ。これは第１引数（正確には不定引数になる前の最後の固定引数）と、va_list
で宣言されたローカル変数を取って、最初の不定引数のポインタを計算してマクロ第１引数に代入するマクロである。これは後でちゃんと見るが、今は単に結果として argp に fmt の次の引数のポインタが入っていると考えれば良い。
そして、vfprintf ( 3 ) を呼び出す。これは fprintf ( 3 ) の変形で、通常の第１引数の出力FILE構造体、第２引数のフォーマットの次に第３引数としてこの va_list 型を取るという、固定引数タイプの fprintf ( 3 ) なのである。だから、結果として va_startマクロによって受けた不定長引数が va_list 型に変換されて、vfprintf ( 3 ) に渡される、ということになる。
引数って何 ？
関数には引数が付き物だ（引数がないものがあるのは勿論）。この引数はよく考えると実は多様なのである。なぜならコンパイラは常に最適化と向き合っている。だから、出来るだけ効率の良いやり方で引数を渡したい、とコンパイラは考える。また、他の言語で書かれたサブルーチンを呼び出すこともたまにはある。その時に引数の渡し方が違っていたりしたらとんでもない結果を返してくれることになる。だから、ある言語では「デフォルトの引数の渡し方」というものがちゃんと決まっており、それに従ってコンパイラは関数を呼ぶ準備の中で引数を処理し、関数の中で引数にアクセスできるのである。
Ｃ言語では、printf ( 3 ) 属などの不定長引数関数をどうしても実現したかったために、やや効率の悪い手法を「デフォルトの引数の渡し方」に採用した。呼び側がスタックに引数を積んで、最後にリターンアドレスを引数に積んで、関数が示すアドレスにジャンプするのである。だから、関数内部では呼ばれた時のスタックポインタからの相対的な位置によって引数にアクセスできる。関数が戻った後には、呼び側の責任として積んだ引数スタックを破棄する。疑似アセンブリで示せば次のような処理になる。
/* sub ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) ; */ MOV EAX , 3 PUSH EAX /* 引数の最後からスタックに積む */ MOV EAX , 2 PUSH EAX MOV EAX , 1 PUSH EAX CALL sub /* すべて引数をスタックに積んだら、CALL
する。*/ ADD ESP , 12 /* 戻ってきたら、積んだスタック（３個×int( 4byte)）を破棄する */
関数内部では次のように引数にアクセスする。
/* sub ( int a1 , int a2 , int a 3 ) { */ /* return a 1 + a 2 + a 3 ; */ PUSH EBP /* いわゆるベースポインタ（関数突入時のスタックポインタのコピー）
*/ MOV EBP , ESP MOV EAX , [ EBP + 4 ] /* 第 １引数をAXレジスタに */ ADD EAX , [ EBP + 8 ] /* 第２引数をAXレジスタに加算 */ ADD EAX , [ EBP + 12 ] /* 第３引数をAXレジスタに加算 */ POP EBP /* EBP を元に戻す */ RET
だから、引数の個数については関数の呼び側が責任を持っているのである。それゆえ、不定個の引数であっても、実際に積んだ引数の数は、積んだ側なので知っており、それを破棄することができる。これが不定長引数のトリックの根本にある。
もし、不定長引数がなければ、関数側で積んだ引数を破棄（スタックポインタを戻す）することも可能である。これは
Pascal などの言語が採用しているやり方である。関数側に引数破棄が入るので、複数ありうる呼び側処理がわずかに減ることになる。しかし、これだと不定引数関数は実現できない。
また、このスタック経由のやり方の鍵の一つは、なるべく引数のサイズが均一であることでもある。今時の 32bit ＣＰＵ では、int 型は比較的大きなデータオブジェクトである。これよりも大きいデータオブジェクトは、浮動小数点数を示すもの（float , double）と gcc の独自拡張である 「 long long 型」（知ってた？こんなの）か、あまりしない構造体（ポインタではなく）引数渡しくらいなものである。だから、引数はポインタであろうと char 型であろうと、とにかく 4 byte データ（レジスタのサイズ）としてスタックに積まれる。これによって問題が大いに単純になっているのである。
ちなみ にＣ言語には register 修飾子があり、これは関数引数に対しても使える。たとえば、
int sub ( register int a1 , register int a 2 ) ;
の要領である。この修飾をすると、もし可能であれば（引数の個数と使えるレジスタの数との兼ね合いがある）関数呼び出しの時にスタック経由ではなくて、レジスタ経由で関数に引数が渡ることになる。疑似アセンブリで示せば次の通り。
/* sub ( 1 , 2 ) ; */ MOV ESI , 2 /* ESI , EDI レジスタを使っ て２つの引数を渡す */ MOV EDI , 1 CALL sub /* すべて引数をスタックに積んだら、CALL
する。*/
まあ、この機能は今時の賢い gcc では、インライン関数展開による最適化のカラミで、相対的に比重が落ちている。どうせインライン関数展開をさせてしまえば、当然レジスタ経由で、引数が渡るのである。まあ、今時 register 修飾をして、最適化を稼ぐのは時代遅れである（馬鹿なコンパイラを使っている人は知らんが...）。
さて、話を不定長引数処理に戻そう。呼び側では引数が不定個であっても、それを積んだ本人なのでいくつ積んだかは判っており、スタックを戻すのには支障はない。また、スタックに引数を積む時に、デフォルトでは（というのか、不定長引数を積む場合には必ず）引数並びの最後の物からスタックに積んでいくという規則がある。それゆえ、関数に突入した際には、必ず「[ESP+4 ]」で第１引数にアクセス出来るのである（勿論引数がない場合は除く）。
それならば、次のようなやり方で不定長引数にアクセスできることになる。（ただし、細かいことを言えばスタックが上方伸長型で、int
単位で、標準的なスタック経由の関数呼び出しをする、という前提の下でだが...）
/* int型不定個の引数の総和を返す */ int adds ( int n , ... ) /* n は引数の個数 */ { int ret = 0 ; int *v = &n ; while ( n-- > 0 ) { ret += *++ v ; } return ret ; }
実際には printf ( 3 ) がしていることも、これと大差がない。引数の個数をどうやって判定しているのか、といえば、それは書式の中にある「%」の数を見、「%f」などの浮動小数点の値などは適切に複数個のスタックデータから値を構築して、スタックに積まれたデータを処理しているのである。それゆえ、ちょっと実験をしてみるのならば書式の「%」の数を実際に仮引数として与える引数の個数よりも増やして見ればよい。
void main ( ) { int x = 666 ; printf ( " %d %d %d
" , 69 , 13 ) ; }
筆者の実行環境では出力 は 「 69 13 666」となった（結果が違う可能性はある）。面白いことに、ちゃんとスタックに確保された自動変数である x の値が余計な 「 %d」の値として出力されている。これはスタックの上に連続して自動変数と引数が確保されたことを示しているのである。
だから、不定長引数の場合には、次のやり方のどれかで関数側が実際にいくつの引数が積まれたのかを知ることができなければならない。
不定引数の個数を第１引数として渡す。adds ( ) で使ったやり方。 第 １引数が「書式」である。printf属、scanf属が使うやり方。 とにかく最後の引数が NULL であることにする。これは exec属や XtVaCreateManagedWidget ( ) などが使っているやり方。
まあ、このような 「スタックの使い方」が不定長引数関数の基盤となっているのである。実際には va_start マクロはこのようなスタックへのポインタをうまく汎用的に扱うマクロに過ぎないのである。
va_arg マクロの使用 例
実際には stdarg.h で は、va_start ( ) , va_arg ( ) , va_end ( )
の３つのマクロを使って、可変長引数を順次処理していく。先程の vfprintf(3 ) を使った例では最初のポインタだけでＯＫで、後続の不定引数の処理は vfprintf(3 ) にまったく任せてしまったので、va_start()
マクロしか使わなかったのである。そうではなくて、まったく自前で不定引数を処理するプログラムをサンプルとして書いてみる。
この時、やはり不定引数の型の問題（というか、その型のサイズが
int よりも大きいケース）について配慮が必要になる。このようなスタックに積まれた引数サイズの不整合の問題を、実は va_arg ( ) マクロはうまく解決してくれるのである。だから、va_arg() マクロを使う限り、int よりも大きなサイズの型についての問題を気にしなくてもよくなる。それだけではなくて、適切にキャストして正しく数値を合成できることをも保証してくれる。これは、スタックの２つ以上の int サイズの値を合成してより大きな型の値にする時に、ビッグエンディアン or リトルエンディアンの問題が生じるためである。このように「良く出来た」マクロなのである（ただし、GNU
のものの話に限るけど...他は知らんよ）。
たとえば 、 ( 「 型 」 「 値 」 ) *
が繰り返し引数に現われるタイプの不定引数でサンプルを示そう。つまり、int 型の 「次の引数の型」を表す定数マクロがあり、その次に型によって示された値がある、というタイプである（強いて言えば XtVaCreateManagedWidget ( )
の不定引数の渡し方がこれだな）。まず、続く引数の「型」を表すマクロはこんなものだ。
# define END 0 /* これで不定引数は終り */ #define CHAR 1 #define SHORT 2 #define INT 3 #define LONG 4 #define FLOAT 5 #define DOUBLE 6 #define STRING 7 /* char * も出来る */ #define LONGLONG
8 /* gcc 専用の 64 bit int */
だからこんな具合に呼び出す。
void main ( ) { va_out ( " " , LONGLONG , 4294967296LL , DOUBLE , 4.3 , STRING , " test " , INT , 69 , DOUBLE , M_PI , CHAR , 'a ' , END ) ; }
申し訳ないが、第１引数はダミーである。単に char * で渡すことにする。これは当然 va_start ( ) マクロで argp を取得するのにどうしても必要だからである。さて、va_out ( ) の定義は次の通り 。
void va_out ( char * dummy , ... ) { va_list argp ; int kind ; va_start ( argp , dummy ) ; /* 最初の不定引数を取得 */ while ( 1 ) { kind = *( int *) argp ; /* 現実には va_list は void * である */ va_arg ( argp , int ) ; /* int 型スタックをスキップして飛ばす */ switch ( kind ) { case END : va_end ( argp ) ; return ; break ; case CHAR : printf ( " char %c
" , *( char *) argp ) ; va_arg ( argp , char ) ; break ; case SHORT : printf ( " short %d
" , *( short *) argp ) ; va_arg ( argp , short ) ; break ; case INT : printf ( " int %d
" , *( int *) argp ) ; va_arg ( argp , int ) ; break ; case LONG : printf ( " long %ld
" , *( long *) argp ) ; va_arg ( argp , long ) ; break ; case FLOAT : printf ( " float %g
" , *( float *) argp ) ; va_arg ( argp , float ) ; break ; case DOUBLE : printf ( " double %g
" , *( double *) argp ) ; va_arg ( argp , double ) ; break ; case STRING : /* 文字列はダブルポインタ */ printf ( " string %s
" , *( char **) argp ) ; va_arg ( argp , char * ) ; break ; case LONGLONG : /* long long だって問題ない */ printf ( " long long %Ld
" , *( long long *) argp ) ; va_arg ( argp , long long ) ; break ; } } }
一応これでうまく行くのである（ホントは FLOAT だけちょっと怪しい ...バグのようだ）。
FORTRAN 風書式出 力
ということは、printf ( 3 ) のやっていることは基本的にこういうやり方に、書式解析を付け加えているに過ぎない。交互に「型」と「値」をスタックに積むのではなくて、「型」の情報が「書式」に埋め込まれていて、それを適切に型情報として読み込んで、引数を処理しているのである。しかし、printf(3 ) をそのまま模倣してもツマラないので、これをヒネって
FORTRAN 風書式を処理するサブルーチンを書いてみよう。
FORTRAN の書式指定は結構複雑だが、そのサブセットということで許して欲しい。FORTRANの書式は大体次のようなルールで出来ている。
各項目は 「 , 」で区切られる。 項目は 「'〜'」のようなそのまま出力される「リテラル文字列」か、引数を解釈して変換して出力する「出力指定」である。
「 出力指定」はその出力型に応じて、「空白出力 」、「 文字出力 」 、「 数値出力」がある。 「 空白出力 」 は「 10X」のようなかたちで、１０文字の空白を出力する。
「 文字出力 」 は「 5A10」のようなかたちで、１０文字の文字列が入っている引数を５つ使って出力する。要するにFORTRANでは、WRITE命令の引数として、配列を一種のループと共に渡すことが出来るのである。ちゃんとFORTRANの仕様に合わすとＣでは実装が難しいので、このかたちで指定した時には正しく配列が５要素あることに制限する。もちろん「A50」のような指定もできる。 「 数値出力」もやはり「文字出力」と同様に配列を指定できて「3I4」のように指定する。これは数値４桁の数の３要素の配列があることを指定する。勿論「I4」のように配列ではない数値も指定できる。
浮動小数点値と改行指定はサボっている。申し訳ない。このサブセットの書式の例は次の通り。
10 FORMAT ( 5X , 'output is ', 3A5,2X , I4,4X,I4 ) WRITE ( 6,10 ) ( MESS ( I ) , I=1,3 ) , DATA1 , DATA2
これ がＣのプログラムだと次のようになるわけだ。
char * mes [ ] = { " test " , " my " , " form " } ; int data1 = 10 ; int data2 = 222 ; fortan_write ( " 5X , \'output is \', 3A5,2X , I4,4X , I4 " , mes , data1 , data2 ) ;
出力は当然両方とも次の通り。
12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890 output is test my form 10 222
まずライブラリ自身が使用するヘッダファイルである。struct
Format は、一つ一つの書式指定を解析した結果であり、これらが next メンバに次の書式の解析結果を繋げた連結リストとして返る。
# define LITERAL 0 /* '〜' に対応する、リテラルの文字列 */ #define BLANK 1 /* X に対応する、空白出力 */ #define ASCII 2 /* A に対応し、引数から文字列を出力 */ #define NUMBER 3 /* I に対応し、引数から数値を出力 */ struct Format { int kind ; /* LITERAL などの種別 */ union u { char * mess ; /* LITERAL の場合、文字列ポインタを保持 */ struct form {
/* BLANK , ASCII , NUMBER の場合 */ short repeat ; /* 繰り返し数( 前の数値 ) */ short num ; /* 個別の書式の表示長さ( 後の数値 ) */ } form ; } u ; struct Format * next ; /* 次の書式指定 */ } ; /* 新しい Format のオブジェクトを取得。本質的に malloc ( 3 ) をラップ */ static struct Format * newFormat ( void ) ; /* 制作された struct Format を解放。いわゆる cdr ダウンをして再帰的に解放する。 */ static void deleteFormat ( struct Format *f ) ; /* 書式文字列から struct Format 連結リストを取得する */ static struct Format * parse_fmt ( char * fmt ) ;
外部インターフェイスは当然これ。
int fortran_write ( char * fmt , ... ) ;
ではライブラリコード。まず fortran_write ( ) 自身を示す 。
int fortran_write ( char * fmt , ... ) { struct Format * ret , * fm ; char work [ 256 ] ; va_list argp ; va_start ( argp , fmt ) ; /* 不定引数処理の準備 */ ret = parse_fmt ( fmt ) ; /* 書式を解析して Fomat 構造体に変換 */ if ( ret == NULL ) { fprintf ( stderr , " parse failed ! %s
" , fmt ) ; return - 1 ; } fm = ret ; while ( fm ) { /* 一つ一つの書式を処理 */ switch ( fm ->kind ) { case LITERAL : /* '〜' で示されるリテラル文字列 */ write ( 1 , fm->u.mess , strlen ( fm ->u.mess ) ) ; break ; case BLANK : /* X で示される空白出力 u.form.num メンバは無視 */ memset ( work , ' ' , sizeof ( work ) ) ; write ( 1 , work , fm->u.form.repeat ) ; break ; case ASCII : /* A で示される引数を使った文字列出力 */ memset ( work , ' ' , sizeof ( work ) ) ; if ( fm->u.form.repeat > 1 ) { /* 配列を受ける場合 */ int i , total ; char ** array = *( char ***) argp ; /* 本質的なキャスト */ /* 出力の制作（左寄せ、文字数超過はカット） */ for( i = 0 ; i < fm->u.form.repeat ; i++ ) { my_strncpy ( &work [ i * fm->u.form.num ] , array [ i ] , fm->u.form.num ) ; } /* 結果の総文字数を得る */ total = fm->u.form.num * fm->u.form.repeat ; va_arg ( argp , char **) ; /* argp を進める */ write ( 1 , work , total ) ; } else { /* 単一文字列を受ける場合 */ char *mes = *( char **) argp ; /* 今までと大差なし */ my_strncpy ( work , mes , fm->u.form.num ) ; va_arg ( argp , char *) ; /* argp を進める */ write ( 1 , work , fm->u.form.num ) ; } break ; case NUMBER : /* I で示される、引数を使った数値出力 */ memset ( work , ' ' , sizeof ( work ) ) ; if ( fm->u.form.repeat > 1 ) { /* 配列を受ける場合 */ int i , total ; int * array = *( int **) argp ; /* 本質的なキャスト */ /* 出力の制作（右寄せ、文字数超過はカット） */ for( i = 0 ; i < fm->u.form.repeat ; i++ ) { setnum ( &work [ i * fm->u.form.num ] , array [ i ] , fm->u.form.num ) ; } /* 総出力文字数の計算 */ total = fm->u.form.num * fm->u.form.repeat ; va_arg ( argp , int *) ; /* argp を進める */ write ( 1 , work , total ) ; } else { /* 単一の数値を受ける */ int mes = *( int *) argp ; setnum ( work , mes , fm->u.form.num ) ; va_arg ( argp , int ) ; /* argp を進める */ write ( 1 , work , fm->u.form.num ) ; } break ; default : fprintf ( stderr , " cannot happen
" ) ; deleteFormat ( ret ) ; /* Format 構造体の破棄 */ return - 1 ; break ; } fm = fm->next ; /* 次の Format 構造体 */ } va_end ( argp ) ; /* argp の破棄 */ deleteFormat( ret ) ; /* Format 構造体の破棄 */ return 0 ; }
面白いのは赤字で強調した部分、
char ** array = *( char ***) argp ; /* 本質的なキャスト */
である。キャストの見かけ上だが、トリプルポインタになっている。一般論としてトリプルポインタは、複雑な多次元データ構造を扱う場合に出ないわけでもないのだが、まあ、あまり乱用すべきものではない。絶対に混乱するので、グローバル変数として定義して、多次元配列調にアクセスするのが普通であろう。筆者のプログラミング経験でも、本質的にトリプルポインタ以上を使ったことがあるのは、この不定長引数処理だけである。これが当然、fortran_read()
などという入力用関数を定義するとなると、上のキャストは次のようになる。
char *** array = *( char ****) argp ;
こうなると、さすがの筆者もちょっと恐怖である（辞書によると、クォドゥルプル(quadruple)・ポインタか..）。元気の良いプログラマは一度チャレンジして見たまえ。
この中でちょっとした下請け関数を使っている。出力整形用に過ぎない。
/* 数値を文字列に変換する */ /* バッファ buf に １０ 進数で val の値を num 文字分だけセット。超過はカット、不足分は空白
*/ /* 手抜き...なぜなら書式長さを越えて「-」が必要な時にどうしたら良いかわからない。
よって負の数には対応せず。*/ static void setnum ( char * buf , int val , int num ) { int i ; for ( i = num - 1 ; i >= 0 && val > 0 ; i-- ) { buf [ i ] = ( val % 10 ) + ' 0 ' ; val /= 10 ; } } /* 文字列を len 文字分コピー。strncpy ( 3 ) みたいなもの。 しかし、文字列末尾に \ 0 を追加しない。*/ static void my_strncpy ( char *d , char *s , int len ) { int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len && *s ; i++ ) { *d++ = *s++ ; } }
問題は書式から struct Format に変換するルーチンである parse_fmt ( )
である。この程度ならば強引に書いても書けるし、正規表現解析ルーチンを使えば少しは楽だ。しかし、拡張性とかデバッグ適性を考えると、この内容はちょっと難しいので、実際には「有限状態機械」のロジックを使った方が無難である。そのため、このルーチンの解説は「可変長引数マクロ」の趣旨からは外れるので、「有限状態機械」を参照されたい。

Hexham shoppers will have to go elsewhere if Robbs closes
Bosses at the almost 189 - year - old Robbs store deliberately set off the fire bell to clear the building of customers and get staff together in one place .
At the designated fire point , the 140 members of staff were told the landmark store would be shutting in two weeks .
The store 's administrators called the decision " efficient and practical " .
' Brutal '
Kroll , the administrators brought in by Robbs ' owners Owen Owen , said that " the closure of Robbs department store was due to become public knowledge before the end of the trading day " .
The administrators said that management wanted " to notify their colleagues of the situation before they found out through other means " .
As a result , they determined that " the most efficient and practical method of informing their colleagues of this business development was by using the fire alarm " .
Not everyone was convinced that it was best method of breaking the news .
" The way we 've been treated is appalling and to find out in such a way has infuriated a lot of people , " said one worker , who wished to remain anonymous .
Peter Atkins , the Conservative MP for Hexham , said it was a " brutal " way for the department store to end its links with the Northumberland market town .
Robbs , which was set up in about 1818 , will close on 12 May unless it can find a buyer .
Liverpool - based Owen Owen has been struggling with cash flow problems since March and has been involved in negotiations to sell its Jopling 's store in Sunderland and its iconic Lewis shop in Liverpool .
Pew ’s financial security and mobility project studied the financial well - being of American families and how their balance sheets relate to both short - term financial stability and longer - term economic mobility .
The initiative built on Pew research that showed savings and assets are key to moving up the economic ladder , both within a lifetime and across generations .
The project 's goal was to foster policy debate and action on how best to improve opportunity to ensure that the American Dream is within reach of everyone .
WHAT TIMING !
Just when the attorney general and the president were coming under fire for the politicized dismissals of eight U.S. attorneys , the Pentagon released a transcript of a March 10 hearing in which Guantanamo detainee Khalid Shaikh Mohammed confessed to masterminding the 9/11 attacks .
Now we can get back to the Bush administration ’s preferred topic :
What a heck of a job it ’s doing in the war on terror .
KSM is a nasty piece of work .
In the transcript , he claimed credit not only for the 9/11 attacks ( “ I was responsible for the 9/11 operation , from A to Z , ” ) but for more than 30 other plots , from the beheading of journalist Daniel Pearl to a plot to assassinate former U.S. presidents .
In fact , there ’s almost nothing to which KSM did n’t confess .
But if the administration hopes to regain lost political capital by shifting the conversation back to terrorism and KSM , the strategy may backfire .
If anything , KSM ’s recent performance highlights the downside of the Bush administration ’s post - 9/11 decision to declare “ war ” against Al Qaeda .
It goes without saying that military action may at times be required to combat well - defended terrorist organizations based in foreign states .
But as a policy matter , the “ war on terror ” framework has been a predictable disaster for the United States .
It led to a counterproductive overreliance on military force , an under - appreciation of the role of politics and community identity in sustaining terrorist organizations and a dangerous , “ anything goes ” approach to intelligence gathering that encompassed secret detentions and torture .

Most ironically , the “ war on terror ” framework has lent legitimacy to terrorist leaders such as KSM , enabling them to present themselves as warriors standing up against a powerful -- and hypocritical -- U.S. military machine .
At his Guantanamo hearing , KSM was quick to exploit what he termed the “ language of war . ”
“ I ’m not happy that 3,000 been killed in America , ” he piously informed the military tribunal .
But in war , “ you have to kill . ”
The U.S. , he implied , is really not so different from Al Qaeda .
Just consider the innocents killed by U.S. bombardments !
By way of further illustration , KSM slyly offered the following : “ I know American people are torturing us ... and I know it is against
KSM ’s claim of moral equivalence may go over well with people alienated by post -9/11 U.S. policies , but it is dangerously misleading .
U.S. failures and abuses are real and should be condemned by all of us .
But nothing justifies the deliberate slaughter of innocents .
The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were neither legitimate acts of war nor some excusable “ exception ” but a hideous crime , a mass murder of appalling dimension .

From the beginning , the Bush administration should have called terrorism what it is : an ambitious form of lethal and complex criminality that at times requires a military response as well as a political and police response .
And it should have called KSM what he is : not an “ enemy combatant ” in a war but a brutal criminal , someone who , as Human Rights Watch ’s John Sifton puts it , deserves the same fate as “ child molesters and serial killers ” -- ignominious trial and conviction .
Putting KSM on trial as the criminal he is would not have precluded U.S. military action against Al Qaeda targets on foreign territory .
But it would have made it harder for KSM to wrap himself in the mantle of a freedom fighter and present himself as a “ combatant ” comparable to George Washington .
The 9/11 commission report noted the “ grandiose ” nature of KSM ’s “ true ambitions . ”
He intended to hijack 10 planes on 9/11 , crashing nine and landing the 10th at a U.S. airport .
Then , “ after killing all adult male passengers on board ” and “ alerting the media , ” KSM planned to “ deliver a speech excoriating ” the United States .
What he longed for “ was theater , a spectacle of destruction with KSM as the self - cast star . ”
Last week at Guantanamo , KSM finally got his theatrical opportunity : the chance to stand before a military tribunal and proudly accept the mantle of “ enemy combatant ” in Al Qaeda ’s war against the U.S.
By declaring war on terrorism , the Bush administration ended up playing right into his hands .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Carnivorous sponges , 585 new species of crustaceans and hundreds of new worms have been discovered in the dark waters around Antarctica , suggesting these depths may have been the source of much marine life , European researchers reported on Wednesday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The team , who scooped samples from as deep as 20,000 feet , found unexpectedly rich diversity of animal life .
Many belong to species found around the world , notably in the Arctic , while others appear to be unique to the deepest Antarctic waters , the researchers reported in the journal Nature .
The unique species tend to be the kind that do not spread easily , which suggests the deep , cold southern oceans may have been the source of many types of marine life , the researchers conclude .
“ The Antarctic deep sea is potentially the cradle of life of the global marine species .
Our research results challenge suggestions that the deep sea diversity in the Southern Ocean is poor , ” said Angelika Brandt of the Zoological Institute and Zoological Museum at Germany ’s University of Hamburg .
“ We now have a better understanding in the evolution of the marine species and how they can adapt to changes in climate and environments , ” Brandt , who led the expedition , said in a statement .
Among the new creatures they documented are a gourd - shaped carnivorous sponge called Chondrocladia ; free - swimming worms and 674 species of isopod , a diverse order of crustaceans that includes woodlice , also commonly called pillbugs , sea lice or sea centipedes .
Of the isopod crustaceans , 585 species had never been seen before .
Between 2002 and 2005 , researchers sampled water and the sediment from 2,500 to 20,000 feet in the deep Weddell Sea and adjacent areas .
Their catch was surprisingly rich .
“ What was once thought to be a featureless abyss is in fact a dynamic , variable and biologically rich environment , ” Katrin Linse , a marine biologist from the British Antarctic Survey , said in a statement .
The researchers said the Weddell Sea is an important source of deep water for the rest of the ocean .
Species can enter the depths of the Weddell sea from shallower continental shelves .
Animals that spread easily , such as the single - celled Foraminifera , were similar to those found in other oceans .
“ The isopods , ostracods ( seed shrimp ) and nematodes , which are poor dispersers , include many species currently known only from the Southern Ocean , ” the researchers wrote .
Researchers had not been able to excavate at the cave
Indonesian officials have blocked access to the cave since 2005 , following a dispute over the bones .
But Professor Richard " Bert " Roberts , a member of the team that found the specimens , told BBC News the political hurdles had now been overcome .
The researchers claim that the remains belong to a novel species of human .
South - East Asia and East Asia is going to yield an awful lot of surprises
Mike Morwood , UNE
Finding other specimens in the cave , particularly one with an intact skull , is crucial to resolving the debate over whether the Hobbit 's classification as a separate species - Homo floresiensis - is valid .
Political hurdle
" This year we will back in Liang Bua again , back in the cave where we found the Hobbits , " said Professor Roberts , from the University of Wollongong in Australia .
The " Hobbit " has forced a re-think of human evolution
The Hobbit 's discoverers are adamant it is an entirely separate human species that evolved a small size in isolation on its remote Indonesian island home of Flores .
Skeletal remains were discovered by an Australian - Indonesian research team in Liang Bua , a limestone cave deep in the Flores jungle , in 2003 .
Researchers found one near - complete skeleton , which they named LB1 , along with the remains of at least eight other individuals .
Vertically challenged
LB1 was an adult female who lived 18,000 years ago , stood just 1 m ( 3ft ) tall and possessed a brain size of around 400 cubic cm ( 24 cu inches ) - about the same as that of a chimp .
Long arms , a sloping chin and other primitive features suggested affinities to ancient human species such as Homo erectus and even earlier ones such as Homo habilis and Australopithecus .
The find caused a sensation when it was unveiled in 2004 , because it suggested human evolution had been much more complicated in South - East Asia than previously imagined .
It also showed that another species of human had survived into " modern " times .
Mike Morwood , director of the excavation , told BBC News the remains at Liang Bua could be the tip of the iceberg : " South - East Asia and East Asia are going to yield an awful lot of surprises and it's going to make a major contribution to our understanding of hominin evolution . "
But not all researchers were happy about this hand grenade being tossed into one of palaeoanthropology 's hallowed vestibules .
Professor Teuku Jacob , based at Gadjah Mada University , in Yogyakarta , Indonesia , contended that the bones of LB1 could have been those of a pygmy person with the condition microcephaly , which is characterised by a small brain .
Bone damage
In 2004 , Professor Jacob - known as Indonesia 's " king of palaeoanthropology " - took the bones away from their repository in Jakarta to his lab in Yogyakarta , 443 km ( 275 miles ) away , against the wishes of the researchers who found them .
They were eventually returned .
But the discoverers claimed the bones were extensively damaged in Jacob 's lab during attempts to make casts .
The damage included long , deep cuts marking the lower edge of the Hobbit 's jaw on both sides , said to be caused by a knife used to cut away the rubber mould .
In addition , the chin of a second Hobbit jaw was snapped off and glued back together .
Whoever was responsible misaligned the pieces and put them at an incorrect angle .
The pelvis was smashed , destroying details that reveal body shape , gait and evolutionary history .
After the accusations surfaced , Professor Jacob denied damaging the remains , telling USA Today that breakages could have occurred when the bones were being transported from Yogyakarta back to Jakarta .
Excavations at Liang Bua were reportedly blocked because Indonesian government officials would not issue exploration permits for projects that might prove Professor Jacob wrong .
Momentous discovery
But the remaining issues now appear to have been smoothed over .
" It 's now a matter of getting everything organised so we can start digging again , " said Professor Roberts .
" You 've got to get there in the dry season ; in the wet season you can hardly drive to the site and when you are there , there are puddles of water all over the floor - so it 's got to be dry to sensibly dig holes . "
Speaking to BBC
News before permission was given to restart excavation , Mike Morwood , from the University of New England , Australia , was optimistic about future research into H. floresiensis and the record of human occupation in island South - East Asia .
" This particular discovery seems to have prompted people to rethink what it is to be human , the relationship between brain size and behaviour , and whether hominin populations have been insulated from environmental factors .
This indicates that they have n't .
" It also raises questions about the colonisation capabilities of early hominids .
What are they doing on Flores and what are they almost certainly doing on other islands in South - East Asia . "
It is still not known how hominids travelled by sea between these islands .
Building watercraft may have been a skill too advanced for them .
So natural catastrophes such as tsunamis have been invoked by some researchers to explain their distribution .
Hominids could have clung to trees as they were washed out to sea , eventually arriving on the shores of other islands .
It hurts when someone steps on our foot .
But why does it hurt more if someone does it on purpose ?
And how do these quirks of pain influence how we spend ?
It is not uncommon to feel intimidated when starting a new job .
This is especially true when you think you 've been hired as a programmer , show up , and are asked to do IT for " just a couple of months " until they hire someone to do that job .
Such is the situation in which Clint found himself , many years ago .
The problem is that when they finally hire an IT guy , it may be hard for the other programmers to accept you into the herd .
To them , you 're just the guy that bounces the email server and makes backups .

Lucky for , the other developers sat him down and walked him through the application he would be working on .
Though many of the concepts seemed foreign , they appeared to know what they were doing .
In fact , when one of the other developers complained that he was getting " inconsistent results , " he askedto take a look at his code .
Needless to say , Clint no longer felt intimidated .

A lot of ideas in modern software development come from Zero Quality Control , Toyota ’s approach to achieving product quality .
Some things , it seems , have been a bit lost in translation .
Here ’s what ZQC can teach us about how to write better software .
Zero Quality
Control takes it ’s name from the idea that quality does not come from controlling and sorting out defects on the end , but from building it up front .
In the words of Philip Crosby , ‘ Quality has to be caused , not controlled ’ .
Toyota ’s solution consists of a design approach that aims to create mistake - proof products , early warnings and inexpensive successive tests at the source .
Poka - Yoke design
Poka - Yoke ( mistake - proofing ) is a design approach which seeks to prevent problems by making products less prone to misuse .
‘ A Brief Tutorial on Mistake - proofing , Poka - Yoke , and ZQC ’ by John R. Grout , and Brian T. Downs is a good introduction information to ZQC , and contains some very interesting examples from every - day life .
Assembling components must be fairly straight - forward
Computer cables are often offered as a common example of Poka - Yoke design .
Video cable plugs are asymmetric , so that it ’s obvious how to plug them in , and that it ’s virtually impossible to turn them the wrong way .
Of course , with the right application of brute force , cables can be plugged in wrongly , but the point is that it ’s much easier to use them correctly .
Grout and Downs also mention an interesting example with fire alarms which cannot be fitted on to the ceiling if a battery is not installed .
In ‘ Documentation for Telepathic developers ’ , I offered a translation of this concept into the software world as “ It should take less code to use the API properly then to unintentionally misuse it .
Assembling components the Poka - Yoke way must be straight forward , and it should really be hard to do it wrongly .
Software should not blow up
Another example of Poka - Yoke design is a typical elevator : when overcrowded , elevator will refuse to work , and a light signal will start blinking , notifying us that something is wrong .
Our software classes should follow this example .
When something is wrong , they should not allow us to proceed and blow up , but they should also not die silently .
An elevator light signal clearly tells us that something is wrong , and so should our components .
Without such signal , we might think that there is a bug in the component , and start working around it .
Exceptions can be an effective way of giving more documentation , but the signal should be clean and unambiguous , in order not to mislead users or client - developers .
Another very interesting example of ingenious Poka - Yoke design given by Grout and Downs is the Bathyscaphe Trieste , a deep - sea submersible used to explore the ocean bead .
In case of electric failure , it would practically be doomed , along with anyone inside the vehicle .
So , ballast silos are held by electromagnets , and case of an electric failure the craft would immediately start rising to the surface .
Likewise , software must be designed to prevent a complete crash , even in the face of system failure .
Auto - save features are a good example .
It ’s not often that the power gets cut , but when it does , our users will surely appreciate that we saved most of their work .
Poka - Yoke testing
Test - devices were designed to inexpensively check if a product was defective .
Poka - yoke tests were inexpensive , repeatable and reliable .
They could be given to workers on the manufacturing line , to check a product straight after they make it .
Checking at the source , rather than on the end , was one of the most important ideas described by Shigeo Shingo in his book on Zero Quality Control .
Mary Poppendieck often comments on those ideas that ‘ inspection to find defects is waste , inspection to prevent defects is essential ’ .
That is basically what test - driven development is all about .
Yet , some of the original ideas of ZQC often do n’t make it into automated tests .
Understanding the basic principles of ZQC and applying them while writing tests can significantly improve the effect of TDD .
Unit Tests have to be as fast as lightning
Poka - Yoke tests worked because tests were inexpensive .
With software , expenses translate directly into developer time .
We have to run unit tests for any code change , and they must not start getting in the way .
So unit tests have to run on developer machines , and they have to be as fast as lightning .
From my experience , any unit test suite that runs longer than a minute is more an obstacle than a helping tool .
People will start skipping tests , which pretty much defeats the whole point of doing them .
This does not mean that we should not write tests that run longer – just that people should not be made to run them every time .
Quick and slow tests should be separated
What works for us quite good is to put fast and slow tests into different suites ( or even different tools ) , and run only the fast suites on every change .
A build automation server , like Cruise Control , should run slower tests every couple of hours and let us know when something is broken .
The server should also run quicker tests , just to make sure that unchecked code did not find it ’s way into the source code repository ( in an ideal world , this will surely never happen , but reality often surprises idealists ) .
I suggest running the quicker tests after any code change in the repository , to get the fastest feedback .
Tests must be reliable
Good test must be deterministic – failing should point to a defect or work not being done .
Tests which pass or fail depending on external factors , not related to the code under test , are a waste .
Spending five minutes to check if a test failed because there really was a bug defeats the whole point of test automation .
Even worse , people might start overlooking genuine problems , because they will start expecting the suite to fail with a few errors .
Red light should mean ‘ stop ! ’ , not ‘ stop , maybe !’.
Tests must be repeatable
Good tests must allow successive checking , to make sure that the item is correct several times during the production , and to allow people to re-test it when a problem is fixed .
Tests which are not easily repeatable typically depend on external systems , or some longer setup .
For example , a test may depend on a payment provider to verify the transaction .
Or , it may involve a database , which has it ’s own rules about integrity constraints or duplicated data .
Unit and component tests which depend on setting up external systems typically signal that code under test should be split into a part that encapsulates a particular business rule , and a part that interacts with an external system .
Doing so will not just make code easier to test , but will lead to a cleaner design and easier code evolution and maintenance in the future .
The test can then focus on a business rule , repeatable and reliable .
Communication with the external system should be moved to integration tests , and does not have to be executed on every code change .
With data - driven tests , if duplication can cause problems for successive checks , clean up the data after the test when possible .
Database testing library DbFit , for example , automatically rolls back the active database transaction on the end of the test .
If similar cleanup is not possible , the next best thing is to have restore the active database from a clean backup before tests .
Tests involving external storage , like a database , typically fail the ‘ fast as lightning ’ criteria , so they should not be executed on every code change in any case .
So , restoring a base version before test runs every couple of hours should be OK .
More on ZQC
Zero quality control and the Toyota production system in general have been taken up by a lot of other industries , in the form of “ Lean initiatives ” .
Mary and Tom Poppendieck are the most active promoters of lean initiatives in the world of software , and their books on Lean Software Development offer some very interesting advice for organising and managing a software shop the lean way .

Glizty and bright metallics in most colours are going to stay huge in the coming season ’s , working their way through Autumn - Winter and Spring - Summer looks and heavily popularised by celebrities such as Cameron Diaz and Sienna Miller .
Also , watch out for metallic bags and accessories being used to liven up drab outfits .
You can dress metallics down , like Rachel Bilson with the YSL Double bag , and Jessica Alba who wears silver metallics with jeans .
For something to add a touch of glamour to your evening wear , try this leather Fendi bag – a a stunning accompaniment to any dress .
The former U.N. weapons inspector , who was scorned for saying there were no WMD in Iraq , speaks with Robert Scheer about American ignorance , the lies that led us to war , Iran ’s nuclear program and more .

Transcript :
Robert Scheer :
I want to get to the book .
But before that , some general questions .
We ’ll go back and forth .
Maybe for an hour , or something like that , and then ask questions , if that ’s all right .
Even if it ’s not all right , that ’s the way we ’re going to do it .
[ Audience laughs . ]
I want to begin — and I do n’t want to single out any candidate .
But … Hillary Clinton last week ….
[ Audience laughs . ] … said that when she voted for the Iraq war , it was based on false intelligence .
Others have made that claim — not necessarily candidates .
What is your response to that ?
Scott Ritter : First of all , it ’s a pleasure to be here tonight and to have an opportunity to talk with you and be in the company of Mr. Scheer .
Hillary wants us to believe that the vote she made was a vote made in good faith .
She wants us to believe that she was a victim of misleading intelligence .
She wants us to believe that she is an individual of strong character and that we can trust her to do the right thing when it comes to leading our nation should she be elected to the highest office in the land .
The most powerful office , by the way , in the entire world .
She asks too much .
For us to say that Hillary was misled is for us to believe that there was n’t … that we need to erase eight years of Bill Clinton presidency .
I know that Bill and Hillary did n’t have the closest of relationships during this period of time .
I ’m not being facetious here .
It ’s very possible that she could have been doing her thing and he was doing his thing : running the country .
But even Hillary had to be aware that it was Bill Clinton that initiated the policy of regime change when it comes to Saddam Hussein .
It was Bill Clinton that initiated the policy of economic sanctions , base containment and destabilization to achieve regime change .
It was under Bill Clinton ’s tenure that the CIA undermined the weapons inspectors , creating the perception of a noncompliant Iraq when the facts spoke other .
Never forget that the CIA today commits to the reality that Iraq was disarmed in the summer of 1991 .
The CIA today says , “ Yes , this was true . ”
As a weapons inspector , we were reporting these facts to the CIA in the fall of 1993 , right in the beginning of Bill Clinton ’s tenure .
It was the Clinton administration that refused to accept the findings of the weapons inspectors , instead maintaining the perception of a noncomplying Saddam in order to continue United Nations - based economic sanctions for the purpose of undermining Saddam ’s regime , leading to regime change .
Bill Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act in 1998 , authorizing $ 100 million of U.S. taxpayers ’ funds to go into overthrowing Saddam Hussein .
The Iraq Liberation , which made it public law - of - the - land policy to change the regime in Baghdad .
And now Hillary is saying , “ Oops ” ?
She got it wrong ?
No .
Hillary and the other politicians who voted in favor of war in 2002 took the route of political expediency .
She , like John Kerry before her and others , were examining , weighing the costs / benefits of this vote .
She and others knew that , should she vote against this war , she would be subjected to immediate and harsh criticism that would undermine her viability as a national political leader .
With all due respect to Hillary Clinton and her current posturing , she is — frankly speaking — a damn liar and should be treated as such , and never be given the opportunity to lead the United States of America .
[ Audience applauds . ]
Scheer : I did n’t expect it to be quite so partisan .
[ Audience laughs . ]
Let ’s change the mood a little bit .
I did n’t want this to be so much Hillary bashing , but , how can we learn ?
Bill Clinton — let ’s take it away from Hillary and put it on Bill — he did resist the call to go to war in a number of different ways .
He did try , for instance , to work out an arrangement with North Korea .
He did resist a lot of this .
What would have been the reason for going for regime change ?
What was the idea ?
That Saddam Hussein was a destabilizing force ?
Ritter : Again , I give Bill Clinton the benefit of the doubt here .
I think it ’s only fair to note that the initiator of regime - change policy in regards to American - Iraqi relations was George Herbert Walker Bush .
And the reason George Herbert Walker Bush chose to eliminate Saddam Hussein from power was that Saddam Hussein had become a political embarrassment to the first Bush administration .
Because Saddam Hussein ’s existence reminded everybody of the reality of the Reagan administration and the George Herbert Walker Bush administration ’s very close ties with Saddam Hussein .
We were just talking at dinner about the fact that Saddam Hussein — the two crimes he was being tried for before he was executed , were crimes that took place prior to Donald Rumsfeld ’s visit , when Donald Rumsfeld embraced Saddam , passed on a message that said , “ You are a friend of the American people . ”
George Herbert Walker Bush sent Sen. Bob Dole to Iraq in March of 1990 with the same message .
“ You are a true friend of the American people . ”
It ’s only in August 1990 , when Saddam invades Kuwait , that he suddenly becomes the personification of evil .
And it ’s the requirement to get the American public from going from viewing Saddam as a true friend to the personification of evil worthy of military intervention that we had to change the mind - set .
Saddam Hussein became the Middle East equivalent — and this is where Bush made his fatal mistake — the Middle East equivalent of Adolf Hitler , requiring Nuremberg - like retribution .
These are direct quotes from a speech made by George Herbert Walker Bush in October of 1990 .
Now , when you call someone the Middle East equivalent of Adolf Hitler , requiring Nuremberg - like retribution , that means at the end of the day he has to be gone , in prison , held to account .
At the end of the Gulf War in 1999 , Saddam Hussein was still in power .
We did n’t go into Baghdad .
We were never supposed to go into Baghdad ; we were supposed to simply liberate Kuwait , which we did .
Now Saddam Hussein is still in power and George Herbert Walker Bush has a political problem .
And this is the point that I ’ve made from day one .
Why is regime change so important ?
It ’s not about national security .
Saddam Hussein never posed a threat to the national security of the United States that warranted American military intervention , whether it be in 1991 or 2003 or any time in between .
Scheer :
But it ’s kind of a depressing thought that you do n’t have adults watching the store .
Because I can go back way before George Walker Bush and ask , why did Jimmy Carter declare the mujahedeen in Afghanistan freedom fighters and challenge the seculars who were in Kabul ?
And that ’s where 9/11 comes from .
Why did Eisenhower overthrow Mossadegh in Iran ?
And that ’s why we have the bloody madness in Iran right now .
We can go through a whole history of the last 50 years where , in the name of making things better , we make things worse .
You ’re a guy who ’s been out there in the field , sort of left holding the bag .
You ’re not nave about Saddam Hussein .
You know he was a bad guy .
You describe in one of your books — I forget which one — being at the Baghdad airport looking for weapons of mass destruction , and so forth .
You understand .
Yet , in retrospect , as I understand your writing , you do n’t think Saddam Hussein was really the worst thing that could have happened .
Ritter : I was driving down the California coast a couple of days ago , went past Camp Pendleton , watched the Marines out there doing their thing , almost deviated off course , shaved my head and rejoined because I really love the Marine Corps .
I miss that time .
I appreciate their service to country , etc .
But one of the things that ’s imperative before we ask our men and women who honor us by serving in the military to make the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country , is that it ’s a cause worthy of the sacrifice .
That means we have to study the cause and know the cause , understand the cause .
While I was driving there I was listening to the radio and there was a song — we talked about it — a Green Day song .
One of the lyrics is “ calling on idiot America . ”
[ Editor ’s note : Actually , “ calling out to idiot America . ” ]
And it just became so obvious to me that the American public does n’t know squat about the world we live in .
Here we are , we ’re having a national debate about Iraq .
“ Where do we go with Iraq ?
What do we do in Iraq ? ”
How can you debate something you do n’t know ?
How can you solve a problem you have n’t defined ?
And here we are talking about Saddam … .
How easily we , the people of the United States of America — and I use that term because it is derived from the preamble of the Constitution , a document which defines who we are and what we are as a nation — how easily we , the people , are deceived .
How easily we , the people , are manipulated .
How easily we are pushed in one direction or the other .
How quickly we bought into Saddam Hussein being the personification of evil .
And while we were calling him the Middle East equivalent of Adolf Hitler , how little we knew of Iraq .
How many people here truly know the difference between a Shia and a Sunni ?
Do n’t feel bad if you do n’t ; the head of the Intelligence Committee of the United States Congress certainly does n’t .
How many people here know whether al - Qaida is a Sunni - based organization or a Shia - based organization ?
Do n’t be upset if you do n’t because the head of the Intelligence Committee certainly does n’t .
Do you know where Wahhabism … do you know what Wahhabism … ?
The point is , I throw out a lot of these terms , which are very relevant about modern - day Iraq , and you have complete ignorance about it .
Not maybe you in the audience , because you ’re here trying to make an effort to try and learn .
But Los Angeles , last time I checked , has a population greater than 400 people .
The vast majority of the people walking and driving the streets of L.A. today , or any city and town in America , know nothing about Iraq , and yet they feel free to have opinions about Iraq .
Saddam Hussein was a product of Iraq ’s modern history .
Saddam Hussein was a product of a nationalist movement that had its roots with Nasser in Egypt , that recognized that in modern Arab society you have tendencies to rip this society apart , called religion , that schism between Shia and Sunni .
So you better damn well know the difference between those two if you want to talk about coming up with a solution , Mr. [ Silvestre ] Reyes , congressman from Texas , head of the House Intelligence Committee !
But we might want to remind Nancy Pelosi , speaker of the House , who appointed this man .
I bet you she could n’t pass the pop quiz , either .
None of them can .
You better know that there ’s not just the difference between Sunni and Shia , but a difference between Kurd and Arab , a difference between a Turkmen and a Kurd .
You better know the difference between Wahhabism and those who embrace the following of Saddam Hussein .
You better know the different religious holidays .
You better know all of this .
Saddam Hussein did .
You better know that tribes have a tendency to rip society apart , too .
That ’s why Baathism , modern Baathism — and I ’m not here condoning Baathism , I ’m just stating reality — rejected tribalism , rejected ethnicity , rejected religion , and spoke of a unified secular Iraqi state .
In order to achieve that vision , Saddam Hussein had to suppress the very tendencies that rise up and tear modern Iraq apart .
And we condemned him for this ?
We called him a war criminal for this ?
Yet now we ’re in Iraq , we took away the glue that held together , and we ’re doing the same damn thing , but even worse .
We ’ve accused Saddam Hussein over the course of 30 years of killing 400,000 Iraqi people .
Hell , it ’s taken us four years and we ’ve killed 600,000 .
( continued on the next page ) Scheer : Your story , your analysis , has held up splendidly .
The analysis of the people that you are disagreeing with has fallen apart .
Whatever one thinks , history has vindicated you .
What do they say to you now ?
Ritter :
They do n’t say anything at all .
[ Audience laughs . ]
You see , the worst mistake they could make at this point in time would be to engage in a debate .
I would love to have a debate with the formulators of policy .
I challenge any one of them at any time .
“ Let ’s talk about this .
Let ’s do it in a public forum .
Let ’s have winner - takes - all so that if you lose the debate , you jump off the cliff .
And I can guarantee you :
At the end of the debate , the entire neocon community will be in a heap at the bottom of the cliff and I ’ll be standing at the top .
[ Audience laughs , applauds . ]
But they do n’t want to engage in that debate .
All they want to do is ignore me and continue to push forward with their … .
Scheer :
You interest me because you wo n’t toe any line and you ’re still a Republican , right ?
Ritter : I ’m an American , first and foremost , but I will say this : I ’m a registered Republican and I ’m not going to leave the Republican Party .
I believe that in order to cure it , good people have to stay in it .
Scheer :
My point in bringing that up was not to make you … .
You were telling me in the restaurant — your three goals , sort of three obligations you feel , and I find that interesting .
Maybe you should repeat that , if you can .
Ritter : I was asked what motivates me , what drives me .
The first thing is good citizenship .
As a citizen , you have to invest yourself into your country .
You have to give something ; it ’s not just about take .
As a Republican , I ’ll quote a Democrat .
“ Ask not what your country can do for you .
Ask what you can do for your country . ”
That ’s what makes a citizen great , it ’s giving something to your country .
I am able to give in a certain area .
I served in the military , I served , as you know , as a weapons inspector .
And I am positioned — unfortunately or fortunately , depending on your point of view — when government is not telling the truth about certain issues .
As a citizen , I have a duty and responsibility to speak out .
Bad citizenship would be to take the path of least resistance and sit back and say , “ Well , I ’m just not going to get involved . ”
No .
You jump in and you say , “ Wrong ! ” because America is about doing the right thing .
So it ’s about telling the truth , it ’s about being a good citizen , about investing yourself .
I believe in how America interfaces with the rest of the world .
We live in this giant globe .
We are 300 million people and there are 6.8 billion others out there ?
And we ’re dictating the codes , the coexistence ?
One of the problems is — and I come back — ignorance .
The American people are some of the most ignorant people you ’re going to meet on the face of the Earth about the world we live in .
That ’s the bottom line .
We ca n’t pass basic tests about global geography , let alone American geography .
And as an American citizen I have a duty and responsibility to participate in the process of informing and educating the American public so it can rise above its ignorance so it wo n’t be intimidated by fear derived from that ignorance and they ’ll make the right decision .
These are the things that motivate me .
Trust me :
It ’s not about making money , because if it was I ’ve certainly taken the wrong path .
Scheer :
But now that you ’ve signed up with Truthdig , that ’s going to change overnight .
[ Audience laughs . ]
I just want to set the record straight so we are n’t tormented by this by someone writing an article somewhere .
You did loathe Saddam Hussein , right ?
Ritter : Loathe is a strong word .
Scheer : I ’ve read your books .
You thought this guy was a bloody dictator .
Ritter : I ’m a realist .
Scheer : Yeah .
Ritter :
And I ’m somebody who believed in a policy of regime change .
I believe that we should ’ve strived to change the policy of the regime of Saddam Hussein .
But there ’s a big difference between changing a regime through a pattern of interface with Iraq that promotes growth of democratic institutions within Iraq so that Saddam Hussein is done away with without any loss of American life , and a policy of regime change that has us invading , occupying and destroying a nation .
I ’ve always committed to a policy of regime change .
In fact , in February of 2003 , right before the war , I was supposed to go to Iraq with a delegation of people including Nelson Mandela and others .
We had a six - point peace plan that the Iraqi had agreed to .
And , basically , these six points would have led to regime change .
Not necessarily Saddam Hussein being dragged out and hung , but the embrace of democratic institutions , U.N. - sponsored elections , things like that that change the character of the nation for the better .
Scheer : Yeah .
The policy that George W. Bush is now following towards North Korea and Cheney has embraced — they will now be taken off the terrorist list , [ Ritter laughs ] they will become good actors , democracy will flower — could have applied to Saddam Hussein .
Let me ask you a question … .
That we ’re there now , and most people — certainly in this room , but most … actually , most people in the country — know it was a big mistake and very costly .
But then they say you just ca n’t get out .
And we were in — talking again in that restaurant and we had that argument about — Vietnam for about 15 years , or something .
You ca n’t just get out .
And then when we got out , under the most ignominious circumstances , lifting people off the embassy and everything , quite the opposite happened than we expected .
And now we have George W. Bush actually visit Vietnam and sit under a statue of the same Ho Chi Minh , and so forth .
So what do you say to the argument , “ Can we get out now ? ” and “ How would we get out ?
”
And so forth .
Ritter :
Not only can we get out , we must get out .
There is no positive thing that will come from the continued presence of American troops inside Iraq .
We ’re not contributing anything , anything positive .
All these lunatics in Fox News and others can talk about building schools , painting schools … whatever you want , and that ’s just absurd in the extreme .
I do n’t even think anyone ’s selling that poison anymore .
They ’re talking about the potential of doing good , but no one ’s talking about us actually doing good because we ’re not doing good .
So , can we get out ?
Absolutely .
Six months and we can have everybody out of Iraq .
It ’s a piece of cake .
It ’s not hard to do that .
“ Should we get out ? ” is the question .
Do we have a moral responsibility , having gone into Iraq and broken it so bad — you know the old Pottery Barn rule : you broke it , you own it ? — should we stay and try and fix it ?
And , again , I believe this is fair debate to have .
It ’s a very legitimate debate to have .
I would , first of all , say that it ’s a debate that all Americans must be participants in , because to stay in Iraq … .
I believe you do n’t talk about solving a problem unless you ’ve properly defined the problem .
If we ’re going to say the problem revolves around saving Iraq , rebuilding it , we ’re talking about decades - long involvement that ’s going to cost trillions of dollars — not billions : trillions of dollars — and will cost us significantly more lives .
And it may not work .
Some people say it ’s a gamble worth taking .
Fine .
I ’d just ask the American people to pass a pop quiz .
Tell me about the city of Karbala .
Tell me about the city of Baghdad .
Tell me about the city of Kirkuk .
Explain to me the significance of these three cities both in terms of Iraqi history past , current and future .
And if you ’re sitting there shaking your head , going , “ What the hell is he talking about ? ” ladies and gentlemen , we need to get out of Iraq right now !
Because if you ca n’t answer that question right now , you are not even equipped to weigh in intelligently about a policy decision that has America committed to several decades of involvement in this nation .
Karbala is the birthplace of Shiism .
That ’s where Hussein [ in the seventh century ] was wiped out by Sunni apostates , creating not only the Shia faith but creating the schism between the Shia and the Sunni .
Baghdad was sacked in the 12th century by the Mongols .
As a result of the sack of Baghdad , the Sunnis said , “ We got defeated because we lost pure Islamic faith . ”
It ’s the birth of Wahhabism .
Wahhabism , Osama bin Laden ’s version of Sunni Islamic fundamentalism , was derived by foreign occupation of Baghdad .
Huh ?
We ’re at war with al - Qaida and the Wahhabists .
And we just empowered them by occupying Baghdad .
If it is n’t sinking into your head yet , it never will .
Kirkuk .
Oil. Kurds .
Turkmen .
Shia .
Kirkuk .
If you ’re going to have any hope of a unified Iraq , you have to tell me how Kirkuk is going to emerge from any post - Saddam environment , a unified city .
Kirkuk is where the formal civil war in Iraq will start .
Not Baghdad , not Karbala : Kirkuk .
And if you do n’t know this , if you ca n’t tell me why , if you ca n’t tell me who the players are , ladies and gentlemen , you ’re ill equipped to enter into a debate about the long - term presence of Americans in Iraq .
So that ’s where I come down to .
Can we get out of Iraq ?
Absolutely .
Should we get out of Iraq ?
If we , the people of the United States of America , do n’t know enough about a country where we ’re asking our armed services to give the ultimate sacrifice for , then we have no business being in that country
Scheer :
All right .
[ Audience applauds . ]
Scheer : George W. Bush , reluctantly , or what have you , has followed a different model now with North Korea .
It ’s no longer unilateral .
We defer to the South Koreans , to the Chinese , to the Russians , to the Japanese .
Right ?
We take seriously the notion of multiparty actors who know more about the region than we do , who know more about what ’s happening .
We are now going to take Korea — not only will we give them aid and comfort , we ’re going to take them off the terrorism list .
Their guy is coming to New York .
They ’ve invited the U.N. , and so forth .
Why is that not a model that should be followed or would be followed with Iran ?
Ritter : First of all , here ’s the problem with Bush ’s policy on North Korea .
The people who made this policy are the same people who said they could never buy into this .
These are the people who condemned Bill Clinton for what he did .
I have to be questioning their motives .
It ’s not as though Bush came in and did what a CO does when a division [ is ] just failing abysmally .
“ You ’re all fired , here ’s the new team in , and here ’s the new way forward . ”
So why would we go down this path with North Korea , which everybody who made this policy rejects ?
Because we have no intention of following through .
There are so many caveats built into this that — .
Trust me on this one : This North Korean policy will collapse inside of a year .
But , what he ’s done with the timing right now is to take North Korea off the map as far as the American people are concerned .
We no longer have to worry about the proliferation of nuclear weapons in North Korea because Bush has just solved it magically , overnight , by a wave of a magic wand .
Now we can focus solely on Iran and not have to worry about the North Korea problem .
Scheer :
So we ’re going to ignore North Korea , that ’s actually exploded such a weapon .
Ritter : Yep .
Scheer :
And we ’re going to focus on Iran , that seems to be — what ?
— 10 years away from having any .
Ritter :
The funny thing about 10 years is , when someone says someone is 10 years away from having a nuclear weapon , ladies and gentlemen , if that ’s the standard you use , every nation is 10 years away from having a nuclear weapon .
Being 10 years away from having a nuclear weapon means you do n’t have anything .
Nothing .
You ’re starting from scratch .
Yeah , you know , you can sit there .
But what the CIA is saying — when they say they ’re 10 years away — is : “ We do n’t have any hard data on Iran .
We ’re just making this stuff up as we go along . ”
The most current one is that Iran is one year away from having it .
You heard the talk .
They can have fissile material in one year .
That ’s derived from the premise that they will get 3,000 centrifuges to be up and running tomorrow and to run , nonstop , for a year — a year of nonstop operation , at the end of which you ’re going to get 20 kilograms of 85 percent enriched , highly enriched uranium .
Theoretically , that ’s possible .
Right now the Iranians can only get 164 centrifuges up and running ; they have another 164 cascade - ready , but they ’re testing it .
And they have bits and pieces of the total 3,000 , but they ca n’t assemble them .
Here ’s the other , unknown secret , ladies and gentlemen :
They ca n’t do it .
They ca n’t do it .
Centrifuges are complex .
They ’re about yea big .
Cylindrical tube .
They have to spin around at 70,000 rpm .
Did you ever play with a gyroscope as a kid ?
Spin it up and hold it in your hand and just doing this ?
That ’s mass .
It ’s moving you because the mass is shifting around .
That ’s only a couple of hundred rpm .
Seventy - thousand rpm .
If it ’s not perfectly balanced , it blows up , falls apart .
To be perfectly balanced , not only do you have to have precision machining throughout , you have to have ball bearings , magnets .
The Iranians do n’t have enough ball bearings and magnets that work , so when they spin these things up , they tend to pop , and when you pop open in a centrifuge , it shuts down .
They ca n’t get them running for a day , let alone a year .
Then , there ’s the problem of feeding in the gas , the uranium hexafluoride .
It ’s contaminated with a substance called molybdenum .
Molybdenum — even if you ’re just talking about a few , microscopic pieces of it — when it spins up at 70,000 rpm , develops a mass the equivalent of several kilograms .
And what happens when you have something spinning with several thousand kilograms moving around inside ?
It pops .
It blows up .
The Iranians ca n’t do it .
Everybody knows this .
Except we , the people of the United States of America , who continue to believe anything we ’re told by a media that repeats without question the assertions put forward by an administration that does n’t give a damn about disarming Iran and is only focused on regime change using the specter of a nuclear - armed Iran as an excuse .
[ Audience applauds . ]
Scheer : I do think applause is in order .
The question I have , sitting here , I ’m thinking , if you ’re so smart , why are n’t you president ?
[ Audience laughs . ]
Where did you learn all that stuff ?
In the Marines ?
Ritter : A lot of people mock the Marine Corps , and sometimes it deserves to be mocked .
Because we shave our heads they call us jarheads , and blockheads , and other terms of endearment .
The most intellectual , philosophical conversations I ’ve ever had — and I ’ve been to Harvard , I ’ve been to Yale , I ’ve been to Columbia , I ’ve been to Berkeley , etc. — are at a bar on a Friday night in a Marine Corps officer club with my fellow officers .
Because — you know what ?
— unlike your Harvard and Yale and Columbia and Berkeley students , we understand what life and death is about .
We understand what we are being committed to .
We have philosophical discussions .
We study the art of war .
We study philosophy .
And we challenge everything .
And that ’s the big thing : challenge everything .
We take nothing at face value .
Battalion commander puts out a new policy .
We sit there and we tear it apart .
“ What the hell is the old man talking about ?
That wo n’t work .
This wo n’t work . ”
We challenge because our lives depend upon it .
As an intelligence officer I was told : “ Never tell your boss what he or she wants to hear .
That ’s not your job .
Your job is to tell them what the facts are .
That ’s your job . ”
Scheer :
So what do people say to you now , privately , when you run into your old buddies .
Do they say , “ You ’ve got it right but we ca n’t speak out ” ?
Why is n’t there more dissent ?
Ritter :
It depends who they are .
I ’ll tell you , inspectors more and more are sending me e-mails , calling me up saying , “ Wow , Ritter , you were right , we were wrong .
We apologize .
We ’re on your side .
Da - da -da . ”
Military guys , they ’ve always been on my side — the ones that I know .
Again , I do n’t mean to be insulting of anybody , but there ’s three circles of people I care about : my family , my friends , and my colleagues .
And I will tell you , without exception , the people who fall into those three categories , the people who know me , the only people who know me , have been on my side 100 percent .
When you get outside of that , people who do n’t know me , they seek to project any sort of personality trait on me that they want to .
I ’m a disgruntled employee .
I ’m this , I ’m that , I ’m the other thing .
I do n’t care about what they think .
What I care about are the people who know me .
And I ’ll tell you , my colleagues in the Marine Corps , United States Army and the armed forces of the United States of America have been behind me 100 percent .
Because they knew me before I challenged the United States on Iraq .
They knew me when I was challenging the United States on the Iran - Iraq war .
They knew me when I was challenging the United States on the Soviet ballistic missile production rates .
They knew me when I was challenging the United States on claims of killing Scud missiles during the first Gulf War .
They knew that , as an intelligence officer , I brought the highest degree of integrity possible to the game .
I was n’t always right , but I never deliberately misled anybody .
Scheer : Really , what you ’re talking about is you ’re someone who ’s asked to pay the price for our folly .
That it ’s not a game , it ’s not a talk show thing , right ?
It ’s not a way of winning elections .
And yet most of the foreign policy issues that you discuss in your book and we talk about have been used as part of a game , a political game .
Hillary , for example .
I did n’t mean to single out Hillary .
She ’s not alone .
Biden takes a similar position .
There are others .
Kerry certainly took that position before he changed , and so forth .
What I get from you in reading your books , rereading some of them , is a sense of outrage .
I can only think of Kevin Tillman , Pat Tillman ’s brother , who wrote a marvelous piece before the election and truthfully said the same thing .
We put people in harm ’s way , not because we really think there ’s a national security objective , but because it ’s important to some other agenda .
I just want to know why there are n’t more Scott Ritters .
Why does n’t it drive more people crazy ?
Why are n’t more people speaking out about that ?
Ritter : I ca n’t answer that question .
I ’m very honest about who I am and what I am .
And I ’ll tell you this : I am somebody who is a true believer .
I joined the Marine Corps , I love my country , I was black - and - white about the world we lived in , I was a Reagan Republican .
I did n’t even know what being a Reagan Republican meant .
I just knew that that sounded good and that ’s what I wanted to do .
I registered Republican .
I voted Republican .
I did n’t study the candidates ; I just went into the booth and went [ making stamping motion ]
Republican , Republican , Republican , Republican , Republican , Republican .
Because I thought that ’s what good Republicans did .
I went out and did my job .
I did what I was told to do .
I did it very well .
But then I found that — as you said — you think you ’re doing something that ’s part of the greater good only to find that you ’re actually serving as a front for somebody ’s political ambition , that has nothing to do with the national security of the United States of America .
That you ’re asked to make sacrifices , or worse , if you ’re a leader , you ’re asking people who are trusting you by following you to make sacrifices .
That these guys back there are n’t willing to write the check .
Now why are n’t there more Scott Ritters ?
What does it take to cross that line ?
Americans are inherently trustful .
I was at a book - signing the other day in La Quinta in Palm Springs , and one of the guys in the audience stood up , and before he asked his question , he apologized .
He said : “ In 2003 I thought you were a nut , I thought you were crazy , I thought you were off the reservation .
I could n’t believe a word you said . ”
And he apologized .
And I said : “ There ’s no reason to apologize .
You had every right to believe that . ”
When everybody else is saying this , and you ’ve got this lone - wolf character saying something else , you have a right to be distrustful of that lone - wolf character , especially when he ’s talking about a subject that ’s not easy for you to investigate independently .
You ’re dependent upon a media that ’s feeding you for the most part disinformation .
Today I have the benefit of the doubt because everything I said turned out to be right , so I come in with a little more leverage .
But the point is that the only thing that gave me the strength to speak out in 1998 was that I was uniquely positioned by circumstances of history to have total knowledge about a very difficult subject .
Even my fellow inspectors , they did n’t have total knowledge ; they only had different pieces of the pie , and they were hesitant to commit to confronting the powers that be , because in the back of their minds they were saying , “ There ’s things I might not know . ”
And that ’s the problem .
There will always be questions in the back of the minds of most well - meaning people , that “ maybe I do n’t know something .
Maybe these guys know something more than I do .
I do n’t want to be the one who seems unpatriotic by stepping forward .
I ’m going to be trustful of the system . ”
Ladies and gentlemen , I hope we ’ve learned as American citizens that we can no longer be trustful of the system .
The system is inherently corrupt because we are not engaged .
The only way to reform the system is to invest in the system intellectually , emotionally , morally .
And we ’re not doing that .
There will be more Scott Ritters , Bob Sheers , other people .
I believe everybody in this room has it in you to do the same that I did , that you ’ve [ motioning to Robert Scheer ] done , that other people have done , if you empower yourself with knowledge and information .
But , void of that , you simply wallow in ignorance .
Scheer :
Thinking about nuclear weapons and reading your book , and the whole idea that we scare people with these things — and they are very scary . …
There ’s a certain assumption that some people can be trusted with them but others cannot , and your book sort of deals with that issue .
Because it ’s very disturbing for instance in the Mideast — well , why should Israel have it ?
And how are you going to tell these Iranians that they can’t have it ?
India , for example .
The majority of people in India think they need one .
Majority of people in Pakistan think they need one .
And when you talk about this sort of ethnocentric view , it ’s actually startling that most Americans seem to be unaware or do n’t care that we are actually the only … that the one nation we think can be most trusted with these weapons is the one nation in the world that actually used these weapons to kill large numbers of people .
[ Audience member :
That ’s right . ]
Ritter :
And more importantly , it ’s not that we used them :
We ’re the only nation out there right now that has embraced a policy of pre-emptively using nuclear weapons in a non-nuclear environment , the current nuclear posture of the Bush administration .
We ’re the only nation that does n’t view our nuclear weapons as a deterrence but rather as a viable tool of problem solving .
Hence the renaming of certain categories of weapons as usable nuclear weapons that are fully integrated into the initial strike plans of many of our military contingencies that exist today .
And what does this say ?
That old saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely is absolutely true .
Nuclear weapons give you a false sense of security .
It ’s an argument I ’ve made over and over again with the Israelis , that the nuclear weapon possessed by Israel only hastens the guarantee of Israel ’s demise .
That if Israel wants to live long - term and enjoy the fruits of peace and prosperity , they not only need to figure out how to live as co-equals with their Arab partners in the region but they need to get rid of their nuclear weapons .
Because if you own a nuclear weapon , those who oppose you will always seek to have the equivalent of it .
Iraq , when they were trying to acquire their nuclear weapon , realized it would take many years to get a nuclear weapon , and that ’s why they went very rapidly forward with chemical and biological weapons , strategic weapons that gave them equivalency of the Israeli nuclear weapon in terms of deterrence .
Look at the tracing .
We started with a nuclear bomb ; the Russians got it .
The Russians got it ; the Chinese got it to counter the Russians .
The Chinese got it ; the Indians got it .
The Indians got it ; the Pakistanis got it .
Where ’s it going to stop ?
It ’s never going to stop .
The only way to deal with nuclear weapons is to walk that dog all the way backwards to the very beginning , and it ends with nobody having nuclear weapons .
That ’s it .
[ Audience applauds . ]
Scheer :
And just so we understand what these weapons do , if that had been a primitive nuclear weapon of , say , the kind we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , in Manhattan , there would not be a Manhattan and we would n’t be having this discussion because we would n’t be having civil liberty .
So we should n’t underestimate the power of these weapons
Ritter : Both the physical power , but also the psychological power of these weapons .
Scheer : Yes , the psychological power is very real .
I remember visiting Chernobyl after that disaster and the absolute fear that gripped the scientists and the military people around there .
But going along with that line — .
So , we ’re concerned about the proliferation of weapons .
You mentioned Pakistan .
We had sanctions against Pakistan when they developed their weapon .
Those sanctions were lifted because Pakistan was needed to be an ally in the war on terror , and then it turns out , of course , as you mention in your book , the case of Khan , and you have a very lively discussion that it was the “ father of the Pakistan bomb ” who was actually the major person involved in this proliferation of this technology .
And then just yesterday , I believe , George W. Bush , President Bush , chided Pakistan for actually abandoning the war on terror in Pakistan .
The Taliban is growing , the al - Qaida , the leaders of course have not been captured .
So how do you connect this with the war on terror ?
Do you think that this president has made us any safer ?
That he ’s dealing with this in any serious way ?
Ritter :
The global war on terror is a misnomer .
You ca n’t have a global war on terror ; it ’s just impossible to do that .
The mistake we made on September 12th , one of many , was invoking war as a response to a criminal act .
I ’m not here to debate conspiracy theories on 9/11 .
I ’m going to go with my working premise , which is , we were attacked by terrorist criminals who committed a crime by hijacking four airplanes , and then committed mass murder with these weapons .
That ’s where I start : A crime was committed against America .
A crime was committed against the world .
And the appropriate response — .
Scheer : Using very primitive weapons , though .
Ritter :
In a very sophisticated way .
Scheer : Yeah .
Ritter :
It was n’t nuclear bombs ; it was airplanes .
Scheer :
But there were $ 3 knives .
Ritter : Yeah , using the box cutters and all that .
Scheer :
Which now has justified this enormous buildup of sophisticated weaponry .
But go on .
Ritter :
And also , TSA getting me to take my shoes off tonight at the airport .
The bottom line is : A crime was committed .
The appropriate response was we turn to the world as the world was willing to receive us and we say , “ We must unite in defense of the rule of law . ” [ Audience applauds . ]
That lawless elements cannot be tolerated in global society .
Instead we declared a war on terror , and what did we do ?
We became terrorists ourselves .
How do you differentiate between somebody flying an airplane into a building , killing 3,000 people , and an American bomber flying at 30,000 feet and dropping a 2,000 - pound bomb on an Afghan wedding party because we misidentify the target ?
Who ’s the terrorist ?
How do we condemn the al - Qaida operatives for sneaking across the border and blowing things up ?
Scheer :
To play devil ’s advocate here , the one was done deliberately , the other was not .
Ritter : Terrorism is terrorism .
OK , what about the MEK ?
What about the CIA funding of Baluchi operatives in Pakistan who crossed the border into Iran , blowing up a car bomb , killing Iranian revolutionary guards ?
Is that not an act of terror ?
Or is that an act of freedom fighters expressing their natural desire to do the right thing ?
The point is , the global war on terrorism is a misnomer .
We have created more harm than good .
Again , you do n’t solve a problem without defining the problem .
And what we ’ve done by reacting the way we have in Afghanistan is , we have not defeated the Taliban .
NATO is getting ready to receive a major spring offensive by the Taliban .
Al - Qaida not only was not defeated , al - Qaida has grown larger .
When we attacked al - Qaida in 2001 when we responded on their attack on us , they numbered around 8,000 operatives .
Today we ’re talking 30 - 40,000 al - Qaida operatives .
They have greater bases .
We ’ve turned Iraq into a recruiting ground of Wahhabist Islamic fundamentalism of a virulent , anti-American nature .
The world we live in is a much more dangerous place than you can possibly imagine because of George W. Bush ’s global war on terror .
The smartest thing we could do is declare victory and say it ’s over .
“ The global war on terror is over .
Done .
We win .
Now let ’s talk about bringing to justice criminals who violate the law on a massive scale . ”
And then we get the world to join us .
But by declaring a global war on terror , we ’ve empowered ourselves because this is an American , unipolar world , to do things such as the expansion of NATO . …
What does the expansion of NATO have to do with the global war on terror ?
The Russians want to know that question , because as a response to the global war on terror we ’ve not only expanded NATO , but we ’re now putting missile defense facilities in Poland and Czechoslovakia , prompting Russia to threaten to pull out of the INF treaty and build a whole new family of short - range and intermediate - range nuclear weapons armed against Europe .
So ask the Europeans how safe they feel now , threatened by Soviet nuclear missiles we were supposed to have terminated in 1987 .
No , the world is a much more dangerous place thanks to George W. Bush .

Updated The Bible may be reclassified as " indecent " in Hong Kong due to its " sexual and violent content " , Reuters reports .
That 's if the 800 or so residents who 've demanded it be restricted to over - 18s get their way , following an unholy rumpus over a sex column recently published in the Chinese University 's Student Press magazine which asked readers " whether they 'd ever fantasised about incest or bestiality " .
Cue a bit of a kerfuffle and the rapid appearance of www.truthbible.net which said that while musings on brother - on - sister and animal bothering were a bit much , the content of the Bible 's fun -filled pages " far exceeds " the Student Press shocker .
The Student Press column was subsequently judged " indecent " by the Obscene Articles Tribunal , and readers of www.truthbible.net bombarded the Television and Entertainment Licensing authority ( TELA ) with demands that God 's handbook receive similar censure .
TELA has said it 's " still undecided on whether the Bible had violated Hong Kong 's obscene and indecent articles laws " .
Local protestant minister Reverend Wu Chi-wai says not .
He offered : " If there is rape mentioned in the Bible , it does n't mean it encourages those activities .
It 's just common sense ... I do n't think that criticism will have strong support from the public . " ®
Update
TELA last night ( Sunday ) spared the Bible elevation to the top shelf , ruling the book had " not violated standards of morality , decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable members of the community " .
The statement noted : " The Bible is a religious text which is part of civilisation .
It has been passed from generation to generation . "
As many of you know , we ’re constantly tweaking and updating our web hosting page based on feedback we get from you .
Well today we ’re very excited to announce we ’re adding a new host to the page with a familiar name – Yahoo !
We ’ve been working with the Yahoo Small Business team to create a solution that gives professional bloggers exactly what they want from their hosting providers .
When we started , Yahoo asked “ What would the perfect blog host do ? ” and their team has been really amazing in executing on a really kick - ass platform for serious bloggers .
It took a little while , but slow cooking makes good eating .
( Like WordPress 2.0 ! )
We think the hosting is good for all the baseline features you should expect — tons of storage , bandwidth , Yahoo reliability , etc .
( You probably heard all about that in their Movable Type announcement last week . )
However we think they ’re worth featuring because of three key things :
With just a few clicks , Yahoo Web Hosting will install WordPress 2.0 complete with a few choice plugins and themes .
Setup one blog or two dozen in seconds .
They will also upgrade your WordPress when a new stable release or update is available , meaning it is a zero- maintenance solution on par with WordPress.com .
when a new stable release or update is available , meaning it is a zero- maintenance solution on par with WordPress.com .
Finally , every Yahoo Hosting customer gets a free Pro-Blogger Akismet license ( $ 5 / mo value ) and Akismet is auto - enabled on new installations , meaning that spam is less of an issue on Yahoo WordPress blogs .
( Much like their stellar email spam handling . )
Read more about this .
Guy Yalif from Yahoo says , “ We believe that by adding WordPress ’ blogging application to our leading web hosting product , we are providing a top notch , scalable , and reliable solution for less than $ 12 per month . ”
We think the above makes a very compelling case for WordPress users to check out Yahoo hosting , and see what we believe is the best WordPress hosting experience on the Web .
As always , if you have any feedback on Yahoo or any other host we feature , please let us know .

Gay men , blood donation and the limits of science .
I gave blood recently , and the barrage of questions asked of all donors reminded me that I 'd been meaning to write this article since June of last year .
At that time , Art Caplan wrote that it 's time to let gay men donate blood , but he did not present much solid evidence for that position .
As it happens , we can be pretty sure he is in command of considerable evidence , having served as Chair of the HHS Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability for four years , but the article was presumably written as an exercise in persuasion and contained just enough information to make me curious .
In trying to decide for myself whether Caplan is right , I found myself in something approaching the position in which I imagine legislators must regularly find themselves : I was trying to find answers to policy questions ( " should gay men be accepted as blood donors ? " ) , without being able to rely on a personal background in the relevant science .
Policy decisions have to be made , but science will rarely give you a hard - and - fast answer even to those questions on which it has something to offer -- and it becomes important to identify which questions those are , and which are not scientific questions at all .
The FDA bans blood donation by any man who has had sex with another man , even once since 1977 ( the probable date of the first clinical AIDS case in the US ) , and by anyone who has been paid for sex during the same time period ; donors are also deferred who have had sex in the last 12 months with anyone who qualifies for the since - 1977 ban .
This policy was most recently formally revised in 2000 , at which time the decision was made to stick with the 1998 recommendation ( the even - once - since - 1977 ban ) , which in turn was based on policy implemented in the late 1980s at the height of the " AIDS scare " .
One way of looking at the question is this : what change in risk could we expect to see if we changed the policy from a lifetime ban for men who have sex with men ( " MSM " ) to the same 12 - month deferral that applies to women who have had sex with such men , or men who have had sex with prostitutes ( both high - risk behaviours ) ?
Here 's where it starts to get complicated , because the risks are already so low that there is essentially no direct way to measure them , and current estimates of risk are derived from sophisticated mathematical models .
It 's tempting to do something like this :
1. MSM = approximately 2 - 3 % of the general population
2 . Of persons living with HIV / AIDS , approx 40 - 50 % are MSM
3. expected increase in donations from the policy change = approx 1 %
4. relative risk increase = ( 45/2.5 ) x 1 = 18 %
Unfortunately , though , ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) are fairly well accepted estimates taken from the references listed below , but ( 4 ) is something I just made up , and it 's nonsense .
Intuitively appealing , maybe , but nonsense .
Inter alia , what makes it nonsense is the relationship between transfusion risk and screening methods .
The primary issue here is what 's known as the " window period " , the time that can elapse between infection and detectable levels of virus .
The FDA says :
Studies have shown that up to 2 months may elapse between the time of infection and the time the HIV antibody test is reactive .
This period of time is often referred to as the " window period . "
Accepting men who have had sex with other men since 1977 as blood donors increases the likelihood for the collection of HIV - positive window period blood , because epidemiologic studies have documented higher incidence and prevalence rates in these populations .
On March 14 , 1996 , FDA recommended donor screening with a licensed test for HIV - 1 antigen , which has succeeded in further reducing the window period .
In fact , blood collection agencies now test every donation for HIV and Hepatitic C virus ( HCV ) by nucleic acid testing ( NAT ) .
This is an exquisitely sensitive test for viral genomic material ; it is more sensitive than the antibody - based test for viral antigen , and unlike the antibody test , does not rely on the host response and is not subject to the resulting delays .
According to the Red Cross :
Since 1987 , the [ HIV ] window period has been reduced from 42 days to approximately 12 - 16 days following the implementation of the HIV antigen test in March 1996 .
A variety of expert presentations at a March , 2006 FDA workshop on behaviour based donor deferrals indicated that , with the advent of NAT , the window period for HIV infection is less than 12 days .
In the US , the residual risk of transmission of HIV or HCV by blood transfusion is estimated , by a variety of models , to be around 1 in 2,000,000 donations .
This is clearly a very conservative estimate , since there are around 15 million donations every year and I could only find mention of four authenticated transfusion - related transmissions of HIV since NAT was implemented in 1999 ( none of which involved MSM ) .
At the same FDA workshop , Celso Bianco re-ran an earlier prediction using risk and other estimates that were getting general agreement at the workshop and came up with a figure , which he called conservative , of one infected unit per 32 years .
So , while it seems intuitively likely that including a high - risk group ( as judged by increased prevalence ) in the donor pool would increase overall risk , calculating -- or rather , estimating -- that increase is far from straightforward .
The only numbers I could find were presented by Andrew Dayton to the same FDA workshop :
The 5 - year [ deferral , instead of a lifetime ban ] would result in possibly a 25 percent increase in the current residual risk , and the 1 - year would be 40 percent .
So , worst case scenario : 1.4 transmissions per 2 million donations , instead of 1.0 -- or about three extra cases per year ( and remember that , to date , the observed level of transmission is much lower than the estimate ) .
I 'm not familiar with what sorts of risks are considered acceptable in public policy formation , but I can say outright that I would be prepared to accept that risk to my own person as the cost of allowing MSM to participate on a more equal footing in a profound act of community altruism .
( To say nothing of a 1 % increase in a critical health resource that is often in short supply . )
Furthermore , given that the window period is less than two weeks and you can only donate every eight weeks , there is an obvious method for reducing the risk even further .
According to the AABB , red blood cells can be stored cold for 42 days or frozen for ten years , and plasmaand cryoprecipitated antihemophilic factor can be frozen for at least a year ; of the fractions into which whole blood is routinely divided , only platelets have a shorter effective storage life , about five days .
It is clearly possible to hold ( at least most of the fractions of ) any first - time donation until the donor returns and can be re-tested ; two clear tests eight weeks apart are definitive proof of HIV - negative status .
This brings us , though , to the reason I said " more equal footing " , not " equal footing " , above .
While MSM ( as defined by the current even - once - since - 1977 FDA exclusion ) includes a great many men who have not had sex with another man for more than eight weeks , it also includes gay men for whom a 12 - month deferral , or even an eight - week deferral , represents a discriminatory barrier .
Somewhat ironically , when the Public Health Service issued its first formal recommendations in 1983 , they offered a partial solution : sexually active homosexual and bisexual men with multiple partners should refrain from blood donation .
While this leaves room for improvement in behaviour based deferral , since sexually active heterosexuals with multiple partners are also at increased risk , it would at least allow gay men in stable monogamous relationships to enter the blood donor pool .
Did you notice that we are no longer debating the science ?
Now we are talking about public policy , social justice and what sorts of risks we are willing to endure .
In that light , here 's another way to look at the question : according to the CDC , African Americans make up approximately 13 % of the US population but accounted for 49 % of new HIV / AIDS diagnoses in 2005 and 61 % of people under the age of 25 whose diagnosis of HIV / AIDS was made during 2001 – 2004 ; over the same period , black women were more than twenty times as likely to be diagnosed with HIV / AIDS as white women .
I think it goes without saying that we are not going to ban African Americans from donating blood on the basis of their ethnicity .
The FDA " believes that there is scientific justification for screening out all potential donors who are men who have had sex , even once , with another man since 1977 " .
After all that , I agree with Art Caplan : the FDA is wrong .

Like the musical Woodstock , the legend of the “ Woodstock of Physics ” grows year after year .
Twenty years ago this month , nearly 2,000 physicists crammed into a New York Hilton ballroom to hear about a breakthrough class of materials called high - temperature superconductors , which promised amazing new technologies like magnetically levitated trains .
“ It was an electrifying event , ” said Philip F. Schewe , a science writer at the American Institute of Physics who runs the news conferences at the physics meetings , then and now .
“ You wished you were there . ”
Many of the participants from the 1987 session reconvened yesterday at an American Physical Society meeting in Denver , partly to reminisce and partly to take stock of what has happened since then and what has not .
Superconductors , discovered in 1911 , carry electricity with no resistance .
Most work at temperatures below minus - 420 degrees Fahrenheit , and by the 1970s , physicists had generally concluded that that was just a chilly limit of how nature works .
It was the tail - end of a bleak November 2001 : a pall of shocked numbness hung over the country , and a rising war hysteria had nearly everyone cowed .
Americans were just beginning to pick themselves up , dust themselves off , and focus on what had happened , and how to react .
It was very early on the morning of the 23rd when , scanning the headlines , I came across a Washington Post story by John Mintz : “ 60 Israelis Detained on Tourist Visas Since Sept. 11 . ” Odd , I thought , why go after the Israelis , probably the least likely suspects ?
The subhead was even more intriguing : “ Government Calls Several Cases ‘ of Special Interest ,  Meaning Related to Post - Attacks Investigation . ”
Apparently organized groups of Israelis had been arrested , and “ dozens ” held without bond .
Inquiries to the Justice Department had yielded this response :
“ In several cases , such as those in Cleveland and St. Louis , INS officials testified in court hearings that they were ‘ of special interest to the government ,  a term that federal agents have used in many of the hundreds of cases involving mostly Muslim Arab men who have been detained around the country since the terrorist attacks .
“ An INS official who requested anonymity said the agency will not comment on the Israelis .
But he said the use of the term ‘ special interest means the case in question is ‘ related to the investigation of September 11th .  ”
It wasnt some anti-Semitic conspiracy crank sitting in his parents  basement , or Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who first linked Israeli nationals to the events of 9/11 : it was the U.S. government , specifically its law enforcement arm .
This I found utterly astonishing , because it was clear to me , at that point , that there was a link , albeit one largely unknown in its specifics .
Why else were the feds casting their nets around for Israelis rather than Arabs , Persians , and , yes , Muslims ?
There was more .
The original Post piece was updated : the number of detained Israelis had risen to 120 .
I had been following the story in this space , and noting its significance , in the weeks before Carl Cameron broadcast his famous four - part report on Fox News , which exposed the extensive Israeli spy network in this country and opened with this electric charge :
“ There is no indication that the Israelis were involved in the 9 - 11 attacks , but investigators suspect that the Israelis may have gathered intelligence about the attacks in advance , and not shared it .
A highly placed investigator said there are  quote  ‘ tie-ins . ’
But when asked for details , he flatly refused to describe them , saying ,  quote  ‘ evidence linking these Israelis to 9 - 11 is classified .
I cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered .
It ’s classified information . ' ”
The story , as it developed in the months  and years  to come , sent me down an investigative path that has yet to reach its endpoint .
What we know is this : in the months prior to 9/11 , bands of Israelis posing as “ art students ” [ . pdf ] had carried out what seemed like a coordinated probing of U.S. government facilities , including locations not known to the public .
A secret government report detailing the activities of the “ art students ”  and their background as highly trained in explosives and the art of telecommunications interception  was leaked to the media , and the story was again in the headlines .
But not for long .
This is potentially one of the most important 9/11 - related stories ever reported , and yet the number of serious investigative pieces done on it can hardly be counted on the fingers of one hand .
Antiwar.com has been following this from the outset , and you can go here for a complete archive of my columns on the subject , plus mainstream media pieces .
Of particular interest is the coverage by The Forward , the oldest newspaper of the Jewish community in North America .
They reported on one key aspect of the Israeli - 9/11 connection : the story of the five employees of a moving van company apprehended hours after the twin towers were struck .
They had been observed in Liberty State Park , New Jersey , overlooking the Hudson , with a clear view of the burning towers .
A woman had seen them from the window of her apartment building overlooking the parking lot : they came out of a white van , and they were jumping up and down , high - fiving each other with obvious glee .
Their mood , it could be said , was celebratory .
They were also filming the towers as they burned , and taking still photos .
The woman called the cops , who put out a “ be on the lookout ” alert .
Ill let Christopher Ketcham , author of a blockbuster new report appearing in Counterpunch , tell the rest of the story :
“ At 3:56 p.m. , twenty - five minutes after the issuance of the FBI BOLO , officers with the East Rutherford Police Department stopped the commercial moving van through a trace on the plates .
According to the police report , Officer Scott DeCarlo and Sgt. Dennis Rivelli approached the stopped van , demanding that the driver exit the vehicle .
The driver , 23 - year - old Sivan Kurzberg , refused and ‘ was asked several more times [ but ] appeared to be fumbling with a black leather fanny pouch type of bag .
With guns drawn , the police then ‘ physically removed 
Kurzberg , while four other men  two more men had apparently joined the group since the morning  were also removed from the van , handcuffed , placed on the grass median and read their Miranda rights .
They had not been told the reasons for their arrest .
Yet , according to DeCarlos report , ‘ this officer was told without question by the driver [ Sivan Kurzberg ] , ‘ We are Israeli .
We are not your problem .
Your problems are our problems .
The Palestinians are the problem .
Another of the five Israelis , again without prompting , told Officer DeCarlo  falsely  that ‘ we were on the West Side Highway in New York City during the incident . ' ”
This is , I believe , the most detailed account yet published of what actually happened that fateful day , and Ketcham clearly shows that the Israelis were certainly aware of why they had been stopped .
The cops practically had to drag them out of the van at gunpoint , and it is surely suspicious that they immediately starting denying any role in “ the incident . ”
How did they know they werent being stopped for a traffic violation ?
No wonder they were held for 71 days , mostly in solitary confinement , and interrogated .
Some repeatedly failed polygraph tests when questioned about possible surveillance activities .
The FBI agents who interrogated them reportedly called them “ the high - fivers , ” because of their odd behavior at Liberty State Park .
The Forward confirmed that the company they ostensibly worked for , Urban Moving Systems , of Weehawken , New Jersey , was in all likelihood a Mossad front .
Dominik Suter , the owner , fled to Israel the day after a police raid on his office .
The five detained Israelis were sent back to Israel , where they claimed to be innocent victims of harassment .
Here they are on an Israeli talk show .
Of course they dont mention any of the above , or that they were found to have multiple passports in their possession , along with $ 4,700 stuffed in a sock and maps of New York City highlighted in certain spots .
Ketcham quotes one local law enforcement official as saying
“ It looked like they re hooked in with this , it looked like they knew what was going to happen when they were at Liberty State Park . ”
Ketcham , utilizing the public record , news reports , and his own sources , has painted the clearest portrait yet of the “ urban mover ” Mossad cell , and how they shadowed the five hijackers who took over American Airlines flight 77 , which struck the Pentagon to such devastating effect .
Living , working , and socializing within a six - mile radius of Bergen County , these two groups circled each other until , on 9/11 , as a dark pall fell over Manhattan and much of the rest of the world , one applauded the others handiwork .
Ketchams story of how the FBI investigation was scotched by high - ups ought to outrage every patriotic American citizen .
He cites a source at ABC News  which covered this story on 20/20 in a treatment I consider a whitewash  as saying “ They feel the higher echelons torpedoed the investigation into the Israeli New Jersey cell .
Leads were not fully investigated . ”
The same source agrees with the general assessment of CIA officers , and intelligence experts such as James Bamford and Vincent Cannistraro , that Urban Moving Systems was a covert Israeli intelligence - gathering operation , most likely engaged in electronic interception and other means of spying on radical elements within Northern New Jerseys Muslim milieu .
In the course of this , and given their geographical proximity , it is not beyond reason to posit that the Urban Movers were watching the future hijackers , listening to their phone conversations , reading their emails , and otherwise keeping fully apprised of their activities .
What made the Israelis jump for joy , as one counterintelligence officer is said to have put it , is that “ The Israelis felt that in some way their intelligence had worked out  i.e. , they were celebrating their own acumen and ability as intelligence agents . ”
The story of how this line of investigation was suppressed , both in the law enforcement community and in the media , is a saga in itself .
I know that Ketcham worked on this story long and hard , and had supposedly firm commitments from both Salon.com and The Nation to publish his work .
Both projects were killed at the last minute , in one case an hour before it was scheduled to run .
What s particularly stupid , in the case of Salon , is that they ran his previous piece , on the “ Israeli Art Student Mystery , ” years ago  and now refuse to follow up their own story .
As for why the government investigation into the Israeli connection was scotched , Ketcham cites a former CIA counter - terrorism officer : “ There was no question but that [ the order to close down the investigation ] came from the White House . ”
I have to tell you that it hasnt been easy following this story over the years .
I was told in the beginning , and in no uncertain terms , that this line of investigation is forbidden , that its “ too hot to handle , ” and , implicitly , that the truth and the facts have to take second place to political correctness .
To even mention this story , in certain quarters , is considered prima facie evidence of anti-Semitism .
Case closed .
In spite of a determined effort on the part of some to redefine anti-Semitism to constrain critics of Israeli government actions , there is an equally determined pushback  a real movement to treat Israel as a nation like any other .
That is , as a nation with its own interests , which , if truth be told , it pursues aggressively , and not only in the occupied territories and Lebanon , but also right here in the U.S .
The story of Israels underground army in America  and its foreknowledge of the 9/11 terrorist attacks  is based on facts , not fantasies , and it has nothing whatsoever to do with anti-Semitism  and everything to do with establishing the full context of the worst terrorist attack in our history .
9/11 was the opening shot of a battle we are still fighting to this day , as our soldiers fall in Iraq , and the hints of a new front in our endless “ war on terrorism ” 
Iran  are hardly subtle .
That signal event launched the war hysteria that has only lately begun to peter out .
One of the major reasons why the public has turned against the Iraq war has been the revelation that the “ intelligence ” we acquired about Iraqs alleged “ weapons of mass destruction ” was manipulated , cherry - picked , and outright falsified in order to make the case for the invasion .
If it turns out that the Israelis really did know  that they picked up “ chatter ” from the groups they were watching , and gained fairly detailed knowledge of the hijackers  plans  it will alter how we think about 9/11 , and change our perception of the perpetual war that ensued .
Go here to order the Ketcham piece , which is not yet online .
You can only get it on dead - tree , but , believe me , it s worth it .
[ Editor ’s note : Ketcham ’s piece is now online . ]
And , while you re doling out cash , remember the Antiwar.com fundraising drive is going into high gear .
I wont tout our fearlessness in covering this controversial story all these years , because the record speaks for itself , and far more eloquently than any sales pitch .
In a era when the “ mainstream ” media has failed , and failed miserably , Antiwar.com is nt a luxury  its a necessity .
You know you ought to contribute today  so , go ahead , do it .

KUCINICH SEEKS CHENEY IMPEACHMENT ; AMERICANS TO RALLY NATIONWIDE ON SATURDAY
NEW YORK , N.Y. , April 23 , 2007 – Following on today ’s announcement by Rep .
Dennis Kucinich that he will file Articles of Impeachment against
Vice - President Dick Cheney , Americans across the country will take to the
streets on April 28 to call for the impeachment of both Cheney and Bush .
From Miami , Florida to North Pole , Alaska , more than 100 actions are planned
nationwide .
Jacob Park , National Coordinator of the April 28 actions , said “ George Bush
and Dick Cheney lied the nation into an illegal war of aggression , are
spying on millions of innocent Americans , and have authorized the use of
torture .
The time has come for all Americans ” ” - particularly our
representatives in Congress ” ” - to decide where they stand .
To turn a blind eye to
lying , spying , and torture makes a mockery of our most basic values and the
very notion of democracy . ”
On April 28 , a visit by George Bush to Miami will be greeted with a massive
impeachment rally organized by dozens of local groups .
At the California
Democratic Convention in San Diego , hundreds of delegates will defy the
party leadership by bringing an impeachment resolution to the floor .
Thousands of Americans will form “ human murals ” spelling out “ IMPEACH ! ” with
their bodies at Ocean Beach in San Francisco , Coney Island in New York , the
foot of the Washington monument in Washington , D.C. , and other locations .
And elsewhere people will spell it out in myriad other ways ranging from
banners drops on freeway overpasses to a skywriting plane over the New
Orleans Jazzfest to a guerrilla impeachment slideshow on the buildings of
New York City .
The coordination of the April 28 nationwide impeachment actions has relied
heavily on new Web 2.0 internet technologies , including ImpeachSpace.com , a
new social network created by the organizers to build a community around the
issue of impeachment .
For a complete list of actions scheduled for April 28 , please see

After all this hype around C# 3.0 where we will get LINQ , lambda expressions and many other thing I thought that it would be useful to have a deeper look at functional programming languages like F#. At Microsoft quite many people are fond of the Functional Programming style which did influence the design of C# 3.0 .
Many language architects there have Haskell background which could explain the renaissance of these " old " concepts .
So what 's the deal with the functional approach ?
It does basically force you to think in a twisted way where the problem is straight solved by calling a function which does call another function and so on .
Lets assume that you want to get the list of all members of all types which are contained in the assemblies that are currently loaded into your AppDomain ( to look at the problem this way is the twisted part ) you could write for example in F# simply :
// Assign allMembers the result of our " calculation "
let all Members = System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies ()
|> Array.to_list |> List.map ( fun a -> a.GetTypes ( ) ) |> Array.concat
|> Array.to_list |> List.map ( fun ty -> ty.GetMembers ( ) ) |> Array.concat
// Print them out
do Array.foreach allMembers ( fun memberInfo -> printf "
%s " memberInfo .
Name )
If you want to understand what this little code fragment really does and how it can be rewritten I recommend the post from Robert .
A more comprehensible version in C# code would look like this :
public List< MemberInfo> GetAllMembers ( ) { Assembly [ ] all Assemblies = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies ( ) ; List < Type > all Types = new List < Type >( ) ; foreach ( Assembly assembly in all Assemblies ) { all Types.AddRange(assembly.GetTypes ( ) ) ; } List < MemberInfo > all Members = new List < MemberInfo >( ) ; foreach ( Type t in all Types ) { all Members .
AddRange ( t.GetMembers ( ) ) ; } return allMembers ; }
You see much more lines to write but in a way that ( most ) people can understand in shorter time .
Let 's rewrite it in a more functional way with C# 2.0 , it does already provide some functional features ( anonymous delegates , iterators , coroutines = yield ) today :
public List< MemberInfo> GetFunctionMembers ( ) { List < MemberInfo > all Members = new List < MemberInfo >( ) ; Array .ForEach ( AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies ( ) , delegate ( Assembly assembly ) { Array.ForEach( assembly .GetTypes( ) , delegate ( Type type ) { all Members.
AddRange(type.GetMembers ( ) ) ; } ) ; } ) ; return allMembers ; }
Anonymous delegates and the new static Array functions are very nifty features in .NET 2.0 that allow a compact functional style programming already today .
The same ForEach , .. constructs are also available for generic Lists as instance functions .
New Array ( generic list ) Helper Functions Of .NET 2.0
The following table does contain the new static array helper functions which are also available as instance functions of generic lists .
Array Function / Delegate Explanation F# Counterpart delegate void Action <T >( T obj )
Action delegate used by some Array helper functions .
Does not return anything .
- delegate bool Predicate <T >( T obj )
Predicate delegate which is used by some array helper functions .
Does return true if the input element does match something .
- delegate int Comparison < T >( T x , T y ) Comparison delegate which is used by Array .
Sort .
Return
negative if x < y
0 if x = y
positive if x > y - ReadOnlyCollection <T> AsReadOnly <T >
( T[ ] array ) Returns a read only collection wrapper of the input collection .
- ConstrainedCopy (
sourceArray ,
sourceIndex ,
destinationArray ,
destinationIndex ,
length
) Generic copy where you can copy only parts of an array to another location inside another array .
- TOutput [ ] ConvertAll < TInput , TOutput > (
TInput [ ] array ,
< TInput , TOutput > converter
) Apply a conversion function to all members of the input array and return the converted array values as new array .
Array.map bool Exists < T > (
T[ ] array ,
Predicate < T> match
) Return true if the called Predicate delegate did return true for an array element .
Array.exists T Find < T > (
T[ ] array ,
Predicate < T> match
)
Return the first matching element when the Predicate delegate does return true for an array element .
Array.find T[ ]
FindAll < T > (
T[ ] array ,
Predicate < T> match
) Return an array with all matching elements for which the Predicate delegate did return true .
Array .
filter T FindLast < T > (
T[ ] array ,
Predicate < T> match
)
Return the last matching element for which the Predicate delegate did return true .
- void ForEach < T > (
T[ ] array ,
Action < T> action
) Execute the Action delegate for every element of the array .
Array.map void Resize < T > (
ref T [ ] array ,
int newSize
)
Finally you can resize an array !
But keep in mind that a new array of the specified size is created and the elements are copied into the new one .
- void Sort < T > (
T[ ] array ,
Comparison < T> comparison
)
Sort the array according to the comparison results of the supplied Comparison delegate .
Array.sort bool TrueForAll < T > (
T[ ] array ,
Predicate < T> match
) Return true if for all array elements the Predicate delegate does return true .
Array.

C# Function / Delegate Call Performance
As you can see you do not have to wait until C# 3.0 to program ( nearly ) functional style with .
NET 2.0 .
Of course F# has many more functions to offer but the list of C# is growing .
This functional thing C# with delegates and anonymous methods is nice .
But how does it perform ?
I did some measurements which did compare how much one integer add operation ( + one integer array access ) is slowed down when we take into account the function calling overhead .
I did take the numbers from my P4 with 3,0 GHz .
The blue bars of this diagram is the time needed for our work ( integer add ) and the red part is the associated overhead .
As we can see here the delegate call is only 20 % slower than a normal ( not inlined ) function call which is quite impressive .
This is what I would expect after reading Eric Gunnersons very good article about this topic .
What is surprising is that there is no difference of a virtual function call compared to a not inlined function call .
The penalty we pay here is that the JITer is not able to inline a virtual function call whereas my " normal " function would have been inlined if I did not prevent it by adding the
[ MethodImpl( MethodImplOptions .
NoInlining ) ]
attribute above the function .
By the way the generated IL code for a " normal " function call and a virtual function call is the same : " callvirt " instruction .
Why is for every function call a virtual function call IL opcode emitted by the C# compiler ?
Answer : Runtime safety .
The C# team did decide to use callvirt for every function call because it does add an additional null check if the object we are calling into is null .
If it is null a NullReferenceException is thrown .
We could use a normal " call " then no exception would be thrown but we will break somewhere inside the function when the ( still null ) this pointer is needed to dereference e.g. a member variable .
Caching The C# Way
A very practical example of caching is the following scenario .
Suppose you have a function that is costly and does generate from some input value /s an an output value which takes a long time to calculate / create ( e.g. a database connection when the connection string is the input ) .
You want to speed up things for some colleagues which do open the database connection at every database server access just because it is so easy to do .
To make caching happen a wrapper around the costly function is needed which does return the already created database connection when it was opened already .
Since I am dealing in my blog very often with the Enterprise Library I use here the Caching Application Block of course ;-) .
To cache a function of the form SqlConnection CreateConnection ( string connString ) you need to write only one additional line of code :
Function < string , SqlConnection > CachedConnection = FunctionCacher.EntlibFuncCacher<string , SqlConnection >( CreateConnection ) ; SqlConnection cachedConn = CachedConnection ( " connection String " ) ;
using System ; using System .
Collections .
Generic ; using System .
Text ; using Microsoft .
Practices.EnterpriseLibrary .Caching ; using Microsoft .
Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.Common.Configuration ;
public static Function < TParam , TReturn > EntlibFuncCacher < TParam , TReturn >( Function < TParam , TReturn > func ) { CacheManagerFactory factory = new CacheManagerFactory ( ConfigurationSourceFactory .Create ( ) ) ; CacheManager cache = factory .
CreateDefault ( ) ; return delegate ( TParam arg ) { TReturn result = default ( TReturn ) ; string key = arg .
GetHashCode ( ) . ToString ( ) ; if ( cache.
Contains ( key ) ) { result = ( TReturn ) cache .
GetData( key ) ; } else { result = func ( arg ) ; cache .
Add(key , result ) ; } return result ; } ; }
The code above does wrap the original delegate into a new one which does first check if the result of the function has been computed before .
If yes the cached value is returned otherwise the costly operation is performed , the result put into the cache and returned to the caller .
This caching function was inspired by Sriram Krishan very good article : Lisp is sin .
Sriram does use in his function a simple hash table which is very fast but will sooner or later overflow your memory .
The Enterprise Library Caching Application Block allows us to upgrade to a real caching solution .
Caching the F# Way
Let 's see if the F# version can do it better :
#r @ "< YourPathToit >\Microsoft.Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.Common.dll " ; ;
#r @ "< YourPathToit >\Microsoft.Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.Caching.dll " ; ;
open System
open Microsoft .
Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.Common.Configuration
open Microsoft .Practices.EnterpriseLibrary .Caching
let CacheFunction f =
let source = ConfigurationSourceFactory .
Create ( ) in //
Get configuration
let CacheFactory = new CacheManagerFactory ( source ) in // Create Cache Factory
let Cache = CacheFactory.CreateDefault ( ) in //
Get configured default cache from Entlib
// define a new function that takes an arbitrary type as input argument
fun ( x ) ->
(
let strKey = sprintf " %d " ( hash x ) in // get ( hopefully ) unique hash value
if ( Cache.Contains ( strKey ) ) then // check if the cache does already contain it
(
unbox ( Cache.GetData(strKey ) ) // unbox ( static cast to return type of f( x ) ) and return the cached object
)
else // otherwise calculate result of original function and store it in cache
(
let result = f x in // do lengthy calculation
Cache.Add(strKey , result ) ; // store result in cache
result // return calculated result
)
)
////////////////////////////
// Usage of CacheFunction
////////////////////////////
let TestFunc ( x:string ) = String .
Format ( " New Value : { 0} " , x ) //
This is our function we want to cache
let CachedFunc = CacheFunction TestFunc // create cached function
The F# version is a bit shorter and contains more comments than the F# version .
Apart from this it does look similar except for the nicer anonymous function definition which does not result in the creation of an anonymous delegate .
It is educational to see what Reflector thinks about our F# version when he does translate it back to C# code .
The CacheFunction does create the local variables as expected and passes it to the F# version of an anonymous delegate class which does not derive from MultiCastDelegate .
public static FastFunc<A , B> CacheFunction <A , B>( FastFunc<A , B > f )
{
IConfigurationSource source1 = ConfigurationSourceFactory .
Create ( ) ;
CacheManager manager1 = new CacheManagerFactory ( source1 ) .
CreateDefault ( ) ;
return new File1.CacheFunction@14<A , B > ( f , manager1 ) ;
}
public CacheFunction@14 ( FastFunc<A , B> f0 , CacheManager Cache0 )
{
this .f0 = f0 ;
this .
Cache0 = Cache0 ;
}
public override B Invoke( A x )
{
// calculate hash code of x and stringify it
string text1 = Pervasives.sprintf<FastFunc<int , string >>(( PrintfPrimitives .
Format4 < FastFunc<int , string > , Unit , string , string >)
new PrintfPrimitives .Format4 < FastFunc<int , string > , Unit , string , string >( " %d " , ( FastFunc< object , FastFunc<int , string > >)
new File1.strKey@16 ( ) ) ) .
Invoke ( Pervasives.hash < A >( x ) ) ;
if ( this .Cache0.Contains ( text1 ) )
{
return Pervasives.unbox <B >( this .Cache0.GetData( text1 ) ) ; // return cached value
}
B local1 = this .
f0 . Invoke(x ) ; // call original function
this .
Cache0 . Add( text1 , ( object ) local1 ) ; // add it to the cache
return local1 ; // return calculated result
}
public static A Microsoft .
FSharp.MLLib.Pervasives.unbox<A>( object x )
{
return ( A ) x ;
}
Curried Functions F# / C#
Each F# delegate receives the local variables via reference so he can access the variables of the outer function .
The Invoke method does contain our actual caching logic which we did write inside our anonymous function .
What I found interesting is that the F# unbox command is nothing else than our good old static cast .
Things are falling into places at last .
In functional languages it is common to create for a function f( x , y , z , ... ) some helper functions g( x=0 , y , z , ... ) which do call f with some default argument ( x=0 in the case of g ) .
This feature does remind me quite strong to default function arguments in C ++.
Of course there is more to it since in a functional language the parameter itself can be a function which is exchanged at runtime to support e.g. different sorting algorithms quite easy .
In F # it is easy to define a function calc which does add the input arguments ( thanks for the comments DeeJ , I am still learning ) .
The trick is that the argument can be anything even another function which does return the correct type .
You can try this code sample with fsi.exe the F# interpreter .
> let calc x y = x + y ; ;
Now we can curry the List.map function with our calc function which does add to every element 2 .
> let List.map ( calc 2 ) [ 1 ; 2;3 ] ; ;
If we execute the curried function we will get the desired result :
val it : int list = [ 3 ; 4 ; 5 ]
Another example of function currying the the Array.map function which is the same as the Array .
ConvertAll function .
Let 's compare the two :
Expected Output :
SOME
LOWERCASE
WORDS
F# version :
let someArray = [ | " some " ; " lowercase " ; " words " | ]
let ToUpperArray ( inArr ) = inArr |> Array.map ( fun y -> y. ToUpper ( ) )
let bigArray = ToUpperArray ( someArray )
do bigArray |> Array.foreach ( fun x -> printf "
%s " x )
Lists are immutable in F# and defined by [ " aaa " ; bb " ] .
This notation is rather confusing for beginners since I expect this definition to be the definition of an array .
Mutable arrays are defined by using the [ | | ] notation which allows us to use them in the old fashioned way .
Thanks for Don pointing this out .
To declare an anonymous ( unnamed ) function we can use the fun keyword to supply a conversion function for the array .
In the next line we call our ToUpperFunction which does execute on all element 's of the array the anonymous functions .
After that we are ready to print the converted array to the console .
C# version :
static public string [ ] ToUpperArray ( string [ ] arr ) { return Array .
ConvertAll < string , string >( arr , delegate ( string input ) { return input .
ToUpper ( ) ; } ) ; } static public void DoArrayStuff ( ) { string [ ] someArray = { " some " , " lowercase " , " words " } ; string [ ] upperCaseArray = ToUpperArray ( someArray ) ; // print them out Array .
ForEach < string >( upperCaseArray , delegate ( string input ) { Console. WriteLine ( " {0} " , input ) ; } ) ; }
Even with the anonymous delegates syntax we have much more overhead when we need to define a new function in C# .
This time the F# version does win the price for the shorter and more concise ( aka ) readable code .
Speed is another thing I did not yet measure because it is not fair to compare a released product against a research language .
Please note that anonymous delegates do create a new delegate instance inside your method where you define them .
If e.g. the ToUpperArray method is called very often with small arrays the cost for the creation of the delegate instance must be considered .
Normally it is a better idea to create the delegate the old fashioned way as a member variable of your class instance .
Coroutines in C #
This extension of the traditional function is in its most general form perhaps a bit too much for most programmers since it does violate nearly every programming principle like encapsulation and information hiding .
C# 2.0 does provide this feature by adding the yield keyword , although in a very limited form as enumerator .
Note :
You must use yield return xxx ; in C# since this way no pre C# 2.0 code was broken if somebody did use the reserved yield keyword despite better knowledge .
In a foreach loop the following things happen :
Get the Enumerator via the IEnumerable < T > interface of the the input object .
Call MoveNext on the enumerator and store the current value of T in a local variable .
The code inside the foreach loop can use the populated local variable now .
Call Dispose on the enumerator .
The following sample does illustrate this behavior :
Expected Output :
Int : 1
Int : 2
Int : 3
public IEnumerable < int > EnumInt ( ) { yield return 1 ; yield return 2 ; yield return 3 ; } public void IterateWithForEach ( ) { foreach ( int i in EnumInt ( ) ) { Console .
WriteLine ( " Int : { 0} " , i ) ; } } public void IterateByHand ( ) { IEnumerator < int > iterator = EnumInt ( ) . GetEnumerator ( ) ; int i ; while ( iterator. MoveNext ( ) ) { i = iterator .
Current ; Console .
WriteLine ( " Int : { 0} " , i ) ; } iterator .
Dispose ( ) ; }
The yield return statement is executed n- times where the function is entered in the same state as it was left of the previous yield return statement .
This powerful feature does allow you to write goto's in a much nicer way ;-) .
You can do anything in your function you would like to .
The most useful things I can imagine are
Smart collections where you supply helper enumerators that enumerate e.g. in alphabetical order plus a filter over you string array .
Start asynchronous operations on each element of a collection and return the delegate that will finish its work later .
Usage in algorithms
...
Coroutines C# Example
Google has created a small but powerful web service called Google API where you can query for search results for check phrases for spelling errors .
This is an excellent opportunity to put our new knowledge about coroutines at work .
The scenario is for example a word editor where you underline the wrong words with red color .
Since spell checking is expensive we want to do it asynchronously so the user can continue with his work without any interruption .
Put an array of phrases into a spell checker
Get the corrected phrases back not necessarily in the order they were given .
To achieve this " not necessarily in the order they were given " part we use asynchronous I/O with delegates to call the Google web service for each phrase and collect the responses asynchronously .
Each corrected phrase is then put along with the original phrase into an array that can be queried by an external call in a synchronous way .
We do only block as long as one response from Google is collected and return it immediately .
The consumer of our SpellChecker can call us synchronously :
public void Spellchecker ( ) { string [ ] phrases = { " seperate pece " , " no hype " , " micosoft " } ; foreach ( KeyValuePair < string , string > result in GetCorrectedPhrases ( phrases ) ) { Console .
WriteLine ( " Phrase : {0} becomes { 1} " , result .
Key , result .Value ) ; } }
Expected Output :
Phrase : no hype becomes no hype
Phrase : seperate pece becomes separate peace
Phrase : micosoft becomes microsoft
The infrastructure behind this real world example is a little longer
GoogleSearchService myGoogle = new GoogleSearchService ( ) ; // .NET powered by Google ;-) public KeyValuePair < string , string > GetCorrectSpelling ( string phrase ) { // do the Google spell check synchronously string newphrase = myGoogle.doSpellingSuggestion(licenseKey , phrase ) ; if ( String. IsNullOrEmpty( newphrase ) ) newphrase = phrase ; //
Key is the original phrase , Value is the googled phrase KeyValuePair < string , string > ret = new KeyValuePair < string , string >( phrase , newphrase ) ; return ret ; } delegate KeyValuePair < string , string > SpellingCheck ( string phrase ) ; IEnumerable < KeyValuePair < string , string > > GetCorrectedPhrases ( string [ ] phrases ) { SpellingCheck checker = GetCorrectSpelling ; // Create delegate instance int PendingSpells = 0 ; // +1 for each request , - 1 for each completed request // Results are collected as pairs where key is the old phrase and value the checked one List < KeyValuePair < string , string >> results = new List < KeyValuePair < string , string >>( ) ; foreach ( string phrase in phrases ) //
Start spell checking for all phrases at once -> very scalable { System .
Threading .
Interlocked .Increment( ref PendingSpells ) ; // Invoke Spell checker delegate asynchronously checker .
BeginInvoke ( phrase , delegate ( IAsyncResult ar ) // put callback into our function too { // Retrieve the delegate .
SpellingCheck caller = ( Spelling Check ) ar .
AsyncState ; // Call EndInvoke to retrieve the results .
lock ( checker ) { results .
Add(caller.EndInvoke( ar ) ) ; } System .
Threading .Interlocked .Decrement ( ref PendingSpells ) ; } , checker ) ; } // collect data from asynchronously called delegates in the order they finish while ( PendingSpells != 0 || results .
Count != 0 ) { if ( results .
Count > 0 ) { // the delegates delegates modify the collection from another thread // we must synchronize here lock ( checker ) { foreach ( KeyValuePair < string , string > result in results ) { yield return result ; // return available result } results .
Clear ( ) ; // remove returned results } } System .
Threading .
Thread .
Sleep ( 50 ) ; // wait until the next phrase comes from google } }
This little example shows the true power of anonymous delegates in combination with asynchronous I/O and the resulting scalable solution which can be found in true Enterprise Applications which use the .NET platform .
I hope Microsoft will forgive me when I used the Google API web service for this demo ;-) .
Conclusions
Many concepts originated from functional programming languages are already alive in C# 2.0 which enables a feature rich way of programming .
F# has some interesting ideas ( type inference , increased thread safety , ... ) which will soon be available to all sharper 's in the future , I hope .
Not all concepts of functional languages should be explored by Mort and Elvis since most of them are fairly complex to understand because functional languages are very picky ( just like unix ) who will become be their friend and who not .
If Einstein does write a F# program then only a true Einstein can maintain it .
When the outsourced Mort and Elvis do change his code I am sure they will screw it up .
My first steps with F# ( I am still a beginner ) have been a little frustrating since the F# compiler does not give me useful compiler error messages .
But once I was more into the syntax it did become easier .
I hope you did enjoy this C# biased introduction into the world of functional programming languages .

On Friday Obama gave a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) in Chicago .
It had been much anticipated in American Jewish political circles which buzzed about his intensive efforts to woo wealthy pro-Israel campaign donors who up to now have generally leaned towards his main rival Senator Hillary Clinton .
Reviewing the speech , Ha’aretz Washington correspondent Shmuel Rosner concluded that Obama “ sounded as strong as Clinton , as supportive as Bush , as friendly as Giuliani .
At least rhetorically , Obama passed any test anyone might have wanted him to pass .
So , he is pro-Israel .
Period . ”
Israel is “ our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy , ” Obama said , assuring his audience that “ we must preserve our total commitment to our unique defense relationship with Israel by fully funding military assistance and continuing work on the Arrow and related missile defense programs . ”
Such advanced multi-billion dollar systems he asserted , would help Israel “ deter missile attacks from as far as Tehran and as close as Gaza . ”
As if the starved , besieged and traumatized population of Gaza are about to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles .
Obama offered not a single word of criticism of Israel , of its relentless settlement and wall construction , of the closures that make life unlivable for millions of Palestinians .
There was no comfort for the hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza who live in the dark , or the patients who cannot get dialysis , because of what Israeli human rights group B’Tselem termed “ one cold , calculated decision , made by Israel ’s prime minister , defense minister , and IDF chief of staff ” last summer to bomb the only power plant in Gaza , ” a decision that “ had nothing to do with the attempts to achieve [ the ] release [ of a captured soldier ] nor any other military need . ”
It was a gratuitous war crime , one of many condemned by human rights organizations , against an occupied civilian population who under the Fourth Geneva Convention Israel is obligated to protect .
Michelle Obama , then Illinois state senator Barack Obama , Edward Said and Mariam Said at a May 1998 Arab community event in Chicago .
B’T
But Obama was not entirely insensitive to ordinary lives .
He recalled a January 2006 visit to the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona that resembled an ordinary American suburb where he could imagine the sounds of Israeli children at “ joyful play just like my own daughters . ”
He saw a home the Israelis told him was damaged by a Hizbullah rocket ( no one had been hurt in the incident ) .
Six months later , Obama said , “ Hizbullah launched four thousand rocket attacks just like the one that destroyed the home in Kiryat Shmona , and kidnapped Israeli service members . ”
Obama ’s phrasing suggests that Hizbullah launched thousands of rockets in an unprovoked attack , but it ’s a complete distortion .
Throughout his speech he showed a worrying propensity to present discredited propaganda as fact .
As anyone who checks the chronology of last summer ’s Lebanon war will easily discover , Hizbullah only launched lethal barrages of rockets against Israeli towns and cities after Israel had heavily bombed civilian neighborhoods in Lebanon killing hundreds of civilians , many fleeing the Israeli onslaught .
Obama excoriated Hizbullah for using “ innocent people as shields . ”
Indeed , after dozens of civilians were massacred in an Israeli air attack on Qana on July 30 , Israel “ initially claimed that the military targeted the house because Hezbollah fighters had fired rockets from the area , ” according to an August 2 statement from Human Rights Watch .
The statement added : “ Human Rights Watch researchers who visited Qana on July 31 , the day after the attack , did not find any destroyed military equipment in or near the home .
Similarly , none of the dozens of international journalists , rescue workers and international observers who visited Qana on July 30 and 31 reported seeing any evidence of Hezbollah military presence in or around the home .
Rescue workers recovered no bodies of apparent Hezbollah fighters from inside or near the building . ”
The Israelis subsequently changed their story , and neither in Qana , nor anywhere else did Israel ever present , or international investigators ever find evidence to support the claim Hizbullah had a policy of using civilians as human shields .
In total , forty - three Israeli civilians were killed by Hizbullah rockets during the thirty - four day war .
For every Israeli civilian who died , over twenty - five Lebanese civilians were killed by indiscriminate Israeli bombing — over one thousand in total , a third of them children .
Even the Bush administration recently criticized Israel ’s use of cluster bombs against Lebanese civilians .
But Obama defended Israel ’s assault on Lebanon as an exercise of its “ legitimate right to defend itself . ”
There was absolutely nothing in Obama ’s speech that deviated from the hardline consensus underpinning US policy in the region .
Echoing the sort of exaggeration and alarmism that got the United States into the Iraq war , he called Iran “ one of the greatest threats to the United States , to Israel , and world peace . ”
While advocating “ tough ” diplomacy with Iran he confirmed that “ we should take no option , including military action , off the table . ”
He opposed a Palestinian unity government between Hamas and Fatah and insisted “ we must maintain the isolation of Hamas ” until it meets the Quartet ’s one - sided conditions .
He said Hizbullah , which represents millions of Lebanon ’s disenfranchised and excluded , “ threatened the fledgling movement for democracy ” and blamed it for “ engulf[ing ] that entire nation in violence and conflict . ”
Over the years since I first saw Obama speak I met him about half a dozen times , often at Palestinian and Arab - American community events in Chicago including a May 1998 community fundraiser at which Edward Said was the keynote speaker .
In 2000 , when Obama unsuccessfully ran for Congress I heard him speak at a campaign fundraiser hosted by a University of Chicago professor .
On that occasion and others Obama was forthright in his criticism of US policy and his call for an even - handed approach to the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
The last time I spoke to Obama was in the winter of 2004 at a gathering in Chicago ’s Hyde Park neighborhood .
He was in the midst of a primary campaign to secure the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate seat he now occupies .
But at that time polls showed him trailing .
As he came in from the cold and took off his coat , I went up to greet him .
He responded warmly , and volunteered , “ Hey , I ’m sorry I have n’t said more about Palestine right now , but we are in a tough primary race .
I ’m hoping when things calm down I can be more up front . ”
He referred to my activism , including columns I was contributing to the The Chicago Tribune critical of Israeli and US policy , “ Keep up the good work ! ”
But Obama ’s gradual shift into the AIPAC camp had begun as early as 2002 as he planned his move from small time Illinois politics to the national scene .
In 2003 , Forward reported on how he had “ been courting the pro-Israel constituency . ”
He co-sponsored an amendment to the Illinois Pension Code allowing the state of Illinois to lend money to the Israeli government .
Among his early backers was Penny Pritzker — now his national campaign finance chair — scion of the liberal but staunchly Zionist family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain .
( The Hyatt Regency hotel on Mount Scopus was built on land forcibly expropriated from Palestinian owners after Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 ) .
He has also appointed several prominent pro-Israel advisors .

If disappointing , given his historically close relations to Palestinian - Americans , Obama ’s about - face is not surprising .
He is merely doing what he thinks is necessary to get elected and he will continue doing it as long as it keeps him in power .
Palestinian - Americans are in the same position as civil libertarians who watched with dismay as Obama voted to reauthorize the USA Patriot Act , or immigrant rights advocates who were horrified as he voted in favor of a Republican bill to authorize the construction of a 700 - mile fence on the border with Mexico .
Only if enough people know what Obama and his competitors stand for , and organize to compel them to pay attention to their concerns can there be any hope of altering the disastrous course of US policy in the Middle East .
It is at best a very long - term project that cannot substitute for support for the growing campaign of boycott , divestment and sanctions needed to hold Israel accountable for its escalating violence and solidifying apartheid .

I ’ve been watching the reactions to Ann Coulter ’s now infamous f-word remark around the Internet and media .
Predictably the neocons are claiming that us liberals are being hypocrites and denying Coulter her right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment .
They could n’t be more wrong .
Coulter went on Fox News to downplay her remark saying it was nothing more than a " schoolyard taunt . "
I ’ll continue using Coulter ’s analogy to illustrate my point .
Suppose my friends and I are hanging out on the schoolyard .
My particular clique is called , oh I do n’t know , let ’s say " the reds . "
Across the playground is another clique hanging out called " the blues . "
I decide that I do n’t like one of the blues named Suzy , so I make a remark calling her a f*** ing c**t .
Now do I have the right to call Suzy that , no matter how crass it is ?
Absolutely .
It ’s guaranteed to me under the First Amendment .
Does Suzy and her friends the blues have a right to get mad about what I called her ?
Absolutely .
Can Suzy and her friends tell another group of kids , " the greens , " what I said about her and suggest that the greens not play with me anymore ?
Absolutely .
Can the blues tell the rest of the reds that if they do n’t want to be thought of as supporting that crude remark about Suzy that they should tell me what I did was n’t cool ?
Absolutely .
When the greens and some of my fellow reds stop playing with me , has my right to free speech been silenced ?
Absolutely not , and that ’s where the neocons are trying to confuse people .
What Coulter and her neocon cronies need to realize is that while they have the right to free speech and they can make whatever stupid , offensive remarks they want , there are still consequences for doing so .
If you preach hate , and you get people hating you in return , do n’t be surprised .
Coulter and friends need to grow up and accept responsibility for their actions .
The First Amendment gives us the right to free speech , but it does n’t give us a free ride .

Defence chiefs are planning to let a camera crew follow Prince Harry during his tour of duty in Iraq .
The Ministry of Defence crew will film him while on operations , with footage being released to television channels and on the internet .
Harry 's commanders hope the film , being dubbed Desert Prince , will inflict a propaganda defeat upon insurgent groups which have been using videos of hostages and wreckages of British aircraft to publicise their causes .
Scroll down for more
The MoD will scrutinise its coverage for any information which could be used by insurgents to locate Prince Harry - one group has already threatened to kidnap him and cut off his ears .
News of the film follows the delay of Prince Harry 's deployment to Iraq .
The Prince , 22 , was held back from the recent handover between units as it was feared his arrival would be too disruptive .
Most members of his Household Cavalry Regiment are already in Basra on a six - month tour of duty .
The Prince is now expected to be given a role in Iraq which would rarely involve him leaving the confines of British bases .
He is no longer going to be utilised as a reconnaissance troop commander - the job he trained for - as this is now considered too dangerous .
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said : " We need to consider how we are going to handle the huge interest in Prince Harry .
Operational security remains of paramount importance . "
The former Conservative Homeland Security spokesman , Patrick Mercer , said : " They will have to be very careful not to give away Prince Harry 's general location .
If this goes wrong , it will come back to haunt them .
" That said , it 's a bold move and a very positive piece of propaganda . "

Leon Vitali was Stanley Kubrick 's assistant for nearly 25 years .
They first worked together when he was cast as the elder Lord Bullingdon in 1975 's Barry Lyndon ; Vitali subsequently stepped over to run Kubrick 's office , cast his films and oversee the video transfers and restored prints of his features .
In recent years , he has permanently relocated to Los Angeles from the UK and worked as a producer on Eyes Wide Shut alumnus Todd Field 's Little Children .
When I learned Vitali was to be presenting a series of screenings of Barry Lyndon at the Walter Reade Theater ( the sold - out run concludes today at 3 and 7 p.m. , with Vitali introducing and discussing the second screening ) , I immediately threatened Lincoln Center with thermonuclear blackmail until they capitulated to allow an interview .
In person , he 's extremely tranquil and eloquent , speaking with a tinge of British on top of his American - born accent .
As one of only a handful of people to have known Stanley Kubrick intimately over an extended period -- both personally and professionally -- speaking with Leon Vitali was probably as close as I could ever get to stepping into Kubrick 's world .
THE REELER :
There are a ton of questions I could ask about Barry Lyndon , but so many of them are cliché : the NASA lenses , how it was initially received .
For me , when I was first getting into Stanley Kubrick -- I was probably a freshman in high school , so we 're talking ' 89 - '90 -- the one movie I did n't know about was Barry Lyndon .
I knew about Strangelove , A Clockwork Orange , had seen Full Metal Jacket on opening day when I was 12 .
I knew everything but this .
I did n't even know that this movie existed until I was like 18 years old .
Maybe we can start there .
These screenings are completely sold out .
It 's become this movie that everyone genuinely loves .
But it was this movie that just was n't talked about for a while .
LEON VITALI : You know , the genesis of that , I think , was -- and Stanley always admitted this -- he took too long to make it .
There was about a year of pre-production , a year - plus of shooting , then he took an awful long time to edit .
And by the time it was ready to come out , I would say , the blockbuster action movies had become de rigeur .
That was what the people really wanted to see .
So when this film came out it was received as strange , slow , completely out of context to what was going on -- and I think people were expecting something a little closer to A Clockwork Orange , which , of course had caused such a furor .
It was living !
A Clockwork Orange was playing for over a year in London .
And it ( Barry Lyndon ) was trashed by many critics , equally so in the UK .
That really hurt Stanley a lot .
He was very depressed about it .
Very upset about it .
He took it to heart .
It took a long , long time really before ...
I can tell you exactly when it was ...
It was in the early - '90s .
The BBC ran a series of his films on television .
It was all the films from Lolita , Strangelove , 2001 , Clockwork , Barry Lyndon , The Shining --
R : The major canon .
LV : The major canon .
The Radio Times , which is like a TV Guide , but more of a magazine , I suppose -- they gave each film a critical breakdown .
Well , they gave Barry Lyndon five stars , because they believed that was the true Odyssey film : you start with someone who 's lowdown ; he travels all the way around Europe ; gets himself into the upper-echelons of the British aristocracy ; then there 's a slow decline back to where he came from .
It 's a classic Odyssey story .
They gave it five stars and all the other films got four stars , but perfect critiques .
And they said if it had n't been for the fact that Barry Lyndon was playing along with these other films , they would have given all those films five stars .
I realized there 'd been a real turning point , especially toward the end of Stanley 's life , where we were getting feedback from a lot of critics that suddenly said : " I 've just seen Barry Lyndon again , and I did not realize at the time what a wonderful film it was . "
They went so lyrical about it .
But anyway , after they screened it on BBC television , the next morning Stanley came into my office , and he said : " Wow , Leon , I watched it for the first time since I do n't know when -- and it's a really great movie ! "
And I said : " Well , that 's what we 've been trying to tell you for years . "
It was really then that he started to get enthusiastic about it and , if he had lived , then you can bet that Warner Bros. would 've taken notice .
We controlled marketing .
Barry Lyndon would 've been much more to the front of subsequent releases , and it would 've had a lot more publicity , been released on its own , given a little flourish .
But , in a way , I kind of like the way there 's a slow understanding beginning to happen .
You feel like it 's a groundswell .
When I moved to Los Angeles permanently in 2003 , I met so many filmmakers and people who work in film , and they started telling me that Barry Lyndon , for them , was not only their favorite Kubrick movie , it was just their favorite movie .
It 's beginning to work now in a way that it never did when it was released .
It 's so gratifying .
R : It 's sort of the way the movie itself works .
The first half of the movie , you really do n't know where it 's going .
LV : Correct .
R : I always find that with Stanley , on the one hand , his work was so innovative and so many people looked to him as somebody who 's going to take it to the next place , but at the same time I kind of feel that he was making his movies outside of time .
To one extent , he wanted to be at the forefront of things , but simultaneously , he was n't doing things as part of the culture .
It 's one of the reasons his movies have been able to be successful and popular , as opposed to just a zeitgeist movie which sums up the moment culturally , but 30 - 40 years later you look back and it 's just completely dated .
( Photo : Jamie Stuart )
LV : Right .
I think you 've got a real valid point there .
And it 's something that I 've always been interested in .
One of the key things about Stanley -- I was with him on his last four films -- one of the key things that you understood was , the whole point of what he was trying to do was to get each one of those stories down to the most basic , simple , straightforward way of telling the story .
Which involves cutting out probably some people 's favorite passages from a book , because they have some relevance socially or what have you .
He never wanted to do that .
R : It 's all very distilled .
LV : Very distilled .
Very focused .
Very concentrated .
And I think that 's one of the reasons some people say he was a very cold filmmaker .
But , in actual fact , I never find that .
I just find him very honest .
Getting down to that very distilled or focused storytelling takes out all those sorts of relevances that -- if you 'd left them in -- would 've dated the movie .
So you cut out all that stuff , because even in a film like Barry Lyndon , which is about 18th - century English aristocracy -- it was a satire ( of ) them really , that was the whole idea of Thackeray 's book -- it still , if you look at that film , it has a relevance to the way that society all over the world is structured , because it 's an outsider trying to break into an establishment .
And the establishment does n't want the outsider to break in .
That 's really what it 's about .
R : A lot of his work was very much about " the outsider . "
LV : That 's right .
R : Within a system or some kind of ...
I think if you read some of the really bad analyses they would 've said , " The outsider within some kind of machine ... "
LV : Yes , yes , yes .
I think he 's the most over - analyzed filmmaker in history .
I really do .
R : History has its own ways of judging things .
LV : Yes .
Absolutely .
R : To me , that 's also just the way that Stanley worked .
You can see the scene functionally for what it is , but on the second pass you realize :
Wait a second , there 's something else very much going on here !
What you thought was going on is n't what 's going on .
LV : Exactly .
When I was at drama school , for instance , obviously we studied a lot of classic text .
People like Strindberg and Chekhov and whatnot .
What happens , I suppose , is , if you get down to the kind of simplicity that they do it leaves the door open for anybody , even in a new era , to put an interpretation on it .
It may have not been something consciously that Strindberg meant to be saying , for instance , or Chekhov , but it 's still valid .
That 's the wonderful thing about interpretation -- the personal gratification you get upon watching something .
It 's down to you .
And if it 's well - made , you could go back and see it a third , fourth , fifth time .
Scorsese said that every time he sees a Kubrick film , he could watch it 10 times , and each time it 's like watching a new movie .
R : The thing that 's interesting for me : I 'm 32 , so for the most part , with the exception of Full Metal Jacket as a kid and , of course , Eyes Wide Shut , I got to know his movies on a TV screen .
LV : Right .
Right .
R : Finally seeing them on the big screen after getting to know them and analyze them on video , there 's always something different seeing it in the manner it was originally intended .
When you see 2001 on a big screen , you see the detail inside the space station -- you see the little people walking around through the windows .
LV : I know .
It 's insane .
R : There 's always something .
Or because the later films were all done for video in full - screen , or the full negative , I should say ...
LV : That 's right .
Absolutely .
I worked with all those transfers .
We went East / West .
You have the whole frame .
When he shot through the camera what he would do was compose for 1.33 -- which is the full TV screen -- and also for 1.85 .
It 's not an uncommon thing to do .
But he would intentionally have action going on in the top of the frame .
In Full Metal Jacket , a really good example , on the TV screen you see it in a really different context .
It does n't lose its power .
Suddenly you 're seeing tops of buildings .
You 're seeing how small these people are inside that milieu .
And that danger can come from anywhere .
The same with The Shining .
It has another kind of power on the TV screen .
And another kind of power when it 's shown theatrically .
But there 's no doubt about it , when you see a film like Barry Lyndon or 2001 -- and I 'd say also The Shining -- theatrically they 're a hell of an experience .
It 's an experience , that 's what it is .
R : I saw Full Metal Jacket during the Film Forum series ( in 2000 ) , and all of a sudden it was like -- seeing it cropped to 1.85 , and changing the composition , it called so much more attention to the lines within the barracks .
But also , every time they 're outside and doing something , the troops will maybe be in the foreground or moving along the Z - axis -- but splitting the screen in almost every shot there 's a line of troops in the background .
My jaw just dropped .
Almost every shot .
And it just gave the most incredible depth to the compositions .
Vitali discussing Barry Lyndon following a screening at the Walter Reade Theater on May 27 ( Photo : S.T. VanAirsdale )
LV : You know , he was not a fan of 1.85 .
He always thought , you know , " You pay to see a movie , you want to see the whole picture . "
He always thought that if you 're ripping out 27 percent of your screen space in a letterbox format that was a bit sad .
But he understood with the multiplex situation what was happening ; that was really the only way to go .
That 's the same reason he only recorded in mono .
Everything except for 2001 -- which in 70 mm , there 's no point in having a mono track with that -- and Eyes Wide Shut .
Because by the time we made Eyes Wide Shut , he realized that most of the multiplexes -- and I would say that 90 percent of the movie houses in the UK are multiplexes now -- understood that sound was something that had become important to the average viewer .
When we released Full Metal Jacket , we sent a squad of people around checking the movie houses .
Some places did n't even know that their stereo systems were n't working .
They had no idea .
He did n't want to have a bad stereo track playing where you lose half your track if it 's not working .
Mono you were always safe with .
I believe Woody Allen still only releases in mono .
R : Really ?
LV : I believe so .
I may be wrong , but I 'm pretty certain .
It 's not bad .
A good mix is a good mix .
That 's all there is to it .
R : I was aware that Stanley had done that .
One thing I find interesting is that so many people talk about the level of control within his films .
LV : That 's right .
R : But other filmmakers I think of who have a great degree of control -- modern filmmakers like say the Coen Brothers or somebody like David Fincher -- they very much work from storyboards .
They go into shooting their movies knowing exactly what they want , and they do it until they get exactly what they want .
With Stanley , however , it seems like it was completely about the process .
LV : That 's right .
He never used storyboards .
Never used storyboards .
That 's a wonderful feeling of freedom you have as an actor , and I 've said several times that Stanley was the closest to a theater director that I ever worked with .
That was the process you went through .
It 's just that instead of taking six weeks to rehearse for a play scene by scene by scene , here we were taking hours and sometimes days to rehearse and shoot and rehearse and shoot .
And all the time during rehearsals , he insisted : " Do it for real .
Do what you think you will do . "
Because the way he found his first shot , he used to walk around the set with an Arriflex tube and just change lenses , look around , down , up , move away , move around .
Once he found his first shot , he knew he could build the scene from that point .
But he said : " If you do n't do it properly , if you do n't do it for real , you could change the way I think about the scene .
You could suddenly put a whole new accent on it . "
You know , it 's such a refreshing way for an actor to work .
It really is .
R : In 2002 , I was at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards and Todd Field was there for In the Bedroom .
He was the first person I saw , and was like : It 's Nick Nightingale ( from Eyes Wide Shut ) !
I went right up and started talking to him .
He was saying the same thing -- you would rehearse the scene to the point where you inherently knew where the camera was going to be .
LV : That 's right .
And the other thing is , you hear a lot of actors -- and I 'm not being negative here -- a lot of filmmakers , for instance , will say that if you over - rehearse it gets boring , you lose its freshness , spontaneity .
But what I always understood was , boredom is just another phase .
You get through that .
And once you get through that , that for me was always a sign that you 'd broken the back of whatever problem was blocking you .
You 'd gone through it and gone through it and gone through it -- and sometimes you do n't even understand why suddenly it feels fresh again .
But he would n't shoot until it had gotten to that point .
That , for me , was the wonderful thing about working with him , because you could trust him to see that point where it 's beginning to work , then ...
Bang !
It was like shooting shit off a shovel .
It was just take after take after take .
And each time , something else would come from that .
Then the scene could change again .
Could be : " Ahh , I had n't thought of that ... "
Then we 'd dash off , sit down somewhere .
" How would you say that ? "
Then you 'd start that process again .
The most exciting time I had as an actor , apart from a couple of stage productions .
It really was .
R : I have this idea that a filmmaker should be able to step into any environment and be able to immediately find at least half a dozen shots .
LV : Yeah .
Absolutely .
I always think one of Stanley 's really big plusses when it came to that was he knew how to organize material .
So if ever he kind of found himself in trouble in the editing process , he always had this instant mental access to another shot that maybe could help him out .
Maybe it was a slightly different angle .
Or it was another line reading .
Because when he edited dialogue , you know , if he had 50 takes of say , " I love you very much , " what he would do is strip out word - for - word -- he'd have 50 " I's , " 50 " love 's , " 50 " you 's , " 50 " very's , " 50 " much's . "
Then he would cross -match to see which combination of them could give him that dramatic impact .
It 's a very long process .
But he knew how to organize that .
And once we got into editing with Avid ...
The first time we ever edited using a computer system was Full Metal Jacket .
We used a system called Montage , which , I gotta tell you , was like Computer Alley !
You had to have these huge towers for random access .
A tower for the main drive .
A hard disk .
A command center .
R : Now I can do that on my laptop .
LV : Exactly .
Exactly .
It was a real amazing experience .
You realize , you used to do the same thing before , but you were cutting mag .
And that took forever .
I mean , it took long enough when you could access your material like that ( snaps fingers ) .
R : And you do n't have to worry about trying to find that one frame at the bottom of the bin .
LV : Exactly .
I mean , the trim box was , like , overflowing .
R : This is kind of a general question , and it might be difficult to answer .
But I think it 's something everybody wants to know :
Who was Stanley ?
LV : You know , it 's not as complicated as you might think .
The best way I can put it is this :
If you make it in more of a personal context and you think about yourself as being someone who can sometimes be angry , sometimes be generous , sometimes be jealous , sometimes be resentful , sometimes be extremely kind -- all those basic human qualities .
Everybody 's got them .
And the thing is , for many people , there 's one part of them that drives them more than another .
Some people are continually feeling guilty about life .
He could feel guilty about some of the things he had to do .
Or they could be extremely ambitious .
Something drives them more than all the others .
They have all those other qualities inside them .
But somebody like Stanley , who had all those like you or I , but to about the power of a gazillion , all right ?
Because from minute to minute it could change .
One of those , the ambitious , would suddenly give way to something quite mean .
And then equally give way to something almost over - generous .
Everything he did was almost overpowering .
Which was quite difficult to live with .
But , of course , stimulating at the same time .
For some people it was hard to deal with because if they were delivering bad news , for instance , or reporting on a failure to complete a mission , for want of a better way of putting it , his line was always : " How long have you known this ?
And were you waiting for the right moment to tell me -- the right psychological moment to tell me ? "
Of course , you 'd always say , " No . "
But inside you were nodding away .
Of course you were , because if you 're having a bad time , I do n't want to come and tell you I 've just had a phone call from so - and - so .
It just was n't worth it .
...
What he could n't stand was if someone lied outright , which is really an easy thing to happen when you 're dealing with somebody who 's so powerful , who can be so angered and outraged at something .
People do n't want to go willingly into those situations .
But if you did , I could tell you we went into everything so thoroughly , got to the bottom of everything so thoroughly , you were always going to be found out .
It 's as simple as that .
So you kind of learned that approach was n't worth it either .
It was often easier to seek the forgiveness than to seek permission to do something , just to get some things done sometimes .
R : I understand there 's going to be another Kubrick Collection for HD ...
LV : Yes , they used the standard - def DVD collection that we did for the whole restoration program a little while ago as a guide .
But , as you know , in high - definition there a whole color science that goes on .
I 'm sure a lot of DP's and directors who shoot film going into the digital intermediate or digital negative , they realize that it does n't always translate right across .
So you really have to get into it .
But they did a really good job .
I went in to look at the titles , which were 2001 , The Shining , Full Metal Jacket , Eyes Wide Shut , and A Clockwork Orange -- all we really needed to do was just place - to - place shift it a little bit .
They looked really , really fine .
It also means that in HD you are getting the 1.85 you saw theatrically .
That 'll be converted into 1.77 or 1.78 --
R : 16:9 .
LV : Yeah .
16:9 .
And now it actually fills the whole screen , so you do n't get those blank bars at the top and bottom .
The only one they 're not doing is Barry Lyndon .
And I have no idea why not .
That would look totally beautiful in HD .
And 2001 , I can't tell you .
It is stunning !
It is so stunning !
The detail ...
You know , we tried when I was working with them all those years ago , we tried to see what would happen if we digitally projected it .
But back then , they only had this 1080 interlace , and what happened was a lot of digital blocking in the small detail areas --
R : Yeah , the lines ...
LV : That 's gone now because it 's progressive 1080 .
It 's beautiful .
R : 2 k scan ?
LV : 2 k scan , yeah .
R : They just came out with the Alejandro Jodorowsky set .
LV : Right .
R : And they did a 2 k scan of The Holy Mountain .
It 's gorgeous looking .
LV : I went to an exhibition in Las Vegas .
I went to the Sony tent .
They want all their cinemas in Japan to be 4 k within a year .
I even saw some test stuff in 8 k , and then you 're getting into realms of ...
And there 's no use comparing it to film .
I love film , and I have so much affection for it .
But you can't think about those things in that way anymore .
It is going to go .
And digital is what it is .
It is n't like film , it 's different .
There 's no point in crying over it .
It 's coming and you just have to deal with it .
The only thing : I was talking last night to some people about this , and the only thing that worries me about digital is there 's been no test of time about storing the information .
Whether you 're going to drop those 1's and 0's -- this migration problem they 're talking about .
They 've gotta work that out somehow .
Because if stuff 's shot digitally and it's not put on a film format , you 've got no 100 percent storage for future archiving .
So I hear a lot of people now , if they 're shooting digitally , they 're making what they call separations on film just to make sure it 's covered .
But it is something they 're going to have to deal with .
We as a whole have two homes - the one we have and the one we need .
On the off chance that you are not content with ...
John Edwards : ' The President is dead wrong ' on Iraq David Edwards
Published : Tuesday April 3 , 2007 Print This Email
This 2008 Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards knocks President Bush 's criticism of the Iraq funding bill , which includes a timetable for withdrawal of US troops , and discusses the race for the White House in an appearance on CNN's The Situation Room .
" The President is dead wrong " on Iraq funding , argues Edwards .
" If the President vetoes the bill that provides funding for the troops , it 's President Bush who 's not providing the support and funding for the troops . "
On the '08 race , Edwards says of his third - place showing in polls , " I think it would be a foolish mistake to write anybody off . "
Transcript of interview : # MALVEAUX : Happening now , Democratic candidate John Edwards is holding a town hall meeting in Iowa .
Dramatic changes in the Democratic race for the White House in a key primary state .
Take a look at this CNN / WMUR New Hampshire presidential primary poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire .
It shows Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton losing ground but still in the lead .
John Edwards is second but neck and neck with Barack Obama .
And Al Gore , who 's not even running , in fourth .
So what does Edwards make of his new momentum ?
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) MALVEAUX : Senator John Edwards .
Thanks so much for joining us here in THE SITUATION ROOM .
Now a lot of people have really set up this race as one Hillary Clinton versus Barack Obama but these poll numbers show you second to Hillary Clinton and neck and neck with Obama .
If Hillary Clinton and her folks are watching now and they see these poll numbers , what is the message you have for her today ?
JOHN EDWARDS , PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE :
Oh , it 's the same message I would have to anybody .
I think it 's pretty clear that this is a very competitive race .
I 've been moving up .
We have some momentum now .
I 'm ahead in Iowa according to the public polls .
I 'm obviously right in the thick of things in New Hampshire .
We have moved up significantly there .
So I think this is going to be a serious race where voters get a chance to look at the differences in our positions and our personal characteristics to be president .
MALVEAUX : Do you think the media has essentially written you off as number three a little bit too soon here ?
Because it looks like we 've got a three way race and you 're just climbing up close to Clinton .
EDWARDS : Oh , I think it would be a foolish mistake to write anybody off .
We 're very early in the campaign .
I started in a strong place .
We had a great fundraising quarter .
I 'm ahead in Iowa which is the place of the first caucus .
Right in the midst of things , obviously , in New Hampshire and we 've moved up there .
So I 'm out there talking about the things that matter .
Real , universal health care plan , changing the way we use energy and a real plan to get out of Iraq .
MALVEAUX : And obviously another thing that matters to the American people is Iraq .
Let 's take a listen at what President Bush said today .
GEORGE W. BUSH , U.S. PRESIDENT : Congress ' most basic responsibility is to give our troops the equipment and training they need to fight our enemies and protect our nation and they 're failing in that responsibility .
And if they do not change course in the coming weeks , the price of that failure will be paid by our troops and their loved ones .
MALVEAUX : Now Senator Reid has actually gone as far as saying that he would support cutting off most funding for the Iraq War if the original legislation is vetoed .
Do you think that that 's gone too far ?
Should Senator Reid cool it at this point ?
EDWARDS : No .
What I think is the president is dead wrong .
He is just dead wrong .
He is just dead wrong .
If the president vetoes the bill that provides funding for the troops , that President Bush is not providing support and funding for the troops because he is the one who stopped the funding and I think it 's the responsibility of the Congress if he does that to stand firm , stand strong , send him another bill that provides funding for the troops by provides to start bringing the troops home .
That 's what Congress should be doing .
They should be strong .
MALVEAUX : So would you support Senator Reid 's bill if it came to the president , if it came to Congress , saying we 're not going to support most of the funding for the Iraq War , as he has suggested .
EDWARDS : I tell you what I support .
What I support is sending a bill to the president that provides for a drawdown of the troops of Iraq .
If the president vetoes that bill , I would send him another bill that provides for a drawdown of the troops in Iraq .
This president has to be forced to change course .
The Democratically - controlled Congress can do that .
He has made mistake after mistake after mistake and he has to be stopped and we have to be strong .
MALVEAUX : So you would not support Senator Reid 's bill cutting off most of the funding for Iraq ?
EDWARDS : I can't tell from the way you 're describing it and from the description I 've heard enough about the specifics .
I think that what we ought to be doing is standing firm , standing strong and forcing this president to start drawing down troops .
MALVEAUX : I want to go to Syria here .
As you know , Speaker Pelosi is in Syria .
She is not traveling in any official capacity .
She has no negotiating power .
Some people look at this as simply political theater .
A stunt .
Do you think that 's right ?
EDWARDS : I think that what America should be doing on the issue of Iraq is dealing directly with both the Syrians and the Iranians .
And I do n't know precisely what Speaker Pelosi is going to do in Syria but we as a nation should be engaged with both the Iranians and the Syrians directly and to help him stabilize Iraq .
Both countries have an interest in a stable Iraq .
They do n't want refugees coming across their border .
They do n't want economic instability and they do n't want to see a broader Middle East conflict .
And I think it make sense to not - on some ideological basis not deal with them but to engage with both of them directly .
MALVEAUX : You 're doing well in terms of poll numbers .
You 're also doing well in terms of fundraising .
How much of this do you think is the result of you being so forthcoming and all the well - wishes that have been given to your wife 's recovery ?
EDWARDS : Oh , I do n't have any way of knowing that .
I suspect that there 's been a lot of attention .
I think people take their vote for president very , very seriously and I think a lot of what the attention has been is they 've looked at both the things I want to do as president and looked at me and Elizabeth as human beings and made judgments and I suspect it 's the result of that .
Time will tell .
MALVEAUX : Thank you very much , Senator Edwards .
EDWARDS : Thanks for having me . #
Philosophy Terrorism and Reconciliation By Ryan McGreal
Published July 14 , 2006
Terrorism is a Tactic
Terrorism is a tactic used to weaken the resolve of democratic governments to continue doing whatever the terrorists oppose , which is usually some form of occupation and / or repression .
This is one of the most important , if least consistently understood , lessons about the relationship between occupation and resistance .
Think of the IRA , the ANC , the PLO , Hezbollah , and Mujahideen / al - Qaeda : the common denominator in all cases is that a more - or - less democratic government is illegally occupying and oppressing a minority group ( the exception is the ANC , which were a numerical majority in their own occupied country ) .
Acts of terrorism get the attention of the voting public , because they force a form of accountability for what their governments do on their behalf .
It 's a double - edged sword , of course , because the fear of getting blown up will drive some people to bug their governments to pull out and will drive others to bug their governments to annihilate the terrorists .
Given enough time , however , even the hawks get tired of fighting and being scared all the time .
As the asynchronous war digs in , the terrorists gradually gain the upper hand tactically , as they learn ways to exploit weaknesses and leverage the occupier 's strengths against it , jujitsu style .
Please note that none of this is meant to advocate terrorism .
I 'm generally a pacifist , and believe violent methods to achieve one 's goals are unethical .
However , it 's possible to understand a phenomenon without endorsing it , and understanding a phenomenon is essential before you can respond appropriately .
Strategic Objectives or Pointless Savagery
The ANC is now a respected political party , and its leader , Nelson Mandela , an internationally renowned man of peace , but it started out as a terrorist organization using violence to undermine the authority of the apartheid government .
Mandela spent decades in prison for his activities .
This just demonstrates that terrorism is a tactic driven by circumstance and opportunity .
Sometimes , liberal democracies celebrate terrorists and call them " freedom fighters . "
For example , President Ronald Regan called the Muhjahideen " the moral equivalent of the Founding Fathers , " suggesting that their campaign against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was morally equivalent to the Founding Fathers ' campaign against the ruling British government .
I ask you : is the world a better place since it recognized the impetus for the ANC 's violent campaign against the apartheid government of South Africa ?
Has the ANC not been rehabilitated , as it were , in the absence of the sheer injustice that drove it to violence ?
Most important : during Apartheid , Afrikaans citizens commonly warned that if the black South Africans were given their freedom , they would rise up en masse and slit the throats of their erstwhile overlords , burning down houses , raping women , and so on .
They were savages , we were told , and could n't be trusted with freedom .
Amnesty for Truth
When Apartheid fell , the ANC launched a massive , nationwide Truth and Reconciliation Commission to bring oppressor and oppressed face to face , acknowledge and take ownership for the actions of both sides , and pursue forgiveness and healing .
It may be the most compelling demonstration in history that hope exists to resolve even the most terrible of hurts .
Archbishop Desmond Tutu spoke about Truth and Reconciliation on the tenth anniversary of the first democratic election in South Africa .
Rejecting blanket amnesty , he noted that bygones " have an uncanny capacity to return and haunt us .
An unexamined and unacknowledged past finds all kinds of skeletons emerging from all sorts of cupboards to bedevil the present . "
At the same time , a Nuremberg - style war crimes trial of the defeated by the victors was also impractical , as " neither the apartheid Government nor the liberation movements of the ANC and PAC defeated their adversaries .
There was a military stalemate . "
Instead , they opted for a compromise that would restore the integrity of all participants : amnesty in exchange for truth .
Instead of retributive justice - an eye for an eye - the new South African government opted for restorative justice :
In the retributive justice process the victim is forgotten in what can be a very cold and impersonal way of doing things .
In restorative justice both the victim and the offender play central roles .
Restorative justice is singularly hopeful , it does not believe that an offence necessarily defines the perpetrator completely as when we imply that once a thief then always a thief .
The African concept of Ubuntu is the idea that a person can only be fully human through interdependence with other humans .
" If one person is dehumanized then inexorably we are all diminished and dehumanized in our turn . "
At the same time , the whole premise of Truth and Reconciliation was that " people retained the capacity to change , that enemies could become friends . "
Post - Apartheid South Africa chose reconciliation over retribution .
This was a direct outgrowth of the joint decision that the military stalemate of which Tutu spoke could have no other resolution other than the complete obliteration of one or both parties .
The Apartheid government was tired of fighting , and the ANC were willing to set aside their weapons and start to broker peace in exchange for freedom .
Breaking the Stalemate
Today , we hear exactly the same things about the Palestinians that we once heard about black South Africans : they 're savages , they do n't value life as we do , they can't be trusted , they 'll kill us all if we give them a chance .
I cannot help but wonder whether things would be different if the circumstances of Palestinians vis-a - vis Israel were to change .
Certainly the global pattern of terrorism as a tactic in response to occupation / repression suggests that this may be the case .
Today , a new surge of violence wracks the Middle East , but Israel will never pacify Hamas or Hezbollah , since they struggle against occupation , and resistance to domination is a renewable resource .
Israel insists that if it relents , the forces of terrorism will not stop until they destroy Israel , drive it into the sea , grind it into dust .
Israel has an unique historic precedent for this fear .
The Jewish people have faced annihilation in a way that few others in the world can even comprehend , let alone appreciate .
This should never be discounted ; just as it helps to respond constructively to terrorism by understanding its sources , it also helps to respond constructively to Israel 's militarism by understanding its sources .
Ultimately , Israel will not achieve its objectives by its current methods , short of annihilating the Palestinian people , a possible end that would be horribly ironic given Israel 's own history .
The two groups are locked in what Tutu would call a military stalemate .
Reconciliation is the only way out of the impasse .
As long as Israel continues to pursue retribution , the stalemate will persist .
More people will die , more people will live in fear , and more people will live under oppression .
( Aside : the Camp David accord was not a credible peace agreement : the plan was a system of non-contiguous bantusans with Israeli checkpoints at all borders and no air or water rights . )
The issue is not " radical Islamism " , which is a perverse reaction to powerlessness , but the powerlessness itself .
One day , Israel will sit down with its neighbours in a spirit of reconciliation .
One day , the two sides will speak truth in exchange for amnesty .
There is no other way out .
Until that happens , the cycle of violence will persist with predictably tragic results .

The word “ pseudo ” means fake .
The surest way to spot a fake is to know as much as possible about the real thing — in this case , about science itself .
Knowing science does not mean simply knowing scientific facts ( such as the distance from earth to sun , the age of the earth , the distinction between mammal and reptile , etc . )
It means understanding the nature of science — the criteria of evidence , the design of meaningful experiments , the weighing of possibilities , the testing of hypotheses , the establishment of theories , the many aspects of scientific methods that make it possible to draw reliable conclusions about the physical universe .
Because the media bombard us with nonsense , it is useful to consider the earmarks of pseudoscience .
The presence of even one of these should arouse great suspicion .
On the other hand , material displaying none of these flaws might still be pseudoscience , because its adherents invent new ways to fool themselves every day .
Most of the examples in this article are related to my field of physics , but similar beliefs and behavior are associated with iridology , medical astrology , meridian therapy , reflexology , subluxation - based chiropractic , therapeutic touch , and other health - related pseudosciences .
Pseudoscience displays an indifference to facts .
Instead of bothering to consult reference works or investigating directly , its advocates simply spout bogus “ facts ” where needed .
These fictions are often central to the pseudoscientist ’s argument and conclusions .
Moreover , pseudoscientists rarely revise .
The first edition of a pseudoscience book is almost always the last , even though the book remains in print for decades or even centuries .
Even books with obvious mistakes , errors , and misprints on every page may be reprinted as is , over and over .
Compare this to science textbooks that see a new edition every few years because of the rapid accumulation of new facts and insights .
Pseudoscience “ research ” is invariably sloppy .
Pseudoscientists clip newspaper reports , collect hearsay , cite other pseudoscience books , and pore over ancient religious or mythological works .
They rarely or never make an independent investigation to check their sources .
Pseudoscience begins with a hypothesis — usually one which is appealing emotionally ,
and spectacularly implausible — and then looks only for items which appear to support it .
Conflicting evidence is ignored .
Generally speaking , the aim of pseudoscience is to rationalize strongly held beliefs , rather than to investigate or to test alternative possibilities .
Pseudoscience specializes in jumping to “ congenial conclusions , ” grinding ideological axes , appealing to preconceived ideas and to widespread misunderstandings .
Pseudoscience is indifferent to criteria of valid evidence .
The emphasis is not on meaningful , controlled , repeatable scientific experiments .
Instead it is on unverifiable eyewitness testimony , stories and tall tales , hearsay , rumor , and dubious anecdotes .
Genuine scientific literature is either ignored or misinterpreted .
Pseudoscience relies heavily on subjective validation .
Joe Blow puts jello on his head and his headache goes away .
To pseudoscience , this means jello cures headaches .
To science this means nothing , since no experiment was done .
Many things were going on when Joe Blow ’s headache went away — the moon was full , a bird flew overhead , the window was open , Joe had on his red shirt , etc. — and his headache would have gone away eventually in any case , no matter what .
A controlled experiment would put many people suffering from headaches in identical circumstances , except for the presence or absence of the remedy it is desired to test , and compare the results which would then have some chance of being meaningful .
Many people think there must be something to astrology because a newspaper horoscope describes them perfectly .
But close examination would reveal that the description is general enough to cover virtually everyone .
This phenomenon , called subjective validation , is one of the foundations of popular support for pseudoscience .
Pseudoscience depends on arbitrary conventions of human
culture , rather than on unchanging regularities of nature .
For instance , the interpretations of astrology depend on the names of things , which are accidental and vary from culture to culture .
If the ancients had given the name Mars to the planet we call Jupiter , and vice versa , astronomy could care less but astrology would be totally different , because it depends solely on the name and has nothing to do with the physical properties of the planet itself .
Pseudoscience always achieves a reduction to absurdity if pursued far enough .
Maybe dowsers can somehow sense the presence of water or minerals under a field , but almost all claim they can dowse equally well from a map !
Maybe Uri Geller is “ psychic , ” but are his powers really beamed to him on a radio link with a flying saucer from the planet Hoova , as he has claimed ?
Maybe plants are “ psychic , ” but why does a bowl of mud respond in exactly the same way , in the same “ experiment ? ”
Pseudoscience always avoids putting its claims to a meaningful test .
Pseudoscientists never carry out careful , methodical experiments themselves — and they also generally ignore results of those carried out by scientists .
Pseudoscientists also never follow up .
If one pseudoscientist claims to have done an experiment ( such as the “ lost ” biorhythm studies of Hermann Swoboda that are alleged basis of the modern pseudoscience of biorhythms ) , no other pseudoscientist ever tries to duplicate it or to check him , even when the original results are missing or questionable !
Further , where a pseudoscientist claims to have done an experiment with a remarkable result , he himself never repeats it to check his results and procedures .
This is in extreme contrast with science , where crucial experiments are repeated by scientists all over the world with ever - increasing precision .
Pseudoscience often contradicts itself , even in its own terms .
Such logical contradictions are simply ignored or rationalized away .
Thus , we should not be surprised when Chapter 1
of a book on dowsing says that dowsers use newly cut twigs , because only “ live ” wood can channel and focus the “ earth - radiation ” that makes dowsing possible , whereas Chapter 5 states that nearly all dowsers use metal or plastic rods .
Pseudoscience deliberately creates mystery where none
exists , by omitting crucial information and important details .
Anything can be made “ mysterious ” by omitting what is known about it or presenting completely imaginary details .
The “ Bermuda Triangle ” books are classic examples of this tactic .
Pseudoscience does not progress .
There are fads , and a pseudoscientist may switch from one fad to another ( from ghosts to ESP research , from flying saucers to psychic studies , from ESP research to looking for Bigfoot ) .
But within a given topic , no progress is made .
Little or no new information or uncovered .
New theories are seldom proposed , and old concepts are rarely modified or discarded in light of new “ discoveries , ” since pseudoscience rarely makes new “ discoveries . ”
The older the idea , the more respect it receives .
No natural phenomena or processes previously unknown to science have ever been discovered by pseudoscientists .
Indeed , pseudoscientists almost invariably deal with phenomena well known to scientists , but little known to the general public — so that the public will swallow whatever the pseudoscientist wants to claim .
Examples include firewalking and “ Kirlian ” photography .
Pseudoscience attempts to persuade with rhetoric , propaganda , and
misrepresentation rather than valid evidence ( which presumably does not exist ) .
Pseudoscience books offer examples of almost every kind of fallacy of logic and reason known to scholars and have invented some new ones of their own .
A favorite device is the non sequitur .
Pseudoscientists also love the “ Galileo Argument . ”
This consists of the pseudoscientist comparing himself to Galileo , and saying that just as the pseudoscientist is believed to be wrong , so Galileo was thought wrong by his contemporaries therefore the pseudoscientist must be right too , just as Galileo was .
Clearly the conclusion does not follow !
Moreover , Galileo ’s ideas were tested , verified , and accepted promptly by his scientific colleagues .
The rejection came from the established religion which favored the pseudoscience that Galileo ’s findings contradicted .
Pseudoscience argues from ignorance , an elementary fallacy .
Many pseudoscientists base their claims on incompleteness of information about nature , rather than on what is known at present .
But no claim can possibly be supported by lack of information .
The fact that people do n’t recognize what they see in the sky means only that they do n’t recognize what they saw .
This fact is not evidence that flying saucers are from outer space .
The statement “ Science cannot explain ” is common in pseudoscience literature .
In many cases , science has no interest in the supposed phenomena because there is no evidence it exists ; in other cases , the scientific explanation is well known and well established , but the pseudoscientist does n’t know this or deliberately ignores it to create mystery .
Pseudoscience argues from alleged exceptions , errors , anomalies , strange events ,
and suspect claims — rather than from well - established regularities of nature .
The experience of scientists over the past 400 years is that claims and reports that describe well - understood objects behaving in strange and incomprehensible ways tend to reduce upon investigation to deliberate frauds , honest mistakes , garbled accounts , misinterpretations , outright fabrications , and stupid blunders .
It is not wise to accept such reports at face value , without checking them .
Pseudoscientists always take such reports as literally true , without independent verification .
Pseudoscience appeals to false authority , to emotion ,
sentiment , or distrust of established fact .
A high - school dropout is accepted as an expert on archaeology , though he has never made any study of it !
A psychoanalyst is accepted as an expert on all of human history , not to mention physics , astronomy , and mythology , even though his claims are inconsistent with everything known in all four fields .
A movie star swears it ’s true , so it must be .
A physicist says a “ psychic ” could n’t possibly have fooled him with simple magic tricks , although the physicist knows nothing about magic and sleight of hand .
Emotional appeals are common .
( “ If it makes you feel good , it must be true . ”
“ In your heart you know it ’s right . ” )
Pseudoscientists are fond of imaginary conspiracies .
( “ There ’s plenty of evidence for flying saucers , but the government keeps it secret . ” )
And they argue from irrelevancies :
When confronted by inconvenient facts , they simply reply , “ Scientists do n’t know everything ! ”
Pseudoscience makes extraordinary claims and advances fantastic
theories that contradict what is known about nature .
They not only provide no evidence that their claims are true .
They also ignore all findings that contradict their conclusions .
( “ Flying saucers have to come from somewhere — so the earth is hollow , and they come from inside . ”
“ This electric spark I ’m making with this electrical apparatus is actually not a spark at all , but rather a supernatural manifestation of psycho- spiritual energy . ”
“ Every human is surrounded by an impalpable aura of electromagnetic energy , the auric egg of the ancient Hindu seers , which mirrors the human ’s every mood and condition . ” )
Pseudoscientists invent their own vocabulary in which many terms lack
precise or unambiguous definitions , and some have no definition at all .
Listeners are often forced to interpret the statements according to their own preconceptions .
What , for for example , is “ biocosmic energy ? ”
Or a “ psychotronic amplification system ? ”
Pseudoscientists often attempt to imitate the jargon of scientific and technical fields by spouting gibberish that sounds scientific and technical .
Quack “ healers ” would be lost without the term “ energy , ” but their use of the term has nothing whatsoever to do with the concept of energy used by physicists .
Pseudoscience appeals to the truth - criteria of scientific
methodology while simultaneously denying their validity .
Thus , a procedurally invalid experiment which seems to show that astrology works is advanced as “ proof ” that astrology is correct , while thousands of procedurally sound experiments that show it does not work are ignored .
The fact that someone got away with simple magic tricks in one scientific lab is “ proof ” that he is a psychic superman , while the fact that he was caught cheating in several other labs is ignored .
Pseudoscience claims that the phenomena it studies are “ jealous . ”
The phenomena appear only under certain vaguely specified but vital conditions ( such as when no doubters or skeptics are present ; when no experts are present ; when nobody is watching ; when the “ vibes ” are right ; or only once in human history . )
Science holds that genuine phenomena must be capable of study by anyone with the proper equipment and that all procedurally valid studies must give consistent results .
No genuine phenomenon is “ jealous ” in this way .
There is no way to construct a TV set or a radio that will function only when no skeptics are present !
A man who claims to be a concert - class violinist , but does not appear to have ever owned a violin and who refuses to play when anyone is around who might hear him , is most likely lying about his ability to play the violin .
Pseudoscientific “ explanations ” tend to be by scenario .
That is , we are told a story , but nothing else ; we have no description of any possible physical process .
For instance , Immanuel Velikovsky ( 1895 - 1979 ) claimed that another planet passing near the earth caused the earth ’s spin axis to flip upside down .
This is all he said .
He gave no mechanisms .
But the mechanism is all - important , because the laws of physics rule out the process as impossible .
That is , the approach of another planet cannot cause a planet ’s spin axis to flip .
If Velikovsky had discovered some way that a planet could flip another ’s spin axis , he would presumably have described the mechanism by which it can happen .
The bald statement itself , without the underlying mechanism , conveys no information at all .
Velikovsky said that Venus was once a comet , and this comet was spewed out of a volcano on Jupiter .
Since planets do not resemble comets ( which are rock / ice snowball - like debris with connection whatsoever to volcanoes ) and since Jupiter is not known to have volcanoes anyway ( or even a solid surface ! ) , no actual physical process could underlie Velikovsky ’s assertions .
He gave us words , related to one another within a sentence , but the relationships were alien to the universe we actually live in , and he gave no explanation for how these could exist .
He provided stories , not genuine theories .
Pseudoscientists often appeal to the ancient human habit of magical thinking .
Magic , sorcery , witchcraft — these are based on spurious similarity , false analogy , false cause - and - effect connections , etc .
That is , inexplicable influences and connections between things are assumed from the beginning — not found by investigation .
( If you step on a crack in the sidewalk without saying a magic word , your mother will crack a bone in her body ; eating heart - shaped leaves is good for heart ailments ; shining red light on the body increases blood production ; rams are aggressive so someone born in the sign of the ram is aggressive ; fish are “ brain food ” because the meat of the fish resembles brain tissue , etc . )
Pseudoscience relies heavily on anachronistic thinking .
The older the idea , the more attractive it is to pseudoscience — it ’s the wisdom of the ancients !
— especially if the idea is transparently wrong and has long been discarded by science .
Many journalists have trouble in comprehending this point .
A typical reporter writing about astrology may think a thorough job can be done by interviewing six astrologers and one astronomer .
The astronomer says it ’s all bunk ; the six astrologers say it ’s great stuff and really works and for $ 50 they ’ll be glad to cast anyone ’s horoscope .
( No doubt ! )
To many reporters , and apparently to many editors and their readers , this would confirm astrology six to one !
This table contrasts some of the characteristics of science and pseudoscience
Science Pseudoscience
Their findings are expressed primarily through scientific journals that are peer - reviewed and maintain rigorous standards for honesty and accuracy .
The literature is aimed at the general public .
There is no review , no standards , no pre-publication verification , no demand for accuracy and precision .
Reproducible results are demanded ; experiments must be precisely described so that they can be duplicated exactly or improved upon .
Results can not be reproduced or verified .
Studies , if any , are always so vaguely described that one can’t figure out what was done or how it was done .
Failures are searched for and studied closely , because incorrect theories can often make correct predictions by accident , but no correct theory will make incorrect predictions .
Failures are ignored , excused , hidden , lied about , discounted , explained away , rationalized , forgotten , avoided at all costs .
As time goes on , more and more is learned about the physical processes under study .
No physical phenomena or processes are ever found or studied .
No progress is made ; nothing concrete is learned .
Convinces by appeal to the evidence , by arguments based upon logical and / or mathematical reasoning , by making the best case the data permit .
When new evidence contradicts old ideas , they are abandoned .
Convinces by appeal to faith and belief .
Pseudoscience has a strong quasi- religious element : it tries to convert , not to convince .
You are to believe in spite of the facts , not because of them .
The original idea is never abandoned , whatever the evidence .
Does not advocate or market unproven practices or products .
Generally earns some or all of his living by selling questionable products ( such as books , courses , and dietary supplements ) and / or pseudoscientific services ( such as horoscopes , character readings , spirit messages , and predictions ) .
This table could be greatly expanded , because science and pseudoscience are precisely opposed ways of viewing nature .
Science relies on — and insists on — self - questioning , testing and analytical thinking that make it hard to fool yourself or to avoid facing facts .
Pseudoscience , on the other hand , preserves the ancient , natural , irrational , unobjective modes of thought that are hundreds of thousands of years older than science — thought processes that have given rise to superstitions and other fanciful and mistaken ideas about man and nature — from voodoo to racism ; from the flat earth to the house - shaped universe with God in the attic , Satan in the cellar and man on the ground floor ; from doing rain dances to torturing and brutalizing the mentally ill to drive out the demons that possess them .
Pseudoscience encourages people to believe anything they want .
It supplies specious “ arguments ” for fooling yourself into thinking that any and all beliefs are equally valid .
Science begins by saying , let ’s forget about what we believe to be so , and try by investigation to find out what actually is so .
These roads do n’t cross ; they lead in completely opposite directions .
Some confusion on this point is caused by what we might call “ crossover . ” “ Science ” is not an honorary badge you wear , it ’s an activity you do .
Whenever you cease that activity , you cease being a scientist .
A distressing amount of pseudoscience is generated by scientists who are well trained in one field but plunge into another field of which they are ignorant .
A physicist who claims to have found a new principle of biology — or a biologist who claims to have found a new principle of physics — is almost invariably doing pseudoscience .
And so are those who forge data , or suppresses data that clash with their preconceptions , or refuse to let others see their data for independent evaluation .
Science is like a high peak of intellectual integrity , fairness , and rationality .
The peak is slippery and smooth .
It requires a tremendous effort to remain near it .
Slacking of effort carries one away and into pseudoscience .
Some pseudoscience is generated by individuals with a small amount of specialized scientific or technical training who are not professional scientists and do not comprehend the nature of the scientific enterprise — yet think of themselves as “ scientists . ”
One might wonder if there are not examples of “ crossovers ” in the other direction ; that is people who have been thought by scientists to be doing pseudoscience , who eventually were accepted as doing valid science , and whose ideas were ultimately accepted by scientists .
From what we have just outlined , one would expect this to happen extremely rarely , if ever .
In fact , neither I nor any informed colleague I have ever asked about this , knows of any single case in which this has happened during the hundreds of years the full scientific method has been known to and used by scientists .
There are many cases in which a scientist has been thought wrong by colleagues but later — when new information comes in — is shown to be correct .
Like anyone else , scientists can get hunches that something is possible without having enough evidence to convince their associates that they are correct .
Such people do not become pseudoscientists , unless they continue to maintain that their ideas are correct when contradictory evidence piles up .
Being wrong or mistaken is unavoidable ; we are all human , and we all commit errors and blunders .
True scientists , however , are alert to the possibility of blunder and are quick to correct mistakes .
Pseudoscientists do not .
In fact , a short definition of pseudoscience is “ a method for excusing , defending , and preserving errors . ”
Pseudoscience often strikes educated , rational people as too nonsensical and preposterous to be dangerous and as a source of amusement rather than fear .
Unfortunately , this is not a wise attitude .
Pseudoscience can be extremely dangerous .
Penetrating political systems , it justifies atrocities in the name of racial purity
Penetrating the educational system , it can drive out science and sensibility ;
In the field of health , it dooms thousands to unnecessary death or suffering
Penetrating religion , it generates fanaticism , intolerance , and holy war
Penetrating the communications media , it can make it difficult for voters to obtain factual information on important public issues .

BBC reporter , Prisoners of Katrina
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , while thousands fled New Orleans , the city 's prisoners were trapped .
Fresh eye - witness accounts reveal what really happened to those left behind , and how crucial forensic evidence was simply washed away .
Nearly 7,000 male and female prisoners were left behind
In September 2005 , long after most people had fled a devastated city , inmates of Orleans Parish Prison - many of them shackled - were still waiting to be rescued from the blazing heat and the stinking floods .
" They basically abandoned the prison , " says Vincent Norman , a chef arrested for an unpaid fine who found himself locked in a cell for days .
Norman should have been there no more than a week .
Instead , abandoned without food , drink or sanitation as the waters rose , he was in prison for 103 days .
" We were just left there to die , " said Cardell Williams , a prisoner who spent two months in jail without ever being charged .
In the days before the hurricane , when other citizens of New Orleans were ordered to leave , city leaders were asked : " What about the prisoners in the jail ? "
" The prisoners will stay where they belong , " replied Marlin Gusman , the criminal sheriff in charge of the city jail .
But it was a gamble he would regret .
Break out
Orleans Parish Prison has ten jail blocks , its own courts and a morgue
Some of those in Orleans Parish Prison had been arrested for minor misdemeanours , like unpaid fines , or jay - walking .
Some had never even been charged .
A third of the inmates were awaiting trial , innocent until proven guilty .
On the night of Sunday 29 August , as Katrina hit the Gulf Coast , they found themselves with violent convicts transferred from other low - lying jails .
The food and drinking water ran out .
Many were in windowless cells in soaring heat .
They began to riot .
Andrew Joseph said he saw a body floating in the water with a rat sitting on its chest
Terrified staff who had brought their families with them to the jail for safety , now found themselves trapped surrounded by floodwater , without phones or radio contact .
Deputy Rhonda Ducre , alone on her wing , had only a torch with fading batteries to keep order in the darkness , as panicked inmates began to break out .
She recalls : " They were shaking on the bars , they were setting fires , they were screaming , they were popping out of their cells .
It was dangerous . "
Body bags
By Monday night , Sheriff Gusman was forced to change his mind .
But now the evacuation of 7,000 prisoners would be infinitely harder .
Two days after the evacuation began , some prisoners were still trapped in their cells
They would have to be ferried by boats , six at a time .
In the chaos some were left behind , forgotten , and some inmates reported seeing prisoners who had drowned .
Andrew Joseph said he saw a body floating in the water with a rat sitting on its chest .
There were reports too of other deaths .
A member of the prison staff made a sworn statement that he had removed two body - bags containing the bodies of female deputies who had died , asphyxiated by smoke from burning mattresses .
But with hundreds of bodies already piling up in the morgue , and with so many of New Orleans citizens missing or still displaced , those claims have never been verified .
Legal rights
Prisoners were dispersed and held throughout the state ... their court cases unheard for months
The sheriff maintained no prisoners died and none escaped , but later it emerged that arrest warrants had been issued for 14 escaped inmates .
All were recaptured , but not before one of them was re-arrested for another murder while on the run .
Months after the hurricane many were still suffering the consequences of a system peculiar to Louisiana - that of funding public defence lawyers partly from traffic violations revenue .
When the city flooded and the traffic stopped , the money ran out , depriving the poor of their legal rights to a defence .
At one time , the city was reduced to just four defence lawyers , each with an unmanageable caseload .
Prisoners were dispersed and held throughout the state , their charges delayed , their court cases unheard for months .
Destroying the evidence
For those convicted of serious crimes and hoping for a reprieve , however , there were graver consequences still .
Vital forensic evidence stored in a basement was destroyed
Forensic evidence stored in the courthouse basement was destroyed , dashing hopes of justice for those wrongly convicted of rape and murder .
Lawyer Dwight Doskey represents clients on death row .
" There will be people - and I 've got one in particular that I 'm worried about - who may have been exonerated by DNA if the evidence had been stored in a safe place .
Those are the people that I feel sorriest for , " he says .
New Orleans is notorious both for its low murder clear - up rate and its wrong convictions .
But for those at the bottom of the social heap - the poorest prisoners in one of America 's poorest states - Katrina brought a justice system already near to collapse , to a standstill .
This World : Prisoners of Katrina was broadcast on Sunday 13 August , 2006 , at 2200 BST on BBC Two .
