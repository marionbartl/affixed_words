Sept. 22 , 2009  --
Anyone selling cigarettes flavored with cloves , fruit – anything but menthol – is a criminal under a ban that marks the first assault in a new war on tobacco .
The law , enacted this summer and kicking in today , directs the FDA to crack down on candy and fruit - flavored cigarettes that public health officials say turn children into life - long nicotine addicts .
" These flavored cigarettes are a gateway for many children and young adults to become regular smokers , " FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg told reporters .
The FDA has sent a letter to tobacco companies warning the agency will take action against those who continue to make , distribute or sell flavored cigarettes in violation of the law .
Border agents have been instructed to block imports of flavored cigarettes .
Federal officials and tobacco control advocates could not say exactly how many people use these products .
But Dr. Lawrence Deyton , head of the FDA 's new Center for Tobacco Products , said they are favored by teens .
" Studies show that 17 - year - old smokers are three times as likely to use flavored cigarettes as smokers over the age of 25 , " Deyton said .
Tobacco companies sweeten their cigarettes because " flavors make cigarettes and other tobacco products more appealing to youth , " he added .
Deyton read what he called " a historic memo " from one tobacco manufacturer , outlining plans to directly target children by making " a cigarette that 's obviously youth - oriented " and by featuring " flavor which would be candy - like but give the satisfaction of a cigarette . "
Calling tobacco addiction a " public health catastrophe , " one of the Obama administration 's top officials , Assistant Secretary for Health Howard Koh , put the cigarette industry on notice that this is just the beginning of a " new chapter in public health efforts at tobacco control . "
The law will require tobacco companies to register with the FDA .
And Deyton said the agency will soon require those cigarette makers to turn over information about the " constituent components of tobacco products . "
The FDA will work with CDC scientists to investigate the safety of those ingredients .
An Unprecedented Effort
It 's all part of an unprecedented federal effort to reduce what Koh said is a public health threat that causes 438,000 deaths – one of every five deaths - each year .
Adults who smoke , he said , die an average of 14 years earlier than non-smokers .

Opinion
The menace of the public option A Satire
Of all the current assaults on our noble republic , perhaps none is more dangerous than the public option - specifically , the public library option .
For far too long , this menace has undermined the very foundations of our economy .
While companies like Amazon and Barnes & Noble struggle valiantly each day to sell books , these communistic cabals known as libraries undercut the hard work of good corporate citizens by letting people read their books for free .
How is the private sector supposed to compete with free ?
And just what does this public option give us ?
People can spend hours and hours in these dens of socialism without having to buy so much as a cappuccino .
Furthermore , not only can anyone read books for free in the library , they can take them home , too .
They get a simple card that can be used at any library in town .
No checking on the previous condition of books they 've read .
No literacy test .
Nothing .
Yet , do these libertines of literature let you choose any book you want , anytime you want it ?
No .
Have you ever tried to get the latest best - seller at a public library ?
They put you on a waiting list for that , my friend .
And if you do ask these government apparatchiks a question about a book , they start talking your ear off , and pretty soon they 're telling you what to read .
Of course , if you break one of their petty rules and return a book late , you have to pay fines that mount grotesquely each day .
Even if you die , your overdue fees keep piling up .
Is that not a death tax ?
How long must the elderly live in fear of burdening their children with these unfair sanctions on their estates ?
Do n't be fooled for a minute .
Somebody has to pay for these " free " libraries , and I 'll tell you who it is , pal .
Those good ol ' suckers , the American taxpayers , that 's who .
Have you ever wondered who 's really behind this public library option ?
And do n't you think it 's fishy that they mask their nefarious activities with benign - sounding names , like Friends of the Library ?
What 's their real agenda - and why do they have so many " volunteer " meetings , anyway ?
No , my fellow Americans .
We cannot wait until we 're all goose - stepped into a massive book checkout line .
This assault on capitalism and our very way of life has got to end .
Be subversive ... burn your library card !
Go out and buy a book !
Google Sidewiki is a new feature being added today to the Google Toolbar that allows anyone to leave comments about pages as they surf the web .
Love something you ’re reading ?
Hate it ?
You can share your views with others who visit the page and who also have Sidewiki enabled .
Share , that is , if Google thinks your comment is good enough .
NOTE : Sidewiki is set to launch at 8 am Pacific Time today .
This post was originally scheduled to go live then , but the news started leaking out .
The Sidewiki link above should start working then .
There have been any number of similar tools like this over the years , so many that I ’ve lost track of their names ( Third Voice was one — thanks , Ethan Kaplan ) .
None really caught on .
But this is Google , with millions of toolbars installed .
That ’s no guarantee of success that Sidewiki will get used , but it ’s certainly worth sitting up and taking notice of .
Below , how the Sidewiki system works .
Sidewiki Phone Home
To use Sidewiki , you have to get the latest version of the Google Toolbar for either Internet Explorer or Firefox ( Google Chrome is n’t yet supported ) .
For it to work , you have to enable the “ enhanced ” version of the Toolbar :
This means allowing the toolbar to report back to Google about all the pages you view .
If Google does n’t know the page you ’re visiting , it ca n’t send back any Sidewiki information that ’s available .
It ’s not new for the toolbar to send information back to Google , if certain features are enabled .
It has operated this way for nearly a decade , for anyone who uses the toolbar for PageRank viewing .
Those using the toolbar as part of Google ’s Web History feature also let information flow back .
In all these cases , information only flows back if the user expressly enables the toolbar to do so .
Do n’t like the idea of Google tracking what you view via the toolbar ?
Then do n’t enable the enhanced features .
Also see Google Search History Expands , Becomes Web History for more about toolbar tracking and privacy issues .
You ’ve Got Sidewiki !
Comfortable with tracking ?
Then here ’s what you see with Sidewiki enabled , when you come to a page that has Sidewiki information associated with it .
In this example , the Google home page itself :
See that little note bubble that the arrow is pointing at ?
That tiny sliver of a border , along with the bubble , lets you know that Sidewiki information is available .
If you click bubble or the >> tab , the Sidewiki panel opens up like this :
Behold , comments !
The comments are being shown within a separate browser window .
They ’re not overlaid onto the original page , as some tools have done in the past or still do .
Nor is the page framed .
The page URL does n’t change .
The browser just opens up a different window alongside the original page , where related Sidewiki information is shown .
All Comments Are Not Created Equal
What comments are shown , and in what order ?
Google secret sauce time .
The official line is this :
Using multiple signals based on the quality of the entry , what we know about the author , and user - contributed signals such as voting and flagging , we work hard to ensure that only the highest quality , most relevant entries appear in the sidebar .
Most of the engineering work for Sidewiki was dedicated to this ranking algorithm .
When I talking with Google about Sidewiki , they gave me a few other factors , such as :
Use of sophisticated language : “ This page sucks ” is n’t sophisticated ; think complex sentences and ideas .
Apparently , Google has a language sophistication detector now , and one that works in the 14 different languages that Sidewiki supports .
: “ This page sucks ” is n’t sophisticated ; think complex sentences and ideas .
Apparently , Google has a language sophistication detector now , and one that works in the 14 different languages that Sidewiki supports .
User ’s reputation :
Are your comments being voted up or flagged down ?
: Are your comments being voted up or flagged down ?
User ’s history :
How long have you had a Google Profile ?
How long have you been commenting ?
ProfileRank
See that mention of Google Profiles in there ?
Got yours yet ?
If not , read our past article , Hoping To Improve People Search , Google Launches “ Profile Results ” .
It covers how Google Profiles were expanded earlier this year , and what you can do to improve yours
Just as Google gives any page on the web a PageRank score that reflects its authority , so too does each Google Profile page have its own form of what I ’d call either “ personal PageRank ” or “ ProfileRank , ” when it comes to the Sidewiki system .
Those with more ProfileRank have a better shot of their comments appearing .
ProfileRank alone is n’t enough , however .
The content of the web page , the quality of the comment and many other factors are taken into account .
Unfortunately , you have no way of knowing your ProfileRank .
For example , look at my Danny Sullivan profile , and there ’s nothing that indicates the degree of reputation I carry within the Sidewiki system .
That ’s something Google said they ’d consider changing , when I raised it , but there are no immediate plans to do so .
Profiles , by the way , are supposed to reflect all the comments a particular person has made .
When I looked during testing , these were n’t showing , so I do n’t have a screenshot example .
But this is supposed to be activated when Sidewiki goes public .
Comments & The Quality Threshold
As discussed , Google spent a lot of time trying to figure how to rank the comments that are shown .
Moreover , not all comments even make the cut .
Some pages might not show a Sidewiki tab , even if there ’s Sidewiki material , unless that threshold is reached .
Similarly , some comments might not be shown until readers “ Next ” their way deeper .
Those deemed of lower quality get flagged , as shown below in a further example from Google ’s home page :
Sorry , Mike .
Also be aware that you ’ll always see your own comments , regardless of the threshold factor .
If you want to see what others view , sign - out of Sidewiki .
You ’ll still be able to see Sidewiki information when signed out .
You just wo n’t be able to add new material , and your own material wo n’t be elevated to the top .
If At First The Comments Do n’t Succeed , Try Showing Blog Posts
Since the system is brand new , to help jump - start its usefulness , Google may show related blog entries for a page that lacks comments .
You can see this in the example below for the Twitter home page :
The first three results all seem decent enough , but the fourth ?
Odd .
And later in my testing , that one dropped out .
Still , I have a personal reason to think the system behind selecting blog posts to show is n’t that great .
When looking at blog posts about Bing , Sidewiki listed only one item worth showing :
OK , that ’s legendary tech columnist Walt Mossberg making the cut .
No complaints there .
But when you drill further into more comments :
You get multiple posts from TechCrunch and ReadWriteWeb , as shown above .
Those are great sources , but why not some variety ?
Keep drilling down into more comments , and you get some different sources but not one single article from Search Engine Land about Bing .
We ’ve written some of the most extensive coverage about Bing that ’s out there .
None of our posts make the cut at all ?
First , Google told me this :
The idea is that we recognize that blogs are another great source of informative and helpful content , so we try to include blog posts when we determine they are relevant about a particular URL .
This is done algorithmically , and we use the same algorithm for ranking blog entries as we do for user entries .
Right now since there are so few user entries , the majority you will see browsing the web are blog entries , but that should n’t be the case after many people are contributing content .
Uh huh .
I pressed further .
Give us some factors that might be at play here , please !
The immediate thought that came to my mind was that because Search Engine Land does n’t serve out a full text feed of our stories , we might be hurting ourselves against other sites .
Yes , Google confirmed that was part of the issue .
Google also added that user feedback from the “ Useful ” also has an influence .
The Useful Buttons
Select any Sidewiki entry , and you ’ll see that you ’re asked if the entry is “ useful ” along with a Yes / No choice .
You can also see the total number of votes .
In addition , if you think a comment is out - of - line for some reason , you can select the “ Report Abuse ” option .
Making Comments
So how do you actually put your thoughts out there ?
Easy .
When you come to a page , click on the Sidewiki button , which will make a comment entry window open :
Once done , save your entry , and that ’s it .
You can embed links using HTML code ( they ’ll be nofollow ones that do n’t pass link juice ) .
You can also drop a YouTube link into a comment , and a video embed frame will automatically be generated .
Need to change your comment ?
Use the edit option at the bottom of the entry :
You can also delete it using an option also at the bottom .
In addition to commenting on a page , you can also comment about particular parts of a page .
For example , say there ’s a quote on a page you ’re viewing .
You can highlight the quote , then make a Sidewiki entry that ’s associated with just that text .
Then there ’s some further magic .
If that quote appears on other pages , your comment will be associated in the right place on those pages as well .
Sharing Comments
Each comment exists as a standalone URL , such as this one I made about the Twitter home page .
Anyone can read Sidewiki entries , even if they do NOT have the toolbar .
In fact , Google encourages that the links be shared .
At the bottom of each comment is a share option .
When selected , this allows you to copy a link to the entry , email the link , or send the link to Twitter or Facebook .
Page Owner / Site Owner Comments
Not so thrilled with the idea that people might leave comments on your site ?
I suspect many will be uneasy about this , especially if competitors begin link dropping .
Unfortunately , there ’s no way you can block the comments from being displayed .
You can , however , claim the first comment for yourself .
If you ’ve verified ownership of a site through Google Webmaster Central , then you ’ll see a special notice whenever you comment on one of your own pages :
Tick the box , and your comment will come above all others .
If you ’ve shared ownership of your site with several people , then any of them will also see this option .
How about making your comment long so that you push off all others ?
That wo n’t work , as Google condenses comments and adds a “ more ” link when there are more than can be shown .
However , in addition to making an official top - of - page owner comment , you can also make additional comments that will be interspersed according to the comment ranking algorithm .
Comment Envy
As I wrote this , I kept having to stop myself from writing Searchwiki rather than Sidewiki .
SearchWiki , released almost a year ago ( see Google SearchWiki Launches , Lets You Build Your Own Search Results Page ) , is a system designed to let people leave comments associated with search results pages .
Since that time , the system seems to have gone nowhere .
I seldom encounter people saying they ’re using it .
Soon after it launched , working with Enquisite , I found practically no traffic was being driven to Search Engine Land from pages where we had good SearchWiki representation .
In short , SearchWiki feels like a dud .
Google Knol launched last year was designed to promote high quality authorship .
Despite fears it would be come a new Wikipedia , it also largely feels like a dud .
A system inviting people in the news to comment on Google News certainly was a dud , being closed in July after running for nearly two years .
Sidewiki feels like another swing at something Google seems to desperately desires — a community of experts offering high quality comments .
Google says that ’s something that its cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted more than a system for ranking web pages .
They really wanted a system to annotate pages across the web .
Of course , there ’s a way this already happens , through existing commenting system that many sites have .
Google may produce unease in some quarters by pushing its own would - be universal commenting system ( through an API , anyone can have Sidewiki comments be embedded into their actual pages ) .
Others tired of moderation and spam fighting may feel relieve that Google might provide more relevant comments .
Certainly Google ’s goal is to be something more than another commenting system .
“ I think we would have failed if people were using it to say ‘ Obama sucks ’ , ” said Sundar Pichai , vice president of product management at Google .
That ’s not to say the system is meant to promote pro-Obama comments !
Rather , the hope is to produce more intelligent and thoughtful comments regardless of a particular position about Obama or any other topic .
“ If those are the comments we ’re surfacing , [ Sidewiki ] would n’t be that much different than much of the web .
What we ’re really trying to do is add value from people who really know what they ’re talking about , ” he said .

Israel received an uncomfortable reminder of international anger over the Gaza war today when lawyers representing 16 Palestinians asked a London court to issue an arrest warrant for its defence minister , Ehud Barak , who is visiting Britain .
After a day of delays and legal wrangling the bid failed on the grounds that Barak enjoyed diplomatic immunity from prosecution .
But the episode triggered a brief storm that is likely to give Israeli officials second thoughts about the risk of prosecution in foreign courts .
Barak was last night addressing a fringe meeting at the Labour party conference in Brighton , and is due to meet Gordon Brown and David Miliband , the foreign secretary ‑— triggering new protests .
Furious Israeli officials insisted all day that he was protected by diplomatic immunity and could not be legally detained .
The action related to alleged war crimes and breaches of the Geneva conventions during the Gaza offensive , launched by Israel last December in response to Palestinian rocket attacks and widely criticised .
The death toll is disputed , but the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem says 1,387 Palestinians died , including 773 people not taking part in hostilities .
Solicitors asked a district judge at the City of Westminster magistrates court to issue a warrant for the minister 's arrest under the 1988 Criminal Justice Act , which gives courts in England and Wales universal jurisdiction in war crimes cases .
The hearing was postponed while the court asked the Foreign Office to clarify Barak 's status in the UK .
The lawyers making the application said they believed a warrant could be issued even if he was in Britain in an official capacity .
Intensive contacts were understood to have taken place throughout the day between London and Jerusalem .
Barak is also deputy prime minister of Israel and leader of the country 's Labour party .
Lawyers from Irvine Thanvi Natas and Imran Khan & Partners said they believed the warrant that the international criminal court issued in May last year for the arrest of Omar al - Bashir , the president of Sudan , offered a precedent .
Bashir is accused of committing war crimes in Darfur .
The issue is politically explosive .
Israel 's ambassador to Britain , Ron Prosor , lambasted the move as the " continuation of the process of demonisation and the de-legitimisation of Israel , " and called the action " spiteful " .
Deputy district judge Daphne Wickham said allegations of war crimes had been well documented , but added : " I am satisfied that under customary international law Mr Barak has immunity from prosecution as he would not be able to perform his functions efficiently if he were the subject of criminal proceedings in this jurisdiction . "
The accusations were based , in part , on a UN investigation conducted by the former South African judge Richard Goldstone .
It concluded this month that Israel had committed war crimes by deliberately attacking civilians and firing white phosphorus shells .
Israel rejected its findings as irredeemably biased .
The 575 - page report also found that Hamas , the group controlling Gaza , may be guilty of committing war crimes by firing rockets at Israeli civilian targets .
Goldstone warned that unless Israel conducted investigations conforming to international standards , its officials could face action by the international criminal court or national prosecutions of the kind attempted in London .
Michel Massih QC , for the applicants , argued that the court needed to be satisfied only that Barak faced war crimes allegations , and that the question of immunity should be considered only after his arrest .
Massih added that international law " places a direct responsibility not only on those who pull the trigger , but on those higher up the chain of command " .
Israeli media reported that Barak had been warned about the impending legal action and urged to leave the UK for France .
But he had decided to carry on with his schedule as there was no doubt he enjoyed diplomatic immunity .
In 2005 , human rights groups criticised British authorities for failing to arrest Doron Almog , an Israeli general for whom an arrest warrant for alleged war crimes had been issued , when his aircraft landed at Heathrow .
Almog stayed on the plane and was allowed to return to Israel .
In June a Spanish court shelved an investigation launched into a July 2002 air strike by Israel on a Hamas target in the Gaza Strip .
The suspects named included the former Israeli defence minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer and six current or former officers or security officials .
Massih said : " If the Israeli courts were themselves to investigate , there would be no need to have recourse to international tribunals . "
The Council for Arab - British Understanding condemned Brown for agreeing to meet Barak .
" It is a disgrace to fete a man who is imposing one of the harshest sieges ever imposed on a civilian population , one that has deprived them even of the most basic necessities of life , " said the council 's director , Chris Doyle .
" It is vital that British ministers send out a strong signal that Britain will stand up for international law and justice and refuse to meet Ehud Barak . "

As a business person , one of your primary goals is to be well known globally .
As your business thrives , you encounter more challenges .
For instance , you have to deal with the language barrier once you enter the global market .
In fact , you ’re likely to encounter this problem even if you ’re only offering your business locally .
Challenges when it comes to the language barrier do not only affect businesses .
Even individuals sometimes deal with such an issue .
For instance , some people might find themselves needing arabic translation montreal when applying for immigrant Visa to the Middle East .
One thing is for sure , though .
Seeking the services of translation agencies is the best way to go .
If ever you find yourself needing to translate a document or any other issue concerning translation , do not hesitate to seek the services of companies who offer translation services .

Classical music is not only great for relaxing , it can be actively enjoyed as well .
You 're in no danger of switching out Led Zeppelin 's box set or The Chronic for Classical Concertos in the Key of C , but if you 're thinking it 's time to deepen your musical repertoire , we 've got the perfect launching point into the greatest hits list of classical music .
So you 're at the point where you 've decided that becoming familiar with at least the rudiments of classical music is an important part of your development into a more sophisticated , urbane , worldly man .
You still love Metallica , or Jay - Z or The Killers or Flogging Molly or Mongolian goat - roping music or whatever your particular thing happens to be , but you 're unsure how to approach the vast , nebulous , intimidating world of ‘ classical ' music .
( Let 's forget for a moment the gross inaccuracy of lumping all the music mentioned in this article under one generic term ; when I say ‘ classical ' music , we all know what I 'm talking about , and all the music here could fit under that monstrous umbrella . )
Nothing like a ‘ Top Ten Pieces of Classical Music That Must Be Heard Above All Others ' list to get the ball rolling , so let me explain the format :
I 've picked ten pieces , all of which are extremely well - known to classical aficionados , most of which are well - known to the wider world .
I 'll include a brief note on the piece , as well as a recommendation or two of other works or composers that might be appealing if you enjoy that particular work .
For some help with terminology and listening approaches , see my previous article , How to Talk About Classical Music .
Some works have well - known nicknames , rarely attributed to the work by the composer himself .
I 'm sure those in the know will skewer me for leaving out any one of ten thousand other possible choices , but three main factors have guided my selection of this list as a whole , not necessarily each particular piece on this list .
They are : accessibility , popularity , and variety , both stylistic and temporal .
In no particular order , here they are :
1. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , Eine Kleine Nachtmusik
If you do n't recognize this immediately upon hearing it , you 've been living in a cave since the day you were born .
Please step into the light , pull your fingers out of your ears , and begin your journey towards joining the human race .
Simple , elegant , beautiful , utterly timeless .
If you like this try : string quartets by Mozart or Luigi Boccherini , chamber music by Ignaz Pleyel or Carl Maria von Weber .
2. Johann Sebastian Bach , The Goldberg Variations
One of the most important classical recordings of the twentieth century ( on any list ) is oddball Canadian genius Glenn Gould ’s 1955 recording of The Goldberg Variations , a keyboard suite by J.S. Bach , master of the Baroque .
Connoisseurs often point to his 1981 recording of the same work as better than the 1955 .
Either way , you wo n’t go wrong .
Sublime and stirring , the opening movement of the work is as soulful and beautiful as you could possibly want .
If you like this try : Bach ’s French Suites , English Suites , The Well - Tempered Clavier .
Keyboard pieces by Domenico Scarlatti or G.F. Handel .
3. Antonio Vivaldi , The Four Seasons
This is a set of four concertos , named –you guessed it–one for each season .
Also from the Baroque era , each concerto consists of three movements , and they are very programmatic–that is , different themes represent specific scenes or events through sound .
If you listen closely it 's not hard to hear a harvest - time barn dance , slippery winter ice , birds singing , growling thunder and sudden storm .
Certain segments of this are extremely popular and you will definitely recognize them .
If you like this try : some of Vivaldi's 500 other concertos , Arcangelo Corelli , Bach ’s Brandenburg Concertos , Concerti Grossi by George Frederic Handel .
4. Georges Bizet , Carmen
There 's a popular joke amongst art music aficionados that all the best Spanish classical music was written by Frenchmen .
What , no laughter ?
I guess you have to be a big music nerd like me to find that funny .
Yes , Carmen is an opera , written by a Frenchman and set in Spain .
Considered by many to be the most perfect opera ever written , it 's ridiculously popular and will make you sound more educated and sophisticated to be able to recognize the arias from this work .
If you 're only ever going to know one opera , it might as well be this one .
And who knows ?
You might even become a secret opera lover …
If you like this try : Other Popular Operas : Gioachino Rossini , The Barber of Seville ( Bugs Bunny music ) , Giacomo Puccini , La Boheme .
Spanish - themed classical music : Symphonie Espagnole by Edouard Lalo , Bolero by Maurice Ravel ( both Frenchmen ) .
5. Ludwig van Beethoven , Symphony No. 6 ( Pastoral )
More program music here , but in a very different style from Vivaldi .
If you ever watched
Disney 's Fantasia as a kid you 'll know this one .
Beethoven wrote grand , fantastic symphonies on a scale that went far beyond any who had gone before him .
His nine symphonies are one of the artistic pinnacles of Western civilization , and No. 6 is my personal favorite .
Imagine an idyllic walk through a central European countryside as you listen , and the music will unfold like magic .
If you like this try : Beethoven 's 5th and 9th Symphonies , symphonic works by Franz Schubert and Felix Mendelssohn .
Great symphonies from other time periods include Gustav Mahler ’s Symphony No. 1 in D Major ( the ‘ Titan ’ ) , Mozart ’s Symphony No. 41 in C Major ( the ‘ Jupiter ) , Symphonie Fantastique ( programmatic ) by Hector Berlioz , Symphony No. 6 in B Minor ( the ‘ Pathetique ) by Tchaikovsky .
La Mer by Claude Debussy ( also programmatic ; so much so that it is considered a tone poem . )
6. George Frederic Handel , Messiah
Handel was one of the greatest composers of oratorios who ever lived .
An oratorio could be thought of as an opera with no costumes , staging or movement : the singers and chorus stand there and perform a long work that typically tells a continuous story .
The Messiah , usually performed around Christmas time , tells the story of the birth , life and death of Jesus .
The Hallelujah chorus just might be the most well - known classical tune in the world , but there are so many great tunes here it ’s impossible to list them all .
If you like this try : Handel 's other oratorios , such as Samson or Solomon .
Masses by Franz Joseph Haydn , cantatas by J.S. Bach , Vivaldi ’s Gloria .
7. Igor Stravinsky , The Rite of Spring
This is a ballet .
Before you ask me where my pink tutu is , know that this ballet is about ritualistic pagan sacrifices and ends with the slaughtering of a young girl , and was so controversial that it caused a riot when it premiered in 1913 .
Yes , this one was also in Fantasia ( the dinosaur thing ) but I 'm not mining Walt Disney for music ; it 's just coincidence , and the fact that this is great music .
Do n't look for catchy melodies to hum in this one ; it 's all atmosphere , violent , percussive clashing , atonal dissonance and off - beat rhythms .
Well - worth a listen if you want to challenge yourself a bit .
Listen to it three times and you 'll be hooked for life .
If you like this try : Stravinsky 's other ballet suites like The Firebird and Petrushka ; Arnold Schoenberg ( if the whole atonalism thing turns you on ) .
8. Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina , Missa Papae Marcelli
‘ Early music , ' as the term is used among musicologists , loosely describes all music before 1750 , which was the end of the Baroque era .
This work , composed during the Renaissance , definitely qualifies .
The legend has it that the Catholic Church was considering banning all music that was polyphonic , or exhibiting two or more independent melody lines running simultaneously .
‘ Too confusing and / or lascivious , ’ they said .
Supposedly Palestrina composed this work as a defense of polyphony , and it was heard by the proper authorities , who determined that polyphony could indeed be used in church music , and therefore this one work by Palestrina , dedicated to a pope who reigned for all of three weeks , changed the course of music history .
Good story , no one really knows how much truth there is to it , but this is a summation of the finest strands of Renaissance vocal music and is stupendously , gloriously beautiful .
The Kyrie especially is positively transcendental , whether or not you are the religious type .
If you like this try : Miserere mei , Deus by Gregorio Allegri ( usually just called ‘ Allegri ’s Misere . ’ )
Choral works by Thomas Tallis , Tomas Luis de Victoria , Josquin des Prez .
9. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky , Piano Concerto No. 1
In 1958 , at the height of the Cold War , the Soviets held the first quadrennial Tchaikovsky Piano Competition in Moscow .
The unlikely winner was a lanky young Texan by the name of Van Cliburn , who , even in those extremely tense , nationalistic times , so wowed the world that he became an overnight celebrity , and the Russians began calling him ‘ Vanka , ’ ( ‘ our little Van ’ . )
I ’ve had the pleasure of hearing Vanka play this work live ; it ’s his signature piece , and with one ferocious concert he propelled it into the public consciousness forever .
If you like this try : Other good piano concertos of widely varying styles : Sergei Rachmaninov , Piano Concerto No. 3 . , Piano Concerto No. 5 by Beethoven ( the ‘ Emperor ’ concerto , ) Piano Concerto in A minor by Edvard Grieg .
Piano music generally : Beethoven ’s piano sonatas ( try the Hammerklavier or Sonata quasi una fantasia ( ‘ Moonlight . ) , anything by Frederic Chopin or Franz Liszt .
10 . Dmitri Shostakovich , String Quartet No. 8 in C Minor
Shostakovich was a tragic figure whose genius managed to shine even through the stifling censorship of the Soviet regime under which he lived .
The string quartet is one of the most important compositional vehicles in classical music , and Shostakovich ( along with Beethoven , Mozart , Haydn , Bela Bartok ) is considered one of the masters of this form .
This particular work was written over the course of a few days in Dresden in 1960 when the composer was said to have been contemplating suicide .
Dark , furious , intense , melancholy , brooding — officially this work was composed as a memorial for the victims of fascism , but Shostakovich may have really intended a broader message , that of repudiation of totalitarianism in general ( which would of course include the Soviet government … )
If you like this try : other Shostakovich string quartets , definitely the Beethoven string quartets ( the ‘ Razumovsky ’ quartets are some of my favorites ) , String Quartet No. 12 in F ( the ‘ American ’ ) by Antonin Dvorak .
String quartets by Bartok , one delightful one by Debussy .
Well there you have it : my list , highly subjective , intensely ruminated over , and by no means complete .
If you were to listen to all of these recordings it would give you a well - rounded feel for the vast sweep of ‘ classical music , ’ and expose you to the tremendous variety therein .
Hit me up in the comments sections with any questions or complaints ; I ’ll be happy to address them .

Those who claim to have a revolutionary anarchist / libertarian socialist program present one of three approaches : Sectarianism , Reformism ( or Centrism ) , and a genuinely Revolutionary ( or Transitional ) approach .
Three Approaches to a Revolutionary Program Sectarianism , Reformism , and the Revolutionary Approach
A revolutionary organization is built around its program .
It embodies its program , which is why people join it .
The program includes its ultimate goals , that is , its vision of a new , self - managed , society .
The program includes an analysis of what the existing society is and how it works .
It includes a strategy for getting from where we are to where we want to go .
I do not mean only a discussion of how the workers in the course of a revolution could begin to build the new society ( such as Kropotkins Conquest of Bread ) , but how to get from the existing , nonrevolutionary , situation to that revolution .
These are all essential parts of a program for revolutionary , working class , libertarian - democratic , socialism .
( I will refer to this as anarchism ,  but , for the purposes of this essay , I am including autonomous Marxism , Left Communism , pareconism , etc. )
In broad outline , there are three possible approaches : sectarianism , reformism or centrism , and a truly revolutionary approach .
1 ) Sectarianism
This is also called the ultra - left approach , although not by me .
(  Ultra - leftism  is usually a term of abuse by leftists for those who are further left . )
This approach also starts from a vision of a better world and even of how a revolution could start to build it .
This vision could be excellent ; that is not the problem with it .
But it lacks a strategy for getting from a situation where most people , even when they struggle , do not aim for anarchism , to one where they will participate in an anarchist revolution .
Quite the contrary .
The sectarian approach says to nonrevolutionary people : Stop struggling for what you want .
Forget about your goals .
Instead , you should fight for our goals , which are so much better .
You workers may want a better standard of living for your families , but we say that consumerism is corrupting and these are just crumbs to buy you off .
Instead we urge you to demand what we regard as a liberated life .
You want to form unions in order to win benefits and better working conditions , but unions are agencies of the bosses and not worth fighting for .
You want freedom of assembly , freedom of religion , an end to gender or racial discrimination , but these are only bourgeois - democratic demands , consistent with capitalism , rather than socialism .
Workers and small farmers in exploited countries want to determine their own future , without the domination of foreign countries , but we want you to ignore imperial rule in favor of proletarian internationalism , which we counterpose to national self - determination .
The same goes for any other goals , such as clean air , ecological balance , ending nuclear energy , withdrawing from immediate wars , etc .
Since these are presumably not the same as libertarian communism , drop them in favor of our ultimate program .
For example , recently there has been a massive rebellion in Iran due to the fraudulent election .
The outrage has spread through much of society , from the middle class to organized labor .
Yet , I am told that certain Iranian Left Communists have refused to endorse the struggle against the stolen elections .
Not that they have been staying home , but they pose their demonstrations as distinct from the demand for honest elections ( although in fact , their opportunity to mobilize is only due to the mass rebellion ) .
Of course , revolutionary libertarian socialists could not endorse any of the election candidates ( all of whom are openly pro-capitalist and supporters of the  Islamic Republic ) .
But they could have chosen to support the right of the Iranian people to determine their own government ( or non-government someday ) .
They might have made demands on the bourgeois politicians or on the unions to call a general strike for political democracy , in order to expose the politicians and union officials .
Such situations arise repeatedly .
Right now a similar struggle for the right of people to elect their government is happening in Honduras .
Should anarchists be too pure to look for ways to participate in these struggles ?
It was just such sectarian logic which caused the Communist Parties to refuse to make alliances with Socialists and anarchists against the Fascists in Italy in the 20s and against the Nazis in Germany in the 30s .
( see Price 2007 ; chapter 11 ,  The Fight Against Nazism in Germany ) .
2 ) Reformism and Centrism
An apparently alternate approach is that of reformism .
Unlike the liberals , reformists aim for a new and better society than capitalism .
Like the liberals , reformists hope to improve society by step - by - gradual - step changes , without the need for an overturn of the capitalist class and its state .
However , there are those who are ( sincerely ) for a revolution but in practice act like reformists .
They are in the political center between reformists and revolutionaries and have been historically called centrists .
Quite a number of anarchists are in this category : revolutionaries in word but reformists in deed .
( Although this is sometimes called opportunism ,  it is not a matter of personal sincerity or integrity , but of program . )
Reformists and centrists seem like the opposite of sectarians , but this superficial .
Like the sectarians , they have no strategy for going from the unrevolutionary present to the revolutionary goal .
There is an unbridgeable gap between the two .
In practice , sectarians and centrists just chose different sides of the gap .
( This is why the same people can be centrist on one issue , such as unions , but sectarian on another , such as national self - determination . )
Their method is to start from where most people are and , at most , to advocate moving just a bit to the left , to the next step . 
The reformists and centrists see themselves as the best builders of the unions or the anti-war movement or whatever , and proclaim that their program is simply a logical extension of unionism , nationalism , bourgeois feminism , etc .
They do not present the revolutionary program as a qualitative break from business unionism , nationalism , or bourgeois feminism .
The reformists are likely to justify this as due to a need to maintain good relations with union officials and movement leaders  liberals who are overt supporters of capitalism .
As the reformists may point out , the union officials are sometimes to the left of the ranks , at least in their formal programs .
This may be so , but the union bureaucrats , as a layer , are representatives of the capitalist class within the working class .
They tie the unions to the Democratic Party and are committed to keeping the system working .
When push comes to shove , they will hold back the struggle .
It is certainly useful to have good relations with the officials , all other things being equal , but not at the expense of abandoning advocacy of the revolution .
Alternately , centrists are likely to justify a nonrevolutionary approach by pointing to the nonrevolutionary consciousness of the workers .
If we radicals are too far to the left , supposedly the workers will not listen to us .
We must not get ahead of the workers , they say .
Gradually , the workers will move step by step to the left , until they become revolutionary .
This assumes a static consciousness on the part of the workers .
It ignores the way in which crises push workers to re-think their assumptions and to become open to ideas which they had previously rejected so that consciousness may change by leaps , not gradual steps .
It ignores the way in which working people change , not everyone all at once , but in layers of workers .
If revolutionaries are trying to stay on the level of the most conservative workers , we may miss the movement of the most radicalized , advanced , workers .
Popular consciousness is mixed .
Workers and oppressed people hold both conservative and radical ideas .
They are patriotic and anti-war , for universal health care but anti-socialist , for civil liberties but for repressing terrorists ,  etc .
This is the expected result of capitalisms impact on consciousness .
A minority of workers and oppressed come to a consistently revolutionary consciousness .
Their job is to organize themselves and to educate other workers .
Otherwise , the advanced workers will be behind the mass of moderate and conservative workers , instead of in front .
( This centrist method has been called tailism ,  for good reason . )
The Maoists call this approach  the mass line .
This means to find out what the workers want and then organize for that .
They use this method precisely because they dare not tell the workers and peasants what the Maoists will really give them , namely totalitarian state capitalism .
So they claim to be for what the people want .
The same is true of the reformists , when it comes down to it .
They cannot say that they intend to maintain capitalist exploitation , war , ecological destruction , racism , and patriarchy .
So they give the workers what they want .
3 ) Revolutionary or Transitional Approach In The Communist Manifesto ( a work which revolutionary anarchists can mostly agree with ) , Marx and Engels wrote ,  The communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims , for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class ; but in the movement of the present they also represent and take care of the future of that movement .
The communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things .
In all these movements , they bring to the front , as the leading condition in each case , the property question  ( section IV ; pp. 45 - 46 ) .
160 years later , this is still a valid approach ( actually , in this passage , they are mostly writing about the need to participate in struggles for bourgeois - democratic rights , so that the workers may straightway use [ them ] as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie ; p. 45 ) .
At the 1907 International Anarchist Congress , there was a dispute between Pierre Monatte and Errico Malatesta .
Monatte argued that it was time for anarchists to end their existence as small propaganda groups , let alone advocating insurrections and terrorism , in favor of building mass labor unions ( syndicates , hence  syndicalism ) .
In this , he was right .
But Malatesta , while for unions , was concerned that revolutionary anarchists would dissolve themselves as a force into the unions .
Therefore he advocated that anarchists maintain revolutionary organizations which would work inside and outside the unions , supporting strikes and other actions but also being involved in every possible struggle while always raising the anarchist goal .
 Whatever may be the practical results of the struggle for immediate gains , the greatest value lies in the struggle itself .
For thereby workers learn that the bosses  interests are opposed to theirs and that they cannot improve their conditions , and much less emancipate themselves , except by uniting and becoming stronger than the bosses .
They will in the end understand that to make their victory secure and definitive , it is necessary to destroy capitalism .
 While demanding complete freedom , we must support all struggles for partial freedom , because we are convinced that one learns through struggle .
We must always be with the people , and when we do not succeed in getting them to demand a lot we must still seek to get them to want something ; and we must make every effort to get them to understand that however much or little they demand should be obtained by their own efforts  ( Malestata , 1984 ; pp. 191 & 195 ) .
The aim is to build a bridge ( or transition ,  hence transitional ) between the partial , limited , struggles and the ultimate need for a socialist - anarchist revolution .
We have to find out what people want , not in order to start the program from that but in order to show people that the way to definitely win what they want is through anarchist revolution ( by their own efforts  ) .
The program starts not from present consciousness but from an objective evaluation of needs .
If humanity is to avoid a deep depression , fascism , nuclear wars , and ecological catastrophe , then an international revolution by the workers and all oppressed is necessary .
This is both an objective analysis ( that humanity is threatened with these evils ) and a value judgment ( that a depression , wars , etc. are evils ) .
Anyone who concludes that there is little or no threat of war or destruction should stick with reformist methods .
There is no guaranteed technique for making appropriate transitional demands .
The goal is to raise limited issues to class - wide , society - wide , demands .
Loss of jobs or incomes at a few places should be countered with demands for guaranteed jobs for all , provided for by the government ( which claims to represent the community ) and managed by the workers .
When businesses are closed down , the demand should be for expropriation of the owners and turning the businesses over to worker and community cooperatives .
And so on .
While such demands are not anarchist - communism in its full form , they are part of an anarchist - communist society and therefore something which supporters of capitalism cannot endorse !
Methods of struggle should be advocated such as plant occupations and general strikes , which are much more effective ( if more difficult to do ) than current forms of union struggle ( particularly lobbying bourgeois politicians ! ) .
Again these are not methods which pro-capitalist union officials are capable of using in any consistent fashion .
The aim is NOT to get people to fight for goals which can not be won .
Some reforms can always be won .
And overall , given the decline of capitalism in this period , NO reforms can be won on a consistent and stable basis .
The aim is to increase the depth and militancy of the struggles .
There is no guaranteed textbook method .
( The transitional program approach was codified , but not originated , by Trotsky , but he made several errors in analyzing the period and in moral evaluations . )
In its essence the revolutionary method is a commitment to trying to connect day - to - day struggles and needs to the goal of a libertarian socialist revolution .
We have to work at it on every occasion , in every way .

Streaming with VLC
You can watch the stream in VLC .
Watch UStream on VLC using the RTMP Stream
This process is a bit more involved , but you get a much lower latency stream , hardware acceleration , and 720 p .
First download RTMPDump for Mac , Windows , or the OS you use .
http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/
Install VLC Media Player for your OS : http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html
[ Normally you would have to go to UStream.com and sniff TCP traffic ( using wireshark ) to retrieve the rtmp URL , but we have done the work for you ]
Another Option is to use http://piscui.webear.net/ustream.php online tool to give you the the RTMPDUMP command and URL for UStream .
Once installed , you can run the following commands
Windows
$ rtmpdump.exe -r " rtmp://ustreamlivefs.fplive.net/ustream4live-live/ " -y " stream_live_1_1_1524 " -s " http://static-cdn1.ustream.tv/swf/live/viewer.rsl:96.swf " - W " http://static-cdn1.ustream.tv/swf/live/viewer.rsl:96.swf " -- live -- quiet | " C: \Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe " -
[ Note : On a 64 - bit version of Windows you will need to go to Program Files ( x86 ) ]
Mac OS X
$ rtmpdump -r " rtmp://ustreamlivefs.fplive.net/ustream4live-live/ " -y " stream_live_1_1_1524 " -s " http://static-cdn1.ustream.tv/swf/live/viewer.rsl:96.swf " - W " http://static-cdn1.ustream.tv/swf/live/viewer.rsl:96.swf "

RTMP Notes :
Sometimes UStream changes the SWF ( Flash player link ) and the Stream URL due to load balancing and DNS updates .
To update RTMP URLs and SWF URLs use the online tool ( described above ) here : http://piscui.webear.net/ustream.php
Streaming with mplayer ( Linux )
You can open the TWiT Live stream in mplayer using the following methods :
$ mplayer - aspect 16:9 [ PUT HLS VIDEO STREAM URL HERE ]
Or , save the URL in a text file with a .pls extension , such as twit - live.pls
To load a playlist with mplayer : $ mplayer - aspect 16:9 - playlist twit-live.pls
You can also add the - stereo # option if you only hear audio in one channel .
For example : $ mplayer - stereo 1 - aspect 16:9 - playlist twit-live.pls
Some GNU / Linux systems have an old version of ffmpeg which cannot play the stream .
One workaround for this is to compile a more recent build of ffmpeg , as it uses ffplay directly .
To use ffplay , enter the following :

Caller Audio for The Tech Guy show
A frequent comment is about " caller echo " during the live Tech Guy show .
It is not echo from the caller 's radio , but an artifact of an inappropriate gain increase introduced by equipment that receives the stream down in southern California .
Leo has complained about it for years , has had to answer chatter comments about it for years ( along with chat moderators ) , and there 's nothing more anyone can do about it ( at Leo 's end of the connection ) .
There is a built - in delay of 40 seconds for the show 's broadcast .
If you hear any audio at all from a caller 's radio , it would be from 40 seconds ago .
To hear clean audio of the conversation , you can tune in to a radio station or download the podcast when it is released after editing .
Future expansion
Leo projected on April 2 , 2009 that in five years TWiT Live will be broadcasting from the Moon .
( As of April 2014 , that was not the case . )
Last week in Pittsburgh , the Group of 20 discussed , among other things , reforming the IMF ( Providing liquidity to dictators and tyrants since 1944 ! ) and resolved itself as the permanent world council for international economic cooperation , which is newspeak for the preservation of international economic oppression .
Whatever objective brings together the most powerful people from the most powerful nations in the world , is not wholesome .
They do not have the people ’s interests in mind because the their interests are not the people ’s .
So it is no wonder that a relatively diverse crowd showed up to protest the gathering darkness in Pittsburgh last week , where the Group of 20 met to discuss , among other things , reforming the IMF ( Providing liquidity .
The powers that be do not like dissent .
In particular , they do not like vocal , public displays of dissent which threaten to reveal their fraud .
So thousands of hired guns , bought paid for with the people ’s money were brought in to Pittsburgh last week to secure “ order ” and to silence the people ’s voice of opposition .
The protesters , and many of the students at University of Pittsburgh saw firsthand what a police state looks like :
The photo ( taken from the video on YouTube ) shows a group of heavily armed police officers posing for a group photo with one of their trophies captives .
The purpose of staging such a photograph with someone who is “ innocent until proven guilty ” is psychological warfare .
It is meant to intimidate , debase , and to humiliate the opposition .
It is the exercise of physical strength and brute force .
The motivation is pure malice , the sort of cream which rises to the top of the State ’s violence gangs .
Right out loud , the students and protesters learned ( if they had n’t learned already ) that the police were not there to protect them .
The police arrived in Pittsburgh in their professional capacities as soldiers of fortune , hired guns and goons …
After all , four thousand heavily armed and armored men do not storm in to your city and tear gas you for your own safety .
They were not there to protect Pittsburgh from the G20 , they were there to protect the G20 from Pittsburgh .

Only on the TED Blog : In The TED Lens , each Sunday a TED speaker offers a new look at the week ’s big news stories .
This week , social psychologist Jonathan Haidt talks about how the moral roots of the political right and left are shaping the debate over healthcare in the United States .
In your talk at TED2008 , you asked us all to “ take the red pill ” and step outside of our moral matrix .
You said that moral psychology was the red pill , and that it could help people resolve many of the puzzles of politics .
When emotions are running high in a debate such as we are seeing in the United States over healthcare , it ’s difficult to do this .
What can moral psychology tell us about the healthcare debate ?
I think there are three basic principles of moral psychology , and I find it helpful to approach any new puzzle by applying them .
The first principle is intuitive primacy : Peoples ’ judgments are based primarily on their intuitive reactions — on quick gut feelings , not on reasoning .
This is how we make most decisions , and Malcolm Gladwell reviewed this research in Blink .
Our feelings guide our subsequent thinking , and in this case there is a vast sea of fear and anger out there caused by the financial crisis , the threat of unemployment , the rewarding of greed and arrogance on Wall Street , and the big changes the Obama administration is trying to implement on many fronts .
People who did n’t vote for Obama started off with negative or ambivalent feelings toward him .
Independents who may have voted for him without much love are easily turned against him by talk of tax increases , whether true or not .
His race may contribute some negativity , for some people .
Whatever the source , negative feelings make it easy for people to believe just about any negative proposition given to them about Obama , including conspiracy theories about his birth certificate .
Negative feelings make it easy to believe any negative claim about his health care plan , including the stuff about death panels .
The second principle of moral psychology is that moral thinking is for social doing :
We engage in moral thinking not to find the truth , but to find arguments that support our intuitive judgments , so that we can defend ourselves if challenged .
The crucial insight here comes from psychologist Tom Gilovich at Cornell , who says that when we want to believe a proposition , we ask , “ Can I believe it ? ” — and we look only for evidence that the proposition might be true .
If we find a single piece of evidence then we ’re done .
We stop .
We have a reason we can trot out to support our belief .
But if we do n’t want to believe a proposition , we ask , “ Must I believe it ? ” — and we look for an escape hatch , a single reason why maybe , just maybe , the proposition is false .
So people who have a negative intuitive reaction to Obama , or who are fearful about the enormous changes going on , are already inclined to believe rumors against him and his plans .
They hear about death panels and forged birth certificates and ask “ can I believe it ? ”
The answer is usually yes , particularly if Fox News raises these questions and brings on experts who claim that the propositions are true .
Even if Fox News presents both sides , the fact that somebody on TV endorsed a proposition gives viewers permission to believe it , if they want to .
Conversely , Democrats can give rebuttals till they ’re blue in the face , but if people are asking themselves “ must I believe it ” about the Democrats ’ claims then the answer they will usually reach is “ no . ”
Logic and consistency just are n’t very important when it comes to morality .
Reasoning is “ the servant of the passions , ” as the philosopher David Hume said long ago .
That brings us to the third principle , which is that morality binds and builds .
I said in my TEDTalk that morality and politics are team sports .
People are n’t just engaging in post - hoc rationalization to justify their individual feelings .
Rather , moral reasoning and rationalizing are done in large part to help your team , and to show that you are a good member of your team .
Moral teams tend to form around principles held to be sacred .
One sacred principle for conservatives since the 1980s , and for libertarians in all eras , is that government is evil , it is a form oppression .
Individual liberty , tied to individual responsibility , are good , so nanny states such as those of Europe , which seem so humane to liberals , are reviled as socialist nightmares that are then mistakenly blended with totalitarian nightmares .
Hence the Obama equals Hitler comparisons .
Of course , people are quite selective about the aspects of government they find oppressive , and many commentators have pointed out the irony of protesters who say , in one case literally , “ keep your government hands off of my medicare . ”
But once again , logic plays little role in our moral lives .
Moral claims and arguments function like gang signs — they show others what team you are on , and they let you share emotions with other people , which bonds you more closely together .
At the end of your talk , you say , “ The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve .
It ’s really precious , and really easy to lose . ”
How does this notion that order tends to decay — suffused by the conservative mentality , which highly values in - groups , authority and purity — shape conservative thinking about President Obama ’s healthcare reform proposals ?
What are liberals missing about the perspective of the political right ?
I did say that in - group , authority and purity are necessary for the maintenance of order , but I would never give them a blanket endorsement .
Rather , my message to secular liberals is , Do n’t dismiss these entirely .
Be wary of them , sure ; they can motivate violations of civil liberties and human rights .
But we need them at times , and to a limited degree .
Above all recognize that matters related to ingroup ( such as immigration , or the flag ) , authority ( such as crime and punishment ) , and purity ( such as sexuality ) are the ones that take on a kind of religious importance for most Americans , because they are about binding groups together around sacred values .
Liberals often trigger outrage by ignoring these concerns in their pursuit of social justice , or of efficient policy .
In terms of the “ five foundations ” that I presented in my TEDTalk , I think that a big area of misunderstanding in the current debate concerns the role of purity / sanctity in biomedical issues , particularly abortion , euthanasia , and stem cell research .
If your morality is based on the moral foundations of harm / care and fairness / reciprocity ( as liberal morality is , in my data ) , then you ’re likely to take a very practical or utilitarian approach , one that aims to minimize suffering while maximizing the rights of the individuals involved .
You take a “ materialist ” view of life , which does n’t mean materialistic as in greedy , it means you think the only thing that exists is matter – no souls – so you think life is a physical or mechanical process that can be tinkered with to optimize the welfare of human beings .
Hence abortion , voluntary euthanasia , and stem cell research are all justified .
But materialism is deeply and profoundly threatening to many people .
It ’s the reason that the philosopher Peter Singer is so widely attacked , despite his humanitarian intentions .
The current Pope and the last one both railed against this form of materialism .
The materialism of the secular left opens it up to charges that it promotes a “ culture of death . ”
Liberals are said to like to kill fetuses and the elderly ; they do n’t treat anything as sacred .
This term has been bandied about on the right for many years , and while it is a gross exaggeration , it is based in a real truth , a real difference on the question of the sacredness of life .
So when Palin threw out the term “ death panels , ” the term struck a chord that had been played many times in recent years .
Liberals were flabbergasted , because it ’s a blatant lie , but it ’s false only in a logical sense , not an emotional one .
And once again , logic has little to do with morality .
If a pro-life social conservative asks himself whether Obama is secretly plotting to create death panels , he is not asking whether this is likely to be true , he is asking only “ can I believe it , ” and the answer is usually yes .
Of course , liberals believe that it is conservatives who like to kill people ( think militarism and capital punishment ) .
Both sides care about life , but in different ways .
Both sides live inside their own moral matrices .
And just like in the movie The Matrix , morality is a “ consensual hallucination ” that is very hard to step out of .
But moral psychology can help people to understand that there are moral motivations on all sides .
People may not be logical , but few of them are crazy .
How would you advise a proponent of Obama ’s healthcare reform bill to go about persuading its opposition — or at least to turn the debate toward the actual validity of its proposals , rather than the sensationalist claims ?
While it is useful to rebut charges and get your arguments out in circulation , you have to understand that arguments and evidence have little impact on people as long as their feelings tilt them against you .
You ’ve got to create trust and liking first , and then people will be willing to listen .
People can believe pretty much whatever they want to believe about moral and political issues , as long as some other people near them believe it , so you have to focus on indirect methods to change what people want to believe .
You have to get them to the point where they ask themselves “ can I believe it ? ” about your claims , rather than about your opponents ’ claims .
The time to establish that trust and liking was months ago , and perhaps some of it was burned up in the giant bailouts and coziness with Wall Street .
I ’m not a political scientist ; I ca n’t say why his poll numbers went down .
But as a moral psychologist I can say that there ’s now little that can be done to win over or calm down the town - hall protesters .
They ’ve formed a new gang , a new heroic moral identity of resistance .
My main suggestion is to boil the plan down to a few easy - to - understand ideas , each of which has some intuitive moral content .
The compassion and caring - for - all ideas should be easy for Obama , but they are not going to win over non-liberals , particularly those like Congressman Joe Wilson who are offended by the prospect of caring for outsiders ( i.e. , immigrants ) .
But Obama might have to reach beyond his moral comfort zone to bring in some conservative ideas of fairness , such as that laziness or personal irresponsibility must not be rewarded .
Obama might want to consider discussing the role of lawyers , and the role of lawsuits in driving up the costs of medical care .
Even if economists say that this is not a major economic factor , it is a major moral issue for many people : whiny , irresponsible patients team up with crooked lawyers to milk the system for multi-million dollar settlements .
It ’s outrageous , and Obama ’s opponents specialize in mobilizing outrage .
Opposition parties always do , and neither side has a deep respect for the truth , although I do think that the kind of populist moral outrage now being cultivated by Glenn Beck and other conservative media personalities shows the three principles of moral psychology in an unusually florid fashion : intuitive primacy , moral thinking is for social doing , and morality binds and builds .
It ’s very hard to combat such attacks with reasons and evidence .
I hope the Obama team finds some more indirect ways to change feelings – perhaps by making progress on the economy , or by handling an international crisis well .
When it comes to moral persuasion , the way to the head is through the heart .

There are several problems with reflection in C ++.
It 's a lot of work to add , and the C++ committee is fairly conservative , and do n't spend time on radical new features unless they 're sure it 'll pay off .
( A suggestion for adding a module system similar to .NET assemblies has been made , and while I think there 's general consensus that it'd be nice to have , it 's not their top priority at the moment , and has been pushed back until well after C++0 x .
The motivation for this feature is to get rid of the # include system , but it would also enable at least some metadata ) .
You do n't pay for what you do n't use .
That 's one of the must basic design philosophies underlying C++.
Why should my code carry around metadata if I may never need it ?
Moreover , the addition of metadata may inhibit the compiler from optimizing .
Why should I pay that cost in my code if I may never need that metadata ?
Which leads us to another big point : C++ makes very few guarantees about the compiled code .
The compiler is allowed to do pretty much anything it likes , as long as the resulting functionality is what is expected .
For example , your classes are n't required to actually be there .
The compiler can optimize them away , inline everything they do , and it frequently does just that , because even simple template code tends to create quite a few template instantiations .
The C++ standard library relies on this aggressive optimization .
Functors are only performant if the overhead of instantiating and destructing the object can be optimized away .
operator [ ] on a vector is only comparable to raw array indexing in performance because the entire operator can be inlined and thus removed entirely from the compiled code .
C# and Java make a lot of guarantees about the output of the compiler .
If I define a class in C# , then that class will exist in the resulting assembly .
Even if I never use it .
Even if all calls to its member functions could be inlined .
The class has to be there , so that reflection can find it .
Part of this is alleviated by C# compiling to bytecode , which means that the JIT compiler can remove class definitions and inline functions if it likes , even if the initial C# compiler can't .
In C++ , you only have one compiler , and it has to output efficient code .
If you were allowed to inspect the metadata of a C++ executable , you 'd expect to see every class it defined , which means that the compiler would have to preserve all the defined classes , even if they 're not necessary .
And then there are templates .
Templates in C++ are nothing like generics in other languages .
Every template instantiation creates a new type .
std::vector<int > is a completely separate class from std::vector < float > .
That adds up to a lot of different types in a entire program .
What should our reflection see ?
The template std::vector ?
But how can it , since that 's a source - code construct , which has no meaning at runtime ?
It 'd have to see the separate classes std::vector < int > and std::vector < float > .
And std :: vector < int >:: iterator and std::vector < float >:: iterator , same for const_iterator and so on .
And once you step into template metaprogramming , you quickly end up instantiating hundreds of templates , all of which get inlined and removed again by the compiler .
They have no meaning , except as part of a compile - time metaprogram .
Should all these hundreds of classes be visible to reflection ?
They'd have to , because otherwise our reflection would be useless , if it does n't even guarantee that the classes I defined will actually be there .
And a side problem is that the template class does n't exist until it is instantiated .
Imagine a program which uses std::vector < int > .
Should our reflection system be able to see std::vector < int >:: iterator ?
On one hand , you 'd certainly expect so .
It 's an important class , and it 's defined in terms of std :: vector < int > , which does exist in the metadata .
On the other hand , if the program never actually uses this iterator class template , its type will never have been instantiated , and so the compiler wo n't have generated the class in the first place .
And it 's too late to create it at runtime , since it requires access to the source code .
And finally , reflection is n't quite as vital in C++ as it is in C# .
The reason is again , template metaprogramming .
It can't solve everything , but for many cases where you 'd otherwise resort to reflection , it 's possible to write a metaprogram which does the same thing at compile - time .
boost : : type_traits is a simple example .
You want to know about type T ?
Check its type_traits .
In C# , you 'd have to fish around after its type using reflection .
Reflection would still be useful for some things ( the main use I can see , which metaprogramming can't easily replace , is for autogenerated serialization code ) , but it would carry some significant costs for C++ , and it 's just not necessary as often as it is in other languages .
Edit :
In response to comments :
cdleary :
Yes , debug symbols do something similar , in that they store metadata about the types used in the executable .
But they also suffer from the problems I described .
If you 've ever tried debugging a release build , you 'll know what I mean .
There are large logical gaps where you created a class in the source code , which has gotten inlined away in the final code .
If you were to use reflection for anything useful , you 'd need it to be more reliable and consistent .
As it is , types would be vanishing and disappearing almost every time you compile .
You change a tiny little detail , and the compiler decides to change which types get inlined and which ones do n't , as a response .
How do you extract anything useful from that , when you 're not even guaranteed that the most relevant types will be represented in your metadata ?
The type you were looking for may have been there in the last build , but now it 's gone .
And tomorrow , someone will check in a small innocent change to a small innocent function , which makes the type just big enough that it wo n't get completely inlined , so it 'll be back again .
That 's still useful for debug symbols , but not much more than that .
I 'd hate trying to generate serialization code for a class under those terms .
Evan Teran :
Of course these issues could be resolved .
But that falls back to my point # 1 .
It 'd take a lot of work , and the C++ committee has plenty of things they feel is more important .
Is the benefit of getting some limited reflection ( and it would be limited ) in C++ really big enough to justify focusing on that at the expense of other features ?
Is there really a huge benefit in adding features the core language which can already ( mostly ) be done through libraries and preprocessors like QT's ?
Perhaps , but the need is a lot less urgent than if such libraries did n't exist .
For your specific suggestions though , I believe disallowing it on templates would make it completely useless .
You'd be unable to use reflection on the standard library , for example .
What kind of reflection would n't let you see a std::vector ?
Templates are a huge part of C ++.
A feature that does n't work on templates is basically useless .
But you 're right , some form of reflection could be implemented .
But it'd be a major change in the language .
As it is now , types are exclusively a compile - time construct .
They exist for the benefit of the compiler , and nothing else .
Once the code has been compiled , there are no classes .
If you stretch yourself , you could argue that functions still exist , but really , all there is is a bunch of jump assembler instructions , and a lot of stack push / pop's .
There 's not much to go on , when adding such metadata .
Oak Brook Man Hates Libraries , Children , Puppies
By Prescott Carlson in News on Oct 2 , 2009 8:20 PM
We 've hung out with a lot of crankypants people in our time , but if we ever have the misfortune to meet 69 - year - old Constantine " Connie " Xinos of Oak Brook , we think he might take first prize .
Oak Brook , home of shopping malls , gated communities , and the suburbs ' tallest office tower , did n't have a proper library building until one was built in 2002 ( Xinos sued to stop construction and lost ) .
Unfortunately for the library , Oak Brook relies heavily on sales taxes for revenue , and as local shopping has been down the town had to make cuts .
A big one was eliminating 5 positions from the library staff , including the head librarian and the children 's librarian .
Residents spoke out against the layoffs , including 11 - year - old Sydney Sabbagha who told the village board at a recent meeting that , " [ the library ] will never be the same without the people you fired . "
Then it was Xinos ' turn to talk , and he called Sydney and anyone like her " whiners " and that she should come up with the money to pay library salaries herself .
Xinos went on to say that he thinks public libraries are " little , personal , private wants " that " [ indulges ] people in their hobbies . "
He might have gone on rambling about Sydney frittering her life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic - eaters , but we 're not sure .
When the Daily Herald spoke to Xinos about the incident and informed him that his harsh words left Sydney in tears , Xinos grinned and said , " I wanted that kid to lose sleep that night . "
Xinos -- who apparently uses language that would make Blago blush -- has helped to get people elected to the village board that share his views about the library , and when told of a recent library event where patrons brought their dogs , he said , " [ blank ] that [ blank ] . "
Xinos previously managed to keep subsidized senior housing out of Oak Brook , saying , " I do n't want to live next to poor people .
I do n't want poor people in my town . "
It 's become bad enough that the library staff has turned to -- get this -- the Teamsters Joint Council 25 for help , and they 're currently in the process of trying to become certified .
Not surprisingly , Xinos had unkind words regarding the Teamsters , saying , " Nobody here likes those kinds of people . "
This is a new model of the Golgi apparatus .
Credit : UC San Diego School of Medicine
A research team at the University of California , San Diego School of Medicine has provided a surprisingly simple explanation for the mechanism and features of the " Golgi apparatus " - a structure that has baffled generations of scientists .
The model developed by the UC San Diego scientists suggests that the Golgi 's unusual shape is a direct consequence of the way it works .
Their study will be published in the October 16 issue of the journal Cell .
The Golgi apparatus serves as a processing center for the exportation of proteins , lipids and other large molecules to their final destinations outside of the cell .
" Its primary function is to serve as a way station for extracellular protein traffic , " said principal investigator Seth J. Field , assistant professor of medicine at UC San Diego .
" Much of our body is made up of material exported by cells - for example , antibodies , hormones , growth factors , even much of the material that makes up bone , cartilage , skin , and hair - and they all depend on the Golgi apparatus working correctly . "
The Golgi apparatus is made up of flattened , membrane - bound stacks called cisternae , but the reason for their shape and structure have been unclear since the Golgi was first identified by Nobel Prize winner George Palade and colleagues using an electron microscope more than 50 years ago .
Each cisterna is made up of a flattened disk that carries enzymes meant to help or modify the protein cargo that travels through them .
Golgi membranes , from yeast to human cells , rely on a particular type of lipid signaling molecule - phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate , or PtdIns ( 4 ) P - for normal trafficking .
Field was a 2008 winner of the NIH New Innovator award to study the function of a group of these lipid signaling molecules called phosphoinositides , which are known to play critical roles in regulating cell growth and death , metabolism , and communication processes within cells .
His search to understand the function of these molecules led to what he described as an unexpected discovery about how PtdIns ( 4 ) P contributes to the structure of the Golgi .
Using a proteomic lipid binding screen , Field and colleagues identified a particular Golgi protein , GOLPH3 which links to PtdIns ( 4 ) P and to a contractile protein similar to those found in muscle called MYO18A .
They discovered that this three - way interaction applies a tensile force that is required for efficient formation of the tubules and vesicles necessary for extracellular transportation .
Their research suggests that another consequence of this tensile force is to stretch the Golgi into the extended ribbon observed by fluorescence microscopy and the familiar flattened form observed by electron microscopy .
" The NIH New Innovator Program is an effort to find exceptionally creative approaches to major challenges in biomedical and behavioral research , " said NIH Director Francis S. Collins , MD , PhD . " Dr. Field has fulfilled that promise with an extraordinary insight into the origin of a structure and a process that has perplexed biologists for decades .
He has shown that an interaction of three particular proteins is essential for Golgi apparatus function and , remarkably , that this interaction also generates the force that shapes the apparatus into the flattened ribbons first observed by electron microscopy half a century ago .
He has given us considerably deeper insight into the mechanism of the Golgi apparatus and a stunning example of the linkage between form and function . "

I have lamented in the past the fact that there rarely seems to be an online video with an environmental theme that " goes viral " .
We get laughing babies , epic safari battles and Susan Boyle , but we never get a video that spreads an environmental meme to millions of people across the planet .
But over the past week , inboxes have been aflutter with recommendations to view a short clip entitled The World 's Deepest Bin .
It shows some pranksters rigging up some simple electronics with a speaker and placing them in a bin in a public park in Sweden .
As people walk by and toss litter into the bin it triggers the cartoon sound of something falling down a really deep mineshaft .
A whistling descent is followed by a distant crash .
Naturally , the bin starts attracting curious passers - by and people are encouraged to throw more waste into the bin .
If this was a recycling bin then the message would be a sound one , but it looks like a normal bin and therefore could be said to encourage people to simply throw away items that might otherwise have been better directed towards a recycling bin .
But that 's niggling : overall , the video contains a simple anti-litter message .
So let 's applaud this rare example of an environmentally themed viral video .
Oh , but hang on , the final frame brings with it some rather depressing news : it 's " an initiative of Volkswagen " .
This is little more than a viral ad dreamed up by some smart people at a car company .
It 's all part of something Volkswagen has initiated called the Fun Theory , the idea that " fun is the easiest way to change people 's behaviour for the better " .
Yes , hard to argue with that really .
The Deepest Bin video is , in fact , one of three videos that have so far been produced .
The other two being the " Empty Bottle Arcade " to promote a sense of fun when recycling , and the " Piano Stairs " which is by far the most popular of the three with 2.5 m views in just a week .
Enjoy .
But never forget this is all about a car company playing clever games with our collective minds .
My original point still remains unanswered : when is someone going to produce a truly meaningful environmental viral video ?
Well the bizarre behavior by Flickr / Yahoo over recent customer service and account deletion issues may have just taken a big left turn from wackyland straight into the Twilight Zone .
Earlier this week I reported an update on the case of Shepherd Johnson .
You ’ll remember Johnson as the Flickr user who had his account deleted without warning after posting remarks critical of President Obama on the official Presidential Flickr stream .
It ’s still not known if pressure from the White House played a role in having Johnson ’s account deleted or not , but his account deletion gained widespread attention from both the blogosphere and the mainstream media after Yahoo nuked his entire account and photostream .
According to Johnson , after his account deletion he disconnected from Flickr for almost 3 months , reserved , he said , that nothing would come of his story .
After giving more reflection recently to his situation , however , Johnson said that he became disgusted over how Yahoo !
Flickr and the Whitehouse had treated him so he decided to try and readdress his account deletion issue with Flickr / Yahoo .
Johnson said that he started out trying to address his account deletion privately with Flickr Community Manager Heather Champ via Flickr mail .
Johnson had spoken with Champ earlier last summer and said previously that she ’d offered him a free $ 24.99 gift card so that he could get a new Flickr Pro account after the deletion .
According to Johnson , however , this time around Champ promptly blocked his flickr mail messages .
He then tried phoning Yahoo ’s VP of Global Customer Care , Laura Narducci , using the phone number that she had given him when dealing with his high profile account deletion back in June .
Johnson said he left voicemails but that Narducci did not return his calls .
Frustrated at being unable to contact Flickr / Yahoo directly over his account deletion , Shepherd next turned to Flickr ’s Help Forum .
As I reported on Tuesday , after Johnson posted requesting someone from Flickr / Yahoo contact him , Flickr locked his thread , ironically , telling him that he needed to contact them privately .
Johnson started another thread complaining that he had tried to contact them privately with no success and ended up not only having that thread shut down , but being banned from the Flickr Help Forum indefinitely as well .
( Note : I ’m also indefinitely banned from the Flickr Help Forum .
They banned me after referencing an anti-flickr blog in the forum last month ) .
Interestingly , Yahoo employee Zack Sheppard told Johnson that “ you are welcome to continue to communicate with us directly , ” while locking his thread and booting him from the help forum .
Not willing to simply give up on what he felt was an unjust account deletion with no response from Flickr / Yahoo , Johnson tried again yesterday to contact Yahoo / Flickr over his issue leaving one more voicemail message for Narducci and one more for Champ .
Johnson said that his voicemail messages were “ not angry , not hostile voicemails , just me stating matter of factly that I wanted this issue resolved . ”
And this is where things get weird ….
After being totally ignored in his attempts to resolve his account deletion issue with Flickr / Yahoo staff .
Johnson says that yesterday he finally did receive a call from someone at Yahoo .
Only it was n’t someone from Flickr ’s customer care division at all .
it was from someone named John Zent , apparently from Yahoo ’s Legal Department ’s Risk Management Group .
Zent identified himself as a security professional for Yahoo as well as a former FBI Special Agent , Johnson told me .
He told me that Zent threatened to have him removed from Flickr for TOS violations as well as have his IP address banned from the site .
Zent went on to accuse Johnson of harassment and said that if he did not stop calling Yahoo that he would call the Sunnyvale Police on Johnson .
“ I was astonished that he had threatened to call the police on a customer who merely had an account dispute which he wanted to have resolved , ” said Johnson .
.
While Johnson denies harassing anyone at Yahoo , he did admit to a couple of comments in a post inquiring about what had happened to Champ ’s face in a post containing a photograph of her that he felt was unflattering .
He said that Zent was “ extremely upset ” by his comments in this post and brought it up three times with him telling Johnson that his activity on Flickr was being “ closely monitored . ”
A little digging on Zent would seem to indicate that he indeed actually may be a former FBI agent — although I ’m not sure how appropriate it is to be using that status formally against a customer with an account deletion complaint at Yahoo .
In fact , it would appear that Zent has quite a colorful past of his own having been charged by a number of sources as being the individual responsible for having Al - Qaeda ( I told you this was going to get weird ) operative Ali Mohamed released from the Canadian police in 1993 as an FBI Informant .
Mohamed was also alleged to have been a “ a key planner of the 9/11 plot , and trainer in hijacking , ” Apparently another bizarre case related to Zent is that of his daughter ’s former boyfriend who was convicted of a triple murder over the killing of his parents for life insurance money .
Zent had reportedly testified on the boyfriend ’s behalf during the trial .
Johnson says that he is not giving up on his account deletion , which he sees as a free speech issue , just yet .
He said he plans to try and contact Narducci again , but that next time he said he ’ll leave instructions on where the Sunnyvale police can pick him up .
“ Yes , my 1st Amendment rights , the issue that this whole thing started over back when I posted comments in the Official Whitehouse Photostream , those rights are that important to me and in an act of civil disobedience I am willing to go to jail for them , ” said Johnson .
Interestingly enough , Flickr has repeatedly claimed in the past that they have no way of reactivating customer accounts after deletions .
Most recently Flickr staff confirmed this and said that they also were not working on any such feature at present .
According to Johnson Zent refuted this claim .
“ I asked him if Yahoo !
could actually turn my account back on to which he replied , “ Absolutely ! ” and then asked and answered his own question , “ Will Yahoo ! do that ?
No we will not . ”
This statement confirms that Heather Champ is a liar when she told me they could not reactivate my Flickr account , ” said Johnson .
I contacted both Zent as well as Yahoo PR yesterday to try and get a response on Johnson ’s case , but as of yet neither have returned my emails .
If / when I hear from them I will post their response .
Update more on this deletion , including additional comments from Shepherd Johnson here .
On Reddit here and here .
Update # 2 : On digg here .
Update # 3 : Jason Khoury from Yahoo PR just emailed me back the following response from Yahoo on this matter : “ It is Yahoo ! policy that we do n’t discuss members ’ accounts and their activity . ”
Reviving the gas fields ( Image : Joel Sartore / National Geographic / Getty )
WHATEVER you may think of our addiction to fossil fuels , there is no shortage of ideas on how to extract every last tonne .
Field trials are now showing that all it takes is common fertiliser .
Natural gas is often present in coalfields , clinging to the coal .
It is extracted through wells drilled into the coal seam , but once production tails off the industry usually moves on .
That ’s when biogenic methane companies propose to move in .
By pumping water and nutrients back down the wells to feed microbes living in the coal they expect to be able to kick - start …
In the small community of Sedalia Missouri there happens to be a substantial Krishna community .
( I wo n’t get into the various names for specific Krishna religions , but will just refer to them as Krishna for simplicity . )
Recently they took offense at the T - shirts worn by the local high school band .
The theme was a trip to the moon and their shirts featured imagery from the Apollo moon landings .
The Krishnas took offense at this because , according to their Vedic scriptures , the moon landing was a hoax .
Specifically it says that the moon is further away than the sun , and that in order for a human to exist on another world , they have to leave their body and adopt one made for that world .
Therefore the astronauts could not have landed on the moon , and the moon landings must have been a hoax .
Seriously – they really believe this .
But the issue here is that they complained about the T - shirts because they found it offensive to their religious beliefs .
They argued that the school system is supposed to remain neutral with regard to religious beliefs , and that they violated this neutrality by endorsing the “ controversial ” Apollo moon landings .
The local paper reports :
Assistant Superintendent Brad Pollitt said complaints by parents made him take action .
“ I made the decision to have the band members turn the shirts in after several concerned parents brought the shirts to my attention , ” Pollitt said .
Regarding the theme of “ Brass to the Moon ” the paper further reports :
Pollitt said the district is required by law to remain neutral where religion is concerned .
“ If the shirts had said ‘ Brass Resurrections ’ and had a picture of Jesus on the cross , we would have done the same thing , ” he said .
And of course parents on both sides of the issue were found for juicy quotes .
Parent Sherry Melby was quoted as saying :
“ I was disappointed with the image on the shirt . ”
Melby said .
“ I do n’t think the moon landings should be associated with our school . ”
Meanwhile , parent Alena Hoeffling got it right :
“ Whatever happened to the separation of church and state . ”
OK – this story is not actually true .
Well , parts of it are true .
The Krishnas really do believe the moon landing was a hoax because it contradicts their interpretation of Vedic scripture and believe that their scripture is a more reliable guide to reality because it comes from god ( sound familiar ) , while they denigrate materialist science as a “ cheat ” .
The story itself is true but it is about evolution , not the moon landing .
The T - shirts had the theme – the “ evolution of brass ” and featured the iconic image of primates evolving toward homo sapiens ( carrying brass instruments ) .
Melby ’s quote above should read : “ I do n’t think evolution should be associated with our school . ”
But the analogy to Krishnas denying the moon landing is perfect .
The only difference is that we live in a Christian dominated culture .
The major malfunction in the reasoning of those parents who complained about the T - shirts , and the response of the school ( who should not have caved to this pressure ) is the equation of endorsing a scientific fact with being against a specific religious belief .
Being neutral with regard to religion does not equate to avoiding scientific facts that some religious groups reject based upon their faith .
There is of course the practical issue that it would be absurd for the public schools to steer clear of every possible religious belief in a multi-cultural society , as my moon landing example demonstrates .
Those who typically make the claim that science must avoid offending their religion , however , are usually only concerned about their religious beliefs .
Christians in the US , for example , who make this claim also often claim that the US is a Christian nation , and therefore we must only respect Christian sensibilities – despite the Constitution ’s rather specific prohibition .
But I am talking about the underlying philosophical position , not the hypocrisy or practicality of the issue .
I am not what some might call an “ accommodationist ” – arguing that science and religion are compatible if we would just water down science enough .
Rather I argue that they occupy separate realms – or at least “ faith ” and science do .
Religions trample on science all the time .
The way I read our Constitution is that the state must remain neutral with regard to faith - based beliefs .
That does not mean the state must remain neutral with regard to purely secular conclusions .
Science is a purely secular system – it is agnostic with respect to any non-falsifiable claim .
Further , science is a system , and its conclusions need only be valid within the system of science .
We as a society have chosen to support the system of science – through funding , institutions , and education .
This largely stems from the recognition that societies which support scientific progress and education tend to thrive while those who do not stagnate and decline .
This is increasingly true as science and technology dominate our civilization .
If the scientific process leads us to a specific scientific conclusion – such as the well - established fact that life on earth as it exists today is the product of organic evolution , or that Apollo astronauts landed on the moon – then that is a scientific conclusion , not a religious belief .
Stating that , within the system of science , the process of science leads us to this specific conclusion is not the same thing as taking a stand with regard to any particular religious belief .
The religious in this country have the freedom to believe and preach whatever they want .
But that does not extend to the right to censor other people from believing or preaching what they want .
Or ( relevant to this case ) to censor the secular process of science whenever they decide it conflicts with their religious conviction .
Put more bluntly – if their religious beliefs conflict with the conclusions of science , that ’s their problem .
They can deal with the cognitive dissonance any way they like , but they can not impose it upon secular society .
In this case , even though it was just about band T - shirts , the school system should have held the line , rather than cave to pressure .
Some things are worth fighting for , even if they are inconvenient to the success of your high school brass band .
This issue crops up in other ways as well .
Chris Cromer was fired as the Director of Science for the Texas Educational System because she passed on an e-mail announcing a lecture about evolution .
This , her superiors argued , violated their neutrality policy regarding evolution and creationism .
She is now suing .
Her case was dismissed , but she is appealing .
My hope is that this point will be decided at the Supreme Court level .
Evolution is a scientific theory , creationism is a religious belief .
Our public school systems teach science , and must remain neutral with regard to religion .
That does not mean they must remain neutral with regard to a scientific theory .
They can enthusiastically teach and promote the consensus of scientific opinion without violating the Constitutional ban on establishing a religion .
The public school system not only cannot , it should not steer clear of every possible religious belief , and even more so of an allegedly privileged religious belief – whether it ’s Krishna or Christian .

UPDATE : Blackwater Claims APF Illegally Using Logos , Material
UPDATE : The American Police Force website page which clearly states that they run the Blackwater - controlled U.S. Training Center is back online here .
American Police Force , the paramilitary unit patrolling a small town in Montana , has been exposed as being a front group for the disgraced private military contractor Blackwater , now called “ Xe ” .
The American Police Force website , on a page that has swiftly been deleted but remains cached here , states that APF runs the “ U.S. Training Center , ” which proves “ a wide range of instruction and training for all types of law enforcement organizations , from basic firearms training to complex SWAT tactics , ” according to the website .
The Blackwater website carries on its contact page the following address , underneath the logo for U.S. Training Center .
Xe Services , LLC
PO Box 1029
Moyock , NC 27958
Xe Services LLC is the new name of Blackwater USA .
In addition , the U.S. Training Center contact page carries the exact same address .
PO Box 1029
Moyock , NC 27958
The U.S. Training Center is run by Blackwater .
Indeed , The U.S. Training Center website , can be accessed via Blackwater ’s forwarding URL at http://www.blackwaterusa.com/.
According to a February 2009 NY
Times article , the U.S. Training Center is a Blackwater “ subsidiary that conducts much of the company ’s overseas operations and domestic training . ”
Blackwater changed the name of the facility from its old title , Blackwater Lodge and Training Center , earlier this this when they also changed their own name to “ Xe ” .
Since Blackwater runs the U.S. Training Center , and the American Police Force stated on its own website , before it was deleted this morning , that it also runs the U.S. Training Center .
This means that either APF is lying about running the U.S. Training Center and is therefore effectively posing as Blackwater , or APF and Blackwater are one and the same .
CLICK FOR ENLARGEMENT : The American Police Force website , on a page that has now been deleted , states that the organization runs the U.S. Training Center .
CLICK FOR ENLARGEMENT : From Blackwater ’s USA ’s website with the U.S. Training Center logo at the top .
CLICK FOR ENLARGEMENT : From the U.S. Training Center website , the contact address is the same as on the Blckwater site becaue Blackwater owns the U.S. Training Center .
A domain registry check confirms that the U.S. Training Center website is registered to XE Services .
The fact that American Police Force attempted to hide the link by deleting the page on their website is further evidence that they are trying to conceal the fact that they are nothing more than a front group for Blackwater .
The U.S. Training Center is the training facility for Blackwater ’s front group , American Police Force .
This means that the new training facility that “ American Police Force ” are trying to build in Hardin is another Blackwater training facility .
This also means that Blackwater troops , under the guise of “ American Police Force ” have been patrolling Hardin , posing as law enforcement , and are also attempting to boss the $ 27 million dollar detention center recently built in the Montana town .
Many people have expressed suspicions that the convicted criminal running “ American Police Force , ” Michael Hilton , is not really the leader of the company and is merely a go between for his bosses .
This is now confirmed by the revelation that APF is a front group for Blackwater .
APF ’s reticence to divulge who their parent company was to reporters is also explained by the fact that they are a Blackwater front .
As the videos below discuss , Blackwater has been widely attacked for its involvement in atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan .
To have such individuals patrolling the streets of American towns posing as law enforcement and manning detention camps is a chilling precedent and all the more reason why American Police Force – or Blackwater as we should now call them – should be kicked out of Hardin immediately and face criminal charges for violating article 2 section 33 of the Montana Constitution .

CANADIAN INFILTRATION OF HOLLYWOOD AND PERVERSION OF AMERICA
Canadians have been in Hollywood since its birth , defining and exporting a Canadian - constructed view of the USA whilst funneling profits back across the border to spend on waffle production , flannel shirts and their communistic healthcare system .
Consider , in modern time , the Canadian - directed Titanic , which was designed with soulless calculation and Borg - like effeciency to push America ’s collective emotional buttons .
As a result it became the highest grossing film of all time .
Even in the early days , Canadian filmmaking has always been geared toward making their profits in America .
In olden times , actors like Ruby Keeler , Florence Lawrence , Beatrice Lillie , Glenn Ford , Walter Huston , Mary Pickford , Douglas Shearer , Norma Shearer , Jay Silverheels , Fay Wray and Marie Dressler passed as Americans at the expense of our domestic acting force .
They were aided from behind the scenes because those pulling the strings were also often Canadian , including Louis B. Mayer , Mack Sennet , Jack Warner , Edward Dmytryk and Arthur Hiller .
In modern times , James Cameron , Paul Haggis , Norman Jewison , Lorne Michaels and Ivan Reitman have continued the dirty work begun by the cadre of the secretly - Canadian .
In the book Stardust and Shadows : Canadians in Early Hollywood , author Charles Foster recounts his discovery of the secret Canadian network , then in its initial phase of infiltration , which he learned of through Canadian director Sidney Olcott .
Though a complete stranger to the members of the organization , as a fellow Canadian he was embraced merely on the basis of his national origins .
Once inside , he met Walter Pidgeon , Deanna Durbin , Fifi D’Orsay and others .
He also reveals that Louis B. Mayer was a racialist known to hire Canadian compatriots without audition and purely on the basis of their race .
CANADIAN EROSION OF AMERICAN VALUES
Firmly entrenched in our movie machine , Canadians have deliberately defined and warped our notions of ourselves .
Florence “ The Biograph Girl ” Lawrence was our first movie star .
Mary Pickford was appointed “ America ’s Sweetheart . ”
More recently , blond , Canadian , silicone cyborg Pamela Anderson has served as an example of all that is wrong with America and is one of al - qaeda ’s main recruitment tools , and she ’s not even one of us .
What do Margot Kidder and Erica Durance and Kristen Kreuk have in common ?
All are Canadian and as Lois Lanes and Lana Lang , they ’ve portrayed the most desirable women in the world to one as powerful as the Last Son of Krypton , who can fly around the world , reverse time and basically have his pick of most of the world ’s three billion women .
THE SINISTER SIDE
Canadians consciously control Hollywood to make themselves seem benign , even American .
Behind the scenes , they engage in all kinds of sordid , society - eroding behavior .
The alcohol and drug - addled Jack Pickford 's efforts to despoil our women were legendary .
One of his wives , Olive Thomas , suspiciously died from poisoning .
It seems her maple syrup contained lethal doses of cyanide .
In an even more sinister case , Canadian Florence La Badie mothered Woodrow Wilson ’s child out of wedlock as part of a larger Canadian scheme to take over the White House .
Luckily , someone tampered with her brakes and she died in a car crash .
Why do n’t we hear about the sinister side of Canadians ?
Obviously because they own the media .
Canadian newscaster Peter Jennings rose to the top of his field by carefully making sure to never pronounce “ lieutenant ” as “ left - tenant . ”
When most foreign actors appear on late night shows , they always have some cute anecdote about the differences between their culture and ours .
But you never hear a Canadian talk about their culture .
Why not play up their foreignness and enjoy Americans ' Canuckphilia ?
Why ?
What are they hiding ?
Is it any coincidence that Canadian Ryan Renolds plays the American in The Proposal who marries a Canadian played by American Sandra Bullock to get her a green card ?
No , they want to disable our ability to distinguish them from us .
FUNNY CANUCKS
Not only do Canadians try to pass as American , they also try to make us laugh .
Although seemingly nonmalignant , laughter can be an insidious tool , used to disarm and distract those who we should remain wary of .
Just look at this list of prominent Canadian merry - andrews :
John Candy , Dan Akroyd , Michael J. Fox , Mike Myers , Eugene Levy , Tom Green , Phil Hartman , Michael Cera , Tommy Chong , Hume Cronyn , Jim Carey , James Doohan , Dave Foley , Matt Frewer , Robert Goulet , Will Arnett , Gene Lockhart , Norm MacDonald , Howie Mandel , Rick Moranis , Catherine O'Hara , Matthew Perry , Seth Rogen , Will Sasso , Martin Short and Alan Thicke .
GOOD LOOKING CANUCKS
Another tool to make people drop their guard is being really , really good looking .
If Canadians ca n’t make us laugh , they use their Dracula - like powers to seduce us to do their bidding .
In moments of clarity , it turns out that many of them are n’t that good looking , but , controlling the media and Hollywood , they set our standard of beauty .
If you have n’t watched Lifeforce , you should .
Consider :
Sarah Polley , Adam Beach , Raymond Burr , Neve Campbell , Kim Cattrall , Hayden Christensen , Rae Dawn Chong , Elisha Cuthbert , Brendan Fraser , Ryan Gosling , Grace Park , Lorne Greene , Graham Greene , Corey Haim , Michael Ironside , Elias Koteas , Mia Kirschner , Sandra Oh , Anna Paquin , Ellen Page , Christopher Plummer , Jason Priestly , Keanu Reeves , William Shatner , Donald & Kiefer Sutherland and Jennifer & Meg Tilly .
THE INEXTRICABILITY OF CANADIANS
What can we do ?
The sad fact is Canadians have attached themselves to Hollywood like so many cybernetic implants that , if now removed , it would kill us .
Meanwhile , the entire Canadian - based film and television industry continues to feed off the host that is mainstream America with their secretly Canadian , apparently All - American films like Porky's , Meatballs , Black Christmas , Christmas Story and Johnny Mnemonic that go to great lengths to hide anything recognizably Canadian .
Canadian propaganda like True Lies and Crash remind us of our supposed racism whilst simultaneously stoking it , at the same time skillfully avoiding depictions of Canadians .
Although the comically profound ignorance about Los Angeles evident in Crash seemed glaring as the sun , it was accepted as deeply insightful and accurate amongst the unfamiliar , easily - swayed and otherwise clueless .
It ’s like we 're in The Matrix .
SNOWED BY " HOLLYWOOD NORTH "
Interestingly , lest people start wondering why they do n’t make any obviously Canadian films , they created their own genre , the Northern .
The prospect of watching adventure films about Mounties is so unappealing that , at minimal cost ( paid for with the profits of their secretly - Canadian blockbusters ) , they can with factory - like precision crank out enough films to allay our suspicions , though in reality , like the tax write off films that line our clearance section , they ’re not intended for human consumption , either by Americans or Canadians .
Have you or anyone you know ever seen or listened to any of these films , television and radio programs ?
The Riders of the Plains ( 1910 ) , Flower of the North ( 1921 ) , The Flame of the Yukon ( 1926 ) , The Lodge in the Wilderness ( 1926 ) , Tiger Rose ( 1929 ) , O'Malley Rides Alone ( 1930 ) , Men of the North ( 1930 ) , The River 's End ( 1931 ) , Riders of the North ( 1931 ) , Mounted Fury ( 1931 ) , The Mystery Trooper ( 1931 ) , Mason of the Mounted ( 1932 ) , Honor of the Mounted ( 1932 ) , Mckenna of the Mounted ( 1932 ) , Clancy of the Mounted ( 1933 ) , The Trail Beyond ( 1934 ) , The Fighting Trooper ( 1934 ) , Courage of the North ( 1934 ) , Undercover Men ( 1934 ) , Silent Code ( 1935 ) , Northern Frontier ( 1935 ) , Timber Terrors ( 1935 ) , Wilderness Mail ( 1935 ) , Fighting Shadows ( 1935 ) , The Red Blood of Courage ( 1935 ) , Border Brigands ( 1935 ) , Code of the Mounted ( 1935 ) , Trails of the Wild ( 1935 ) , His Fighting Blood ( 1935 ) , Skull and Crown ( 1936 ) , Rose Marie ( 1936 ) , Caryl of the Mountains ( 1936 ) , O'Malley of the Mounted ( 1936 ) , The Country Beyond ( 1936 ) , Phantom Patrol ( 1936 ) , Secret Patrol ( 1936 ) , King of the Royal Mounted ( 1936 ) , Wildcat Trooper ( 1936 ) , Renfrew of the Royal Mounted ( 36 - 40 ) , Challenge of the Yukon ( 39 - 55 ) , Blair of the Mounties , Men in Scarlet , Renfrew of the Royal Mounted ( 1937 ) , Death Goes North ( 1938 ) , On the Great White Trail ( 1938 ) , Heart of the North ( 1938 ) , On the Great White Trail ( 1938 ) , The Mysterious Pilot ( 1938 ) , Fighting Mad ( 1939 ) , Crashing Thru ( 1939 ) , North of the Yukon ( 1939 ) , Blue Montana Skies ( 1939 ) , Susannah of the Mounties ( 1939 ) , Outpost of the Mounties ( 1939 ) , Yukon Flight ( 1939 ) , Man From Montreal ( 1939 ) , Murder on the Yukon ( 1940 ) , Danger Ahead ( 1940 ) , Sky Bandits ( 1940 ) , River 's End ( 1940 ) , North West Mounted Police ( 1940 ) , King of the Royal Mounted ( 1940 ) , The Royal Mounted Patrol ( 1941 ) , North of the Rockies ( 1942 ) , Northwest Rangers ( 1942 ) , Perils of the Royal Mounted ( 1942 ) , King of the Mounties ( 1942 ) , Riders of the Northwest Mounted ( 1943 ) , Law of the Northwest ( 1943 ) , Northern Pursuit ( 1943 ) , Belle of the Yukon ( 1944 ) , Northwest Trail ( 1945 ) , The Royal Mounted Rides Again ( 1945 ) , Neath Canadian Skies ( 1946 ) , North of the Border ( 1946 ) , Where the North Begins ( 1947 ) , Dangers of the Canadian Mounted ( 1948 ) , Northwest Stampede ( 1948 ) , Trail of the Mounties ( 1949 ) , Trail of the Yukon ( 1949 ) , Wolf Hunters ( 1949 ) , Mrs Mike ( 1949 ) , Dog ( 1950 ) , North of the Great Divide ( 1950 ) , Call of the Klondike ( 1950 ) , Gene Autry and the Mounties ( 1951 ) , Yukon Manhunt ( 1951 ) , Northwest Territory ( 1951 ) , The Wild North ( 1952 ) , Border Saddlemates ( 1952 ) , Yukon Gold ( 1952 ) , Pony Soldier ( 1952 ) , Blue Canadian Rockies ( 1952 ) , Fangs of the Arctic ( 1953 ) , Fort Vengeance ( 1953 ) , Northern Patrol ( 1953 ) , Canadian Mounties vs Atomic Invaders ( 1953 ) , Gunfighters of the Northwest ( 1954 ) , Yukon Vengeance ( 1954 ) , Rose Marie ( 1954 ) , Saskatchewan ( 1954 ) , Perils of the Wilderness ( 1956 ) , The Canadians ( 1961 ) , Alien Thunder ( 1974 )
I did n’t think so .
But , as you can see , some are on DVD .
Maybe I 'll watch one .

I 'll have to think aboat it .
Not only do Canadians try to pass as American , they also try to make us laugh .
Although seemingly nonmalignant , laughter can be an insidious tool , used to disarm and distract those who we should remain wary of .
Just look at this list of prominent Canadian merry - andrews : andAnother tool to make people drop their guard is being really , really good looking .
If Canadians ca n’t make us laugh , they use their Dracula - like powers to seduce us to do their bidding .
In moments of clarity , it turns out that many of them are n’t that good looking , but , controlling the media and Hollywood , they set our standard of beauty .
If you have n’t watched , you should .
Consider : and
What can we do ?
The sad fact is Canadians have attached themselves to Hollywood like so many cybernetic implants that , if now removed , it would kill us .
Meanwhile , the entire Canadian - based film and television industry continues to feed off the host that is mainstream America with their secretly Canadian , apparently All - American films likeandthat go to great lengths to hide anything recognizably Canadian .
Canadian propaganda likeandremind us of our supposed racism whilst simultaneously stoking it , at the same time skillfully avoiding depictions of Canadians .
Although the comically profound ignorance about Los Angeles evident in Crash seemed glaring as the sun , it was accepted as deeply insightful and accurate amongst the unfamiliar , easily - swayed and otherwise clueless .
It ’s like we 're in
Today is Canada Day , a day no doubt celebrated in a manner designed not to attract too much attention .
Canada is the home of the quiet revolution , after all .
Most likely , their national day is marked by knowing glances .
Such is the Canadian character that their national day is not marked with fireworks , guns in the air or vuvuzelas .
Though Candians are stereotyped as quiet , harmless and polite pacifists who eat ketchup chips , how do we reconcile that peaceful image with the knowledge that their main export seems to be ice beer and that when they 're not knocking each others teeth out in the hockey rink , they 're clubbing baby seals with Neil Peart - like percussive overkill ?
Indeed , how much do we really know about our neighbors north of the border and the threat they pose ?
What harm is there in Canadians running Hollywood , you ask ?
They ’re only doing the work Americans wo n’t , you say .
In one three year stretch , the best actress category of the Oscars went to Canadians . andall took the Oscar back to Canada .
That ’s $ 1,500 of gold - plated britannium , or 1,303 loonies .
If movies and TV series likeandhave taught us anything , it ’s that when aliens are allowed to live in peace amongst us it ’s never a good idea .
Though they invariably claim to come in peace , the proper response is that they to go in pieces .
Due to blissful American ignorance and our welcoming disposition toward immigrants , most of us are wholly unaware when and how many Canadians are among us .
Although a phrenologist could see right through their smiling faces to their true nature , your average American when near a Canadian merely gets a tingling sensation and an inexplicable unease .
With good reason too , when one becomes aware of how far reaching Canadian tentacles are in our society …

( Moscow ) - Turkmen authorities should immediately release an activist arrested on what appears to be politically motivated grounds , Human Rights Watch said today .
Andrei Zatoka , a well known environmental activist , was detained on October 20 , 2009 , in Dashoguz , Turkmenistan .
Zatoka 's acquaintances told the Russian human rights group Memorial Human Rights Center that Zatoka was attacked by a man without warning while shopping for food at about 11 a.m. at a market in Dashoguz .
When Zatoka tried to get away from the man and turned to two police officers nearby to report the incident , the policemen proceeded to arrest Zatoka .
He had apparently never met the man who struck him and had absolutely no reason to engage in an altercation with him .
" Zatoka 's arrest appears to be a clear move by Turkmen authorities to stifle his activism , " said Rachel Denber , Europe and Central Asia deputy director at Human Rights Watch .
" Authorities should let him go at once and drop any charges against him . "
Zatoka is being held as " a person under suspicion " in the attack , which appears to have been staged .
He told his acquaintances by phone that the city police department had at first indicated it would let him go , but then informed him that he was under suspicion for causing injuries of " medium severity " to a passer - by and faces criminal charges that could land him in prison .
A forensic medical exam performed on the alleged victim reportedly confirmed that his wrist had been broken and that he had a concussion .
Zatoka has apparently been able to speak with his lawyer .
The October 20 arrest was not the first time Zatoka has been targeted by Turkmen authorities .
On December 17 , 2006 , he was seized by police on a flight to Ashgabad and charged with two violations of Turkmenistan 's criminal code ( Article 287 - illegal acquisition , sale , storage , transportation , delivery or possession of weapons , ammunition , explosive substances or devices , and Article 302 - illegal transactions with strong or poisonous substances ) in what also appeared to be a politically motivated prosecution in retaliation for his civic activism .
He was given a suspended sentence and released on January 31 , 2007 .
In February 2008 , Turkmen authorities told Zatoka that they had barred him from traveling outside the country , but he was given no reason for the restriction .
That spring , the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights , a Turkmen human rights organization in - exile , reported that Turkmen special services had intensified pressure against Zatoka in an effort to make him stop his activism .
Zatoka had traveled to Ashgabad on a number of occasions in an effort to get the travel ban against him lifted , most recently in September .
He had also recently written a complaint to the authorities about the pressure he had been facing from local police and security services .
Independent nongovernmental organizations and news media cannot operate openly , if at all , in Turkmenistan , and authorities frequently target activists .
Human Rights
Watch is aware of numerous instances in which independent activists and journalists have been subjected to threats and harassment by security services .
Zatoka , a biologist , co-founded the Dashoguz Ecological Club in 1992 .
A Turkmen court closed the organization in 2003 in connection with the politically motivated imprisonment of its other co-founder , Farid Tukhbatullin .
Tukhbatullin was released in April 2003 following an international campaign on his behalf and has since lived in exile in Austria where he heads the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights .
Zatoka has continued environmental activism in Turkmenistan , mostly by serving as an expert on the environment for Counterpart Consortium , a USAID - funded organization .
Human Rights
Watch called on Turkmenistan 's international partners , in particular the United States and European Union governments , to urge Turkmenistan to free Zatoka immediately and to undertake urgently needed human rights reforms .
" International actors have placed high hopes on Turkmenistan 's government as committed to reform , " said Denber .
" But Zatoka 's arrest and other steps backward in recent months unfortunately prove them wrong and call for redoubled efforts to press for urgent improvements .
The European Union recently upgraded relations with Turkmenistan through the conclusion of an Interim Trade Agreement and is looking to enhance them further with the conclusion of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in the near future .
Both agreements contain a so - called human rights clause , committing the parties to " respect for democracy and fundamental and human rights " and providing for possible suspension should either party violate this principle .
The partnership agreement has yet to be ratified by the parliaments of the United Kingdom and France .
Turkmenistan 's president , Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov , is expected to travel to France on a state visit next month .
Turkmenistan remains one of the most repressive and authoritarian countries in the world .
Berdymukhamedov came to power in December 2006 after the death of the self - declared president - for - life , Saparmurat Niazov .
In the first year of his presidency , Berdymukhamedov took some measures to dismantle some of the most excessive and ruinous social policies of his predecessor , but these did not result in any genuine reforms affecting human rights .
Hundreds of people , perhaps more , languish in Turkmen prisons following unfair trials on what appeared to be politically motivated charges .
Draconian restrictions on freedom of expression , association , assembly , movement , and religion remain in place .
An 11 - year - old Sydney girl is suing fast food chain KFC for just over $ 10 million , claiming she was poisoned at one of its restaurants .
Monika Samaan arrived at the New South Wales Supreme Court this morning in a wheelchair .
She has acquired spastic quadriplegia and a profound intellectual disability .
The court has heard that her condition was due to salmonella poisoning from a contaminated KFC product called a ' twister . '
She ordered the product from the Villawood outlet in Sydney 's south west in October 2005 .
The next day she was vomiting and had diarrhoea .
Her parents and brother were also sick after sharing her twister .
The family 's lawyer , Anthony Bartley SC , told the court that Monika Samann had been an extremely bright and active young girl before her illness .
KFC is accused of breaching its duty of care and the Trade Practices Act .
The court heard that a company review conducted last week gave the Villawood outlet a performance ranking of 41 per cent .
That is regarded as a breakdown standard .
The hearing continues .
Ok , maybe not every country , but with at least 12 different sockets in widespread use it sure as hell feels like it to anyone who 's ever traveled .
So why in the world , literally , are there so many ?
Funny story !

The more you look at the writhing orgy of plugs in the world , the sillier it seems .
If you buy a phone charger at the airport in Florida , you wo n't be able to use it when your flight lands in France .
If you buy a three - pronged adapter for le portable in Paris , you might not be able to plug it in when your train drops you off in Germany .
And when your flight finally bounces to a stop on the runway in London , get ready to buy a comically large adapter to tap into the grid there .
But that 's cool !
You can take the same adapter to Singapore with you !
And parts of Nigeria !
Oh yeah , and if said charger does n't support 240v power natively , make sure you buy a converter , or else it might explode .
And aside from a few oases , like the fledgling standardization of the Type C Europlug in the European Union , this is the picture all across the world .

I 'd hesitate to refer to power sockets as a part of a country 's culture , because they 're plugs — they do n't really mean anything .
But in the sense that they 're probably not going to change until they 're forcefully replaced with something wildly new , it 's kind of what they are .
What 's Out There

There are around 12 major plug types in use today , each of which goes by whatever name their adoptive countries choose .
For our purposes , we 're going to stick with U.S. Department of Commerce International Trade Administration names ( PDF ) , which are neat and alphabetical : America uses A and B plugs !
Turkey uses type C! Etc .
Thing is , these names are arbitrary : the letters are just assigned to make talking about these plugs less confusing — they do n't actually mandate anything .
They 're not standards , in any meaningful sense of the word .
Advertisement
And even worse , these sockets are divided into two main groups : the 110 - 120 v fellas , like the the ones we use in North America , and the 220 - 240 v plugs , like most of the rest of the world uses .
It 's not that the plugs and sockets themselves are somehow tied to one voltage or another , but the devices and power grids they 're attached to probably are .
How This Happened
The history of the voltage split is a pretty short story , and one you 've probably heard bits and pieces of before .
Edison 's early experiments with direct current ( DC ) power in the late 1800s netted the first useful mainstream applications for electricity , but suffered from a tendency to lose voltage over long distances .
Nonetheless , when Nikola Tesla invented a means of long - distance transmission with alternating current ( AC ) power , he was doing so in direct competition with Edison 's technology , which happened to be 110v .
He stuck with that .
By the time people started to realize that 240v power might not be such a bad idea for the US , it was the 1950s , and switching was out of the question .
Advertisement
Words were exchanged , elephants were electrocuted , and eventually , the debate was settled : AC power was the only option , and national standardization started in earnest .
Westinghouse Electric , the first company to buy Tesla 's patents for power transmission , settled on an easy standard : 60 Hz , and 110v .
In Europe — Germany , specifically — a company called BEW exercised their monopoly to push things a little further .
They settled somewhat arbitrarily on a 50 Hz frequency , but more importantly jacked voltages up to 240 , because , you know , MORE POWER .
And so , the 240 standard slowly spread to the rest of the continent .
All this happened before the turn of the century , by the way .
It 's an old beef .
Advertisement
For decades after the first standards , newfangled el - ec - trick - al dee-vices had to be patched directly into your house 's wiring , which today sounds like a terrifying prospect .
Then , too , it was : Harvey Hubbell 's " Separable Attachment Plug " — which essentially allowed for non-bulb devices to be plugged into a light socket for power — was designed with a simple intention :
My invention has for its object to ... do away with the possibility of arcing or sparking in making connection , so that electrical power in buildings may be utilized by persons having no electrical knowledge or skill .

Thanks ,
Harvey !
He later adapted the original design to include a two - pronged flat - blade plug , which itself was refined into a three - pronged plug — the third prong is for grounding — by a guy named Philip Labre in 1928 .
This design saw a few changes over the years too , but it 's pretty much the type Americans use now .
Here 's the thing : Stories like that of Harvey Hubbell 's plug were unfolding all over the world , each with their own twist on the concept .
This was before electronics were globalized , and before country - to - country plug compatibility really mattered .
The voltage debate had been pared down to two ( ish ) which made life a bit easier for power companies to set up shop across the world .
[ Note :
There are technically more than two voltages in use , which reader Michael clarifies rather wonderfully here ] .
But once they were set up , who cared what style plug their customers used ?
What were you gonna do , lug your new vacuum cleaner across the ocean on a boat ?
Early efforts to standardize the plug by organizations like the International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) had trouble taking hold — who were they to tell a country which plug to adopt ? — and what little progress they did make was shattered by the Second World War .

Take the British plug .
Today , it 's a huge , three - pronged beast with a fuse built right into it — one of the weirder plugs in the world , to anyone who 's had a chance to use one .
But it is n't Britain 's first plug , or even their first proprietary plug .
In the early 1900s the Isles ' cords were capped with the British Standard 546 , or Type D hardware , which actually include six subversions of its own , all of which were physically incompatible with one another .
This worked out fine until the Second World War , when they got the shit bombed out of them by Germany , and had to rebuild entire swaths of the country in the midst of a severe shortage of basic building supplies — copper , in particular .
This made rewiring stuff an expensive proposition , so the government was all , " we need a new plug , stat ! "
Here was the pitch : Instead of wiring each socket to a fuseboard somewhere in the house , which would take quite a bit of wire , why not just daisy - chain them together on one wire , and put the fuses in each plug ?
Hey presto , copper shortage , solved .
This was called the British Standard 1363 , and you can still find them dangling from wires today .
Notice how even in the 1940s and ' 50s — practically yesterday !
— the UK was devising a new type of plug without any regard for the rest of the world .
Advertisement
Now imagine every other developed country in the world doing the same thing , with a totally different set of historical circumstances .
That 's how we ended up here , blowing fuses in our Paris hotel rooms because our travel adapters ' voltage warning were inexplicably written in Cyrillic .
Oh , and it gets worse .

You know how the British had control over India for , like , ninety years ?
Well , along with exporting cricket and inflicting unquantifiable cultural damage , they showed the subcontinent how to plug stuff in , the British way !
Problem is , they left in 1947 .
The BS 1363 plug — the new one — was n't introduced until 1946 , and did n't see widespread adoption until a few years later .
So India still uses the old British plug , as does Sri Lanka , Nepal and Namibia .
Basically , the best way to guess who 's got which socket is to brush up on your WW1 / WW2 history , and to have a deep passion for postcolonial literature .
No , really .
Is There Any Hope for the Future ?
No .
I talked to Gabriela Ehrlich , head of communications for the International Electrotechnical Commission , which is still doing its thing over in Switzerland , and the outlook is n't great .
" There are standards , and there is a plug that has been designed .
The problem is , really , everyone 's invested in their own system .
It 's difficult to get away from that . "

When Holland 's International Questions Commission first teamed up with the IEC to form a committee to talk about this exact problem in 1934 .
Meetings were stalled , there was some resistance , blah blah blah , and the committee was delayed until 1940 .
Then a war — a World War , even !— threw a stick in the committee 's spokes , ( or a fork in their socket ?
No ? ) , and the issue was effectively dropped until about 1950 , when the IEC realized that there were " limited prospects for any agreement even in this limited geographical region ( Europe ) . "
It 'd be expensive to tear out everyone 's sockets , and the need did n't feel that urgent , I guess .
Plus , the IEC can't force anyone to do anything — they 're sort of like the UN General Assembly for electronics standards , which means they can issue them , but nobody has to follow them , no matter how good they are .
As time passed , populations grew , and hundred of millions of sockets were installed all over the world .
The prospect of switching hardware looked more and more ridiculous .
Who would pay for it ?
Why would a country want to change ?
Would n't the interim , with mixed plug standards in the same country , be dangerous ?
Advertisement
But the IEC did n't quite abandon hope , quietly pushing for a standard plug for decades after .
And they even came up with some !
In the late 80s , they came up with the IEC 60906 plug , a little , round - pronged number for 240v countries .
Then they codified a flat - pronged plug for 110 - 120v countries , which happened to be perfectly compatible with the one we already use in the US .
As of today , Brazil is the only country that plans to has adopt[ed ] the IEC 60906 , so , uh , there 's that .

I asked Gabriela if there was any hope , any hope at all , for a future where plugs could just get along :
Maybe in the future you 'll have induction charging ; you have a device planted into your wall , and you have a [ wireless ] charging mechanism .
Advertisement
Last time I saw a wireless power prototype was at the Intel Developer Forum in 2008 , and it looked like a science fair project :
It consisted of two giant coils , just inches apart , which transmitted enough electricity to light a 40w light bulb .
So yeah , we 'll get this power plug problem all sorted by oh , let 's say , 2050 ?

She took care to emphasize that the standards are still there for people to adopt , so countries could jump onboard , but even in a best - case scenario , for as long as we use wires we 'll have at least two standards to deal with — a 110 - 120 v flat plug and the 240 - 250v round plug .
For now , the Commission is taking a more practical approach to dealing with the problem , issuing specs for things like laptop power bricks , which can handle both voltages and come with interchangeable lead wires , as well as as something near and dear to our hearts :
" We have to move forward into plugs we can really control , " Gabriela told me .
She means new stuff like USB , which is turning into the de facto gadget charging standard .
The most we can hope for is a future where AC outlets are invisible to us , sending power to newer , more universal plugs .
My phone 'll charge via USB just as well in Sub - Saharan Africa as it will in New York City ; just give me the port .
In the meantime , this means that things really are n't going to change .
Your Walmart shaver will still die if you plug it into a European socket with a bare adapter , Indians will still be reminded of the British Empire every time they unplug a laptop , Israel will have their own plug which works nowhere else in the world , and El Salvador , without a national standard , will continue to wrestle with 10 different kinds of plug .

In other words , sorry .
Many thanks to Gabriela Ehrlich and the IEC , as well as the Institute for Engineering and Technology and Wiring Matters ( PDF ) , and USC Viterbi 's illumin review .

You know how the English - Canadian media is always lecturing the Québécois on how their language issues are distracting them from the real important stuff , like economic developement and roads ?
And how the separatist obsession with language is killing Montreal and has been causing it ’s decline ?
Two stories broke in the news yesterday .
One involved language , the other one about … hum … just something about the Mafia running the City of Montreal .
The three French - language dailies in Montreal headlined with the Mafia story .
Only le Devoir even mentioned the Supreme Court ruling on bill 104 on the first page .
The Montreal Gazette went for the language headline and gave the story about the former of leader of the opposition and former executive council member Benoit Labonté ’s allegations that the City of Montreal ’s administration is hostage to organised crime a whopping 1/40th of the front page .
Inside , the Gazette gave the language story more that 4000 word , including the main editorial .
The City Hall scandal ?
332 . Eighteen less words that this post .
The National Post also headlined with language .
No national daily in Canada mentions the fact that Canada ’s second major city is in the midst of a major corruption scandal one week from a general election .
A Google.ca news search for bill 104 on the 22nd and 23rd of october returned 167 stories in English .
A search for Labonte returned ony 21 articles .
A search in French netted 84 stories for Labonte as opposed to only 47 about Loi 104 .
Vigile.net , the ultra-nationalist clearinghouse for all things language and separatism - related in the Québec media lists 50 stories on Bill 104 and 90 , almost twice as many , on the City Hall scandals .
Even those language - obsessed separatists of the Parti Québécois are reported by Radio - Canada not to have mentioned language , the Supreme Court or Bill 104 for the first 20 minutes of question period !
Meanwhile , the “ Top court strikes down Quebec English school law ” is the most active story of the day on CBC.
ca with 1170 comments and growing .
The four stories on the Montreal situation , stories that just might be the answer to the eternal question as to why Montreal has so many potholes , have a total of 94 comments .
Sally Harpold is a Sudafed Head . . . or is she an Actifed Head ?
Well , the important thing is that she has been finally locked away in Clinton , Indiana where she was caught buying two cold medicines within seven days .
Vermillion County Prosecutor Nina Alexander ( left ) racked up the major coup four months after the purchases and charged her with violating Indiana law 35 - 48- 4-14.7 , which restricts the sale of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine , or PSE , products to no more than 3.0 grams within any seven - day period .
What is amazing is that Harpold thought that she could get away with this .
Here is her crime spree : she bought one box of Zyrtec - D cold medicine for her husband at a Rockville pharmacy and then less than seven days later she bought a box of Mucinex - D cold medicine for her adult daughter at a Clinton pharmacy — a total of 3.6 grams total of pseudoephedrine in a week ’s time .
Not only is the grandmother of triplets a criminal in the eyes of Alexander but she is an enabler pushing cold medicine on her family .
Police have been able to learn the “ drug signals ” in the family — usually members with cough repeatedly to signal their need for another fix .
Alexander charged her with a class - C misdemeanor , which carries a sentence of up to 60 days in jail and up to a $ 500 fine .
She is willing to expunge the crime from her record , if Harpold pays the court costs , stays clean for 30 days , and presumably comes to terms with “ her problem . ”
What is astonishing is that officials expect citizens to calculate their amounts of the pseudoephedrine in over - the - counter drugs , but as the list below shows there are about 1000 such products that you might buy containing the substance .
People are expected to drag themselves with the flu to the store and then calculate the exact amount of the substance in purchases over the last week .
Alexander , however , blames pushers like Harpold : “ If you take these products , you ought to know what ’s in them . ”
The law itself is obviously poorly written .
The burden and expectation for the consumers to track these amounts is unrealistic .
Stores may be barred from sales to individuals , but either take these products off the market or regulate sales through the stores .
Criminalizing a population of sneezing , coughing citizens is not the solution .
One would at least expect police and particularly prosecutors to show some common sense and discretion .
Even though Vermillion County ranked as the state ’s fifth - largest producer of methamphetamine and this is viewed as a law to combat such production , one can make simple and obvious judgments in cases like this .
Alexander , however , appears to protect her office against the ravages of discretion or common sense .
She insisted “ [t ] he law does not make this distinction .
. .
I ’m simply enforcing the law as it was written . ”
Well , there are lots of laws that fail to make distinctions but prosecutors are not required to charge in every case .
Prosecutors are not robots .
They play a role in the system of justice to avoid injustice .
In Harpold case , the police came for her four months after her purchases in the middle of the night .
She was thrown in jail and eventually released on bond .
For those of you who do not want to land in an Indiana jail with a head cold , here is the list of roughly 1000 medicines sold over the counter that are covered by these laws .

Consumers Ca n’t Choose Not to Do Business
One argument free market fundamentalists use often is that if you do n’t like how a company does business , just do n’t do business with them , go to a better company , and the market will get rid of bad companies .
So , for example , if you do n’t like the way your credit card company is raising arbitrary fees and interest rates , well , find another credit card company .
A good idea .
If , of course , there was a free market .
With credit cards , the terms tend to be pretty universal .
If your credit rating is X , and you have Y assets , credit card companies will generally all treat you the same way .
One may be marginally better than another , but it is marginal .
They make more money by all engaging in the same practices which increase fees and interest than by engaging in price wars , and they understand that
Same thing with telecom service .
If there are 3 providers , and they all provide about equivalent services , then there is n’t a free market .
In many rural markets for health insurance , one provider may control 90 % of the market , and in many others two or three controlling the majority is very common .
Nor is their much difference between their offerings at any given price point ( or their customer service / denial rates , etc … ) even when you have multiple “ options ” .
And since doing without a credit card is actually very difficult ( I did it for years , I know what I ’m speaking of — I invite you to travel without one one day to see what I mean ) and so is doing with phone or internet service , well , you ’ve got little choice .
In fact , what the US has in many industries are largely unregulated oligopolies , because the regulators mostly do n’t bother .
I ’m a big believer in free markets , myself .
I ’d love for more of them to exist .
But it is basic economic theory ( and something Adam Smith understood very well ) that the first thing people do when they win the market is try and make sure there is n’t a market .
The best profits are monopoly or oligopoly profits .
Free market mechanisms by themselves cannot ensure the continued existence of free markets .
Government is needed , but so are the proper mores .
When John Kenneth Galbraith , in the post war period , looked into why executives did n’t pay themselves a lot more ( they could have ) he came to the conclusion that it was essentially a cultural thing — managers would n’t tolerate it , it was against what they believed in .
Their ethics .
Likewise in 19th century America belonging to certain religious groups was a big plus for a merchant .
People would go out of their way to do business with you , because they knew it was much more likely you would n’t cheat them or price gouge them , that you believed in a fair profit , but only a fair profit .
Ethics .
Free market fundamentalisms in the US has done a great deal of damage by claiming the only ethic that matters is greed .
The free market is not self regulating , the invisible hand does not always work to the benefit of society as a whole ( as Adam Smith well knew ) , greed is not always good , and free markets naturally tend towards unfree markets in which the choice for consumers is to take what is offered or go without .
( If you do n’t believe me , take one of the “ contracts ” given to you by a big firm , and cross out the parts you disagree with , and write in your own wording .
“ Negotiate ” with them .
Let me know how it works out . )
Free markets are grand things .
Every once in a while they even exist .
Insomniacs Mike Acton created quite a stir when he claimed yesterday that keeping your game at 60 fps does n’t matter .
Unfortunately , his article bases this only on correlation between frame rate and final score .
While it ’s of great importance to the business end of making games , there ’s little reasoning on the technical side why 60 fps and 30 fps make so little difference .
( Based on what else I read from Mike , I ’m sure he ’s reasoned about it alright – it ’s just not part of this particular article . )
The concept of frame rate matters at all because the update rate of the entire world is tied to the refresh rate – the game progresses “ one frame ” at a time .
That , in turn , is done since the final draw that a world update triggers needs to be tied to the screen refresh to avoid screen tearing )
But “ the world ” is not a monolithic block – games do many things , and the order in which you do them matters very much .
Mick
West has an excellent article on what he calls “ response lag ” – the time it takes for a button press to finally cause a result on screen .
And effectively , you measure this lag time by stating how often you need to run “ the world ” ( or the main game loop ) until the input causes a visible effect .
That , in turn , means that with the same internal delay , a 30 fps game takes twice as long to react to a button press as a 60 fps game .
Now , if your game is well engineered , that internal delay is “ only ” 3 - 4 frames .
At 30 fps , that ’s just below the human reaction time – that ’s why most gamers do n’t complain about 30 fps if it ’s a well - engineered game engine .
Things start to get different once the gamer is not reacting , but planning ahead and trying to hit a button at an exact time .
Music games , for example .
Or FPS players who lead a shot .
Here what matters is not so much the lag per se – we can learn to anticipate that .
What matters is that that lag is constant , so there are no timing surprises .
So what matters is predictable lag that does not exceed the human reaction time – which is just so achievable with 30 fps , and a monolithic step function .
And that ’s the core assumption everybody was making for the “ 60 fps or die ” argument – your step function is monolithic .
It was , for a long time , with a single core synced to the screen refresh .
That argument simply is n’t true any more .
We have multiple cores available that can run completely decoupled from each other1 .
That means , for example , that I can sample the controller at a much higher rate than I refresh the screen .
We might run the physics engine at a time step significantly shorter than the duration of a single frame .
In other words , we can run components of the world at different speeds and only have the drawing synced to the screen .
The tricky issue here is that we are sampling – aliasing effects can be introduced along the way .
Which is really all that “ lag ” is – it ’s the result of discrete sampling of a continuous world .
And that is the part that surprises me most – while we have a ton of really smart guys working on keeping our lag small , nobody seems to treat it as an aliasing problem , bringing signal theory to bear on it .
Am I missing something ?
Dante 's Inferno Is Making Me Angry
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Friday , 9th of October 2009 - 08:33 PM ]
This month is the month of Anger for the team and video .
The below clip show cases a bit of the weapons , melee and magic , that Dante will use as he travels down through the circles of Hell .
Fitting for a level that is all about violence and , well , Anger .
Unfortunately , they do n't touch much on what is going to be going on this circle .
Outside of constant combat and use of the free flow combat Dante will employ .
Although they do touch on the different modes of Death 's Scythe that you will use .
Placing it even more on par with the weapon styles of God of War .
But since the developers have stated that they take that form of comparison as a compliment , I guess here is another compliment .
Check out the Anger here and wait for next month and it 's Heresy .

UK Chinook helicopters grounded for * years * due to software problems
danny burstein < dannyb@panix.com >
[ UK news sources : UK bought Boeing helicopters , figured they 'd save money by designing their own software ...]
When the [ Boeing ]
Chinooks were delivered in 2001 at a cost of 259 million [ British pounds ] - the [ software ] codes would have pushed the price to over 300 million - they could not be certified because of the lack of software .
They could be flown but pilots were barred from taking the controls in cloudy conditions or at low altitude .
....
While all the discussions were going on the Chinooks had been idle in their hangars .
Between 2001 and 2007 the helicopters had to be inspected once a week and moved out of the hangars every two years for more detailed checks , at a total cost of 560,000 [ pounds ] .

DNA Evidence Can Be Fabricated , Scientists Show
Monty Solomon < monty@roscom.com >
Scientists in Israel have demonstrated that it is possible to fabricate DNA evidence , undermining the credibility of what has been considered the gold standard of proof in criminal cases .
The scientists fabricated blood and saliva samples containing DNA from a person other than the donor of the blood and saliva .
They also showed that if they had access to a DNA profile in a database , they could construct a sample of DNA to match that profile without obtaining any tissue from that person .
" You can just engineer a crime scene , " said Dan Frumkin , lead author of the paper , which has been published online by the journal Forensic Science International : Genetics .
" Any biology undergraduate could perform this . "

Computer - driven class schedules
" David Lesher " < wb8foz@panix.com >
[ would Ferris Bueller get the week off ? ]
Prince Georges [ MD ] Public Schools $ 4.1 million SchoolMax student scheduling system has left thousands of its high school students with no schedules , and thus no classes .
Those students have spent the first few days of school sitting in the gym , cafeteria , or other holding areas .
While the number of still - unscheduled students has fallen from the first day 's 8000 [ of 41,000 total ] to roughly 2000 , that does not include those in the wrong classes ; including one where administrators have , in effect , randomly assigned students to any available class .
The saga sounds oh so familiar to RISK regulars ; a big changeover , no manual fallback scheme , approaching deadlines , with complaints about inadequate training , and big increases in the time needed [ from ~ 10 minutes to 45 per student ! ] for core tasks .
But SchoolMax is not a new creation , nor are these issues .
It was deployed for 300,000 in the Los Angeles Unified School District , and Richmond County , Georgia had similar issues in 2004 .
So who 's not learning here : SchoolMax , the school systems clients , or their students ?

RFI is n't all harmless : turns on oven
" David Lesher " < wb8foz@panix.com >
RFI is usually an annoyance but seldom harmful .
Here 's an exception .
A UPI article of 18 Aug reports : Andrei Melnikov said his Maytag Magic
Chef stove beeps and turn its broiler onto the highest setting if his phone , which he has had for about three years , receives an incoming call while within two feet of the appliance , WABC -TV , New York , reported Tuesday .
...
He said the stove is currently unplugged and Maytag has agreed to send a repair crew to get to the bottom of the problem .
GSM cell phones are noted for causing audible RFI in other receivers nearby .
Looks like some Maytag ranges are equally vulnerable .

Pepper -spray ATMs
Jeremy Epstein < jeremy.j.epstein@gmail.com >
Have n't seen this in RISKS - I first heard about it on NPR's Wait Wait ( waitwait.npr.org ) as part of their truth - is - weirder - than - fiction contest , so was initially skeptical , but it appears to be true .
Seems that some South African ATMs are equipped with pepper spray to ( under software control ) spray anyone who tampers with the machines .
According to the ( UK ) Guardian , " the technology uses cameras to detect people tampering with the card slots .
Another machine then ejects pepper spray to stun the culprit while police response teams race to the scene . "
The Guardian report says that three servicing technicians were hit while ( legitimately ) repairing the machines .
It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that when there 's software involved , there 's opportunities for it to go wrong .
And as someone on a blog pointed out , this technology can also be used by the bad guys - get the ATM to trigger on a legitimate customer , and while the customer is incapacitated , take their ATM card and whatever other valuables they have .

The VA erroneously informs over a thousand vets of fatal diagnosis
Rob McCool < robm@robm.com >
http://fcw.com/articles/2009/08/26/va-erroneously-informs-vets-of-fatal-disease-diagnosis.aspx
Through a data maintenance error , the Veteran 's Affairs department recently sent out automated letters to as many as 1200 veterans that they had the fatal neurological disorder known as Lou Gehrig 's disease .
A diagnostic code was chosen many years ago for " unknown neurological disorder " .
That itself is an example of the often problematic " miscellaneous " hole in most categorization systems .
Some things simply defy categorization .
Later , the diagnostic code was expanded to include Lou Gehrig 's disease .
Still later , the VA decided to make Lou Gehrig 's disease a service - connected disability .
So they sent the automated letters to inform affected vets that benefits were available .
Up to 1200 people were erroneously informed of this and the office is getting more than 50 calls a day from veterans in an understandable panic .

A file transfer program erroneously installed on a server in an Army Reserve Officers ' Training Corps ( ROTC ) office at Boston University inadvertently exposed personal information about thousands of people affiliated with the program .
University officials say the compromised computer was taken off - line when the breach was identified on July 28 ; they are working with the U.S. Army Cadet Command to contact every person whose information was placed at risk .
The incident involved information on 6,675 people , say University administrators , 406 of whom are affiliated with BU .

Swiss Data Protection orders Google Streetview offline
Peter Houppermans < peter@houppermans.com >
The risk of not living up to your promises when you do mass surveillance : the Swiss newspaper NZZ reports today that the Swiss office for Data Protection ( http://www.edoeb.admin.ch) has asked Google to immediately shut down the Swiss part of Google Streetview because it does not meet Data Protection standards - the masking of license plates and faces is insufficient .
The ( German language ) article is at http://preview.tinyurl.com/nwsl65.
I can attest to that , I had a quick browse of a place I know , and the promised masking of faces was in quite a few cases simply absent ..
The Swiss Data Protection office does n't consider the " you can opt out if you want " approach as acceptable , a point I can only agree with when it comes to privacy .
I 've read through a Q&A ( http://preview.tinyurl.com/muor75, no English version available ) with Google provided answers , and that contains a few classics : ( a ) people would know in advance where the cars would be , " so they could act accordingly " - a fantastic idea to move your obligation to the people you 're surveilling ( " just go and hide if you do n't like it " ) ( b ) you can always have your picture removed - which only requires you to remember where exactly you saw the camera car , several months later .
It appears Google has also offered to remove house images if so required .
I think that 's a bit much , but from what I 've seen so far it would be a good idea if they would at least obscure windows .
The resolution of the images is in some cases sufficient to make out what 's INSIDE houses close to the street .
But hey , according to Google they should have had their curtains drawn when Google came filming .

Cannot print on Tuesdays !
phil colbourn < philcolbourn@gmail.com >
Today I came across an interesting bug mentioned on a blog .
The problem was that printing for some people failed occasionally .
Later someone noted that his Wife had been complaining that she could n't print on Tuesdays !
In reading through the bug report people were initially claiming that it must be an OpenOffice bug since all other applications printed fine .
Others noted that it comes and goes .
One user found a solution :
To remove and purge the system of OpenOffice and re-install ( any easy task on Ubuntu ) .
He reported on a Thursday that this fixed his printing problem .
Two weeks later he reported ( on a Tuesday ) that his solution did not work after - all .
Nearly 4 months later the Wife of a Ubuntu hacker complained that OpenOffice would not print on Tuesdays .
I can imagine the scenario : Wife : Steve , the printer will not work on Tuesdays .
Steve :
That 's the printer 's day off - Of course it will not print on Tuesdays .
Wife :
No , I 'm serious !
I can not print from OpenOffice on Tuesdays .
Steve : ( Unbelieving .. )
Ok ...
Show me .
Wife : I can't show you .
Steve : ( Rolling eyes .. )
Why ?
Wife : It 's Wednesday !
Steve : ( Nods .
He says slowly ... )
Right .
The problem seemed to be tracked down to a program called ' file ' .
This * NIX utility uses patterns to detect file types .
eg. if the file starts with '% ! ' followed by ' PS - Adobe - ' then it is a PostScript file .
It seems that OpenOffice writes the date to the postscript file .
On Tuesdays it takes the form of % % CreationDate : ( Tue MMM D hh : mm : ...)
An error in the pattern for an Erlang JAM file meant that ' Tue ' in the PostScript file was being recognised as an Erlang JAM file and so , presumably , it was not being sent to the printer .
The Erlang JAM file pattern is : 4 string Tue Jan 22 14:32:44 MET
1991 Erlang JAM file - version 4.2
It should have been 4 string Tue\ Jan\ 22 \ 14:32:44 \ MET \ 1991 Erlang JAM file - version 4.2
With the large number of files types that this program attempts to match ( over 1600 ) it is not surprising that errors are made in the patterns , but also the order of matching could mean that false positives are common .
In this case , an Erlang JAM file was matched before the PostScript match occurred .

Given that most governments can tap phone calls for lawful purposes once the signal hits the tower , what possible use would there be to having a weak cipher for radio transmissions ?
The Pirate Bay Returns With Guns Blazing

When The Pirate Bay was shut down by the authorities yesterday many believed that this was the end for the Internet 's largest BitTorrent tracker .
A mere three hours after it went offline the site reappeared from a different location .
The Pirate Bay team released the following statement , adapted from Churchill 's famous " We Shall Fight On the Beaches " speech .
" We have , ourselves , full confidence that if all do their duty , if nothing is neglected , and if the best arrangements are made , as they are being made , we shall prove ourselves once more able to defend our Internets ... "

Bad questions for account retrieval
Jeremy Epstein < jeremy.j.epstein@gmail.com >
A recent study [ 1 ] showed that the " security questions " used for recovering account access tend to be easily guessable , even by strangers , and the answers are almost as frequently forgotten by the account owner .
As pointed out in that article , it 's important in choosing questions that they have relatively unchanging answers , or else customers will be unable to recall the answer a year or two down the road when they 're needed .
That 's of course why questions like birthplace and mother 's maiden name are " good " from the memory perspective , even though they 're bad from the security perspective .
So the other day I was helping my son apply for a student credit card at Citibank , and was somewhat amused that the following were the * only * questions allowed ( I think you had to have answers to three of them ) : ( A ) Best friend 's last name ( B ) Pet 's name ( C ) Favorite teacher 's last name ( D ) Last 4 digits of friend / relative phone # ( E ) Other ( A ) might be mined from Facebook or a similar page ( a large fraction of people will probably list their spouse 's name ! ) , if it 's not their spouse , for many people this will change over time . ( *) [ 1 ] notes that " best childhood friend " is frequently forgotten and fairly easily guessed ; " best friend " is both easily guessed and subject to change .
As noted in [ 1 ] , ( B ) is easily guessed ( although less likely to change than ( A ) ) .
( C ) is likely to change over time .
( D ) has the disadvantages of the person changing , as well as choosing which phone number ( cell / home / work ) ; also many of the college students who are the target of this application do n't know their friends ' phone numbers since they 're all programmed into cell phone memory .
And their implementation of ( E ) does n't allow you to put in a hint , but the answer is limited to 10 characters .
The risk ?
In the move to trying to improve the security of backup questions , even big companies can miss the point .... [ 1 ]

Ever vigilant against terrorism , the LAPD gets specific instructions : < http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/mccarecommendation-06132008.pdf>
A Suspicious Activity Report ( SAR ) is a report used to document any reported or observed activity , or any criminal act or attempted criminal act , which an officer believes may reveal a nexus to foreign or domestic terrorism .
The information reported in a SAR may be the result of observations or investigations by police officers , or may be reported to them by private parties .
Incidents which shall be reported on a SAR are as follows : [...]
Takes pictures or video footage ( with no apparent aesthetic value , i.e. , camera angles , security equipment , security personnel , traffic lights , building entrances , etc. ) .
There are so many fallacies here I do n't know where to start .

c ) LAPD 's finest 's esthetic value judgment is up to the task of differentiating between terrorism and turkeys .
Err , I 've seen their HQ building ; and besides , not even the Hollywood power barons manage that task well - witness this summer 's flops such as GI Joe. d)

Stephen Albin The Art of Software Architecture : Design Methods and Techniques August 2009 ACM Featured Online Book for Professional Members
The ACM Featured Online Book Program focuses on books in the ACM Collection that are highly used and highly reviewed .
A different book will be featured in each newsletter .
This issue features a title from our Books 24x7 collection .
Stephen Albin .
The Art of Software Architecture : Design Methods and Techniques
This book synthesizes and distills information so that the practicing software architect , and especially the beginning software architect , can fill in the gaps in their understanding of software architecture design .
This innovative book uncovers all the steps readers should follow in order to build successful software and systems .
With the help of numerous examples , Albin clearly shows how to incorporate Java , XML , SOAP , ebXML , and BizTalk when designing true distributed business systems .
The book not only teaches how to easily integrate design patterns into software design , but also documents all architectures in UML and presents code in either Java or C++.
Bernard Kuc of Computing Reviews said " Albin presents extensive coverage of the current state of the art in software architecture .
Throughout the book , he remains focused on software architecture .
He does not give in to the temptation of going deeper into software engineering and design , an area already well covered elsewhere , and hence achieves coverage of a wide breadth of material in relatively few pages . "
One Amazon reviewer , who rated the book 5 stars , said the book as " This book uses real world examples and practical advice coupled with academic rigor .
It provided tremendously helpful insights into how I can improve the efforts of my team . "

GRAND RAPIDS , Mich .  Dozens of kayakers paddled down the Grand River here on Sunday to get a close look at “ Nessie on the Grand , ” a stylized foam version of the Loch Ness Monster floating near the shore .
A few blocks east , outside the Grand Rapids Children ’s Museum , groups of excited youngsters posed for their parents ’ cameras against a colorful mosaic , gazing at their reflections in bits of mirrored tile .
And inside the nearby Urban Institute for Contemporary Arts , adults and children fired questions at a chatty New Yorker named Jason Hackenwerth as he twisted balloons into the components of a giant caterpillar - shaped sculpture .
As popular as these attractions were , they and many others spread around Grand Rapids were more than just crowd - pleasing curiosities  though they had to be that , too .
The three are among 10 finalists in a new art competition here that is being judged by members of the public , and that has drawn more than 1,000 entrants with its top prize of $ 250,000 .
The organizers of this first - ever event , called the ArtPrize , describe the sum as “ the world ’s largest art prize , ” and the competition  open to anyone over 18 and to be decided by the votes of tens of thousands of visitors  as among the world ’s most democratic .
The winner of the election  balloting concluded on Wednesday  is to be announced on Thursday night .
In addition to the top payout , each of the nine runners - up will receive at least $ 7,000 , from a total pool of $ 449,000 .

El ex presidente Vicente Fox desaprob� la pretensi�n de algunos legisladores de suprimir la pensi�n a los ex presidentes .
Dijo que no renunciar� a la pensi�n mensual que recibe , superior a los 140 mil pesos .
" Por supuesto que no voy a renunciar , yo lo necesito " , enfatiz� Fox .
Argument� que la pensi�n es un elemento que tiene que ver con la transparencia y con la rendici�n de cuentas " y que tiene que ver con evitar cualquier tentaci�n para cualquier presidente de hacerse justicia por propia mano " .

A decision by Atlanta forward Ilya Kovalchuk on his future is coming soon .
The impending Thrashers free agent will decide in the next few weeks whether he will re-sign with the club or choose to test free - agency , according to analysts Pierre LeBrun and Elliotte Friedman on Hockey Night in Canada 's Hotstove segment on Saturday .
" That could happen in the next couple of weeks .
[ There are ] a lot of positive feelings coming out of Atlanta , " LeBrun said .
" But there 's a team in the [ Kontinental Hockey League ] … that I think would love to get its hands on him . "
That team is Russia SKA Saint Petersburg , operated by KHL president Alexander Medvedev .
If Kovalchuk moves back to Russia , it would be the biggest coup so far for the fledging super - league .
Kovalchuk has spent all of his eight NHL seasons with the Thrashers , who drafted him first overall in 2001 .
But he 's only had limited playoff success with the team .
Atlanta only reached the post - season once with the Russian in the lineup , in 2006 - 07 when the Thrashers were swept in the first round .
If Kovalchuk chooses not to sign with Atlanta , Friedman said he might make the move to Russia .
" A number of Russian players around the league believe that if he 's not in Atlanta next year , he will go back to Russia , " he said .
" And the question is : Does he want the money [ that will be offered in the KHL ] , or does he want to stay in the NHL ? "
The 26 - year - old had one of his best statistical years last season , scoring 43 goals and adding 48 assists for 91 points .
The total was good for sixth overall in the NHL scoring race .
The NHL and KHL are embroiled in a battle over player poaching , as the Russian league has signed a number of the NHL 's restricted free agents .

Advertisement A host of weird and wonderful animals has been discovered by a BBC expedition which ventured deep into some of the world 's most remote rainforest .
The team explored the crater of a pristine giant extinct volcano located in the highlands of Papua New Guinea .
Accompanied by the first biologists ever to set foot in the crater , the team filmed strange spiders , giant caterpillars and tree - living kangaroos .
Series producer Steve Greenwood describes what they found .
" The BBC 's Natural History Unit in Bristol has been making filmed expeditions to remote parts of the rainforest since 2006 , firstly to Borneo for the programme Expedition Borneo , and then Guyana for Lost Land of the Jaguar , " he says .
The team may have discovered up to 40 new species
Giant rat found in ' lost volcano '
" When it came to organising the third expedition , the team were desperate to take on the challenge of New Guinea , the largest and most mountainous tropical island in the world . "
To film the latest programme , Lost Land of the Volcano , the team visited the crater of Mount Bosavi , a pristine extinct volcano located in the southern highlands of Papua New Guinea .
The area is so remote and inaccessible that no people live in the crater .
Even villagers in the few scattered settlements surrounding the volcano rarely ventured in , due to the difficulty of climbing the slopes leading to a 2,800 m summit .
" ' If you fall when climbing in , ' one village elder said , ' no one will ever find your body , ' " recounts Greenwood .
The area has an astonishing collection of invertebrates
In Pictures : Weird crater creatures
The expedition team comprised a filming team of two cameramen , two sound recordists , two directors and support staff , along with a medic specialised in remote areas and an expert in ropes and climbing trees .
They joined with a number of expert scientists , specialising in mammals , birds , frogs , fish and bats among others , led by Professor George McGavin of Oxford University and the University of Derby in the UK .
Together they found a wealth of new creatures , during the three - week expedition .
The team can't be sure until scientists have had a chance to formally evaluate and describe the animals found , but they suspect they may have discovered up to 40 new species , including approximately 16 species of frog , one species of gecko , at least three new species of fish , 20 species of insect and spider and one new species of bat .
" Highlights include a camouflaged gecko , a fanged frog and a fish called the Henamo Grunter , so named because it makes grunting noises from its swim bladder , " says Greenwood .
The creatures were documented during a three - week expedition
They also found a Doria 's tree kangaroo , which wandered close to camp .
Tree kangaroos are notoriously wary of people , but this particular one seemed unfazed by the team 's presence .
That confirmed what the expedition team suspected , that the huge crater walls had effectively cut off the animals living within the volcano crater , allowing them to be naive to people .
As well as large creatures , the team also encountered a variety of odd - looking insects including bizarre spiders .
On one trip outside the crater , they found a giant caterpillar surrounded by hundreds of smaller maggots .
The caterpillar appears to have tried to escape the maggots , which were attempting to eat it .
Broadcast of The Lost Land of the Volcano series will begin on BBC One on Tuesday 8 September at 2100 BST .

While a fair number of celebrities come from classic rags - to - riches stories , or at least Gap - to - Gucci stories , there are also some who were born into wealth and success .
I 'm not saying that they did n't make it in their own right " “ I think our # 1 spot on the list has certainly made his own name for himself .
But the people on today 's Q10 definitely had some connections and privileges that the average person did n't .
1. Anderson Cooper is Gloria Vanderbilt 's son , which definitely resulted in a privileged lifestyle : he was photographed by Diane Arbus as a baby , appeared on The Tonight Show at the age of three and modeled for Ford Models between the ages of 10 and 13 .
But life was n't all rosy : his dad died when he was just 10 and his older brother committed suicide by jumping out of the window of a 14th - floor apartment building when Anderson was just 21 .
He graduated from Yale and hoped to get his foot in the door at ABC just answering phones , but could n't even get that job .
Eventually he landed a gig with Channel One as a fact checker and has been on the rise ever since .
2. Chevy Chase 's dad , Ned Chase , was a prominent book editor in Manhattan and his mother was the heiress to a plumbing fortune ( I did n't know there were plumbing fortunes , either ) .
His parents divorced when he was just four , and each parent re-married " “ his dad , in fact , married into the Folgers coffee family .
Despite this ,
Chevy says he was raised in an upper - middle class family and that his wealthy maternal grandfather did n't leave any money to his mother .
He has also stated that his mother and step - father abused him as a child .
3. Carly Simon 's dad is the " Simon "  of Simon and Schuster : he co-founded it .
4. Barbara Walters is the daughter of Lou Walters , who founded the famous " Latin Quarter "  nightclub .
As the result of owning such a glamorous joint , celebrities were at her house all of the time and she spent a lot of time at the clubs .
" This is where I spent Thanksgiving and Christmas and birthdays and prom nights , " she once said .
As rich as her dad once was , she said he was also very good at losing it all because of the business gambles he took .
5. Humphrey Bogart 's father , Belmont DeForest Bogart , was a heart and lung surgeon .
His mother , Maud Humphrey , was a well - known illustrator who studied with James Whistler and was later the art director for a fashion magazine .
They lived in a brownstone on the Upper West Side and had a summer home that sat on 55 acres in upstate New York .
Because of his family connections , he was admitted to the Phillips Academy prep school in Andover , Mass .
But he got expelled .
He was raised to believe that , as a profession , acting was uncouth and beneath him .
But the late hours and adoring
girls appealed to him , and thus we have one of the greatest film actors of all time .
6. Paul Giamatti is the son of A. Bartlett Giamatti , former Major League Baseball Commissioner and a former President of Yale University .
He did , indeed , attend Yale University and was a member of the Skull and Bones society .
7. Linda McCartney was an heiress , but not to the obvious .
Her maiden name was Eastman , and when she once told a reporter that her family had nothing to do with the Eastman - Kodak company , Paul feigned being upset and said , " What ?
I 've been had ! " 
But Linda was an heiress : her mother was Louise Lindner Eastman , whose dad founded Lindner Department Stores .
8. George Plimpton was the son of Francis Plimpton , the Plimpton in the law firm Debevoise and Plimpton , one of the most well - known law firms in the world .
Their clients include CNN , Coca - Cola , the NFL , NBC , Sony , the New York Times and Yahoo !
9. Glenn Close 's father was once the personal physician to Mobutu Sese Seko , the President of Zaire .
Her grandfather was an investment banker and director of the American Hospital Association who was first married to Post Cereals ' heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post .
This did n't make her the heiress to the Post fortune , though " “ Glenn 's mother was her father 's second wife .
10 . Oliver Stone 's father was a prominent stockbroker in New York .
His dad was anxious for him to follow in the family footsteps and arranged for him to attend all of the best schools and even work at a French financial exchange .
He was admitted to Yale but dropped out twice , although he eventually attended film school at NYU .
As you can see , that worked out for him .

Update :
Here 's another video demonstrating the technique with fun music via Hack a Day :
Master Lock [ MarkEdwardCampos via Hack a Day ]
Samantha King ’s 2006 book Pink Ribbons Inc. was one of the first that examined why breast cancer , more so than any other illness , became a ubiquitous marketing movement .
Answer :
The most significant risk factors for breast cancer ( such as genetics and age ) ca n’t be altered by women , which is why it ’s often regarded as a “ blameless ” disease .
It attacks mostly women , who account for the bulk of America ’s purchasing power .
It attacks the very symbol of femininity , the breast .
And a pink ribbon is cute and soothing .
“ I ’ve talked to survivors who ’ve contacted me and were so enraged that their struggle with the disease was being commodified in this way , ” says King , who is based in Kingston , Ontario .
“ The response I ’ve heard from corporations when I challenge them about this is ‘ Who cares , as long as the money is going to a good cause ? ’ ”
“ It ’s such a double - edged sword , ” says LaShaune Johnson , 33 , another breast cancer survivor and a postdoctoral fellow , who recently relocated to Hartford from Hyde Park .
She did her dissertation on breast cancer organizations and black women .
“ On the one hand , buying that pink stuff makes you feel connected to the people who survived and made it to the other side .
Since she was diagnosed 2 ½ years ago , Anna Schleelein , a 26 - year - old attorney in Newton , spends Octobers in a self - imposed pop-culture blackout .
She tries to avoid TV , magazines , and , especially , shopping , to steer clear of all those pink - ribbon products .
“ October is just a reminder of my cancer , ” Schleelein says .
She is screened for recurrences with MRIs and mammograms every six months , and October is particularly difficult if she is awaiting the results of a test .
“ I want to buy my English muffins and not be reminded of it while I ’m waiting for results to come in . ”
Many breast cancer survivors like Zielinski find themselves conflicted over this little powerful ribbon .
Some survivors feel companies are exploiting breast cancer , marketing themselves as philanthropic outfits that care about women when what they mostly care about is the pink ribbon ’s enormous ability to boost profits .
Some just feel overwhelmed by the constant pink reminder , especially in October , Breast Cancer Awareness Month , of a disease that has forever altered their lives .
“ I think that the pink ribbon , as a symbol , tends to pretty up what is a pretty crappy disease .
But a pink ribbon is easier to look at than the disease itself . ”
But it was n’t long before she got a little sick of the pink .
“ I felt kind of hateful , ” says the insurance company sales manager who lives in Charlestown .
“ I was like , ‘ What makes you think I like pink now ? ’
When Kim Zielinski was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 at the age of 33 , well - meaning friends inundated her with products bearing a little pink ribbon .
Each product ’s maker promised a cut of the sales price to a breast cancer charity , and these friends felt they were supporting the cause and , by association , Zielinski .
A petite brunette who ’s now 35 , she was enormously grateful for the millions of dollars that these pink - ribbon products direct each year to charities that fund breast cancer research and education .
But most consumers do n’t read reports from Midwestern business schools .
Many people believe that a firm that puts a pink ribbon on a product is donating money out of its own pocket , at a loss , because it is committed to the fight against breast cancer .
That ’s not to say the employees and executives are n’t committed to the cause , but that is not why they do it .
A recent study of the effects of cause marketing by two professors at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor found that not only can companies raise prices and make higher profits on the sale of products that benefit a cause , these companies ’ entire brand portfolios can experience a “ spillover ” increase in sales and profits , which more than compensates for the money given to charity .
The report concluded , “ Our results suggest that actions of [ cause marketing ] firms should be looked on with some skepticism by consumers and government officials -- while the firms may be helping with charitable causes , they are also using [ cause marketing ] to increase their own prices and profits . ”
It is also a powerful technique for raising profits .
Research from Cone Communications , a Boston consultancy that helped pioneer the widespread use of cause marketing , has shown that 79 percent of consumers would likely switch to a brand that supports a cause , all other things being equal .
People want to buy from companies that appear to do good deeds .
In one test conducted by Cone and Duke University ’s Fuqua School of Business , shampoo aligned with a cause saw a 74 percent sales increase over the same brand without a cause .
When a company sells a product and promises a portion of the proceeds to a cause or charity , it ’s called cause - related marketing .
( This is unlike the charitable foundations that some companies set up to give away money unconnected to product sales . )
Avon and Estee Lauder were two of the first to use the pink ribbon as a marketing tool by slapping it on cosmetics in 1993 .
Other companies rapidly followed suit .
Susan G. Komen for the Cure , the Texas - based 900 - pound gorilla of breast cancer fund - raising , has turned cause marketing into a money - printing machine .
Last year , the charity raised almost $ 50 million from more than 250 corporations , which gave Komen some of their proceeds from product sales .
Komen is just one of dozens of charities that partner with companies to raise funds .
The technique has been a tremendously powerful way of generating money for breast cancer research and education by redirecting consumer dollars .
Many breast cancer survivors and women battling the disease care , that ’s who .
And they ’re increasingly willing to speak out about it .
“ I would hope that companies are n’t looking to profit off the use of the pink ribbon , ” says Zielinski .
“ There are other ways that they can market things . ”
But few causes have proven to be as incredibly profitable -- or as exploited -- as breast cancer .
Of the complaints , Karen White , director of corporate relations for Komen , says : “ It ’s not something that we hear on a regular basis .
Responsible cause marketing is good cause marketing and serves a wonderful cause .
We ’re excellent stewards of the funds that come in through this . ”
Still , nonprofit executives realize that some companies are misusing the pink ribbon , and they recognize that if corporate partners appear greedy instead of philanthropic , it tarnishes the charities ’ own reputations -- and fundraising efforts .
White says Komen approves the products on which its partners are slapping Komen ’s trademarked version of the pink ribbon , and the charity says it monitors partners to ensure they are following accepted charitable giving guidelines and state laws that govern corporations involved in cause marketing .
With one in eight women being diagnosed with breast cancer , more research is needed into cause , treatment , and prevention .
Every donated dollar helps , so most charities refuse to bad - mouth pink - ribbon cause marketing , no matter how much it upsets some breast cancer patients and survivors .
“ For those of us with breast cancer , it ’s like getting hit in the face , ” says Sather .
“ The companies are making money off my disease -- even if they ’re giving an amount to charity , they ’re making so much more in profit . ”
Such misuse and hoop - jumping infuriates Jeanne Sather , a Seattle woman battling metastatic breast cancer and known throughout the cancer community for her fight against the pink ribbon and Breast Cancer Awareness Month .
She will send a “ Boycott October ” button to anyone who asks .
Her blog ,
The profit power of cause marketing is why , come October , everything turns pink .
The pink ribbon ’s use is unregulated , and it has no consistent meaning .
Some companies simply attach a ribbon and say they ’re “ raising awareness . ”
Many pink - ribbon campaigns require the purchaser to register the sale online or through the mail .
“ Often , I hear the argument that we would be better off if companies would just donate the dollars that they spend on marketing these products or creating these products , ” says Chris Mann , associate manager of brand marketing for Brighton - based New Balance , which for the past eight years has given a percentage of the sales of its “ Lace Up for the Cure ” shoe , apparel , and accessory collection to Komen .
“ And I do n’t disagree that a donation of that amount would be very impactful .
At the same time , that point of view does n’t understand the realities of how for - profit corporations have to work .
In most of the cases , that money was never earmarked as purely a donation or a philanthropic initiative .
In most cases , it ’s funds that are coming out of a marketing budget .
And by definition , a marketing budget is meant to drive return for the business . ”
( The New Balance Foundation , a separate entity set up to make charitable donations , has given more than $ 100,000 over the past four years to local breast cancer initiatives and gave $ 100,000 in 2007 to Komen . )
Nonetheless , Breast Cancer Action ( BCA ) , a San Francisco - based advocacy and fund - raising nonprofit , has for years called Komen out for joining with companies that it accuses of raising money for breast cancer while manufacturing products that contain ingredients that have been proven to or are likely to cause cancer .
BCA recently declared victory when Yoplait , one of Komen ’s biggest partners through its “ Save Lids to Save Lives ” campaign , agreed to stop using milk from cows treated with recombinant bovine growth hormone , or rBGH .
The byproduct of the hormone that remains in milk has been linked by many studies to the development of breast cancer .
Shortly after Yoplait ’s statement that it would stop using milk from treated cows , Dannon made a similar announcement about its yogurt .
In 2002 , BCA created the “ Think Before You Pink ” campaign , encouraging consumers to ask questions before buying pink , among them :
Is the product bad for my health , where is the money going , and how much is going there ?
It ’s difficult or impossible to answer these questions while confronting a sea of pink products in aisle five at Walgreens .
Which is why Komen , for one , insists that its corporate partners clearly say on products how the sale will benefit Komen and if there is a donation minimum or maximum .
One of Komen ’s partners with a maximum is New Balance , which caps its contribution at $ 1 million per year .
The shoe maker has hit that target during each of the past two years and expects to do so again this year , according to Mann .
“ We would love to [ raise the cap ] , ” he says , “ but the unfortunate realities of the business world at this point are that [ we ] , like many other companies , are not having the flexibility given the current economic times to increase marketing spends . ”
So what happens each year to the money that the company earns after the cap is reached that would normally go to Komen ?
“ We would hold on to that . ”
White says that Komen monitors its partners ’ sales and requires that when they hit their maximum they tell consumers that purchases are no longer benefiting Komen .
New Balance , however , said in a statement that it does not inform consumers once the company reaches its cap ; its product labels state that a maximum donation exists , so the firm believes it ’s in compliance with Komen ’s rules .

If you have water with you , drink it all immediately .
There is a good chance you will be rescued before long so it is pointless being dehydrated .
If you do run out of water , the trick to finding more in the wilderness is to remember that water always flows downhill .
Find a hill and wait at the bottom .
I read somewhere that if there is no water available , you can drink your own urine so I always take a two litre bottle of it wherever I go just in case .
Do not eat the bright purple mushrooms .
Once while lost , I found and ate some bright purple mushrooms figuring such a friendly colour could not possibly be dangerous .
A short time later , a beetle and I discussed the differences between the director 's cut of Bladerunner and the cinematic release .
Always remember that bark is an excellent source of nutrition and can be prepared simply by marinating overnight and cooking for twenty minutes in a preheated oven at 240 degrees celcius .
Things that should not be eaten : Bright purple mushroomsRocksCha-Chi's Mexican Restaurant foodWaspsBuilding yourself a shelter is an integral part of survival .
A small bungalow or cottage will be sufficient unless you have a lot of furniture .
Always remember that when tiling a roof , it is important to use a rope and harness to avoid falling .
If you do fall , land horizontally with your arms and legs stretched out to maximise surface area .
Always check with your local council on required permits prior to building .
Protect yourself from hungry animals by fortifying your shelter .
A wall of no less than two metres with a lockable gate should be sufficient .
Always build your wall out of non combustible materials as wild animals will often attempt to gain access by using fire .
Befriend large animals such as bears to protect you from smaller ones .
A bear can easily be mollified by running towards it yelling .
Materials that are not suitable for building shelter with : WaterAngry wordsLive antsBuilding a fire without the use of matches or a lighter is a simple matter .
Most forest fires are caused by lightning strikes so run a steel cable from the top of a tall tree to a pile of sticks and then be patient .
Construct your fire under a group of trees and stack large piles of leaves around the edge to serve as wind breaks .
Wolves are attracted to firelight but have a highly developed sense of smell and detest the odour of petrol so be sure to douse the surrounding area and yourself well .
If you do not have petrol with you and wolves enter your campsite , curling up into a small ball and making a high pitched sound like a wounded bird will confuse and deter them .
If you are being attacked by a wolf , do not accidently grab a snake to fight it off with .
If you have emergency flares , taping several dozen to your legs and setting them off at the same time will allow you to hover above the wolves for several seconds , safe from their snapping jaws .
Having the appropriate clothing and medical equipment in preparation for any weather condition or emergency situation is the key to survival .
If you are camping in a cool climate such as the Antarctic , make sure you take a scarf .
Watching the movie Castaway will give you an idea of what items would be useful should you find yourself lost for several years and comes down to personal preference .
If I was Tom Hanks , I would have taken several hundred cartons of cigarettes and a suitcase of pornography .
I read somewhere about a guy who , while camping , cut his leg and as he was sleeping , a spider laid eggs in the wound .
I would rather amputate my leg than have baby spiders hatching in it so a surgical grade bone saw is an essential component in any backpack .
It is always better to preempt these things so any limbs that receive cuts , scratches or bites should be removed immediately .
Find some means of alerting rescuers to your whereabouts .
If you are lost in a desert , writing a large SOS in the sand with your water is an effective means of drawing attention .
If you are lost in a jungle , a simple two way radio can be constructed from kits available at any Tandy or RadioShack store .
Waving your arms at passing rescue planes expends precious energy so it is better to dig a small hole , lay in it , cover yourself with leaves to keep warm and relax while you wait for them to find you .
Use the time you are waiting to be rescued wisely .
Sort your DVD collection into alphabetical order or fix that broken tap that you have been meaning to for months but did not get around to because it would mean driving to the hardware store and buying a new rubber washer .
Scrapbooking is apparently a fun and satisfying hobby .
Having someone to talk to will help the time pass much more quickly .
The last time I was lost and feeling lonely , I constructed company to talk to from mud .
I called her Anne and after realising we had a lot in common , we fell in love .
Sadly , she disappeared a few nights later during a rainstorm and though I searched desperately for her throughout the wilderness for many weeks , I eventually gave up hope and sought recluse from the outside world inside a dam where I lived for eight years with my pain and a family of angry beavers .
If you become bored while waiting to be rescued and decide to walk , it is helpful to have a map .
As you have no way of knowing where you may become lost , a map of everywhere is required .
Simply marking everywhere on the map you are not will pinpoint where you are .
A simple compass can be constructed by rubbing a small round pebble up and down polyester slacks to generate static magneticity then floating the pebble in a small pool of water .
The pebble will sometimes face north .
Keeping a collection of pebbles in your pocket is also handy for when you come to a stream as you can use them as stepping stones .
In case of deeper rivers , it is wise to carry a collection of larger rocks in your backpack at all times .
If the river is still too deep , constructing a canoe can easily be accomplished by pouring a mixture of liquid polymer and setting agents into a precast mould .
The award - winning poet and playwright Inua Ellams brings together contemporary culture , classical myth , vernacular dialect and flashes of dark humour in The Actual – his first full collection of poetry .
Written on the author ’s phone , in transit , between meetings , before falling asleep and just after waking , these are poems of personal and political fury , sometimes probing delicately , sometimes burning with raw energy .
A few days ago , a woman who is a student at Hofstra University accused 5 men of gang rape .
She said that they took her cell phone and lured her into a men ’s room in a dormatory collective assaulted her .
A
Fox affiliate tv station in New York reported the story and in the text began by saying that “ Five Men Gang Raped an 18 year - old Hofstra University student on campus … ”
At the end of the sentence , they added “ according to police . ”
Now , technically it is correct and gives attribution but , when the opening statement to the story makes such a declaratory statement that sounds like a fact , unless the entire sentence is read carefully , can be problematic .
Let ’s face it , people read headlines and often miss details .
As it turns out , the police investigation found that one of the 5 men had recorded the incident on a cell phone .
The video supported the men ’s story that the entire event was consensual .
The “ victim ” recanted her story to say the incident was not a case of rape .
Now , the Miami Herald revealed the news that the charges were dropped and did so with a full photo of one of the accused , who had the charges dropped against him .
The others who were jailed also had their names and photos released throughout the media .
Yet , they will forever be linked to the accusation which was fabricated .
Apparently , police officials are considering filing charges against the woman for filing a false report .
Newsday raises five good questions surrounding the entire event and the reprecussions .
However , in my mind , Newsday did not ask a huge question .
That is , should the woman ’s name be released ?
The media has always taken the position of not reporting the name of rape victims or those who make accusations of rape .
But , routinely the accused get their names released and pictures put in the media prior to any convictions .
In this case , there was no rape victim .
She is now a suspect in a crime .
Should she not have her name released ?
The woman shown at the right was identified in the Duke LaCrosse Team case when it was found that she made a false report .
The men did not commit a crime , yet got their mugs put up everywhere and their names are not connected with a rather ugly charge .
Newsday is reporting on how they are coping , but not a word about the suspect in the crime against them .
Now , the woman admits that she was not a victim of anything .
Should the press continue to protect her identity ?
Is the press avoiding asking that question of itself and hoping that the public does n’t ask the same question .
Probably a good question for a journalistic ethics or media law class .
What do you think ?
Since I wrote some posts blaming things on porn–including the new enthusiasm for facial cumshots and FFM threesomes –I ’ve gotten multiple reader mail requests to discuss one more staple of mainstream hetero porn : anal sex .
A disclaimer before we start : I am not arguing against anal sex .
There ’s nothing wrong with it .
It can be pleasurable and enjoyable , and –as with any sex act–if two consenting adults want to engage in it , I do n’t judge and neither should you .
Okay then .
Recent scientifc data–which we ’ll get to in a minute–suggests that heterosexual women , and especially young women , are having anal sex more frequently than ever before .
For our mother ’s and grandmother ’s generation , anal sex was just about the ultimate taboo , a perverse act that couples rarely did or at least , never admitted to .
Not anymore .
Now it ’s one of the most popular searches on Google , joked about and referred to endlessly on reality TV and in scripted popular shows like “ Entourage , ” “ Sex and the City ” .
Even good - girl Renee Zellweger has a go with Hugh Grant in “ Bridget Jones . ” .
As with any trend in women ’s sexual behavior , I think it ’s fair to examine what cultural influences might account for this change .
People are more likely to engage in a formerly taboo sex act if depictions of it are widely available , even celebrated .
And where is anal sex eroticized , and depicted as not only normal , but totally hot ?
Why porn , of course .
A recent feminist call - to - arms by Janice Turner in the Times of London ( which I ’ve quoted from before and is worth a read ) blames porn and the “ raunch culture ” it creates for exalting anal sex .
Not because it ’s wrong , mind you , but because it ’s yet another sex act women feel obliged to perform–enthusiastically –for male pleasure , usually at the expense of their own pleasure .
As the academic Rosalind Gill has pointed out , in raunch culture women are not passive sexual objects , but active , even voracious agents .
Or so they appear .
Mostly , though , they are acting out the scripts , the exaggerated desires of pornography .
When porn lived on the top shelf it was clearly fantasy , removed from real relationships .
But once porn was omnipresent it suddenly gave the appearance of being true .
Porn has “ groomed ” young women until they do n’t even address their own pleasure .
Instead they are expected to get off on men getting off on them .
Today [ sex ] is perceived as something women perform for men …
And anal sex , that Act 4 of every porn movie , which gives little female pleasure and often much pain , is now firmly in the sexual repertoire of many 16 - year - old girls .
Turner describes the work of Jessica Ringrose , a sociologist specializing in gender issues at the University of London .
Dr. Ringrose , in her research on teen girls and culture , discovered that on the social networking site Bebo :
“ Hi I ’m Daniella And I Like It Up The Bum ” is typical of the taglines she came across among girls as young as 13 .
Because the way to get attention and be sexy is to talk about how you like it up the ass–even if you ’re still in junior high !
( Excuse me while I head / desk ) .
I ’ve watched a lot of anal sex in hetero porn , and in nearly every case , the actresses are writhing and moaning in obviously fake–or at the very least , heavily exaggerated –pleasure , while the male actors piston away .
I find those scenes wince - inducing , and the descriptions , like “ blond slut gets her ass pounded , ” are even worse .
But they ’ve become a staple of hetero porn DVDs and popular free porn websites like RedTube and YouPorn .
As a result , anal sex has joined hairless crotches , FFM threesomes and facial cumshots as the beau ideal of hetero hotness .
And in case you think Ringrose and Turner are being alarmist , there ’s plenty of data from credible sources that leaves little doubt that more–and increasingly younger –women are having anal sex .
A study recently published on - line by The American Journal of Public Health reported on both the rise in heterosexual anal intercourse among teens and young adults :
A new study by researchers at the Bradley Hasbro Children ’s Research Center suggests that the incidence of heterosexual anal sex is increasing among teens and young adults particularly those who have recently had unprotected vaginal sex .
These findings mirror recent data that show anal sex rates among adults doubled between the years 1995 and 2004 .
The study , published online by the American Journal of Public Health , is among the first to report on the little - known factors associated with heterosexual anal intercourse among adolescents and young adults .
“ The topic of anal intercourse is often considered taboo especially when discussed in the context of youth relationships even though we know that this behavior is a significant risk factor for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections .
It ’s critical that we recognize that more and more young people are engaging in anal sex so we can open the lines of communications and help them protect their sexual health , ” says lead author Celia Lescano , PhD , of the Bradley Hasbro Children ’s Research Center ( BHCRC ) .
Researchers assessed the sexual behavior of 1,348 adolescents and young adults between the ages of 15 and 21 who had unprotected sex in the previous three months .
They found that 16 percent had engaged in heterosexual anal intercourse within the timeframe , with condoms being used just 29 percent of the time .
The study also suggests that these young women are having anal sex not for their own pleasure , but acquiesce to the desires of their male partners :
Females who had heterosexual anal sex were more likely to be living with their partners , to have two or more sexual partners and to have previously experienced coerced intercourse ( ed : that ’s science - speak for “ rape victim ” ) .
“ These findings suggest that the factors associated with anal intercourse among females in the study relate to the context and power balance of sexual relationships , ” says Lescano , who ’s also an assistant professor of psychiatry ( research ) at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University .
“ We must teach teen girls and young women how to be assertive in sexual relationships , such as refusing unwanted sexual acts and negotiating for safer sex , whether it ’s anal or vaginal . ”
A different study by the Hutchinson Cancer Research center also found a distinct uptick in the number of women engaging in anal sex :
… among the female control group studied , 21.5 percent had reported practicing anal sex , a significant increase from a previous case - control study , published in 1987 , in which 11 percent of female controls had reported ever having anal sex .
Incidentally , Hutchinson studied the popularity of anal sex because doctors believe it ’s linked to rising rates of HPV - related anal cancer .
As part of its research on STIs , the CDC also studied the trend , and reports that 34 % of women 25 - 44 reported having had anal sex .
When you see a new or expanding trend in sexual behavior–or any human behavior at all–it ’s illogical to assume that it just sprang up all by itself .
Sexual trends are rooted in the larger culture .
It makes perfect sense to assume that repeated exposure to eroticized depictions of anal sex is going to make both men and women curious about it and more likely to try it .
No harm there –that ’s certainly how and why I decided to try it .
Problem is , hetero mainstream porn is n’t depicting the kind of careful , attentive interaction that makes anal sex pleasurable .
In fact , in porn there ’s no attention paid to the woman ’s pleasure–or even her comfort–at all .
The male actors just plunge in and start pounding .
It ’s not the kind of sex teens–or anyone else–should aspire to .
Unfortunately , in our pornified popular culture , male pleasure is king , and young women are buying into that message , instead of expecting equal focus on their own pleasure ( or the chance to say “ no thanks , not for me ” without repercussion or ridicule ) .
What ’s even more discouraging is that they seem to think they must do it in order to be seen as sexy , or popular .
Thanks , porn .

The paper , which recommends that the US return to a more laissez - faire economic system rather than intervening further in activity , has been endorsed by Nobel laureate James Buchanan , who said : " We have learned some things from comparable experiences of the 1930s ' Great Depression , perhaps enough to reduce the severity of the current contraction .
But we have made no progress toward putting limits on political leaders , who act out their natural proclivities without any basic understanding of what makes capitalism work . "
Since May , the red light cameras in the city of Corona , California have issued a total of 6511 citations worth $ 2,903,906 .
This money has been split between Corona , Redflex Traffic Systems of Australia , the state and Riverside County .
On Wednesday , the Corona City Council discussed the possibility of cutting the state and county out of the program entirely .
This would allow Corona to keep more money while giving the city a chance to claim it is lowering the pricey $ 446 automated ticket .
“ I voted for the program , but I made a mistake , ” Mayor Steve Nolan said .
“ I did n’t ask the cost …
We are killing people with the fines . ”
The city ’s proposal would ignore the California statute authorizing red light camera ticketing , setting procedures and establishing the fines .
In its place , the city would substitute its own administrative ticketing arrangement .
Currently Corona only collects $ 133.80 out of each $ 446 ticket .
Under the new plan , the first ticket would be lower but the city stands to collect a much greater amount from repeat violations .
“ Administrative citations are processed outside of the court system and the driver is not held responsible , ” Police Chief Richard Madory explained .
“ Vehicle Code Section 21101 ( d ) provides the city with the authority to implement a local ordinance that would require a motorist to stop at red lights or any other traffic control device ; however , there are no cities , to our knowledge , in California that are issuing administrative citations for red light violations .
The fees received for administrative citations are set by California Government Code 36900 at $ 100 for a first violation .
Subsequent violations can be increased up to $ 500 within a twelve - month period of time . ”
Taking the unprecedented step of abandoning the structure set out by the legislature would certainly draw a lawsuit .
Opponents of the red light camera program made forceful statements at the council hearing .
“ I think we need to call this what it is : a tax increase for the city , ” resident Mark Hainan said .
“ We ’re taxed enough .
Obama ’s killing us , our state ’s killing us , and now our own city ’s killing us .
We ’re talking about California stops — ninety percent of the people in this room do California stops .
I think the whole abomination should be abolished , not just reduce the fines . ”
According to the city , 55 percent of tickets are issued to Corona residents .
Redflex sends the vast majority of these tickets to drivers who make a right - hand turn on red after slowing .
Studies show that these “ California stops ” are not a significant cause of accidents .
Only one resident spoke in favor of the cameras , and those speaking against them received applause from the audience until Nolan insisted that they stop .
Nolan ended the meeting by stating that he would schedule a public city council study session to further consider the administrative ticket proposal .

Not every French person sided with baboon - mannered Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
“ You know very well , if this [ maid - raping ] episode had occurred in France , it would not have turned out the same way … , ” said Marine Le Pen , currently France ’s most popular and most controversial presidential candidate .
“ It ’s always good news to see a scoundrel in handcuffs , ” said her father , Jean - Marie Le Pen .
Many consider the elder Le Pen , who founded France ’s National Front Party , a scoundrel himself , but nobody disputes his mastery of inflammatory comments .
Modern satellite communications , which today bring us everything from multi-channel television to the Global Positioning System and the nightly weather map , began as a salvage job to restore the prestige of Hughes Aircraft Company ’s beleaguered Radar Department .
It was late 1958 , and the Los Angeles - area lab was developing a powerful , aircraft - mounted radar for U.S. jet interceptors to target incoming Soviet bombers .
Then the Soviets turned to ballistic missiles .
Department head Frank Carver went to see Harold Rosen , his young hotshot electrical engineer , who had been trained at the California Institute of Technology .
The interceptor is now obsolete , Carver told Rosen , and the radar project is dead .
Find something else to do .
The bureaucratic survival instinct does not usually inspire genius , but these were unusual times .
The Soviet Union had launched Sputnik the year before and was building bigger and better rockets almost monthly .
The United States was racing to catch up .
“ Space was on everybody ’s mind .
You wanted to be part of it , and here was an opportunity , ” Rosen says .
His tree - shaded ranch house in Santa Monica , the den tastefully furnished with testimonials of his accomplishments , is the same one he bought when he came to Hughes in 1956 .
Still spry at 83 , Rosen consults part - time for Boeing , which took over Hughes ’ satellite operations in 2000 .
He puts in two days a week on such jobs as designing the architecture of communications satellites and helping investigate problems with ones already in orbit .
For years researchers had been talking about the ability to transmit radio signals around the world by using Earth - orbiting satellites as a relay , but in the 1950s , it was still only a dream .
There were several ways to make it happen .
By 1958 , the leading idea was to put a fleet of satellites in Earth orbit at an altitude between 200 and 1,200 miles .
A ground station would link to one satellite as it came up over the horizon , then switch to another when the first one was gone .
( Even the first active commercial communications satellite , Telstar , which was launched into an elliptical orbit in 1962 , was supposed to have been part of a fleet . )
A second way was to boost a satellite 22,000 miles above the equator , where it would be in geosynchronous orbit , moving at a speed that constantly kept it over the same spot on Earth .
Whoever could put three of these in orbit equidistant from one another could receive , relay , and transmit signals to and from almost anywhere on the planet .
In a 1945 issue of Wireless World magazine , British scientist and science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke had first outlined for a popular audience how such a system might work .
While he wrote of a three - satellite network operating in geosynchronous orbit , he also described an orbiting space station manned by astronauts whose chief job was to change burned - out vacuum tubes .
The arrival of the Space Age made Clarke ’s orbital concept seem achievable .
Rosen had n’t thought much about communications satellites , and did n’t know anything about Clarke ’s vision , but in early 1959 he started talking to colleagues .
Tom Hudspeth , an electronics engineer at Hughes and a ham radio operator , lamented the sorry state of international communications .
To use transatlantic telephone service , you had to get in line .
And there was no bandwidth for television , he complained .
A communications satellite would change everything .
Rosen also sought out Don Williams , a brilliant , Harvard - educated , 28 - year - old mathematician and inventor who had worked at Hughes before joining a startup company that built machines to detect dead cockroaches , cigarette butts , and other foreign objects in recycled - glass bottles .
Business was good , but Rosen needed him , so he persuaded Hughes to pay Williams an annual salary of $ 22,000 — very high at the time — and got him back .
Williams was interested in navigation satellites ; Rosen was not .
But Williams wanted to put his satellite in geosynchronous orbit , and Rosen was very interested in that .
Then another colleague showed Rosen a journal paper written by two renowned Bell Laboratories engineers — Rudolf Kompfner and John Pierce — that described how to use space for transoceanic communications .
The authors and Bell Labs were interested in low - altitude satellites .
Rosen saw that low altitude had its virtues ; from there , randomly spaced satellites could use omnidirectional antennas to receive and transmit signals .
But he also found the approach sloppy , like surrounding Earth with a halo of whirling bowling balls .
A geosynchronous system , by contrast , requiring only three satellites , was conservative and neat — “ far more appealing to me , ” he says now .
There were major challenges : how to transmit the signals ; how to keep the satellite from wobbling or drifting out of orbit ; whether the United States had enough rocket to lift a payload to 22,000 miles .
But Rosen decided to go forward , and during the next four years , he , Hudspeth , and Williams built the world ’s first high - altitude communications satellite .
The Syncom program was the prototype for an industry that today has 275 satellites in geosynchronous orbit .
Business leaders and academics will meet in Grafton today to learn more about the rollout of the National Broadband Network .
The Minister for Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy , Stephen Conroy , will meet the representatives and talk about future regional opportunities and benefits of the project .
Page MP Janelle Saffin says the National Broadband Network is an ambitious project to wire up Australia for high - speed broadband .
She says it promises to revolutionise day - to - day activities and the way business is done on the New South Wales north coast .
Ms Saffin says Southern Cross University Professor of Information Technology , Peter Croll , has been building a strong case for the Northern Rivers and mid-north coast to be a high priority area for the rollout .
Senator Conroy will visit the village of Coutts Crossing , local businesses and outline the plan at a lunch meeting .

The Article : What ’s So Bad About Israel ? by Michael Neumann in July of 2002 for Counter Punch .
The Text :
It ’s hard to say what ’s so bad about Israel , and its defenders –having nothing better to use –have seized on this .
Some do so soberly , like Harpers publisher John R. MacArthur , who thinks Israel comes off no worse than the Russians in Chechnya , and much better than the Americans in Vietnam ( Toronto Globe and Mail , May 13th , 2002 ) .
Others do so defiantly .
True , Israel has taken the land of harmless people , killed innocent civilians , tortured prisoners , bulldozed houses , destroyed crops , yada yada yada .
Who cares ?
What else is new ?
I completely sympathize with this point of view .
The appetite for world - class atrocity may be adolescent , but it belongs to an adolescence that many of us never outgrow .
The facts are disappointing .
Even compared with post - Nazi monsters like Pol Pot or Saddam Hussein , the Israelis have killed very few people ; their tortures and oppression are boring .
How could these mediocre crimes compete for our attention with whatever else is on TV ?
They could n’t ; in fact they are designed not to do so .
Yet Israel is a growing evil whose end is not in sight .
Its outlines have become clearer as times have changed .
Until sometime after the Six - Day War in 1967 , Israel ’s sins were unspectacular , at least from a cynic ’s perspective .
Israel was born from an understandable desire of a persecuted people for security .
Jews immigrated to Palestine ; acquired land by fair means or foul , provoked violent reactions .
There ensued a cycle of violence in which the Jews distinguished themselves in at least one impeccably documented and truly disgusting massacre at Deir Yassin , and probably many more that Jewish forces succeeded in concealing .
The new state accorded full rights only to its Jewish inhabitants , and defeated its Arab opponents both in battle and in a propaganda campaign that effectively concealed Israeli racism and aggression .
It was said then , as now : what ’s so bad about that ?
The answer is , nothing .
Of course the perpetrators of these crimes deserve no state , but only punishment : what else is new ?
Is n’t this the normal way that states are born ?
Israel ’s pre-1967 crimes , then , are not a part of its special evil , though they did much to create it .
The past was glorified , not exorcised .
Both Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir , indisputably responsible for the worst pre-1967 brutalities , went on to become prime minister : the poison of the early years is still working its way through Middle East politics .
But the big change , post - 1967 , was Israel ’s choice of war over peace .
Sometime after 1967 , Israel ’s existence became secure .
It did n’t seem so during the 1973 Yom Kippur War , but soon it became clear that Israel would never again be caught with its guard down .
Its vigilance has guaranteed , for the foreseeable future , that Arab nations pose no serious threat .
As the years pass , Israel ’s military advantage only increases , to the point that no country in the world would care to confront it .
At the same time , and to an increasing extent , Palestinians have abandoned any real hope of retaking pre-1967 Israeli territory , and are willing to settle for the return of the occupied territories .
In this context , the Israeli settlement policy , quite apart from its terrible effect on Palestinians , is outrageous for what it represents : a careful , deliberate rejection of peace , and a declaration of the fixed intention to dispossess the Palestinians until they have nothing left .
And something else has changed .
Israel could claim , as a matter of self - interest if not of right , that it needed the pre-1967 territory as a homeland for the Jews .
It can not say this about the settlements , which exist not from any real need for anything , but for three reasons : to give some Israelis a cheap deal on housing , to conform to the messianic expectations of Jewish fundamentalists , and , not least , as a vengeful , relentless , sadistically gradual expression of hatred for the defeated Arab enemy .
In short , by the mid-1970s , Israel ’s crimes were no longer the normal atrocities of nation - building nor an excessive sort of self - defense .
They represented a cold - blooded , calculated , indeed an eagerly embraced choice of war over peace , and an elaborate plan to seek out those who had fled the misery of previous confrontations , to make certain that their suffering would continue .
So Israel stands out among other unpleasant nations in the depth of its commitment to gratuitous violence and nastiness : this you expect to find among skinheads rather than nations .
But wait !
there ’s more !
It is not just that times have changed .
It also has to do with the position Israel occupies in these new times .
Though we might wish otherwise , the political or historical ‘ location ’ of a crime can be a big contributor to its moral status .
It is terrible that there are vestiges of slavery in Abidjan and Mauritania .
We often reproach ourselves for not getting more upset about such goings - on , as if the lives of these far - off non -white people were unimportant .
And maybe we should indeed be ashamed of ourselves , but this is not the whole story .
There is a difference between the survival of evil in the world ’s backwaters and its emergence in the world ’s spotlight .
If some smug new corporation , armed with political influence and snazzy lawyers , set up a slave market in Times Square , that would represent an even greater evil than the slave market in Abidjan .
This is not because humans in New York are more important than humans in Abidjan , but because what happens in New York is more influential and more representative of the way the world is heading .
American actions do much to set standards worldwide ; the actions of slave - traders in Abidjan do not .
( The same sort of contrast applies to the Nazi extermination camps : part of their specialness lies , not in the numbers killed or the bureaucracy that managed the killing , but in the fact that nothing like such killing has ever occurred in a nation so on the ‘ cutting edge ’ of human development . )
Cultural domination has its responsibilities .
What Israel does is at the very center of the world stage , not only as a focus of media attention , but also as representative of Western morality and culture .
This could not be plainer from the constant patter about how Israel is a shining example of democracy , resourcefulness , discipline , courage , toughness , determination , and so on .
And nothing could be more inappropriate than the complaints that Israel is being ‘ held to a higher standard ’ .
It is not being held to one ; it aggressively and insolently appropriates it .
It plants its flag on some cultural and moral summit .
Israel is the ultimate victim - state of the ultimate people – the noblest , the most long - suffering , the most persecuted , the most intelligent , the Chosen Ones .
The reason Israel is judged by a higher standard is its blithe certainty , accepted by generations of fawning Westerners , that it exists at a higher standard .
Other countries , of course , have put on similar airs , but at least their crimes could be represented as a surprising deviation from noble principles .
When people try to understand how Germans could become Nazis , or the French , torturers in Algeria , or the Americans , murderers at My Lai , it is always possible to ask –what went wrong ?
How could these societies so betray their civilized roots and high ideals ?
And sometimes plausible attempts were made to associate this betrayal with some fringe elements of the society –disgruntled veterans , dispossessed younger sons , provincial reactionaries , trailer trash .
If these societies had gone wrong , it was a matter of perverted values , suppressed forces , aberrant tendencies , deformed dreams .
With Israel , there is no question of such explanations .
Its atrocities belong to its mainstream , its traditions , its founding ideology .
They are performed by its heroes , not its kooks and losers .
Israel has not betrayed anything .
On the contrary , its actions express a widely espoused , perhaps dominant version of its ideals .
Israel is honored , often as not , for the very same tribal pride and nation - building ambitions that fire up its armies and its settlers .
Its crimes are front and center , not only on the world stage , but also on its own stage .
What matters here is not Israel ’s arrogance , but its stature .
Israel stands right in the spotlight and crushes an entire people .
It defies international protests and resolutions as no one else can .
Only Israel , not , say , Indonesia or even the US , dares proclaim : “ Who are you to preach morality to us ?
We are morality incarnate ! ” Indonesia , or Mauritania , or Iraq do not welcome delegations of happy North American schoolchildren , host prestigious academic conferences , go down in textbooks as a textbook miracle .
Characters on TV sitcoms do not go off to find themselves in the Abidjan slave markets as they do on Israel ’s kibbutzim .
Israel banks on this .
Its tactics seem nicely tuned to inflict the most harm with the least damage to its image .
They include deliberately messy surgical strikes , halting ambulances , uprooting orchards and olive groves , destroying urban sanitation , curfews , road closures , holding up food until it spoils , allocating five times the water to settlers as to the people whose land was confiscated , and attacks on educational or cultural facilities .
Its most effective strategies are minimalist , as when Palestinians have to sit and wait at checkpoints for hours in sweltering cars , risking a bullet if they get out to stretch their legs , waiting to work , to get medical care , to do anything in life that requires movement from one place to another , as likely to be turned back as let through , and certain to suffer humiliation or worse .
Israel has pioneered the science of making life unlivable with as little violence as possible .
The Palestinians are not merely provoked into reacting ; they have no rational choice but to react .
If they did n’t , things would just get worse faster , with no hope of relief .
Israel is an innovator in the search for a squeaky - clean sadism .
The worse things get for the Palestinians , the more violently they must defend themselves , and the more violently Israel can respond .
Whenever possible , Israel sees to it that the Palestinians take each new step in the escalation .
The hope is that , at some point , Israel will be able to kill many tens of thousands , all in the name of self - defense .
And subtly but surely , things are changing still further .
Israel is starting to let the mask drop , not from its already public intentions , but from its naked strength .
It no longer deigns to conceal its sophisticated nuclear arsenal .
It begins to supply the world with almost as much military technology as it consumes .
And it no longer sees any need to be discreet about its defiance of the United States ’ request for moderation : Israel is happy to humiliate the ‘ stupid Americans ’ outright .
As it plunders , starves and kills , Israel does not lurk in the world ’s back - alleys .
It says , “ Look at us .
We ’re taking these people ’s land , not because we need it , but because we feel like it .
We ’re putting religious nuts all over it because they help cleanse the area of these Arab lice who dare to defy us .
We know you do n’t like it and we do n’t care , because we do n’t conform to other people ’s standards .
We set the standards for others . ”
And the standards it sets continue to decline .
Israel Shahak and others have documented the rise of fundamentalist Jewish sects that speak of the greater value of Jewish blood , the specialness of Jewish DNA , the duty to kill even innocent civilians who pose a potential danger to Jews , and the need to ‘ redeem ’ lands lying far beyond the present frontiers of Israeli control .
Much of this happens beneath the public surface of Israeli society , but these racial ideologies exert a strong influence on the mainstream .
So far , they have easily prevailed over the small , courageous Jewish opposition to Israeli crimes .
The Israeli government can afford to let the fanatical race warriors go unchecked , because it knows the world would not dare connect their outrages to any part of Judaism ( or Zionism ) itself .
As for the dissenters , do n’t they just show what a wonderfully democratic society Israel has produced ?
As Israel sinks lower , it corrupts the world that persists in admiring it .
Thus Amnesty International ’s military adviser , David Holley , with a sort of honest military bonhomie , tells the world that the Israelis have “ a very valid point ” when they refuse to allow a UN investigative team into Jenin : “ You do need a soldier ’s perspective to say , well , this was a close quarter battle in an urban environment , unfortunately soldiers will make mistakes and will throw a hand grenade through the wrong window , will shoot at a twitching curtain , because that is the way war is . ” (*)
We quite understand : Israel is a respectable country with respectable defense objectives , and mistakes will be made .
Soldier to soldier , we see that destroying swarthy ‘ gunmen ’ who crouch in wretched buildings is a legitimate enterprise , because it serves the higher purpose of clearing away the vermin who resist the implantation of superior Jewish DNA throughout the occupied territories .
It is this ability to command respect despite the most public outrages against humanity that makes Israel so exceptionally bad .
Not that it needs to be any worse than ‘ the others ’ : that would be more than bad enough .
But Israel does not only commit its crimes ; it also legitimates them .
That is not a matter of abstract moral argument , but of political acceptance and respectability .
As the world slowly tries to emerge from barbarism –for instance , through the human rights movements for which Israel has such contempt– Israel mockingly drags it back by sanctifying the very doctrines of racial vengeance that more civilized forces condemn .
Israel brings no new evils into the world .
It merely rehabilitates old ones , as an example for others to emulate and admire .

Science reporter , BBC News
Frank De Winne ( front - right ) is on his second mission to the ISS Belgian astronaut Frank De Winne has spoken of his pride at taking command of the International Space Station .
The European Space Agency astronaut is the first national outside of the US and Russia to lead a crew on the orbiting platform .
De Winne took the role at the weekend when the previous commander , Gennady Padalka , left to return to Earth .
The Belgian told reporters on Tuesday that his appointment was a great moment for the European Astronaut Corps .
" I have always been proud to be European and the Europeans of course have a big heritage as explorers ; and so , therefore , for me , it is a big honour to be the first European to be a commander of the space station , " he said .
De Winne made his remarks during a live link - up with the ISS .
He took questions while floating inside the Columbus module , Europe 's science lab attached to the platform .
The Esa astronaut launched to the station in May .
He will stay aboard the platform until December when he is due to fly back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule .
' Mature ' role During his command , he will oversee the completion of the Japanese HTV mission .
The HTV is a new freighter that supplies the ISS with food and equipment .
The robotic truck will soon detach from the platform , taking itself and the ISS 's rubbish into a controlled burn - up over the Pacific Ocean .
Expedition 21 - the name given to De Winne 's crew - will also welcome a new module from Russia .
The Mini-Research Module 2 , or MRM 2 , will act as an additional docking port and airlock at the Russian end of the station .
It will be delivered next month .
The Belgian also has a busy schedule of science ahead of him .
He said he had already worked on 35 experiments and had a further 10 to work through before his stay was completed .
Simonetta Di Pippo , the director of human spaceflight at Esa , congratulated Frank De Winne on his appointment .
She said it reflected well on all European space activity .
" It is a confirmation for the quality of our work , of our teams who support the operations and who prepare , train and support our astronauts , " she told BBC News .
" This commandership also marks the fact that Europe is mature to play a greater role in human spaceflight and exploration . "
Clown company
Two Esa astronauts are due to go to the ISS next year ; a third will follow in 2011 .
At the moment , Europe is dependent on other nations to carry its astronauts into orbit .
Esa recently initiated a study to examine if its robotic ATV freighter could be upgraded to carry crews of its own .
Frank De Winne spent nine days aboard the space station in 2002 .
Asked about the recent visit of circus entrepreneur Guy Laliberte to the platform as a space tourist , the ISS commander said the Canadian had fitted in well .
" He integrated very well in the crew and he did not disturb our work at all , " the Belgian explained .
" Moreover , I think it 's very important that people like him who talk to a different audience about the importance of space also get the opportunity do that ; and I think he did it very well . "

WHOA !
A recently declassified interview with Brigadier General Godfrey McHugh , President Kennedy ’s military aide on his fateful trip to Dallas in 1963 , contains some shocking details about LBJ in the hours after Kennedy ’s head was blown off .
Seems Ole Burlap Britches was convinced that whoever killed Kennedy would soon be coming for him , so he did what most of us would probably do : hid in the bathroom of Air Force One ’s presidential bedroom and sobbed hysterically .
In a post for HuffPo , historian Steven M. Gillon discloses McHugh ’s shocking revelations about Lyndon Johnson , generally thought of as being a big , Texas badass .
After President Kennedy ’s body had been loaded onto Air Force One , everyone was ready to get the fuck out of Dallas , but there was one problem … nobody knew where LBJ was and he ’d ordered the pilots to keep the plane on the ground , so McHugh went looking for him :
According to the newly declassified transcript , Mrs. Kennedy was becoming desperate to leave .
“ Mrs. Kennedy was getting very warm , she had blood all over her hat , her coat … his brains were sticking on her hat .
It was dreadful , ” McHugh said .
She pleaded with him to get the plane off the ground .
“ Please , let ’s leave , ” she said .
McHugh jumped up and used the phone near the rear compartment to call Captain James Swindal .
“ Let ’s leave , ” he said .
Swindal responded : “ I ca n’t do it .
I have orders to wait . ”
Not wanting to make a scene in front of Mrs. Kennedy , McHugh rushed to the front of the plane .
“ Swindal , what on earth is going on ? ”
The pilot told him that “ the President wants to remain in this area . ”
McHugh , like most members of the Kennedy entourage , did not know that Johnson was onboard .
They believed that the new president was on his own plane flying back to Washington .
If LBJ was on the plane , McHugh wanted to see for himself .
Since he had not seen Johnson in the aisle — and at 6 ’ 4 ″ Johnson would be tough to miss — McHugh assumed that he must then be in the bedroom .
When he checked there Johnson was nowhere to be seen .
The only place on the plane he had not inspected was the bathroom in the presidential bedroom .
What McHugh claimed to have witnessed next was shocking .
“ I walked in the toilet , in the powder room , and there he was hiding , with the curtain closed , ” McHugh recalled .
He claimed that LBJ was crying , “ They ’re going to get us all .
It ’s a plot .
It ’s a plot .
It ’s going to get us all . ' ”
According to the General , Johnson “ was hysterical , sitting down on the john there alone in this thing . ”
Now , Gillon goes on to say that McHugh did not like LBJ , so it ’s possible he made up a story to make him look like a huge pussy for posterity , but Generals do n’t lie , do they ?

When it comes to investing , there two distinctive strategies .
The first is the buy and hold approach .
The second is timing the market .
Simply put , buy and hold investors keep buying ( stocks , mutual funds , ETFS … ) no matter what is happening to the market and hold those investments regardless of market conditions .
This is typically done through a strategy called dollar cost averaging ( DCA ) .
Market timers seek to take money out when the market is weak and buy more when buying is good .
Ultimately , you need to be sure that the investing plan is personalized to your preferences .
These days there are a lot of varying opinions about what the market is going to do .
Has the bull been released to run free , or is the bear lurking behind a hidden door ?
Fortunately , if you are a buy and hold investor you do not need to worry about those factors as long as you have a long term timeframe ( 5 - 10 years ) .
I concluded a long time ago that I ’m not smart enough to time the market .
The Problem with Buy and Hold Investing – You May Look Like an Idiot
I spent the end of 2008 and the first few months of 2009 feeling like an idiot .
Ever since I bought my very first mutual fund about 15 years ago I have been a buy and hold investor .
I ’ll be honest , the economic downturn made me doubt and second guess my myself .
The situation was actually intensified because in April of 2008 I cashed in all my non-retirement related investments so that I could move them to another brokerage .
I held that check in my hand and then turned around and threw it right back into the market .
My losses were just about in line with everyone else around 40 % .
I started with such a strong buy and hold mentality and I was such a strong believer in that every time the market went down I threw a little more money into the market .
It would only take a few weeks before I would feel like even more of an idiot .
I thought everyone else had pulled out of the market while my losses were growing minute by minute .
Three Advantages of Buy and Hold Investing
The Buy and Hold Approach Lets You Look Like a Genius
Though I felt like an idiot in the middle of the mess , I feel quite good now .
I have not lost a single dollar in the 2008 – early 2009 market woes .
I now feel a sense of redemption .
Perhaps I did make some wise choices .
Either way , there have been some blessings from the financial weakness .
At this very moment , the market timer has the weight of the world on his shoulders .
He struggled to know if it the market is destined to go up or down .
They are forced to decide if they should get in or stay out .
The agony increases .
The buy and hold investor , on the other hand , has made his choice and moves on .
Sometimes this is an extremely lucrative decision as the market has now offered around 55 % returns since its low point this year .
The Buy and Hold Approach Protects Your Investments From Their Greatest Enemy – You
While investing has many enemies , none is more formidable than the enemy within .
While there are many lessons to be learned from investing , you should not start investing until you have at least a fundamental investing knowledge .
Without some fundamental knowledge you will be setting yourself up for a fall .
In general , the less sophisticated a plan sounds and the more boring it appears to be , the more likely you are to succeed .
Your emotions will take you on a roller coaster , but you need to continue to do what is right regardless of how you feel .
The Buy and Hold Approach Offers the Flexibility to Focus on Other Life Events
I sure hope the sum of your life includes more than the movements of the market .
Far too many people can tell you what the DJIA did today , but cannot tell you what their kids did at school .
Why is it that people have time to watch the market , but not time for leisure ?
The buy and hold approach lets you spend your life energy in line with your values .
As you look ahead to your investing plans for 2010 , you should seriously consider the many advantages of being and buy and hold investor .
Are you a fan of the buy and hold approach or market timing ?
The sea butterfly Limacina helicina , at the bottom of polar food chains , is very sensitive to acidity .
By FishOutofWater
Many marine shells are made up of a metastable form of calcium carbonate , aragonite , that forms and dissolves quickly .
Many of these organisms have evolved in very chemically stable , slightly alkaline marine waters around pH 8.1 .
Because the activity of the carbonate ion in solution drops very rapidly with increasing acidity above pH 8.1 , organisms with aragonite shells that do n't control acidity internally cannot survive in acidic water .
The sea butterfly 's shell formation speed slows dramatically at pH7.78 pdf
The sea butterfly is food for a wide range of fish , birds and marine mammals in the polar regions .
The " shelled pteropod " species produce a calcium carbonate shell ; the only shelled pteropod in Arctic waters is Limacina helicina , a species that can occur in high densities in both Arctic and Southern Ocean .
Limacina helicina is also an important component of marine food webs .
For example in the Southern Ocean it is frequently very abundant ( up to 2681 indm −3 ) and is a major dietary component for zooplankton and higher predators such as herring , salmon , whale and birds ( Hunt et al. , 2008 ; Karnovsky et al. , 2008 ) .
Shelled pteropods may also play a geochemical role in the oceans , as significant contributors to the export of carbonate ( order 10 % of the global CaCO3 flux , Berner and Honjo , 1981 ) and carbon to the deep ocean ( Collier et al. , 2000 ) .
The naturally high dissolved CO2 levels in the polar regions , which are the most biologically productive regions in the oceans , make the Arctic Ocean and the Southern Ocean more susceptible to the effects of ocean acidification than the temperate and tropical seas and areas of the oceans .
However , ocean circulation brings cold polar waters upward in certain areas , making them sensitive to acidification too .
The uptake of C02 by photosynthesis to from organic carbon chains and in calcium carbonate shells has maintained stable levels of upper ocean acidity for the past 500 million years , excepting periods of mass extinctions , when the chemistry was acidified by rapid increases in atmospheric CO2 levels .
However , the deeper ocean below a certain depth dissolves calcium carbonate for 2 primary reasons .
The acidity of the deep ocean is increased by the oxidation to CO2 of organic matter that rains down form the near surface .
Increasing pressure also promotes the dissolution of calcium carbonate shells .
An oxygen minimum zone forms where most of the organic matter is oxidized .
Deep water is more acidic and contains less oxygen than the surface ocean .
The most biologically productive marine areas in the temperate zones and tropics are areas of deep water upwelling .
This water is richer in nutrients but more acidic and lower in oxygen than in less productive waters .
The Pacific Ocean , which is on the upwelling end of the thermohaline circulation ( the great ocean conveyor of salt and heat that begins with downwelling near Greenland in the north Atlantic ocean ) is therefore more affected by acidification than the Atlantic and Indian oceans .
Tropical coral reefs in the Pacific near Panama are small and tend to fall apart because the water is upwelled and acidic .
Even the Great Barrier reef is suffering .
Growth has slowed to record low rates .
Coral growth in Australia 's Great Barrier Reef has slowed to its most sluggish rate in the past 400 years .
By J. Freund FishOutofWater
The decline endangers the species the reef supports , say researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science .
They studied massive porites corals , which are several hundred years old , and found that calcification has declined by 13.3 % since 1990 .
Global warming and the increasing acidity of seawater are to blame , they write in Science journal .
By burning , in a few hundred years , fossil fuel carbon that took nature hundreds of millions of years to sequesterwe are recreating a natural disaster , Dr. Ken Caldeira told Congress .
Ken Caldeira 's testimony to the House of Representatives .
Twenty years ago , I was studying what happened to ocean chemistry when the dinosaurs became extinct , over 60 million years ago .
When the meteorite hit that killed off the dinosaurs , gases were released that made the oceans acidic .
Coral reefs disappeared , along with many other organisms that make their shells or skeletons out of calcium carbonate .
It took a few tens of thousands of years for ocean chemistry to recover , but it took coral reefs about two million years to become common once again .
Unfortunately , unless we reduce carbon dioxide emissions , it looks like our effect on the oceans will be similar to the effect of the meteorite that wiped out the dinosaurs , except we are taking a few decades to do what the meteorite did in an afternoon .
Off of the west coast where acidic cold water upwells the volume of acidic oxygen depleted water is growing rapidly with bizarre effects .
Humboldt , or jumbo squid ( Dosidicus gigas ) have indeed made their return to California waters , and in a big way .
They are now being caught on party boats from San Diego to Fort Bragg .
Special evening trips that specifically target the squid are catching behemoths ranging from 12 to 40 lbs .
Good numbers of Humboldt squid have been showing up off the California coast in recent years .
Although there are no bag limits at this time , anglers should be conservation - minded and take only what they can comfortably use .
One large jumbo squid can easily feed an entire family for quite a long time .
By California DFG FishOutofWater
As far as what impact the Humboldt squid may be having on other game fish populations , the jury is still out .
The squid 's major prey items include lantern fishes ; however , lantern fishes are prey to a lot of other game fishes , so it may be more of a competition aspect rather than strictly a predator - prey aspect .
Humboldt squid are more efficient predators in low oxygen environments than fish predators and can out - compete these species .
However , they also feed on a wide range of species from northern anchovy , Pacific sardine , Pacific mackerel , juvenile rockfishes , and squid species ( including themselves , hence their reputation ) so there is great potential to directly affect game fish populations .
According to Senior Marine Biologist and DFG squid expert Dale Sweetnam , " Researchers have been observing the expansion and shallowing of oxygen minimum zones off the West Coast in recent years .
It is that environment that Dosidicus flourishes in and is probably the reason that they are still out and about and in no hurry to leave . "
Expanding low oxygen zones make are a danger to marine life and ultimately all animals that respire oxygen .
Schemes to fight global warming and ocean acidification by fertilizing the ocean would make low oxygen zones grow faster .
Similarly , efforts to engineer solutions to global warming will not solve the ocean acidification problem .
Dr. Ken Caldeira presented this figure to Congress that showed why we need to reduce CO2 to 350 ppm .
Present levels of CO2 are already causing enough acidity to damage corals in the Galapagos islands , endangering the whole unique ecosystem that Darwin discovered .
Orange & Red zones are deadly to coral & acid sensitive life .
By Ken Caldeira to Congress FishOutofWater
The figure shows that if we allow CO2 levels to reach 450 PPM as planned ( not 350 ) Galapagos corals will be in the red zone .
If that happens the Galapagos ecosystem will likely be irreversibly damaged .
Damage in the Galapagos Islands is already being observed at 380 PPM .
Some 175 years after the wildlife of the Galapagos helped inspire Charles Darwin to develop his theory of evolution , scientists are measuring the impact of global warming on the rich but fragile biodiversity of the islands .
The volcanic archipelago , about 600 miles west of the Ecuadorean coast , is home to scores of endemic species that closely depend on one another for survival .
Scientists say abrupt and frequent changes in sea temperatures and the death of coral reefs near the islands show that global warming is taking its toll on local sea life .
" The coral reefs create a habitat ; they are like a forest , like the Amazon .
They are home to scores of species .
...
If the corals die we lose thousands of species that are associated to the coral , " said German marine biologist Judith Denkinger .
The Galapagos - based scientist said the harm that pollution and climate change are causing marine life could trigger a domino effect and hurt on - shore species as well .
" Everything is intertwined .
You can't say this is land , this is sea , they are both one , " Denkinger said , sitting on a rock by the sea and surrounded by growling sea lions .
Everything is intertwined .
We must save our seas and all the creatures that depend on us .

Tracey Emin says France has traditionally helped artists Artist Tracey Emin has said she is thinking of leaving the UK in protest about being overtaxed .
In a Sunday Times interview she said she was " very seriously considering leaving Britain , " adding : " I 'm simply not willing to pay tax at 50 % . "
The government 's 50 p tax rate for incomes of more than £ 150,000 will be introduced in April .
Emin said she is considering France because she thinks it has lower taxes and appreciates the arts more .
She said : " So much here is simply not working now .
The taxes are too high , there are n't enough incentives to work hard , and our politicians have put me off .
We 're paying through the nose for everything . "
' Importance of culture ' Referring to the new tax , she said : " I reckon it would mean me paying about 65 p in every pound with tax , National Insurance and so on . "
Emin said the Labour government had no understanding for the arts .
" At least in France their politicians have always understood the importance of culture and they have traditionally helped out artists with subsidy and some tax advantages , " she said .
" We simply have what I call ' ambition politicians ' who go from one department to another for career reasons , " she said .
" We should never have got involved in either Iraq or Afghanistan .
Nor should we have bid for the Olympics , which we 've now got and cannot afford , " Emin added .
The new tax rate , announced in April 's Budget , broke Labour 's 2005 manifesto pledge not to raise income tax for high earners during this Parliament .
The government estimated the higher rate would raise £ 1.13 bn next year .

Ring Toss by Carly & Art
Ever since seeing the Edward Burtynsky exhibit and attending Saturday ’s lecture by Dr. William Rees at the Corcoran , I ca n’t stop thinking about Man vs Nature .
As Dr. Rees explained ( in a very eloquent and scientific manner ) , there are fundamental differences between our behaviors that make it virtually impossible for man to coexist with nature in a closed system .
At our current rate of population growth and resource consumption , the planet simply cannot sustain us forever .
To summarize his speech , unless drastic policy changes are put into place by our governments and we start to think globally instead of selfishly , well , we ’re doomed .
This week ’s featured photo is a demonstration of nature ’s struggle against man .
Or is it ?
Despite having several rings of concrete around its base , the tree is growing and doing everything it should be doing .
The concrete , as far as the tree is concerned , is only a slight annoyance .
I tend to agree with George Carlin ’s philosophy about the state of the planet which is , “ The planet is fine . ”
“ Besides , there is nothing wrong with the planet .
Nothing wrong with the planet .
The planet is fine .
The PEOPLE are fucked .
Difference .
Difference .
The planet is fine .
Compared to the people , the planet is doing great .
Been here four and a half billion years .
Did you ever think about the arithmetic ?
The planet has been here four and a half billion years .
We ’ve been here , what , a hundred thousand ?
Maybe two hundred thousand ?
And we ’ve only been engaged in heavy industry for a little over two hundred years .
Two hundred years versus four and a half billion .
And we have the CONCEIT to think that somehow we ’re a threat ?
That somehow we ’re gonna put in jeopardy this beautiful little blue - green ball that ’s just a - floatin ’ around the sun ? ”
So while we may be doomed , the planet is not .
When we ’ve done ourselves in , the planet will let out a deep sigh , shake its head in disgust , and slowly put itself back together again .
While its nice to have optimism , to recycle , to buy hybrids and to use CFL light bulbs , our existence is a mere blip on the radar that may be discovered by a future species one day when they find a petrified Coke can buried deep in the ground .

Veteran White House reporter Helen Thomas on Monday advised the Obama administration to stand down and avoid fighting with Fox News and its correspondents .
In an interview with MSNBC , the columnist -- who is promoting her new book on presidents and their campaigns -- also stressed the White House ought to " stay out of these fights . "
" They can only take you down .
You can't kill the messenger , " said Thomas , who has covered every president from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama .
Whether the White House takes her advice , however , is another story .
Just this weekend , Senior Adviser David Axelrod charged Fox was " not really a news organization . "
And Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel twice insinuated the channel was a danger to the craft of journalism itself .
“ It ’s not a news organization so much as it has a perspective , and that ’s a different take , " Emanuel told CNN 's " State of the Union , " a line he echoed in principle on CBS later in the day .
" And more importantly , it ’s important not to have the CNN ’s and the others of the world being led and following Fox , as if what they ’re trying to do is a legitimate news organization . "
Most of us need about eight or so hours of sleep a night to perform optimally during the day .
But scientists have found a mother and daughter who naturally snooze just six nightly hours , waking up bright - eyed and bushy tailed .
Sleep logs revealed the 44 - year - old woman and her 69 - year - old mother have been " natural short sleepers " for most of their lives .
They both go to bed at about 10 p.m. and rise at 4 or 4:30 a.m .
While that might sound a lot like your schedule , there 's a catch : Besides catching fewer Z's , the two family members are also very active .
For instance , the mother travels internationally often and dances three or four times a week .
" They really have shorter sleep requirements , " said study researcher Ying - Hui Fu , a professor of neurology at the University of California at San Francisco , Mission Bay .
It turns out , the pair are genetically programmed for such abbreviated sleep .
They both carry a genetic mutation to the gene DEC2 that Fu and her colleagues found is at least partly responsible for the sleep pattern and probably contributes to so - called sleep homeostasis ( how much sleep we need ) .
Scientists think sleep is controlled by at least two processes , one called circadian rhythm that sets the timing of when we go to sleep and when we wake up , turning some into night owls , for instance .
The second is a homeostatic process , which regulates the length of shut - eye .
Though
Fu is n't sure how many people carry such a genetic mutation , she said it 's probably rare as the researchers found no other carriers in a sample of 250 .
To figure out how the genetic mutation impacts sleep , Fu and her colleagues genetically engineered mice to have either two copies of the mutant gene or just one copy .
Compared with the normal mice , those with one mutant gene slept about 1.2 hours less , and mice with two mutant genes slept 2.5 hours less .
The mutant mice also bounced back faster than the normal mice from sleep deprivation .
While the results , which will be detailed in the Aug. 14 issue of the journal Science , may not let the habitually late snoozers catch fewer snores , they could ultimately lead to treatment for individuals with sleep disturbances , the researchers note .
Next ,
Fu and her colleagues hope to find other genes related to sleep homeostasis .
" This is something that gives us a clue that there is a gene that is regulating human sleep homeostasis , " Fu told LiveScience .
" After we find several [ genes ] , we can get a picture of how this sleep homeostasis mechanism works , how our body regulates how much sleep we need . "
LPC : The past , present , and future of Linux audio
Did you know ...?

Please help out by buying a subscription and keeping LWN on the net .
The history , status , and future of audio for Linux systems was the topic of two talks — coming at the theme from two different directions — at the Linux Plumbers Conference ( LPC ) .
Ardour and JACK developer Paul Davis looked at audio from mostly the professional audio perspective , while PulseAudio developer Lennart Poettering , unsurprisingly , discussed desktop audio .
Davis 's talk ranged over the full history of Linux audio and gave a look at where he'd like to see things go , while Poettering focused on the changes since last year 's conference and " action items " for the coming year .
Davis : origins and futures
Davis started using Linux as the second employee at Amazon in 1994 , and started working on audio and MIDI software for Linux in 1998 .
So , he has been working in Linux audio for more than ten years .
His presentation was meant to provide a historical overview on why " audio on linux still sucks , even though I had my fingers in all the pies that make it suck " .
In addition , Davis believes there are lessons to be learned from the other two major desktop operating systems , Windows and Mac OS X , which may help in getting to better Linux audio .
He outlined what kind of audio support is needed for Linux , or , really , any operating system .
Audio data should be able to be brought in or sent out of the system via any available audio interface as well as via the network .
Audio data , as well as audio routing information , should be able to be shared between applications , and that routing should be able to changed on the fly based on user requests or hardware reconfiguration .
There needs to be a " unified approach " to mixer controls , as well .
Most important , perhaps , is that the system needs to be " easy to understand and to reason about " .
Some history
Linux audio support began in the early 1990s with the Creative SoundBlaster driver , which became the foundation for the Open Sound System ( OSS ) .
By 1998 , Davis said , there was growing dissatisfaction with the design of OSS , which led Jaroslav Kysela and others to begin work on the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture ( ALSA ) .
Between 1999 and 2001 , ALSA was redesigned several times , each time requiring audio applications to change because they would no longer compile .
The ALSA sequencer , a kernel - space MIDI router , was also added during this time frame .
By the end of 2001 , ALSA was adopted as the official Linux audio system in favor instead of OSS .
But , OSS did n't disappear and is still developed and used both on Linux and other UNIXes .
In the early parts of this decade , the Linux audio developer community started discussing techniques for connecting audio applications together , something that is not supported directly by ALSA .
At roughly the same time , Davis started working on the Ardour digital audio workstation , which led to JACK .
The audio handling engine from Ardour was turned into JACK , which is an " audio connection kit " that works on most operating systems .
JACK is mostly concerned with the low - latency requirements of professional audio and music creation , rather than the needs of desktop users .
Since that time , the kernel has made strides in supporting realtime scheduling that can be used by JACK and others to provide skip - free audio performance , but much of that work is not available to users .
Access to realtime scheduling is tightly controlled , so there is a significant amount of per-system configuration that must be done to access this functionality .
Most distributions do not provide a means for regular users to enable realtime scheduling for audio applications , so most users are not benefiting from those changes .
In the mid-2000s , Poettering started work on the PulseAudio server , KDE stopped using the aRts sound server , GStreamer emerged as a means for intra-application audio streaming , and so on .
Desktops wanted " simple " audio access APIs and created things like Phonon and libsydney , but meanwhile JACK was the only way to access Firewire audio .
All of that led to great confusion for Linux audio users , Davis said .
Audio application models
At the bottom , audio hardware works in a very simple manner .
For record ( or capture ) , there is a circular buffer in memory to which the hardware writes , and from which the software reads .
Playback is just the reverse .
In both cases , user space can add buffering on top of the circular buffer used by the hardware , which is useful for some purposes , and not for others .
There are two separate models that can be used between the software and the hardware .
In a " push " model , the application decides when to read or write data and how much , while the " pull " model reverses that , requiring the hardware to determine when and how much I /O needs to be done .
Supporting a push model requires buffering in the system to smooth over arbitrary application behavior .
The pull model requires an application that can meet deadlines imposed by the hardware .
Davis maintains that supporting push functionality on top of pull is easy , just by adding buffering and an API .
But supporting pull on top of push is difficult and tends to perform poorly .
So , audio support needs to be based on the pull model at the low levels , with a push - based API added in on top , he said .
Audio and video have much in common
OSS is based around the standard POSIX system calls , such as open ( ) , read ( ) , write ( ) , mmap( ) , etc. , while ALSA ( which supports those same calls ) is generally accessed through libasound , which has a " huge set of functions " .
Those functions provide ways to control hardware and software configuration along with a large number of commands to support various application styles .
In many ways , audio is like video , Davis said .
Both generate a " human sensory experience " by rescanning a data buffer and " rendering " it to the output device .
There are differences as well , mostly in refresh rates and the effect of missing refresh deadlines .
Unlike audio , video data does n't change that frequently when someone is just running a GUI — unless they are playing back a video .
Missed video deadlines are often imperceptible , which is generally not true for audio .
So , Davis asked , does anyone seriously propose that video / graphics applications should talk to the hardware directly via open / read / write / etc . ?
For graphics , that has been mediated by a server or server - like API for many years .
Audio should be the same way , even though some disagree , " but they are wrong " , he said .
The problem with UNIX
The standard UNIX methods of device handling , using open / read / write / etc. , are not necessarily suitable interfaces for interacting with realtime hardware .
Davis noted that he has been using UNIX for 25 years and loves it , but that the driver API lacks some important pieces for handling audio ( and video ) .
Both temporal and data format semantics are not part of that API , but are necessary for handling that audio / video data .
The standard interfaces can be used , but do n't promote a pull - based application design .
What is needed is a " server - esque architecture " and API that can explicitly handle data format , routing , latency inquiries , and synchronization .
That server would mediate all device interaction , and would live in user space .
The API would not require that various services be put into the kernel .
Applications would have to stop believing that they can and should directly control the hardware .
The OSS API must die
The OSS API requires any services ( like data format conversion , routing , etc. ) be implemented in the kernel .
It also encourages applications to do things that do not work well with other applications that are also trying to do some kind of audio task .
OSS applications are written such that they believe they completely control the hardware .
Because of that , Davis was quite clear that the " OSS API must die " .
He noted that Fedora no longer supports OSS and was hopeful that other distributions would follow that lead .
When ALSA was adopted , there might have been an opportunity to get rid of OSS , but , at the time , there were a number of reasons not to do that , Davis said .
Backward compatibility with OSS was felt to be important , and there was concern that doing realtime processing in user space was not going to be possible — which turned out to be wrong .
He noted that even today there is nothing stopping users or distributors from installing OSS , nor anything stopping developers from writing OSS applications .
Looking at OS X and Windows audio
Apple took a completely different approach when they redesigned the audio API for Mac OS X. Mac OS 9 had a " crude audio architecture " that was completely replaced in OS X .
No backward compatibility was supported and developers were just told to rewrite their applications .
So , the CoreAudio component provides a single API that can support users on the desktop as well as professional audio applications .
On the other side of the coin , Windows has had three separate audio interfaces along the way .
Each maintained backward compatibility at the API level , so that application developers did not need to change their code , though driver writers were required to .
Windows has taken much longer to get low latency audio than either Linux or Mac OS X .
The clear implication is that backward compatibility tends to slow things down , which may not be a big surprise .
JACK and PulseAudio : are both needed ?
JACK and PulseAudio currently serve different needs , but , according to Davis , there is hope that there could be convergence between them down the road .
JACK is primarily concerned with low latency , while PulseAudio is targeted at the desktop , where application compatibility and power consumption are two of the highest priorities .
Both are certainly needed right now , as JACK conflicts with the application design of many desktop applications , while PulseAudio is not able to support professional audio applications .
Even if an interface were designed to handle all of the requirements that are currently filled by JACK and PulseAudio , Davis wondered if there were a way to force the adoption of a new API .
Distributions dropping support for OSS may provide the " stick " to move application developers away from that interface , but could something similar be done for a new API in the future ?
If not , there are some real questions about how to improve the Linux audio infrastructure , Davis said .
The continued existence of both JACK and PulseAudio , along with supporting older APIs , just leads to " continued confusion " about what the right way to do audio on Linux really is .
He believes a unified API is possible from a technical perspective — Apple 's CoreAudio is a good example — but it can only happen with " political and social manipulation " .
Poettering :
The state of Linux audio
The focus of Poettering 's talk was desktop audio , rather than embedded or professional audio applications .
He started by looking at what had changed since last year 's LPC , noting that EsounD and OSS were officially gone ( " RIP " ) , at least in Fedora .
OSS can still be enabled in Fedora , but it was a " great achievement " to have it removed , he said .
There were only bugs reported against three applications because of the OSS removal , VMware and quake2 amongst them .
He said that there " were n't many complaints " , but an audience member noted the " 12,000 screaming users " of VMware as a significant problem .
Poettering shrugged that off , saying that he encouraged other distributions to follow suit .
Confusion at last year 's LPC led him to create the " Linux Audio API Guide " , which has helped clarify the situation , though there were complaints about what he said about KDE and OSS .
Coming in Fedora 12 , and in other distributions at " roughly the same time " , is using realtime scheduling by default on the desktop for audio applications .
There is a new mechanism to hand out realtime priority ( RealtimeKit ) that will prevent buggy or malicious applications from monopolizing the CPU — essentially causing a denial of service .
The desktop now makes use of the high - resolution timers , because they " really needed to get better than 1 / HZ resolution " for audio applications .
Support for buffers of up to 2 seconds has been added .
ALSA used to restrict the buffer size to 64 K , which equates to 70 ms 370 ms of CD quality audio .
Allowing bigger buffers is " the best thing you can do for power consumption " as well as dropouts , he said .
Several things were moved into the audio server , including timer - based audio scheduling which allows the server to " make decisions with respect to latency and interrupt rates " .
A new mixer abstraction was added , even though there are four existing already in ALSA .
Those were very hardware specific , Poettering said , while the new one is a very basic abstraction .
Audio hardware has acquired udev integration over the last year , and there is now " Bluetooth audio that actually works " .
Poettering also noted that audio often did n't work " out of the box " because there was no mixer information available for the hardware .
Since last year , an ALSA mixer initialization database has been created and populated : " It 's pretty complete " , he said .
Challenges for the next year
There were a number of issues with the current sound drivers that Poettering listed as needing attention in the coming year .
Currently , for power saving purposes , PulseAudio shuts down devices two seconds after they become idle .
That can lead to problems with drivers that make noise when they are opened or closed .
In addition , there are areas where the drivers do not report correct information to the system .
Decibel range of the device is one of those , along with the device strings that are either broken or missing in many drivers , which makes it difficult to automatically discover the hardware .
The various mixer element names are often wrong as well ; in the past it " usually did n't matter much " , but it is becoming increasingly important for those elements to be consistently named by drivers .
Some drivers are missing from the mixer initialization database , which should be fixed as well .
The negotiation logic for sample rates , data formats , and so on are not standardized .
The order in which those parameters are changed can be interpreted differently by each driver which leads to problems at the higher levels , he said .
There are also problems with timing for synchronization between audio and video that need to be addressed at the driver level .
Poettering also had a whole slew of changes that need to be made to the ALSA API so that PulseAudio ( and others ) can get more information about the hardware .
Things like the routing and mixer element mappings as well as jack status ( and any re-routing that is done on jack insertion ) and data transfer parameters such as the timing and the granularity of transfers .
Many of the current assumptions are based on consumer - grade hardware which does n't work for professional or embedded hardware , he said .
It would be " great if ALSA could give us a hint how stuff is connected " .
There is also a need to synchronize multiple PCM clocks within a device , along with adding atomic mixer updates that sync to the PCM clock .
Latency control , better channel mapping , atomic status updates , and HDMI negotiation are all on his list as well .
Further out , there are a number of additional problems to be solved .
Codec pass - through — sending unaltered codec data , such as SPDIF , HDMI , or A2 DP , to the device — is " very messy " and no one has figured out how to handle synchronization issues with that .
There is a need for a simpler , higher - level PCM API , Poettering said , so that applications can use the pull model , rather than being forced into the push model .
Another area that needs work is handling 20 second buffering .
There are a whole new set of problems that come with that change .
As an example , Poettering pointed out the problems that can occur if the user changes some setting after that much audio data has been buffered .
There need to be ways to revoke the data that has been buffered or there will be up to 20 second lags between user action and changes to the audio .
Conclusion
Both presentations gave a clear sense that things are getting better in the Linux audio space , though perhaps not with the speed that users would like to see .
Progress has clearly been made and there is a roadmap for the near future .
Whether Davis 's vision of a unified API for Linux audio can be realized remains to be seen , but there are lots of smart hackers working on Linux audio .
Sooner or later , the " one true Linux audio API " may come to pass .

Jarno Trulli and Adrian Sutil continued with their heated debate over their accident at the Brazilian Grand Prix , with another fallout during Thursday 's press conference in Abu Dhabi .
Trulli , showing photographs of the accident to prove his point , was still angry at his Force India rival , who was baffled to understand why the Italian was " freaking out " .
" I think we 're going to discuss it probably tomorrow in the drivers ' briefing and in the GPDA briefing , " Trulli said .
" Obviously it was very disappointing to end the race like that , especially on the first lap .
" Obviously I think I had every reason to be extremely furious .
I 've got all the evidence to show that I was there , I was next to him , so I think tomorrow we are going to discuss it . "
Sutil said he saw no reason to continue the debate .
" I think there 's nothing to discuss .
It was a quite obvious incident , " he said .
" In the end it was a very disappointing for myself , even more , I think , because I was the one who was just driving and he lost control of his car and crashed in my back so it was not my problem , it was his problem .
" I do n't know why he 's freaking out like that , to be honest . "
Trulli continued : " If you want , I can show you some pictures .
I do n't know if you 're blind but they clearly show you that my front wing is next to your front wing so .. "
Sutil again insisted he saw no problem with the incident .
" You 're trying to overtake me on the outside on the kerbing .
There was not a problem , " the German said .
" You were just not going off the power .
The same happened in Barcelona where you lost control again and crashed again into a Force India car . "
Trulli , who was fined for confronting Sutil after the Interlagos crash , refuted the suggestions .
" In Barcelona I spun and he hit me because he tapped the kerb , he completely cut the circuit and he did n't slow down . "
Sutil responded : " No , no .
Watch the race in Barcelona .
I did n't hit you , you hit me .
I do n't know what 's the problem , but maybe your eyes are a problem . "

Former coal industry executive Ian Dunlop says the government 's CPRS is a dud : it wo n't reduce emissions , it will slow innovation , and destroy investment confidence .
This week in New York , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is honoured with co-chairmanship of a global leaders round table , seeking to revitalise negotiations on a climate change agreement to be finalised at Copenhagen in December .
But if he brings to this task the government ’s prevailing climate policy mindset , it will further diminish the already shaky prospects for any realistic agreement at Copenhagen .
The weak , inconsistent compromises represented by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme ( CPRS ) and the Renewable Energy Targets , built around out - dated science , are wholly inadequate responses to escalating climate risk and certainly not exemplar policies for the world community .
Ironically , a dysfunctional Opposition allows the government to claim the high ground as a “ climate saviour ” when nothing could be further from the truth .
The hypocrisy of government and Opposition policy is laid bare in the light of the scientific warnings , which are now coming in thick and fast .
Here are such a selection of reports on the increasing risk :
The International Panel on Climate Change flagged in 2007 that global warming was unequivocal , with more than 90 % certainty that it was due to human greenhouse gas emissions .
The Copenhagen Climate Science Congress in March 2009 stated that we now face an increasing risk of abrupt or irreversible climatic shifts .
Chief scientist Penny Sackett , addressing parliamentarians in March , warned that if we do not act quickly and decisively the effect will be devastating .
Professor Will Steffen ’s report , released by Penny Wong in July 2009 , states that the majority of indicators point toward more rapid and severe climate change and more costly and dangerous impacts .
The Global Health Commission view climate change as the biggest global health threat of the 21st Century .
Recent US research indicates faster warming ahead than previously predicted , with ocean temperatures at record high levels and unprecedented melting of Arctic sea ice .
Evidence of CO2 and methane emissions from the Arctic permafrost and seabed continues to unfold , along with evidence that human emissions have reversed a long - term Arctic cooling trend .
Recent warnings from Victorian and NSW fire authorities indicate a severe bushfire season ahead after record winter warmth .
The Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report 2009 states that the overall outlook for the Reef is poor and that catastrophic damage may not be averted .
The World Bank urges rapid action .
How many reports are needed before our leaders wake up ?
Big changes are happening even at the 0.8 oC warming we have already experienced relative to pre-industrial levels , let alone the further 0.6 oC or more to which we are committed as a result of historic emissions .
While there remains much uncertainty over climate science , there is a high degree of certainty on key issues , strongly indicating that human emissions are a major factor creating current warming .
Other explanations advanced by sceptics are , on the balance of probabilities , highly unlikely and none explain the evidence around us .
Government and Opposition , along with major corporations , are well aware , from their scientific advisers , of this rapidly deteriorating picture and the need for far more aggressive policy and action .

Why then are these warnings ignored ?
First , established vested interests are intent on maintaining the status quo .
The economic system developed over decades , based conventional growth and incremental change .
Power and influence evolved accordingly .
The changes now required are transformative , not incremental , in which established players will lose and new players gain .
Inevitably there is reluctance to break with the past , as the old players continue to exercise power and adopt defensive rather than leadership roles .
Second , political and corporate mindsets today are overwhelmingly short - term , driven by all - pervasive short - term incentives , to the exclusion of long - term considerations such as climate change .
Third , free market ideology still dominates .
Markets are important , but to be effective they must operate within realistic rules ; those rules have been progressively dismantled over the past decade .
Despite vehement protestations by corporate leaders that markets are the preferred solution , there is great reluctance to include the true costs of externalities , such as carbon pollution .
Fourth , corporate and political culture , while lauding leadership , rapidly retreats into managerialism — the incremental improvement of the status quo , oblivious to the fact that the status quo is unsustainable .
Fifth , the assumption that technology will save the day .
Technology is essential , but not sufficient .
It must be accompanied by different values , moving away from growth and consumption to an emphasis on long - term sustainability .
So it ’s not surprising than any sceptical view of the mainstream science is seized upon with alacrity to justify further procrastination .
Despite 20 years of global negotiations , virtually nothing has been done so far to address climate change .
Having weighed the latest evidence of the risks we run , scepticism now has to give way to decision and real action .
The continuing reluctance of our leaders to honestly acknowledge these realities raises fundamental concerns over national and corporate governance .
The first priority of responsible government is to address major threats to national security .
Climate change and the related issues of peak oil and energy security are arguably the greatest threats Australia will face in the next decade , with potentially catastrophic implications .
The legitimacy of any government now depends on its preparedness to acknowledge these threats and take appropriate action .
That is not happening .
To implement policy in the full knowledge that it is inadequate , as proposed with the CPRS , is a serious breach of fiduciary responsibility to the electorate .
We need effective emissions trading .
Overseas experience demonstrates that the concept only works if emission reduction targets are aggressive , with minimal escape clauses and compensation .
The CPRS fails on all counts ; implementation in its current form will do little to reduce emissions , it will slow innovation , in the process undermining the credibility of emissions trading and destroying investment confidence .
Corporately , directors have a fiduciary duty to act honestly , in good faith and to the best of their ability in the interests of the company in perpetuity — the last two words have been conveniently forgotten in recent years .
Climate change is likely to be the most material issue affecting companies in the coming decade .
Yet there is little acknowledgment of this by corporate Australia ; quite the reverse .
The image projected is one of delay , denial and special pleading for unwarranted compensation .
Any sense of urgency to alert shareholders to the real climate risk is absent .
Again , a serious breach of fiduciary responsibility .
Climate risk cannot be managed by incrementalism and the “ art - of - the - politically - possible ” : it is not just another item on the political and corporate agendas .
It is bigger than any political party , corporation or ideology .
It has the potential to destroy companies and countries unless we act quickly .
We need transformative , bipartisan leadership and co-operation — honestly acknowledging the challenge , setting out the solutions , however unpalatable , building support for and implementing rapid change .
Above all , climate policy must be re-structured , built upon the latest science .
As Winston Churchill put it : “ It is no use saying ‘ we are doing our best ’ .
You have got to succeed in doing what is necessary ” .

The BBC has defended allowing Nick Griffin to appear on Question Time A decision by the BBC to allow the leader of the anti-immigrant British National Party to take part in a TV debate has triggered protest and controversy in the UK .
Here , BBC correspondents from across Europe reveal how media coverage of far - right parties is handled in different parts of the continent .
EMMA JANE KIRBY - PARIS
A couple of weeks ago , the French National Front ( FN ) politician Marine Le Pen appeared on a national TV debate Mots Croises ( Crosswords ) and caused a public outcry .
Not because she was an extreme right politician being given air time on a mainstream political show , but because she read extracts from culture minister Frederic Mitterrand 's pseudo - autobiography in which he made allusions to a former involvement in the Thai sex trade .
Jean - Marie Le Pen 's performance on French TV boosted his popularity
She demanded the resignation of the minister - and was taken so seriously that Mr Mitterrand was forced to appear on the eight o'clock news to defend his position .
Politicians from all sides joined the debate , which was entirely prompted by the FN , as to whether he was fit to be in office .
People here are used to turning on their TVs and radios and seeing and hearing the views of the FN .
Part of the role of the CSA ( the authority which guarantees the liberty of audiovisual communication ) is to " guarantee the pluralism of expression of opinion and thought " so even outside election periods , the FN is assured air time .
And television has served the party well .
In 1984 , the leader of the National Front Jean - Marie Le Pen ( father of Marine ) saw support for his party double overnight after being questioned on the leading political programme L'Heure de Verite ( the Hour of Truth ) - not dissimilar to the BBC's Question Time .
Experts say his credible performance helped to legitimise his views and Mr Le Pen himself credited the programme with boosting his popularity , calling it " the hour that changed everything " .
In the election of that year , the French National Front went on to score 2.2 million votes and Mr Le Pen was invited to participate in more and more broadcasts .
Although the extreme left group Action Directe set off bombs across Paris in protest at the publicity being given to the far right , Mr Le Pen continued to rise in the opinion polls .
In the 2002 elections , he knocked out Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin in a shock result in the first round , scoring 16.8 % of the votes - just 3 % below the then President , Jacques Chirac .
ADAM EASTON - WARSAW
The nearest equivalent to the BNP in Poland is probably the League of Polish Families - a nationalist , anti-EU and anti-gay rights party based on traditional Roman Catholic values .
The party gets much less media coverage these days because it failed to win enough votes to be represented in the Polish parliament at the last general elections in 2007 .
But it was a junior member of the coalition government from 2005 up to that point .
Its then leader , Roman Giertych , was the country 's education minister and both his appointment and the party 's presence in the government were controversial here and sparked street demonstrations .
Some critics here say the League of Polish Families has ties to far - right movements with anti-Semitic views .
Mr Giertych or any of the party 's leaders have never publicly expressed such views to my knowledge .
Newspapers here have , however , printed photographs of members of the party 's former youth movement , All Polish Youth , giving Heil Hitler - type salutes .
When they do it is usually front - page news .
Far - right parties existed in Poland before World War Two .
Given this history and the fact that Hitler made Poles unwilling witnesses to the Holocaust by building many of the death camps on Polish soil , the far right remains controversial , but also a phenomenally well discussed topic here .
TRISTANA MOORE - BERLIN
The far - right NPD is a legal political party , but given Germany 's Nazi past and the fact that the party has no seats in the federal parliament , ( or Bundestag ) , the NPD has rarely been given much airtime on the main public TV channels .
German journalists would shy away from giving any publicity to far - right parties , and it would be virtually unheard - of for a far - right leader to appear on a public TV talk show .
The media coverage of the NPD tends to be negative .
So a funding scandal for the NPD was widely reported and stories are often published about NPD demonstrations which end in violence , or far - right attacks on immigrants .
A legal attempt to ban Germany 's NPD failed For example in August , the NPD in the eastern state of Thuringia threatened Zeca Schall , an Angolan - born member of Chancellor Merkel 's CDU party who has German citizenship .
He was abusively " told to go back home " .
Mr Schall ended up under police protection and there was a public outcry .
The story was reported by many German papers and TV channels , but while there were interviews with Mr Schall , the main media outlets avoided any interviews with the NPD .
The far - right NPD party is represented in regional parliaments , like in the eastern state of Saxony , and some television channels have broadcast interviews with regional NPD leader Holger Apfel .
But these interviews are usually brief and they are part of a short news item .
Germany has tough anti-Nazi laws and the country 's far - right political parties remain highly controversial .
The Zeca Schall case provoked another heated debate over whether the NPD should be banned .
The federal government tried to ban the NPD in 2003 , but the attempt failed when judges at Germany 's highest court threw out the case .
Recently , the Interior Minister of Bavaria Joachim Herrmann announced he would launch a bid to ban the NPD next year , arguing that the Schall case exposed the racist nature of the party .
DUNCAN KENNEDY - ROME
In Italy , the term " extreme right " has often been a difficult concept to pin down .
In its purest form , the country gave the world Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party , a text - book definition of fervent right - wing nationalism .
But even Mussolini started his political life as a Marxist Socialist and maintained elements of social progression in his policies .
Then in the 1940s rose the Italian Social Movement ( MSI ) , which became the nostalgic keeper of the fascist torch .
The MSI , in turn , morphed into the National Alliance , which this year voted itself out of existence in order to join the newly formed centre - right grouping of the PDL , or People of Freedom Party , headed by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
Opponents accuse the Lega Nord of being a xenophobic , regionalist and populist group , coalescing around anti-immigration policies
It all means that , currently , the most extreme expression of right - wing opinion in Italy is centred on the Lega Nord , or Northern League .
But the league does n't sit on the margins of political life in the same way that the British National Party does .
It gained more than 8 % of the vote in last year 's general election , earning it 60 deputies in Italy 's lower house of parliament and 26 senators in the upper house .
The league is now a key coalition partner in Mr Berlusconi 's government and has four ministers , whose portfolios include the interior ministry and agriculture .
The matter of whether the league has a right to appear on TV is simply not an issue .
The heads of the various RAI state TV networks do not appear before cameras having to justify their decision to put the league 's politicians , or supporters , on news bulletins or discussion programmes .
The league earned its democratic stripes many years ago and so is an integral part of public life , openly accepted on all media platforms .
Its firebrand leader , Umberto Bossi , is head of the government 's reforms and federalism department .
Opponents accuse the league of being a xenophobic , regionalist and populist group , coalescing around anti-immigration policies .
But it would be wrong to depict the league as a single - issue party .
It embraces a range of right / left views on other policies , from its deeply conservative stance on immigration , to its more liberal approach to wages and pensions .
The league also has non-white members and holds political sway in many immigrant communities .
But although it is Italy 's third largest party , it remains small , unable to spread its appeal widely beyond its northern base .
And despite its best efforts , in the public 's mind it is mostly associated with matters of immigration , which open it up to equal measures of scorn and admiration .
NICK THORPE - BUDAPEST
The far - right Jobbik Party in Hungary won 14.8 % in the June elections to the European Parliament .
That was the breakthrough the party was looking for , and its members are trying to build on their support ahead of next year 's parliamentary elections .
Most opinion polls suggest they have 10 - 12 % support , and analysts predict they will become the third force in parliament after Fidesz ( centre right ) and the Socialists ( centre left ) .
The mainstream media were already dealing with them long before the June 2009 result .
The Jobbik leader Gabor Vona regularly appeared on the flagship Napkelte ( Sunrise ) programme of MTV ( Hungarian public service television ) , and the programme 's producer was criticised for giving him the " oxygen of publicity " .
In his most celebrated appearance on the programme , on 10 August , reporter Janos Bethlen repeatedly asked Vona whether or not he would advise his supporters to take part in a commemoration of Rudolf Hess ( Hitler 's deputy ) , organised by another far - right group .
Much of the media coverage of Jobbik so far is less about the party itself and its policies , more about who is to blame for its rise .
Vona refused to answer , and suggested that Bethlen go to Israel if he wanted to talk about the Holocaust .
Janos Bethlen almost lost his cool and pointed angrily at Vona , saying : " I found that remark insulting . "
Jobbik leaders are often interviewed by other media as well , especially since their result in June .
Events surrounding the banning of the Hungarian Guard , a paramilitary formation set up by Jobbik two years ago , are also covered in detail .
By openly speaking about what they call " gypsy crime " many commentators fear that Jobbik is stirring up ethnic conflict .
Much of the media coverage of Jobbik so far is less about the party itself and its policies , more about who is to blame for its rise .
The Socialists blame the main conservative opposition party , Fidesz .
Fidesz say the Socialists are responsible .

Errors to Avoid in a Personal Injury Case
Do Not Wait to Seek Medical Treatment
When someone is injured in an incident , the at - fault party ’s insurance company is generally responsible for paying for the victim ’s medical bills , lost wages , and other expenses .
However , the insurance company ’s goal is to save money .
If an injured person fails to seek medical treatment in a timely manner , the insurance company may argue that the injured person did not try to mitigate his or her damages , which may result in a lower damages award .
Similarly , accident victims must make sure that they follow their doctors ’ orders .
Accident victims should show up to all scheduled appointments and follow up as requested .
Be Honest About Past Illnesses or Injuries
Many people injured due to the negligence of another worry that their past illnesses or injuries will hurt their chances of prevailing in their claims .
However , this is not the case .
If all injuries are disclosed to a healthcare provider , that healthcare provider is able to determine which injuries were caused by the accident and which prior injuries , if any , were aggravated by it .
It is important not to be dishonest when pursuing a legal claim — therefore , injured parties should always disclose their full health histories after an incident .
Do Not Try to Handle the Case on Your Own
Accident claims have numerous requirements that must be met , such as filing deadlines .
Rather than try to navigate the complex legal system while recovering from an accident , it is best to let an experienced Colorado personal injury attorney handle the case .
Seek Legal Advice as Soon as Possible
The amount of time you may have to file a legal claim depends on a variety of factors , including the type of incident and whether it happened on governmental property .
Seek the advice of an experienced attorney sooner rather than later so you are not barred from making your claim .
An attorney can also advise on best practices early in the case .
Wait to Settle the Claim
Once the ink has dried on a settlement agreement , there is no going back .
If an injured person settles before all of the relevant evidence — such as medical records and bills — have been produced and examined , the settlement may not adequately compensate the victim for the losses he or she has sustained .
It is important to achieve maximum medical improvement before considering any settlement offers .
Keep the Details to Yourself
Although it may be tempting to discuss the case with friends and family or on social media , it is best to refrain from doing so .
Discussing the case with anyone other than the victim ’s attorney could violate the attorney - client privilege , which would mean that conversations between the attorney and client are no longer confidential .
Further , if an injured person discusses the case with others , the details of the conversation could make their way to the opposing party .
Social media posts may be saved or printed out and used against you in court .
Do Not Start a GoFundMe
Statements made online , even those made on fundraising sites , may be used against victims in their cases .
What may seem like a good source of funds for pending medical bills and other expenses may actually cost victims more in the end .
It is best to discuss such plans with your attorney before you start a fundraising account .

BAGHDAD 
As Iraqi officials work to assign blame for the deadly attacks on the heart of the government on Sunday , concern is rising that a greater security threat may come from within the system in the form of corruption , from the top leadership of ministries down to soldiers who man checkpoints .
A recent internal report on corruption by the inspector general of the Interior Ministry specifically mentions the bribery of checkpoint guards :
The blast on Sunday at the Justice Ministry , surrounded by checkpoints , killed nearly 160 people , while a similar attack in August on the Foreign and Finance Ministries killed at least 122 .
“ These car bombs did n’t come from the sky ! ” said Judge Abdul Sattar al - Beiriqdar , spokesman for the Higher Judicial Council .
“ They must have been driven in streets until they reached their target .
If there were no corruption , the attackers would n’t risk passing through these checkpoints . ”
But the corruption runs much deeper , endangering the fragile sense of security in Iraq as America draws down its forces , with security services that seem aimed as much at enriching themselves as protecting average Iraqis , according to dozens of interviews with police officers and officials as well as the report by the Interior Ministry .

Majority Leader Steny Hoyer whispers to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi during a health care news conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday , Oct. 29 , 2009 . | John Shinkle / POLITICO
'I 'm not big on showing weakness '
Even before her bill reaches the House floor , health care reform has been a lesson in the limits of power for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — and in the immense challenge of managing disappointment on the left .
The bill rolled out Thursday is weaker than many progressives — including Pelosi — had once hoped for , but her advice is to “ declare victory ” and recognize that this is not the last word .

“ On any given day , success that upsets business as usual in Washington can be perishable .
I do n’t want to get too bogged down , ” Pelosi told POLITICO in an interview Thursday afternoon .
“ We are not passing a bill , shutting the door , turning out the lights and walking away .
We will have other legislation . ”
Nor is she much open to prolonging the public option insurance debate by allowing a floor debate on an amendment to insist on a more robust version than the one now in the House bill .
“ I ’m not big on showing weakness .
It ’s not my thing , ” she said in the interview .
“ I do n’t like to have predictable losses . ”
At a recent caucus , she quoted her old Shakespeare favorite : “ We happy few ; we band of brothers . ”
But with a 256 - vote majority and liberals leaking whip counts , she laughed and did n’t argue with the notion that it ’s time to go back to her Appropriations Committee days and the Rolling Stones : “ You ca n’t always get what you want , ... but if you try some time , you just might find , you get what you need . ”
Energy independence and climate change are singularly Pelosi passions .
“ I ’m trying to save the planet , ” she once famously said .
But health care is rooted deeper in the Democratic Party , and the undertaking now — all compressed into one massive bill — is genuinely enormous .
“ This is a remarkable change , ” said Rep. George Miller , a close Pelosi ally and chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee .
“ At the end of the day , ... you ’ve said to Americans , ‘ Never again will you be without insurance . ’
Kind of stunning .
Incrementalism will never get you there . ”
For Pelosi , Thursday ’s announcement rollout followed months of face - to - to face meetings with members — a process that forever redefined the role of the modern speaker for Democrats .
“ I have never seen a speaker so involved in the details of legislation , ” said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) .
“ She has the ability like the local priest to listen , ” said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel ( D - N.Y . ) .
“ So much of it is endurance ; the other is an ability to be persuasive .
But whatever combination it is , they do n’t teach that in school . ”
Her style can be smothering .
She is a legendary keeper of lists .
And as much as she is devoted to building consensus within her party , this can crush the chances for more open debate on the House floor .
“ I consider the 78 caucus meetings we had our amendment process , ” she told POLITICO .
“ That ’s when people brought forward their ideas before and after August , and we ’ve tested them . ”
Senate Democrats , stung by Pelosi ’s imperiousness , can speak of her as “ she who would be queen . ”
“ House mother , ” “ madam , ” “ mother superior ” and a “ mother bear with her cubs ” are all expressions that come up in interviews .
Even White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel calls her “ Mother . ”
“ Well it ’s probably not spelled the same way , ” said Pelosi ’s friend Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D - Calif . ) .
But if the speaker is tough , it is also a tough world — especially for a woman .
Baltimore - bred , she has an ear for racing metaphors , and there are days when she might be Winning Colors or Genuine Risk , two famous fillies who won the Derby only to be bumped badly or forced outside in the stretch by the boys in the Preakness .
Her poll numbers among men are devastating .
Women tip slightly against her , 36 percent to 31 percent , in a recent Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll .
Among men , the ratio is far worse : 2 to 1 against Pelosi .
Among older men , it ’s 56 percent to 22 percent .
And the big men in her own life have n’t always made this easier .
She is deeply wary of the expanded military commitment in Afghanistan now being considered by President Barack Obama .
Her old ally Emanuel cut a series of deals with the Senate — often at her expense in the House .
And in the midst of the whole health care debate , she has had to fend off attacks on Rangel for alleged financial abuses now being investigated by the House ethics committee .
The relationship with Obama and Emanuel is most complicated .
The president spoke warmly of the speaker at an event in San Francisco earlier this month .
And the two had a one - on - one luncheon meeting last week .
The same night — after a meeting with party progressives — Pelosi saw Emanuel at a dinner hosted by Rep. Mike Thompson ( D - Calif . ) .
But the next morning , many House leadership staffers were quick to blame the White House for allegedly leaking the news that Pelosi lacked the votes for the more robust public option favored by liberals .
And it was considered a welcome victory that the White House spoke of the public option in its statement Thursday on the House bill .
On Afghanistan , she is not ready to commit flatly to whatever Obama should decide about increased troop levels .
“ Let ’s see what he decides , ” she said in the interview .
“ I have confidence in him .
I salute him for his deliberative process . ”
But it ’s a challenge she does n’t relish — given the unhappiness already on the left .
“ You thought energy was a heavy lift , health care , the budget , the recovery package .
Nothing was as hard as funding the war in Afghanistan , ” she said , recalling the battle earlier this year over war funding .
“ The supplemental was very hard . ”
“ With this , ” she said in reference to health care , “ you ’re talking about what works in your region .
You go back and forth .
That was ‘ I ’m not voting for it . ’
And no , I did n’t have my heart in it at all .
I had told my members last year , this was our last war supplemental . ”
“ I ’m a consensus builder ...
My members are satisfied when they ask me a question that I am conversant , ” she said , but that also required her to immerse herself in the policy details .
“ We have a big tent and huge challenge .
It does n’t affect every district the same way , and we have to listen . ”
At times , she could grow impatient :
In a show of unity , she and Rep. Earl Pomeroy ( D - N.D. ) each apologized for rudeness in the Thursday caucus .
And as a relative newcomer to the complex debate over insurance coverage , Pelosi tended to show her appropriations background as well as her Bay Area love of science and the next big thing .
“ We knew there was no way that we were going to get a robust public option in the final bill , ” she said , looking ahead to the Senate .
But the potential savings made it attractive as she struggled to deal with the fallout after the president surprised her by setting a $ 900 billion target for the bill .
Emanuel recently dismissed that White House decision as having a minimal impact , but Pelosi said it meant having to make close to $ 100 billion in adjustments .
“ I think $ 100 billion is not trivial , ” she said , but then laughed at finding $ 14 billion at the expense of the drug companies — protected in the Senate by their deal with the White House .
“ We did ‘ a little cookie ’ for the pharmaceutical industry , ” she said .
“ A cookie out of their lunch . ”
To build support , she also had to resolve regional concerns about disparities today in Medicare reimbursements , and as part of this bargain , she signed onto both studies and an enforcement mechanism to force potential changes .
Section 1160 of the bill lays out an elaborate implementation scheme that empowers the Obama administration to make major changes — which Congress will have limited power to block — that could lead to a new system of reimbursements more indexed to the value of the care provided , not the traditional fee - for - service measures .
“ That ’s very important , ” Pelosi said , and it won her support from lawmakers like Rep. Ron Kind ( D - Wis. ) in pushing larger structural reforms .
In the farm bill two years ago , the two found themselves at opposite ends , but here Pelosi lent her support over the discomfort of some like Waxman .
“ The speaker is a person who is about change and reform , ” Kind told POLITICO .
“ She does appreciate people who are thinking out of the box . ”
Asked why he gave in , Waxman said he wanted to help Pelosi meet what he saw was a commitment she had already made .
“ She ’d given her word , and I wanted to help , ” he said .
“ She knows that words matter , ” says Eshoo .
“ Once you put feet on them , these words walk into people ’s lives .
There ’s a reality to it ; she can more than hold her own — she ’s a master of detail . ”
“ Think of how many speakers in the past have tried to get to this point , ” said Rules Committee Chairwoman Rep. Louise Slaughter ( D - N.Y . )
“ She got here . ”
So , in a nut shell , here ’s the scoop .
The Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione is one of the most exquisite autos to emerge in recent years .
But with such amazing gusto comes a steep price tag .
Amazingly , Alfa managed to condense the lineage of this supercar into the diminutive MiTo , retaining much of the same charm but at an attainable cost .
And to celebrate this feat of automotive styling , Alfa Romeo challenged two up and coming designers to create women ’s jeans as cool as MiTo ’s genes .
Or so the story goes …
Conceived to celebrate the unique genealogy passed from the breathtaking Alfa 8C Competizione supercar to the head - turning Alfa MiTo , the Italian sporting car manufacturer , Alfa Romeo , paired up with TV ’s fashion expert , Louise Roe , to challenge two up - and - coming fashion designers to create a line of women ’s jeans that would be as cool and desirable as the Alfa MiTo and , and at the same time , raise money for charity .
The result is a one - off series of limited edition skinny fit jeans – available via www.mitojeans.co.uk – that echo the genealogy concept by deconstructing first generation jeans to create new , high fashion jeans complete with a high quality leather waistband and Alfa Romeo red stitching .
London - based fashion designers Bjork and McElligott , who have already created outfits for a number of celebrities , also introduced other distinct and attractive styling touches including embroidered rear pockets – one featuring the serpent from Alfa Romeo ’s iconic badge on the right plus their own logo on the left pocket – to create recognisable and distinct jeans .
Significantly most Alfa MiTos feature a DNA button that alters the responsiveness of the accelerator , brakes and traction to suit different driving conditions – Dynamic , Normal and All Weather .
Sophie McElligott said : “ The DNA button gave us an extra framework to operate within .
The Alfa MiTo ’s parentage from the Alfa 8C and the concept that DNA is in your genes made the project ’s beneficiary an easy choice . ”
The designers chose the charity Jeans for Genes to profit from the sale of the high class jeans and found two boutique retail outlets in London through the charity ’s patron , Donna Ida .
Priced at £ 75 a pair , the designer jeans are expected to raise vital funds for Jeans for Genes .

In general case append will add one item to the list , while += will copy all elements of right - hand - side list into the left - hand - side list .
Update : perf analysis
Comparing bytecodes we can assume that append version wastes cycles in LOAD_ATTR + CALL_FUNCTION , and += version -- in BUILD_LIST .
Apparently BUILD_LIST outweighs LOAD_ATTR + CALL_FUNCTION .

We can improve performance even more by removing LOAD_ATTR overhead :

Moscow : Russia is set to develop a
nuclear - propelled spaceship for the future lunar and
inter - planetary missions , a top Russian space official said on Wednesday .
" We have developed a design for a manned spacecraft
powered by a nuclear engine , " Chief of Russian Federal Space
Agency Roskosmos Anatoly Perminov said .
Speaking at a meeting of the presidential commission
on the modernisation of the Russian economy , Perminov said the
design of the spacecraft would be finalised by 2012 and would
require further financing of USD 580 million over next nine
years .
He said the development of Megawatt - class nuclear
space propulsion systems ( MCNSPS ) for manned spacecraft was
crucial for Russia if the country wanted to maintain a
competitive edge in the space race , including the exploration
of the Moon and Mars .
Quoting President of Russian Academy of Cosmonautics
Anatoly Koroteyev , government - run new agency RIA Novosti said
the key scientific and technical problem in sending manned
missions to the Moon and Mars was behind the development of
new propulsion systems and energy supplies with a high ratio
of energy - mass efficiency .
" The current capabilities of the Russian space
industry are clearly insufficient either to set up a permanent
base on the Moon or accomplish an independent manned mission
to Mars , " Koroteyev said .
Bureau Report
We call them school librarians , but in these contentious times , I 'm inclined to call them heroes .
Take Karin Perry , for example .
That 's " Mrs. Perry " to you middle - schoolers .
She cast the winning bid in an auction to bring best - selling author Ellen Hopkins to speak to her students at Whittier Middle School in Norman , Okla .
This was a big " whoo - hoo ! " for Mrs. Perry 's students .
Hopkins writes fiction for adolescents , including " Crank , " a heartbreaking tale of a bright 15 - year - old girl whose life is derailed by her addiction to methamphetamine .
Hopkins wrote the book after her own gifted daughter went to prison for the same drug addiction .
Hopkins often talks to students about the dangers of drugs , but Mrs. Perry asked her to talk last week about writing .
Students were bubbling with questions , but they were never allowed to ask Hopkins any of them on school grounds .
One parent did n't like the content of Hopkins ' book .
That 's all it took for Superintendent Joe Siano to order a committee review of the book and to disinvite the celebrated author .
Now is as good a time as any to mention that this is Banned Books Week , which is sponsored annually by the American Library Association to celebrate the freedom to read .
The library group says there were at least 513 challenges to books last year , but that nearly 80 percent of such challenges are never reported .
It takes only one -- one parent , one family , one community member -- to jump - start a crusade to deprive everyone else 's children of the right to read .
Here are some of the authors whose books have been challenged across the country in the last two years : Mark Twain , Toni Morrison , John Steinbeck , F. Scott Fitzgerald , Julia Alvarez , Ernest Gaines , Kurt Vonnegut , Khaled Hosseini , Bobbie Ann Mason and J.D. Salinger .
Hacks , every last one of them .
The call to ban Hopkins ' book was heartily endorsed by local newscaster Kelly Ogle , who had n't read the whole thing but had counted the f-bombs .
In a segment aptly titled , " My 2 Cents , " Ogle also accused Hopkins of painting " an ugly and graphic picture " of meth addiction .
Not sure what Ogle was going for there .
Perhaps he thinks fiction means you make up everything , including the real consequences of ravaging one 's body with crank .
Hopkins told me she has received thousands of letters from teenagers who say her books helped them turn their lives around .
She also said she is seeing an uptick in attempts by individual parents to ban books by her and other authors , and she thinks she knows why .
" They 're definitely emboldened by what happened with [ Barack ] Obama 's speech , " she said , referring to the president 's televised address to students earlier this month .
His speech was banned in many classrooms across the country after school districts buckled like brittle knees to conservatives who objected even before knowing its content .
Obama 's speech was later widely praised as positive and inspiring , even by many conservative leaders .
But the damage was done , Hopkins said .
" These are scary times for librarians and teachers .
All it takes now is for one parent to object .
If we let them win , they 're just going to keep doing it . "
Not in Karin Perry 's patch of America , they are n't .
Mrs. Perry could n't speak to me without permission from her superintendent , who never returned my call .
Not to worry .
Sometimes it 's true that actions speak louder than words .
Let me tell you what she did .
Mrs. Perry asked Hopkins if she would still come .
The answer was yes .
Then she asked Hillsdale Free Will Baptist College -- love the name -- if she could move Hopkins ' talk to their campus .
The college said yes .
About 150 students , parents , teachers and librarians attended last week 's speech .
So far , there are no reports of fainting or even frantic fanning of faces .
But as we all know , it only takes one person to declare otherwise before you 're smack dab in the middle of a dust storm over the First Amendment .
If that wind kicks up dirt on your corner , may there be a Karin Perry at a library near you .

This data sheet also in French , Spanish , and Arabic .
( Aug. 12 , 2009 ) Global population numbers are on track to reach 7 billion in 2011 , just 12 years after reaching 6 billion in 1999 .
Virtually all of the growth is in developing countries .
And the growth of the world ’s youth population ( ages 15 to 24 ) is shifting into the poorest of those countries .
The Population Reference Bureau ’s 2009 World Population Data Sheet and its summary report , to be released on Aug. 12 , offer detailed information about country , regional , and global population patterns .
“ Even with declining fertility rates in many countries , world population is still growing at a rapid rate , ” said Bill Butz , PRB ’s president .
“ The increase from 6 billion to 7 billion is likely to take 12 years , as did the increase from 5 billion to 6 billion .
Both events are unprecedented in world history . ”
The projection for population growth in developing countries assumes that fertility in those countries will fall to the same low levels as in today ’s developed countries , around two children per woman .
That is quite an assumption .
Currently , the highest fertility rate is in Niger , 7.4 children per woman .
The lowest rate is in Taiwan , 1.0 children per woman .
“ The great bulk of today ’s 1.2 billion youth — nearly 90 percent — are in developing countries , ” said Carl Haub , PRB senior demographer and co-author of the data sheet .
Eight in 10 of those youth live in Africa and Asia .
“ During the next few decades , these young people will most likely continue the current trend of moving from rural areas to cities in search of education and training opportunities , gainful employment , and adequate health care . ”
One of the major social questions of the next few decades is whether their expectations will be met .
The 2009 World Population Data
Sheet provides up - to - date demographic , health , and environment data for all the countries and major regions of the world .
It shows just how stark the contrasts are between rich and poor countries , as illustrated by the table with data from the United States , Canada , and Uganda .
Even though Canada and Uganda have close to the same population today , Uganda is projected to have more than double Canada ’s population by 2050 .
The cause of these enormous differences is the difference in lifetime births per woman .
Ugandan women have 6.7 children on average , five more than the average for Canadian women .

Hundreds of millions of people live barely above that level .
HIV prevalence now appears to be on the decline in Africa , but rates are still far higher than in other world regions .
Swaziland has the world ’s highest rate of HIV : 26 percent of its population ages 15 to 49 is HIV positive .
The birth rate among U.S. teenagers is twice as high as the average for all developed countries .
The U.S. rate is 42 births per 1,000 teenage girls ( ages 15 - 19 ) ; the rate for all developed countries is 21 per 1,000 .
The Juan T. Trippe Jumbo
Jet was once the crown jewel of the Pan Am fleet , built in 1970 as the world ’s first commercial jumbo jet .
Now it ’s the shabby ruin of a high - concept restaurant in Seoul , South Korea .
I visited in the summer of 2009 , with SY .
This is the story of our explore , and the story of how such a historic plane ended up in such bizarre circumstances .
Nose cone of the Juan T. Trippe
I was in Korea to visit SY ’s family and get to know something about her country .
On our trip we visited all the major tourist highlights - the War Museum , the Seoul Tower , various ancient palaces .
and of course , this plane .
The Juan T. Trippe is hardly on the Korean tourist trail , nor does it feature in any guidebooks or promotional brochures , but it ’s after glimpsing it on the internet I knew I just had to visit this amazing sight for myself .
It did not disappoint .
To say the vision of a jumbo jet parked beside a city is incongruous is an understatement .
It ’s downright bizarre , and intriguing .
That ’s clearly what the owners hoped for when they bought it in California , had it chopped into 62 pieces and shipped in giant containers across the Pacific .
What owners ?
Time for a little history .
Easy to spot .
This jet was built in 1969 , and named after Juan T. Trippe , one of the leading aeronautical pioneers of his time .
He was a Howard Hughes figure who invented the very idea of the Jumbo Jet .
He also and founded the company Pan American Airlines , which in the 1930 ’s and 40’s was the biggest airline company in the world .
However modern times were not kind to Pan Am , and after Trippe ’s death in 1975 it began to ail .
In 1991 the company filed for bankruptcy and was not bailed out by the US government .
As a result it was broken up and all its planes sold .
The Juan T. Trippe flew a few more routes between Nigeria , California , and Somalia for various owners , before being put out to pasture in 1999 .
However in 2001 a South Korean couple bought it as their dream - retirement package , shipped it to Seoul , and converted into a high - concept restaurant .
On dry land again they rebuilt it , fashioning new stubby wings for it to keep the image complete , gutting it to add in Asian - style floor - dining at the level of the windows , a kitchen , and an executive suite up where the pilots once steered the giant craft .
The restaurant did n’t last long though , failing in the mid-2000 ’s , leaving the couple living in a hut beneath the hull to serve as security guards to keep out vandals .
We met them , when they popped out from their shack under the plane to chase us away .
More on that now .
Bold against the city .
Giant nose .
SY figured all the logistics for this trip , not surprisingly since she ’s Korean .
It meant taking a combination of several trains and buses out of central Seoul 40 km or so .
“ We ’re nearly at the end of the line , ” she said , as the bus pulled round another twisting turn amongst Korea ’s tall green mountains .
“ I see it ! ” I cried , as for a moment the nose of a bright blue jumbo jet poked its head out at me , before another green mountain blocked it from view .
We got off the bus and hurried to see it , and there it was .
The Juan T. Trippe in all its jumbo glory , clearly abandoned , gorgeous against a gorgeous blue sky .
Ready to take - off , again .
Here the stair - case and hut under the belly are clear .
After arriving and wandering around a bit in awe , we approached .
There was a shabby looking hut beneath the jet ’s belly , and an access stair going up the side .
We climbed up it , only to be halted at the top by locked glass doors .
Down the stairs , seemingly roused by our footsteps , an angry old man appeared out of nowhere and spat some aggressive Korean at us .
SY told me he was basically telling us to get lost , get off his property , which I suppose was fair enough .
A noodle shop under its wing .
Fair enough , but we ’d not come all that distance to give up so easily .
SY took point and I stood in back smiling and flashing my camera as we went down to the shack the old man lived in , squatted underneath the hull .
He called out into the house and an old woman emerged , presumably his wife , who seemed pretty unimpressed with us , though perhaps amenable to suggestion .
SY flashed her press credentials and pushed through the woman ’s negativity with some semi-true exaggerations ( this is a photographer from England , I ’m from a magazine in Tokyo , we ’ve come only to see your plane , we really had hoped to see inside , please do n’t say we ’ve come all this way for nothing ) , not really false but neither totally true .
The woman persisted , but SY just started walking forwards and saying ‘ thank you thank you ’ and before I knew it the woman had relented and we were in the fuselage ( where it was baking hot ) and taking shots .
At the entrance , looking in .
Dining zones .
Tables , windows .
It was obvious the woman was only just tolerating us , so SY kept her busy with a barrage of questions ( taking notes all the while ) , while I took photos as fast I could .
I hurried towards the cock - pit but the woman signaled for me to stop .
SY said ‘ thank you thank you ’ a few more times and we both made a dash onwards , unobstructed .
The cockpit was set up like an office , with a few chairs looking out of the glass over the city blocks , an old PC in back .
Down the spiral staircase beneath it was a conference room kind of space , a nice long table and chairs fitting perfectly in the narrowing fuselage .
Conference zone .
Conference zone windows .
Refurbishing .
Cockpit .
Suite area .
Looking down on clouds .
Low tables and seating cushions .
We dashed around a bit more , took a few more photos , then that was it , and we were out in the cool fresh air again .
SY was able to fill me in on all that she ’d learned : the two old folks were the owners , they ’d bought it with their own cash as their dream - retirement package , the first commercial Jumbo Jet ever in their possession as a restaurant .
It was a big dream , and one can only respect their ambition .
For the few years it managed to survive , I can imagine all the locals coming to check it out at least once , just to say they had eaten there , but after you ’ve used up that pool , and the middle - era Jumbo Jet fan pool , what do you have left ?
A rather expensive , sad folly in the middle of nowhere .
Down the side .
Out the back .
The wife also told SY that numerous film and TV crews had come by asking for permission to come aboard and do interviews , but she ’d always refused , including refusing a crew from NHK ( the Japanese BBC ) who had come especially to shoot it .
Why she let us in is a mystery , but probably has to do with SY ’s determination .
Kudos to her for that !
She further told us the plane would be shipped off elsewhere , and would become a museum , which seems a fitting third life for such a storied plane .
( note - it has since been demolished , though I ca n’t say whether it ended up as a museum or simply scrap metal ) .

One of the sections preparing for transit , back in 2001 after the couple bought it .
Here ’s a video of some highlights .
Its quite basic , as once inside it was pell - mell to get what photos I could .
There were much longer sections with SY talking to the lady beneath the plane , I just left a few seconds in so you get the impression .

Audio : Basically to FOF , a Christian can never be rightfully terminated
by Jeremy Hooper
After Hewlett - Packard put up posters meant to encourage acceptance of gay people , Richard Peterson , a worker in the company 's Boise , ID , office , decided to " retaliate " by posting scriptures that he considers to be gay condemnatory , on his work cubicle , in plain view of everyone .
After some employees complained , Peterson admitted to his managers that the passages were " intended to be hurtful .
And the reason [ they were ] intended to be hurtful is you cannot have correction unless people are faced with truth . "
He went on to flat - out admit that he hoped LGBT employees " would read the passages , repent , and be saved . "
Despite this obviously out - of - line behavior , Richard 's managers did n't even fire him .
Instead , they gave him some paid time off to think about his options .
But what did Peterson do upon his return ?
Well , he went right back and re-posted the anti-gay passages , indicating that he would only remove them if H - P removed the pro-acceptance poster .
So at this point H - P , completely out of all other reasonable options , had no choice but to fire Mr. Peterson for insubordination .
Peterson tried to make legal hay out of the matter .
However , he of course lost in court .
That 's because the court , like any reasonable person , saw the clear difference between a poster about accepting your co-workers and passages that are intended to hurt the same .
Call them anal if you must , but most CEOs prefer a workforce that is able to complete their 9 to 5 days without being told they are spending 10 to eternity in fiery damnation !
And in this case , the courts fully saw that H - P higher ups fired Peterson not because of his religious beliefs , but rather because he violated the company 's non-harassment policy .
You can read every detailed step right here .
Yet this reality does n't stop Focus on the Family from using this very case as their first example of why employment nondiscrimination for LGBT people is supposedly bad .
It 's just the latest in their string of overlooking what is inconvenient in order to make life more inconvenient for LGBT people :
Focus on the Family is Signing a Letter to Congress Regarding ENDA [ FNIF ]
And even the AT&T example , while slightly more truthful on its face , is itself flawed reasoning .
Because in that instance , the courts did determine that AT&T was wrong to fire Albert A. Buonanno , with the difference being that Mr. Buonanno did n't harass anyone in his decision to not sign the company pledge .
The judge ruled that his was a personal decision , and that the company could have engaged in better communication with Mr. Buonanno in order to come to some sort of agreement .
In this instance , Focus on the Family should be happy that their side pushed back and gained a " win . "
Instead they are working overtime to clumsily parlay this company matter into political opportunism .
And it 's crucial to note that this AT&T matter ( like the Hewlett - Packard one ) happened without ENDA -- and situations like this could and will continue to happen whether or not ENDA is on the books !
Because ENDA deals with the hiring and firing of LGBT employees .
It deals with the right to work .
Ancillary matters like this ( which has more to do with company procedure than sexual orientation or " religious discrimination " ) could always potentially arise , simply because LGBT people exist ( no matter how much some wish to deny that ) .
And these and similar workday situations can also arise even though religious employment discrimination currently is protected ( something FOF conveniently overlooks ) , because no one group is above the law .
In a perfect world , none of us would be seeking the right to be !
Your thoughts
I do n't understand .... freedom of religion does n't justify or allow discrimination ... would these people fel the same way if I put up passages about being pro-slavery from the Bible around my office space ?
If the African Americans in my office were pissed off about it , would I have the right to sue ?
Like , come on .
STUPIDITY .
Utter , STUPIDITY .

He hoped LGBT employees would " read the passages , repent and be saved " .
Yeah , right .
What a load of crap .
Like there are LGBT adults living in the U.S. who are unfamiliar with conservative Christian attitudes towards homosexuality .
Like all it would take to change their minds was some asshole repeating , " You 're going to hell if you do n't do what I - oops , I mean GOD wants you to do . "
I find it hard to believe that people who pull this stuff truly believe they can win instant conversions .
Outside of a Jack Chick tract , when does this actually happen ?
No , the real goal is to make a show of " righteousness " .
If anyone reacts negatively to their obnoxious behavior , it 's because THEY'RE not righteous themselves .
It 's self - aggrandizement disguised as an attempt to " help " others .
They just do n't like it when somebody calls them on it .
Posted by : Bill S | Sep 3 , 2009 9:58:51 AM
Typical bigot bullshit .
Anyone wanna bet on the amount of money Focus on the Family would spend defending a muslim putting up anti-christian quaran quotes all over his office ?
Yeah , I think its 0 to .
Posted by : penguinsaur | Sep 3 , 2009 10:47:57 AM
So , they cite a case where a religiot abused his ENDA rights ( unsuccessfully ) against HP , as a reason not to extend ENDA rights to LGBTs .. because WE might abuse the law in the same way ..
Do they not see how circuitous and nonsensical that line of reasoning is ??
Or , they do , but it 's such a clever twisting of the facts , that the synaptically challenged ( warped ) zombie - automatons would never be able to make the connection .
Posted by : Dick Mills | Sep 3 , 2009 11:23:47 AM
Maybe it would help if we adopted a more pc title like " the genderly challenged " .
It could confuse the " un " holy opposition for years .
Posted by : ednigma459 | Sep 3 , 2009 1:35:09 PM
Er , I think you made a mistake .
" Despite this obviously out - of - line behavior , Stephen 's managers did n't even fire him .
Instead , they gave him some paid time off to think about his options . "
Who 's Stephen ?
You said the man 's name was Richard Peterson .
Posted by : Yuki | Sep 3 , 2009 3:55:12 PM
Oh yea .
Good catch , Yuki .
I 'll fix .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Sep 3 , 2009 3:58:43 PM
Wait , so they 're using antidiscrimination laws to protect discrimination ?
Posted by : Brian | Sep 3 , 2009 5:55:53 PM
What the FOF ad / interview did not say ... is that being fired because of religious beliefs is also going to get protected too .
And that it requires proof that that is the reason of the firing , be it a firing because of religious beliefs or sexual orientation .
And for example , in my great state of Oklahoma , we have a law that specifically says that you can fire someone if they are gay , tell them that is the reason you are firing them .
The middle ground is one of equal respect within the work place , we do n't have that at this time .
All my love , hugs and kisses , Ryan

“ They ’re making a search engine . ”
A bunch of my friends think that .
It happens every week or so that I ’ll get introduced as “ a search engine guy ” .
And maybe there could exist a definition of “ search engine ” which included recommendations .
But there is something at the core of recommendations that ’s different from search .
Search is about finding .
You start with a topic you know exists and you want to find information about it .
Recommendations are about discovering things you did n’t know about .
“ They ’re making a search engine . ”
A bunch of my friends think that .
It happens every week or so that I ’ll get introduced as “ a search engine guy ” .
And maybe there exists a definition of “ search engine ” which includes recommendations .
But when people think about Google Search vs. Amazon ’s recommendations , the difference is between finding and discovering .
Search is about finding .
You start with a topic you know exists and you want to find information about it .
Recommendations are about discovering things you did n’t know about .
See , there we ’ve got a bunch of info about Miles Davis .
But that ’s the thing — it ’s all about Miles Davis .
If you already know Miles Davis exists , search is a great way to find out more about him and his music , but it ’s awkward for discovering things you do n’t know about .
For comparison :
When looking things related to Miles Davis we get a list of the giants of jazz — most of whom played with Miles Davis at some point in their career .
No prior knowledge of Charlie Parker is required in this context .
If you know about Miles Davis and want to discover things which are like Miles Davis you need a recommendations engine .
The genesis of graph - based web search was in Jon Kleinberg ’s seminal paper Authoritative Sources in a Hyperlinked Environment .
Kleinberg ’s paper predated Brin and Page ’s by a few months and was cited in the original PageRank paper .
From Kleinberg ’s abstract :
The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics , through the discovery of “ authoritative ” information sources on such topics .
We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority , based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of “ hub pages ” that join them together in the link structure .
Note the recurring keyword : authoritative .
It turns out that the difference between search and discovery is not just the presentational difference between them — it is also algorithmic .
When finding related rather than authoritative source in a graph we massage the data in fairly different ways .
In fact , it turns out that authoritative sources are often simply noise in a search for related items .
Let ’s examine this visually again .
Here we have a mocked up subgraph of Twitter — a few people that are following Barack Obama .
When you start a search with Kleinberg ’s algorithm ( HITS ) , it begins by extracting a starting set of nodes based on a text search .
Let ’s imagine here that we ’d searched for people mentioning Barack Obama and this was the set of nodes that were returned .
Kleinberg ’s algorithm attempts to determine the authoritative source in the set , and it ’s pretty clear on visual inspection from this set that it ’s the node called “ Barack Obama ” .
The algorithm in the paper is naturally a bit more involved — it also incorporates the notion of “ hubs ” , but we ’ll ignore those for now for simplicity .
( Incidentally , Kleinberg ’s paper is a rare combination of disruptive and accessible and well worth the time to read . )
Now if we were looking through that same subgraph and trying to find related users we ’d need to use different logic .
That someone is following Barack Obama says very little about them ; certainly it does n’t go far in determining what they ’re likely to be interested in .
If we were recommending a friend for Matt to follow , visually it ’s clear that Jim would be a better recommendation than Bob .
As it turns out , Barack Obama , the “ authoritative ” node in this graph is in fact just noise when trying to deliver a set of recommendations and it ’s best if we ignore it altogether .
Again , as visually confirmed , removing the “ authoritative source ” from the subgraph makes finding related users for e.g.
Matt or Dave much easier .
This problem surfaces all of the time in recommender systems .
If we were applying it to finding related artists to Miles Davis , it would be that the terms “ jazz ” or “ music ” are far too often linked to Miles Davis and his ilk .
On Twitter ’s graph it ’s people with so many followers that following them says little about a person .
In a book store it ’s that having bought Harry Potter says little about one ’s more specific tastes .
In the early days of Directed Edge , we called this the “ tell me something I do n’t know ” problem .
That is , after all , what recommender systems are for .
If you recognize all of the results in a set of personalized recommendations , they ’re not doing their job of helping you discover things .
If something in a set of search results seems unrecognizable , it ’s probably just a bad result .
A bizarre , deep sea fish without a face has been re-discovered after going missing for nearly 150 years .
Researchers from Museums Victoria and the Australian government ’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) reeled in the creature during a recent voyage off Australia , 4 kilometers below the surface , reports the Guardian .
Truth be told , the fish is n't exactly faceless .
It does have a mouth and two beady - red nostrils , but its otherwise featureless head makes it difficult to determine the front end of the animal from the back end .
“ This little fish looks amazing because the mouth is actually situated at the bottom of the animal so , when you look side - on , you ca n’t see any eyes , you ca n’t see any nose or gills or mouth , ” explained Tim O’Hara , the chief scientist and expedition leader .
“ It looks like two rear - ends on a fish , really . ”
The creature was caught as part of an unprecedented survey of commonwealth marine reserves along the Australian eastern coastline .
As many as one - third of all the species being recorded by the expedition are new to science .
While this is n't the first time one of these faceless fish have been seen , it 's the first documented account of the species since 1873 .
200 years of rubbish
Aside from discovering strange and wondrous organisms , the expedition has also uncovered a monstrous reality happening at the bottom of our oceans : the amount of trash sometimes seems to outnumber the fish .
“ There ’s a lot of debris , even from the old steam ship days when coal was tossed overboard , ” said O'Hara .
“ We ’ve seen PVC pipes and we ’ve trawled up cans of paints .
It ’s quite amazing .
We ’re in the middle of nowhere and still the sea floor has 200 years of rubbish on it . ”
The ocean 's abyssal plains are becoming our planet 's waste baskets , as toxins and dreck pile up in trenches and other low places of the sea floor .
In fact , earlier this year scientists detected " extraordinary " levels of toxic pollution in the Mariana Trench , the deepest part of the world 's oceans .
It 's therefore increasingly important that researchers document the unique biodiversity of these little - studied parts of our planet to establish a baseline , so that future studies can more accurately calculate the impacts of pollution in these remote habitats .
The Swiss are looking at two draft proposals on assisted suicide The Swiss government has laid out the details of proposals to ban or severely restrict assisted suicide as part of plans to tackle " suicide tourism " .
More than 100 Britons with terminal or incurable illnesses have used the Swiss centre Dignitas to kill themselves .
Justice Minister Eveline Widmer - Schlumpf has called for organisations like it to face stricter controls .
The proposals will now be subject to consultation , with a draft law due to be sent to parliament in March .
Ms Widmer - Schlumpf said groups like Dignitas would face prosecution if the proposals are passed into law and they do not comply .
' Profit - driven '
As part of the proposals , patients would have to provide two separate medical opinions proving that they have a terminal illness and are expected only to have months to live .
Those who are chronically or mentally ill would find it more difficult to get help in ending their lives .
Ms Widmer - Schlumpf said : " We have no interest , as a country , in being attractive for suicide tourism . "
She said organisations involved in assisted suicide were " testing the boundaries of the law " and that deaths by this method should not become a " profit - driven business " .
In a statement , the justice ministry said that " suicide must only be a last resort " and that it was committed to protecting human life .
It made it clear that the preference was for restrictions rather than an outright ban , saying " essentially , the Federal Council does not wish to take anything away from the current , liberal legislation " .
The proposals are open for public comment until 1 March , after which the government will send a draft law to parliament .
Although there is nothing concrete in the current Swiss penal code which says that assisted suicide is legal , the practice of helping a terminally - ill patient to end his or her life is widely considered as a " humane act " .
Unless the person helping is proven to be acting out of self interest , prosecution is extremely unlikely .

You know things are going well for the economy when Bernard Madoff is fighting in prison over the stock market .
Maybe the argument revolved around dollar cost averaging into this easy money rally .
Here in California , specifically in Southern California there seems to be a lot of energy getting behind the housing bottom parade .
Prices have stabilized to a certain degree .
Yet is this really a bottom ?
It think it is important to frame the argument in relation to employment , incomes , and demographic trends .
Simply saying we are at a bottom is like saying home prices will always go up just because .
Hopefully people will learn from this bubble that housing prices can be inflated with interesting loans like Alt - A and option ARMs .
Speaking of option ARMs :
“ ( Housing Wire ) Several of our investors have questioned the current loss severity in light of negative amortization and home price decline , ” researchers wrote in the report .
“ Our analysis suggests that option ARM loss severity will likely range between 60 % and 70 % provided home prices have stabilized . ”
As we have highlighted before most Alt - A and option ARM products sit in California .
Los Angeles County has the largest number of Alt - A loans of any county in the United States .
Wells Fargo has a large option ARM portfolio brought on board through their acquisition of Wachovia but many of these are of the Pay Option ARM variety that have 10 year life spans .
Even with that , many of these loans are imploding already :
Source : Housing Wire
On a positive note , the Governator signed new mortgage legislation that includes , the destruction of option ARMs :
“ ( LA Times ) Late Sunday night , the governor signed AB 260 by Assemblyman Ted Lieu ( D - Torrance ) .
The measure , which takes effect Jan. 1 , tightens restrictions on mortgage brokers so they cannot steer borrowers to riskier , higher - interest loans when they qualify for less - expensive ones .
The new law also bans so - called negative - amortization loans , which offer the option of monthly payments so low that the loan amounts can actually grow over time .
The law also limits prepayment penalties to no more than 2 % of the loan balance and allows state regulators to enforce federal lending laws . ”
Option ARMs never had any business of existing so this is positive news .
Yet the option ARMs that will cause problems are already out there recasting from 2010 to 2012 and no one is originating option ARMs anymore since the government is the lender of first and only resort .
When we talk about a housing bottom we really need to look at history to gain some perspective .
It was n’t always the case that California had a higher median home price than that of the nation .
Yet slowly over time California started disconnecting from the nationwide median price .
I thought the best way to highlight this divergence is to plot data from 1968 comparing nationwide and California median home prices :
Now this is a fascinating comparison .
Nationally , prices moved up steadily until the late 1990s when they seemed to disconnect from the trend .
California however had a few surges .
We see one occurring in the mid-1970s when prices started diverging from nationwide prices .
Then , we see another surge in the 1980s when we had another real estate bubble .
Finally , we hit a trough around 1995 and take off like a lunar expedition and the bubble of the century is born .
Prices have crashed as they do when bubbles burst .
But are prices at a bottom ?
In the last peak in the 1980s California home prices cost about twice that of the nationwide median price .
At the height of the current bubble , it almost reached 3 times the nationwide median price .
Take for example the trough in 1996 :
1996
California Median Price : $ 177,270
Nationwide Median Price : $ 122,600
At this juncture , a California home cost roughly 44 percent more than a median price home throughout the country .
Let us run the numbers as they stand today :
2009
California Median Price : $ 285,480
Nationwide Median Price : $ 174,000
A California home will cost you 64 percent more than the nationwide median price home .
Keep in mind that this bubble of course is unprecedented in nature but the argument that somehow prices are historically cheap does n’t even line up with the 1980s bubble trough .
Clearly this bubble that has wiped out over $ 12 trillion in household wealth is much larger .
Plus , we have yet to see the Alt - A and option ARMs hit the market and this will bring prices lower in mid to upper tier markets – in fact , this is where the action is going to take place in the next few years .
Even if we go back to the trough ratios of 1996 , we still need a 10 percent drop in prices .
How significant is that ?
Well if you are using a FHA backed loan that will easily wipe out your saved down payment and some .
It is also important to understand that we are entering the slow selling season for real estate .
Let us examine Southern California data :
Now this chart is worth exploring .
Fall and winter are historically slow selling months .
Spring and summer without fail bring out the buyers .
Boom or bust these are typically good times for home sellers .
As you can see from the above chart , without exception since 2000 the low season selling point is reached in January or February .
Keep in mind the recent boom in Southern California was largely due to investors , first time home buyers lured by the $ 8,000 tax credit , low interest rates , and people looking at the first chart where prices have crashed and assuming it is now a good time to buy .
But what if the tax credit is removed as it should be ?
What will happen ?
You can rest assured that this coupled with the seasonal trends will only push sales lower and most likely prices .
What you need to factor in as well is that foreclosures do n’t care about seasons .
They are going to happen no matter what because they are dependent on the real economy .
We can run extend and pretend loan modifications but without employment growth , it is merely a paper façade .
So for those just rushing to buy right now they are entering a market with so much artificial stimulus right before the following :
( a) Tax credit removal ( it will happen at some point )
( b) Slower selling season
( c) Alt - A and option ARMs coming online in full force 2010 to 2012
(d) Banks holding off inventory and moving like snails with foreclosures
These are a few items that artificially boost the market and it has only stabilized prices , it has not created a boom .
The reason prices will continue to have pressure on the downside is California employment is weak .
12.2 percent official unemployment with a under utilization rate of 23 percent :
Without job creation housing prices will continue to face pressure to the downside .
If you want to see some added job pressure just look at this data :
Source : OC Register
So prices are still too high reflecting the actual economy .
You need to remember that California wages boomed in the 1990s because of the technology bubble and unemployment was relatively low and heading lower so home price increases made sense .
Incomes went up , unemployment went down , and housing prices went up .
Yet now we are to believe that incomes going down , unemployment going up , is somehow the reason for prices to move up ?
I do n’t buy it .
I think most of us would agree that housing at the very minimum has to reflect the incomes of households in their community or potential buyers .
Otherwise , your home will sit on the market .
As a property owner I know this well .
I can “ want ” $ 2,000 a month in rent but if the market is only paying $ 1,500 then guess what ?
I can sit back and have the place sit vacant for months losing monthly cash flow or I can work with the market rate .
The difference with the current housing market is the government is trying to inject artificial stimulus by giving tax credits , artificially lowering rates , and trying to back stop the entire banking industry just so people can go and buy homes .
But until the job situation recovers , there wo n’t be any sustained recovery .
That is why this belief that a jobless recovery is no problem misses the entire point that people purchase homes when they feel secure in their jobs and have wages that will allow them to buy a home within their price range .
Let us look at the actual MLS data :
It is interesting since the peak in fall of 2007 , the inventory number has steadily decreased .
But this brings into question the big X - factor of the shadow inventory .
Keep in mind this is MLS public data .
The real factor is how many homes are in the shadows for Southern California .
Here ’s some interesting data from the Amherst Mortgage Insight study :
Source : Amherst Mortgage Insight
Now this is fascinating data .
We need to also include the Inland Empire above and you have some of the top 5 areas with shadow inventory .
In fact , that MLS number trend heading lower is dwarfed by the growth in shadow inventory .
Factor in the shadow inventory for L.A. and San Diego and the shadow inventory is nearly twice as big as the actual MLS listed properties .
We ’ve never been in a spot like this so to assume things will play out nicely is ignoring the facts .
There is a false sense of security in the current market .
If you are looking to buy , be cautious .
The market is really artificially stimulated and the only outcome so far is stabilization ( or at least on the surface ) .
Remove this , and you can guess what will happen next year .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Toward the end of her marriage , Rabia Iqbal said she feared for her life .
Robina Niaz said the Quran " condemns " abuse of women .
" If we witness injustice , we 're required to speak up . "
Iqbal was born in New York to parents who had immigrated to the United States from the tribal areas of Pakistan .
She had a strict Muslim upbringing and when she was 16 , her parents arranged her marriage to a 38 - year - old man .
She claims her husband turned violent during their 10 years of marriage .
When she finally left him , she did not know where to turn .
Going home was n't an option , she said .
" My parents ... made clear that they would disown me , " Iqbal said .
" My father even said ... ' You 're lucky you live in America because if you lived back home , you would have been dead by now . ' "
She was hiding out in her office at work when a friend put her in touch with Robina Niaz , whose organization , Turning Point for Women and Families , helps female Muslim abuse victims .
" It was such a relief ... to speak about things that ... I thought no one would understand , " said Iqbal , who has received counseling from Niaz for more than two years and calls Niaz her " savior . "
" Robina understood the cultural nuances ... the religious issues , " Iqbal said .
Watch Iqbal tell her story »
A devout Muslim , Niaz stresses that there is no evidence that domestic violence is more common among Muslim families .
" Abuse happens everywhere , " said Niaz .
" It cuts across barriers of race , religion , culture . "
But , she said , Muslims are often reluctant to confront the issue .
" There 's a lot of denial , " she said .
" It makes it much harder for the victims of abuse to speak out . "
When Niaz launched her organization in 2004 , it was the first resource of its kind in New York City .
Today , her one - woman campaign has expanded into a multifaceted endeavor that is raising awareness about family violence and providing direct services to women in need .
Niaz said she firmly believes that domestic violence goes against Islamic teachings , and considers it her religious duty to try to stop abuse from happening .
" Quran condemns abusive behavior of women , " she said , noting that the prophet Mohammed was never known to have abused women .
" Allah says , ' Stand up against injustice and bear witness , even if it 's against your own kin .
So if I see injustice being done to women and children , I have to speak up .
It 's my duty . "
Niaz 's mission began after a difficult period in her own life .
Born and raised in Pakistan , she had earned a master 's degree in psychology and had a successful career in international affairs and marketing when she moved to the United States to marry in 1990 .
" It was a disastrous marriage , " she said .
As Niaz struggled to navigate the American legal system during her divorce , she said she appreciated how lucky she was to speak English and have an education .
She realized that many immigrant women without those advantages might be more likely to stay in marriages because they did n't know how to make the system work for them .
" If this is how difficult it is for me , then what must other immigrant women go through ? " she remembered thinking .
After volunteering with South Asian victims of domestic violence , Niaz , who speaks five languages , got a job using those skills to advocate for immigrant women affected by family violence .
But Niaz 's focus changed on September 11 , 2001 .
" I was no longer a Pakistani - American ... I looked at myself as a Muslim . "
Niaz said the backlash many Muslims experienced after the terror attacks made abuse victims more afraid to seek help ; they feared being shunned for bringing negative attention to their community .
Watch Niaz explain the effects of 9/11 on abused Muslim women »
" Women who were caught in abusive marriages were trapped even more , " recalled Niaz .
In 2004 , Niaz used her savings to start Turning Point for Women and Families .
Today , her work focuses on three main areas : providing direct services to abused women , raising awareness through outreach , and educating young women -- an effort she hopes will empower future generations to speak out against abuse .
Crisis intervention services are a critical element of Niaz 's efforts .
Through weekly counseling sessions , she and her team provide emotional support to the women while helping them with practical issues , such as finding homeless shelters , matrimonial lawyers , filing police reports or assisting with immigration issues .
Niaz has helped more than 200 Muslim women .
While most of Turning Point 's clients are immigrants , the group helps women from every background .
While Niaz has support from many people in New York 's Muslim community , she acknowledges that not everyone appreciates her efforts .
She keeps her office address confidential and takes precautions to ensure her safety .
" There have been threats ... but that comes with this work , " she said .
" I know that God is protecting me because I 'm doing the right thing . "

Sun Microsystems took data centers mobile when it embraced shipping containers , but Dell 's gone further - and smaller - with a data center in a briefcase .
Self - outed Dell geek Jimmy Pike has built a data - center in a briefcase , hacking together a dual - socket server cluster featuring a pair of 2.5GHz Intel processors and a combined 32 Gb memory and 4Tb storage on two machines running Windows Server 2003 and Red hat Enterprise Linux .
Pike happens to be the director of systems architecture for Dell 's data center solutions group , and he likes to take his work - meaning servers - home .
Dell 's director , a veteran of NCR and Intel , said he just started hacking things together in his garage one Saturday afternoon .
" I decided it could be a cool thing to build a couple of servers in a brief case .
That way , when I bring things back and forth from home to work , it would n't be so much trouble , " he told Dell cloud computing evangelist Barton George during a video posted here and below .
" I wondered if I could cram everything I wanted into this briefcase . "
Turns out he could .
" I call it a portable for the architect on the go , " Pike said .
What exactly is in Pike 's portable ?
Two 16 Gb servers running a pair of L5420 Xeon 2.5 processors - previously known as Harpertown - and sporting a pair of one - terabyte , 3.5 SATA devices .
There 's a five - port Ethernet switch and everything 's running off one of Dell 's single , central power supply units .
Pike 's also thrown in two 500 Gb scratch discs for testing and a pair of Solid - State Drives because he 's " constantly running into questions about SSDs and how they behave . "
And yes , there 's cooling with six fans .
The only thing not included is virtualization , so the two machines are running their copies of Windows 2003 and RHEL separately . ®
Report : Five Children Die Each Day From Abuse or Neglect Study shows 10,000 children in the U.S. died of abuse between 2001 and 2007 .
Oct. 21 , 2009  --
A new report out today found that on average , five children died from abuse or neglect every day in the United States between 2001 and 2007 .
The report by the advocacy group Every Child Matters , estimated that more than 10,000 children died over the same time frame .
In 2007 alone 1,760 children died , a 35 percent increase over the death rate in 2001 .
And , due to poor reporting and record - keeping in many states , the actual number is estimated to be as much as 50 percent higher .
Texas was found to have the highest number of deaths , 228 , attributable to child abuse in 2007 , but Kentucky had the highest per-capita rate at 4.09 deaths per 100,000 children .
In the wake of these findings , lawmakers and celebrities joined forces on Capitol Hill today to urge Congress to increase funding to fight child abuse .
" It 's a failure of the United States of America but we have the opportunity and the resources , and I believe the will and the commitment to correct this , " said Sen .
Bob Casey , D - Pa .
With negotiations over health care reform ongoing , Casey and Rep. Patrick Kennedy , D - R.I. , both urged lawmakers to include provisions to fight child abuse in any health care reform .
" Within the Finance Committee health care proposal is Senate Bill 1267 … the Evidence Based Home Visitation Act of 2009 .
The data shows that among other things , the risk of child abuse and neglect dropped significantly for mothers and children involved in this program .
There is no reason why we should not pass that as part of the health care bill , " Casey said .
Kennedy emphasized the importance of getting parents access to adequate mental and psychological care .
" One of the things that we have in this health bill , is mental health parity ... The reason why that 's so important in helping reduce child abuse and neglect is obviously children have parents and those parents if they are not mentally healthy ... they are going to be more likely to take that out and have an environment where those kids are forced to grow up in really difficult and traumatic circumstances , " he said .
Several members of the advocacy community agreed .
" We need to pass comprehensive health reform that supports our nations families and includes crucial public health services like home visiting , like well child care , like prevention for all Americans , " said CEO of the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs Michael Fraser .
Lawmakers Call for Increased Parent Education Programs
Kennedy also called for increased funding for parent education programs .
" This is not only a health issue , it 's an education issue , " he said .
" We need to look at our education system in a holistic family context .
We know that if the parent is involved in their child 's education , those children succeed .
If there are mentors involved those children succeed ... we need to make sure we mentor at risk parents .
" A lot of them do n't know any better than to repeat the cycle of violence that they were brought up in .
If they know that they can reinforce positive behaviors through these mechanisms and these methods ... who teaches someone how to become a parent ?
Where do you get a license to be a parent ?...
Why is it that we do n't do more to facilitate new families being able to get the necessary directives ? "
Kennedy asked .
The report notes that inadequate state resources leaves many states stretched too thin and unable to provide protection to all of the children in need .
" When it comes to the investments we 're talking about , against our great wealth , it 's such [ a ] small , small sums of money .
Three , 4 or 5 billion dollars .
Compare that to the bailout of world 's biggest banks .
If the United States is able to bailout America 's banks , it ought to be able to bailout America 's children and families , " said Every Child Matters President Michael Petit .
The report found a nearly 13 - fold difference between the amounts that states spend per person to counter child abuse and neglect .
Thirteen states spent less than $ 50 per person to address issues of abuse , while top states invested close to three times that amount .
Rhode Island spends the most at $ 181 per person .
Poor funding adds additional stress to advocacy programs and increases the case loads of social workers tasked with helping children in high - risk situations .
" Too often , large case loads and unsupportive work environments lead to high employee turnover , hindering attainment of key safety and permanency outcomes for children , " explained Rebecca Myers of the National Association of Social Workers .
" We owe these workers the resources and the working conditions that create successful outcomes .
We must do better . "
Celebrities Speak Out Against Child Abuse
Lawmakers and advocates were joined by celebrities from the cast of " Law and Order : Special Victims Unit . "
" Through the drama and the acting , I have a real empathy for these real - life people that these characters are drawn from , " said B.D. Wong , who plays forensic psychiatrist Dr. George Huang .
" [ The violence ] goes much further than people think it does and it behooves us all as a community and a nation to investigate this important topic and to do something about it . "
Aaron Task , TechTicker : President Obama has come under withering attacks from right - wing politicians , pundits and Tea Party throwers .
But the Glenn Becks of the world could learn a few things from Ralph Nader when it comes to criticizing the President .
Here 's a sample of what the famed consumer advocate and former Green Party presidential candidate says of Obama in the accompanying video :
His early months in office have been " very disappointing . "
Obama is " a frightened man , " who wo n't take on corporate power .
Obama is " conflict averse " - and a " harmony ideology type , " who 's being taken advantage of by the sharks in Congress , of both parties .
He 's " Bush - Cheney redux " when it comes to military and foreign policy , " albeit with better speeches " to the Muslim world .
Given Obama 's handling of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , Nader wonders in amazement : " And they gave him the [ Nobel ] Peace Prize ? "
Nader 's main gripe is that Obama has " turned his back on the very people " who voted him into office , imploring the President to invite representatives of consumer , environmental and worker groups to the White House -- " as they elbow their way between the hordes of corporate execs , speculators and criminals that have received invitations there . "
Notably , the accompanying interview was conducted prior to reports that Obama has backed away from a campaign promise ( threat ? ) to raise taxes on corporations overseas profits .
Gee , I wonder what Nader would have to say about that ...
In all seriousness , if Nader 's views of Obama are shared by other progressives and " lefties , " his warnings about the Democrats being the minority after the 2010 mid-term elections may very well come to fruition .
About a week ago , Typhoon Ketsana ( known in the Phillippines as " Ondoy " ) made landfall , and according to the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) , Ketsana dropped 455 mm ( 17.9 in ) of rain on Metro Manila in a span of 24 hours on Saturday - the most in 42 years .
A month 's worth of rainfall in a single day washed away homes and flooded large areas , stranding thousands on rooftops in the city and elsewhere .
Ketsana later crossed over to Vietnam and Cambodia , where it is still active .
Over 360 people are known to have been killed , and damage estimates are reaching $ 100 million .
Unfortunately , another tropical storm may be headed toward the southern Philippines on Wednesday but is still 1,000 km ( 600 mi ) off the coast .

( CNN ) -- Russia 's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin held talks with Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao in Beijing Tuesday , as the two countries agreed to bilateral economic and trade deals worth $ 4 billion , Chinese state media reported .
Wen hosted a welcome ceremony for Putin at the Great Hall of the People at the start of a three - day visit , before their private talks and a larger session involving ministers from both sides , Xinhua said .
" Russia and China have become genuine and comprehensive strategic and cooperative partners in recent years , " Putin was quoted by Xinhua as saying .
Bilateral relations have become stable and mature since the forging of diplomatic ties 60 years ago and particularly the establishment of the Russia - China strategic cooperative partnership in 1996 , Wen told reporters .
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov said the deals included two $ 500 - million - dollar banking deals -- one involving Russia 's Vnesheconombank ( VEB ) and the China Development Bank and the other between Russia 's VTB bank and the Agricultural Bank of China , Agence France - Presse reported .
Chinese and Russian negotiators also met Tuesday " to exchange views on China - Russia energy cooperation , " according to a Chinese foreign ministry statement .
In April , the two countries signed agreements on oil cooperation , while a memorandum of understanding on natural gas cooperation in followed in June .
But negotiations over the pricing of the gas have reportedly remained a major obstacle to a final deal , AFP said .
However , Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan , who met with Zhukov at a joint economic forum earlier Tuesday , told reporters that the China - Russia oil pipeline project was going smoothly and the loan China pledged to Russia had been implemented , Xinhua said .
The construction on the China section of an oil pipeline from Siberia started in May .
The 1,030 - kilometer ( 640 - mile ) pipeline runs from Skovorodino , Russia , to the city of Daqing in northeastern China .
It is expected to go into operation by the end of 2010 and carry 15 million tons of crude oil annually from Russia to China from 2011 to 2030 , Xinhua added .

From baby deliveries to unexpected deaths , Mike Bowes , a 911 dispatcher from Quincy , Massachusetts , has handled a wide range of emergency calls .
Emergency dispatcher Mike Bowes received a call that his home was in flames Monday night .
But Monday night , the 44 - year - old received an unexpected call from his neighbor :
His own house was on fire .
The 911 call came in about 10:45 p.m. Monday , a little more than an hour before Mike Bowes ' shift ended .
My neighbor 's house just blew up , the caller said .
" What 's the address ? "
Mike Bowes asked patiently , just as he did with every emergency call for the past 11 years with the Quincy Police Department .
The caller frantically relayed the address , Bowes ' home address for 20 years .
" It was shocking , " Mike Bowes said .
" I thought she was kidding .
It 's a long shot .
I mean , what 's the chances it will be your house ? "
Out of 90,000 people who reside in Quincy , Massachusetts , a suburb of Boston , Mike Bowes ' was the home in flames , and he had answered the emergency call .
Thoughts raced through his mind :
Are my parents OK ?
Are the neighbors safe ?
What about my stuff ?
Following procedure , Mike Bowes transferred the call to the fire department .
Soon , dozens of calls about the fire from other neighbors began to pour into the control room .
Watch Mike Bowes talk about the fire »
One of the callers was his mother , Elizabeth Bowes , 68 .
She and her husband , Donald Bowes , 72 , had escaped unharmed .
About 10:45 p.m. , Elizabeth Bowes was reading a novel in the kitchen when she heard the explosion and saw flames shoot through the kitchen window .
She ran to wake her husband in a first - floor bedroom .
There was also a landlord living in upstairs .
Firefighters arrived within minutes and helped her to safety .
Within five minutes of receiving the call , police escorted Mike Bowes to his home .
He could see the fire light up the dark sky from afar .
Anxious neighbors gathered in the park nearby .
He was relieved to find his parents together on the sidewalk .
" My parents are alive ; my neighbors are alive , " he said .
" It 's an inconvenience , but we 'll get through it . "
In another coincidence , one of the first firefighters to arrive on scene was Mike Bowes ' cousin , Tom Bowes .
Tom Bowes , a firefighter for the past eight years , scrambled into the house to salvage old albums with wedding and baby photos amid the flames .
But everything else -- the clothes , electronics and furniture -- were destroyed .
No one was injured in the fire , and firefighters have yet to determine what caused the blaze .
They say it started in the garage , about 15 feet from the home .
Mike Bowes says his job prepared him to deal with the challenging circumstances .
Bowes and his family are living in a hotel , and local police officers and firefighters have donated clothes and money .
" A lot of people think dispatchers are strange because I 've been joking about what happened , " he said .
" I say , ' If I 'm not laughing , I 'll start crying . '
This is what I have to do . "

Tracking banana disease and educating farmers on how to protect their plantations is among several mobile phone applications being piloted in Uganda by the Grameen Foundation , a nongovernmental agency that aims to reduce poverty through microfinancing and new technology .
Grameen partnered with Uganda ’s largest mobile network operator , MTN , to create AppLab Uganda , an initiative to explore ways to use mobile technologies to improve people ’s lives , said the program director , Eric Cantor .
“ People already have phones in their pocket , already need information , and some organizations already that provide information , ” Mr. Cantor said .
“ We ’re accelerating those connections . ”
Building applications for agriculture seemed logical in a country that is predominately rural and reliant on small farms , he said .
Mr. Rutagumirwa is among several leaders in rural communities who were trained by Grameen to survey and educate neighboring farmers about the proper methods to contain banana disease .
In recent years , the wide spread of two diseases has decimated banana crops in East Africa , threatening the food security and livelihood for an estimated 30 million farmers , according to the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture .
In Uganda alone , bananas cover about 40 percent of the country ’s farmable land and are a staple food for more than 12 million people .
Losses from banana disease are estimated to be $ 70 million to $ 200 million each year .

San Francisco residents in need of diversion should grab an SF guide catering to people who actually live in the city .
Sometimes , residents just are n't aware of the hidden gems and deals that are available in their own backyards , but a quick point in the right direction can make all the difference .
For people with foodie sensibilities who find it hard to make the time to actually cook , one of the best things to do in San Francisco is to head down to the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market and load up on ingredients .
There 's nothing like grabbing a cup of coffee on a Saturday morning before heading over to the Ferry Building and joining in the gastronomical frenzy .
Get there early to mingle with other food - obsessed souls and top chefs as they check out tasty treats such as organic Portobello mushrooms and seasonal vegetables .
Exotic chocolates and artisanal cheeses tempt on all sides .
Another key spot in a practical guide to San Francisco must be Hayes Valley .

Did President Obama call Kanye West a “ jackass ” ?
It would appear that he certainly did , when asked about Sunday night ’s incident at MTV’s Video Music Awards in an off - the - record interview .
The interview was apparently conducted by CNBC , but the revealing tweet came from ABC ’s Terry Moran , and read “ Pres. Obama just called Kanye West a " jackass " for his outburst at VMAs when Taylor Swift won .
Now THAT'S presidential . ”
The tweet was quickly deleted , but much like Google , which caches web pages , Twitter search does not immediately remove deleted tweets , so Moran ’s remark is still visible .
ABC has since apologized for the incident in a statement obtained by Politico , but the story could turn into an important one when it comes to Twittering White House reporters .
While as far as off - the - record Presidential comments go this one is rather insignificant , the leak sets a very bad precedent .
Expect to hear more about this incident in coming days .
The 2009 Lexus ES 350 shot through suburban San Diego like a runaway missile , weaving at 120 miles an hour through rush hour freeway traffic as flames flashed from under the car .
At the wheel , veteran California Highway Patrol Officer Mark Saylor desperately tried to control the 272 - horsepower engine that was roaring at full throttle as his wife , teenage daughter and brother - in - law were gripped by fear .
“ We ’re in trouble . . . .
There ’s no brakes , ” Saylor ’s brother - in - law Chris Lastrella told a police dispatcher over a cellphone .
Moments later , frantic shrieks filled the car as it slammed into another vehicle and then careened into a dirt embankment , killing all four aboard .
The tragedy Aug. 28 was at least the fifth fatal crash in the U.S. over the last two years involving runaway Toyota and Lexus vehicles made by Toyota Motor Corp .
It is also among hundreds of incidents of sudden acceleration involving the company ’s vehicles that have been reported to Toyota or the federal government , according to an examination of public records by The Times .
Toyota has blamed the incidents -- apart from those caused by driver error -- on its floor mats , asserting that if they are improperly installed they can jam open the accelerator pedal .
A month after the Saylor crash , Toyota issued its biggest recall in company history , affecting 3.8 million vehicles in model years as far back as 2004 .
But auto safety experts believe there may be a bigger problem with Toyota vehicles than simply the floor mats .
The Saylor crash and others like it across the country , they say , point to a troubling possibility : that Toyota ’s ignition , transmission and braking systems may make it difficult for drivers to combat sudden or unintended accelerations and safely recover , regardless of their cause .
Toyota is not the only car company to be hit with reports of sudden acceleration , but the San Diego fatality , the massive recall that came in its wake and Toyota ’s position as the world ’s largest automaker have focused intense scrutiny on the company by federal safety regulators and others .
“ This is Toyota ’s Firestone , ” said Sean Kane , president of Safety Research & Strategies , a Rehoboth , Mass . , auto safety consulting firm .
He was referring to the public relations disaster that hit Bridgestone / Firestone almost 10 years ago over defective tires that caused a series of fatal accidents .
“ Right now , ” Kane said , “ when you say sudden acceleration , Toyota is it . ”
In addition to Saylor and Lastrella , the San Diego crash killed Saylor ’s wife , Cleofe Lastrella , and their only child , 13 - year - old daughter Mahala .
Signaling how seriously the company takes the incident , Toyota President Akio Toyoda made an apology this month while meeting with the Japanese news media .
“ Customers bought our cars because they thought they were the safest , ” he said .
“ But now we have given them cause for grave concern .
I ca n’t begin to express my remorse . ”
One remedy being considered by Toyota implicitly acknowledges what critics have been saying for almost 10 years : that the company ’s highly computerized engine control system lacks a fail - safe mechanism that can quickly extinguish sudden acceleration events , whether they are caused by floor mats , driver errors or even unknown defects in the electronic control system , as alleged in some lawsuits .
Reports of sudden acceleration in Toyota vehicles has resulted in nine federal inquiries and investigations since 2000 , two of which determined that there were improperly positioned floor mats .
Another found a loose part in Sienna minivans , and yet another probe remains open .
The rest were dismissed with no findings of equipment problems .
In most Toyota vehicles , the floor mats are held in place by two clips , which can come loose .
Toyota offers a standard carpeted floor mat and an optional rubber version .
Both mats have a cutout around the accelerator pedal .
The vehicle driven by Saylor had a rubber floor mat , but Toyota said it was for a different model of Lexus .
Since the San Diego crash , Toyota has urged all its customers to remove their floor mats as an interim fix .
But longer term , Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons said , the company is examining significant design changes .
One possible remedy is to redesign the accelerator pedal to make it harder to get caught by a floor mat , he said .
Another potential fix , he said , involves reprogramming the engine ’s computer to automatically cut power when a driver brakes while the gas pedal is depressed .
Such fail - safes are needed , auto experts say , because sudden acceleration can cause drivers to panic , diminishing their ability to take swift action -- such as shutting off the engine or shifting into neutral .
If anybody should have known how to stop an out - of - control car , it was Saylor , who was trained in emergency and high - speed driving as a 19 - year CHP veteran .
But a close look at the Lexus ES 350 raises questions about whether the car ’s very design may have compromised Saylor ’s skills .
One obvious line of defense is to simply shut off the engine , a step that may not be intuitive on the ES 350 .
The car has a push - button start system , activated by the combination of a wireless electronic fob carried by the driver and a button on the dashboard .
But once the vehicle is moving , the engine will not shut off unless the button is held down for a full three seconds -- a period of time in which Saylor ’s car would have traveled 528 feet .
A driver may push the button repeatedly , not knowing it requires a three - second hold .
“ When you are dealing with an emergency , you ca n’t wait three seconds for the car to respond at 120 miles an hour , ” said Clarence Ditlow , executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety .
The ES 350 Saylor was driving that day was a loaner provided to him by Bob Baker Lexus when he took his family ’s Lexus in for servicing .
It ’s unclear whether Saylor ’s own car had the same feature or whether he was aware of the shutdown procedure .
Bob Baker Lexus did not return calls .
That procedure is explained deep in the owners manual .
In a text box labeled " !
Caution , ” Toyota tells owners , “ Do not touch the ‘ power ’ switch while driving . ”
But under the warning it adds , “ If you have to make an emergency stop , press and hold the ‘ power ’ switch for more than three seconds . ”
Lyons , the Toyota spokesman , said : “ I think the text is valid .
What I ’d prefer it to say is to explain that you ’ll lose power assist [ for ] brakes and steering if you do so . ”
The shutdown procedure reflects a larger problem :
As auto manufacturers adopt increasingly complex electronic features , it becomes more difficult to explain how they work , said Paul Green , a human factors expert at the University of Michigan ’s Transportation Research Institute .
A study by the institute found that in some cases , owners manuals would have to run up to 1,000 pages to fully disclose everything .
“ In the past , systems were pretty simple , ” Green said .
“ You put a key in the lock and turn it .
Now we have a fob with functionality . ”
The other common defense tactic advised by experts is to simply shift a runaway vehicle into neutral .
But the ES 350 is equipped with an automatic transmission that can mimic manual shifting , and its shift lever on the console has a series of gates and detents that allow a driver to select any of at least four forward gears .
The arrangement of those gear selections could make it difficult to shift from a forward gear directly into neutral in a panic situation , Toyota spokesman Lyons acknowledged .
“ I think it ’s possible to get the shifter confused , but I ca n’t be sure that ’s what happened ” in San Diego , Lyons said .
“ You ’d be surprised how many people around here [ Toyota ] do n’t know what the neutral position is for . ”
The most obvious impulse for any driver experiencing sudden acceleration is to apply the brakes .
But when an engine goes to full throttle and is speeding at 120 mph , the brake might not stop the car .
The ES 350 and most other modern vehicles are equipped with power - assisted brakes , which operate by drawing vacuum power from the engine .
But when an engine opens to full throttle , the vacuum drops , and after one or two pumps of the brake pedal the power assist feature disappears .
As a result , a driver would have to apply enormous pressure to the brake pedal to stop the car , and if the throttle was wide open might not be able to stop it at all , safety experts say .
“ I do n’t think you can stop a car going 120 mph and an engine at full throttle without power assist , ” said Ditlow , the safety center director .
Indeed , a 2007 study by federal highway safety officials showed that braking distance and force on a Lexus ES 350 increased fivefold when the throttle was wide open .
And evidence introduced in sudden acceleration trials suggests that it can take up to 225 pounds of pressure on a brake pedal to arrest a runaway vehicle , far more than most drivers can muster from a seated position , said Edgar “ Hike ” Heiskell , a Charleston , W.Va. , attorney who is suing Toyota over a fatal acceleration accident in Flint , Mich .
Lyons acknowledged that the vacuum can be depleted when an engine throttle is wide open , leaving the drivers without power - assisted brakes .
“ There ’s a [ federal ] standard where you have to be able to stop the car without power - assisted brakes , but obviously I do n’t think it includes situations where the throttle is wide open , ” he added .
Drivers in other crashes also found it difficult to rein in a runaway Toyota .
Guadalupe Gomez of Redwood City said he was held hostage for 20 miles on a Bay Area freeway by a 2007 Camry traveling more than 100 mph .
Gomez was unable to turn off the engine or shift into neutral and then burned out his brakes before slamming into another car and killing that driver , said attorney Louis Franecke , who represented that victim ’s family .
The San Diego crash is still under investigation by the San Diego County Sheriff ’s Department and the CHP ; until the probe is complete , neither agency is commenting .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , meanwhile , says it has an open investigation into sudden acceleration events involving Toyota vehicles .

I just got my Google Wave invite .
No , I ’m already out , so I ca n’t send one to you , sorry .
But this service is way overhyped and as people start to use it they will realize it brings the worst of email and IM together : unproductivity .
See , the first thing you notice is that you can see people chatting live in Google Wave .
That ’s really cool if you are working on something together , like a spreadsheet or a Word document .
But it ’s a productivity sink if you are trying to just communicate with other people .
It also ignores the productivity gains that we ’ve gotten from RSS feeds , Twitter , and FriendFeed .
What do I mean by that ?
It is noisy , but the noise often happens way down in a wave deep in your inbox .
This is far far worse than email .
( New email always shows up at the top of my inbox , where Google Wave can bring me new stuff deep down at the bottom of my inbox ) .
It ’s far far worse than Twitter ( where new stuff ALWAYS shows up at top ) .
It ’s even far worse than FriendFeed , which my friends always said was too noisy .
At least there when you write a comment on an item it pops to the top of the page .
And , worse , when I look at my Google Wave page I see dozens of people all typing to me in real time .
I do n’t know where to look and keeping up with this real time noise is less like email , which is like tennis ( hit one ball at a time ) and more like dodging a machine gun of tennis balls .
Much more mentally challenging .
See , Google Wave was oversold as something you ’d use with the public , or at least with large groups of friends , like you use Twitter , email , or Facebook .
No .
Using it that way is an attention dump and will kill your productivity .
Google Wave is actually closer to IM .
Great with your very close friends or very active coworkers but horrid for nearly everyone else .
Google ’s
Wave will crash hard onto the beach of overhype .
My advice ?
DO NOT ADD EVERYONE .
Get a close personal friend , or a coworker to play with this and do n’t publicize that you ’re using it until you are sure you can deal with the productivity hit you ’ll take here .
DO NOT ASSUME THIS IS A TWITTER KILLER .
It is not .
It ’s not even a good sharing engine , far worse than FriendFeed is .
I ’d recommend using a private room over on FriendFeed first .
DO TRY THE API if you are a developer .
From what I ’m seeing that ’s where the real value in Google Wave will come , but we have n’t seen enough apps yet so end users wo n’t find much here to play with yet .
To see some screen shots and how noisy this can get , go over and check out Louis Gray ’s post about it .
Just get ready for the crash of overhype , this one did n’t deserve this much hype for what it delivered .

" The Real Goal of the 45 - Day Curfew is to Torpedo November 's Electoral Process "
El Tiempo Staff Editorial translated by Kristin Bricker
With Executive Decree PCM -M-016-2009 , the dictatorial government has taken off its mask and really outdone itself by keeping Honduras and the Honduras people kidnapped through its use and abuse of the State 's weapons and its desire to manipulate the Constitution and the laws of the Republic .
This executive decree , signed by the de facto head of state Micheletti in a meeting with his equally de facto cabinet , establishes a curfew for 45 consecutive days , during which practically all rights and individual freedoms are annulled , leaving the Honduran people completely defenseless before the usurpers .
From the moment this dictatorial edict went into effect , inalienable rights such as personal freedom , the right to free thought , the right to organize and meet , the right to free movement , rights to privacy in one 's own home , and protections against arbitrary detentions ceased to exist in Honduras .
Honduras is at the mercy of a dictatorship that has tried to enthrone itself against the will of an entire people .
Honduras is an international pariah and a State that has been kidnapped by a group of unscrupulous and adventurous politicians , military officials , businessmen , and religious kingpins who have no consciences .
They maintain omnipotent power over the government in order to enjoy absolute impunity , privileges , and canonry .
As for freedom of expression , which is fundamental to human coexistence and democracy , article 73 of the Constitution of the Republic states :
Printing presses , radio and television stations , and whichever other means of emitting and broadcasting thought , as well as their components , cannot be confiscated , nor closed , nor can their work be interrupted on the grounds that they are committing a crime in transmitting their thoughts , their responsibilities under the law notwithstanding .
We cite that constitutional article for informational purposes .
We know that for a dictatorial , totalitarian government , like that which holds power in Honduras , " the Constitution is pure drivel " and " can be violated as much as is necessary , " according to the subculture of the political " class " that has brought our country to the point of complete political , economic , and social disaster .
Article 3.3 of executive decree PCM - M - 016-2009 prohibits : " Publication in any media , spoken , written or televised , of information that offends human dignity , public officials , or criticizes the law and the government resolutions , or any style of attack against the public order and peace . "
All of this , naturally , is according to the dictatorial regime 's criteria and in no way according to democratic mentality .
It is obvious , therefore , that with the 45 - day curfew - - that is , for the duration of the election campaigns -- the real goal is to torpedo November 's electoral process through a plan to consolidate the dictatorship 's power , unmasking the de facto regime 's faked determination to support the general elections at the end of the year .
This is because there cannot be an electoral campaign without individual freedoms , without the freedom of expression or transmission of thought , without the freedom of association and the freedom to hold meetings , without free transit and the right to privacy in one 's own home , and without protections against arbitrary detentions .
That is very clear .

Myths That Place Children At Risk During Custody Litigation Dallam .
S. J. , & Silberg , J. L. ( Jan / Feb 2006 ) .
Myths that place children at risk during custody disputes .
Sexual Assault Report , 9 ( 3 ) , 33 - 47 . ( PDF )
The Leadership Council is a nonprofit scientific organization concerned about he welfare of children .
We have become increasingly concerned about the legal system 's treatment of victims of family violence during divorce and child custody proceedings .
The LC has reviewed documentation from a number of cases in which children were placed in the sole custody of a parent that the child alleges is physically or sexually abusing them .
Many of these children were prohibited from any contact or provided only limited contact with the parent seeking to protect the child - despite the fact that this parent had never been found to have harmed the child .
In most cases the child 's allegations were quite credible .
Some groups have opposed exposure of this problem claiming that the information is politically motivated or constitutes " father - bashing . "
Our analysis indicates that the problem of abusers or batterers obtaining custody is widespread and well documented by research .
Presenting this information is not an attempt to " bash " any particular group , but is offered simply to educate professionals about the extent of this serious problem affecting child safety .
Societal acceptance of these myths assists perpetrators of family violence by giving them custody of their victims and by encouraging public denial about the failure of the legal system to protect these children .
The Leadership Council prepared this analysis because we believe that society as a whole benefits when the public has access to accurate information regarding child abuse and other forms of interpersonal violence .
Introduction Approximately one in two marriages in the United States end in divorce , affecting over a million children per year .
About 10 % of these divorces involve custody litigation .
At the same time , child abuse is a widespread problem in our society and families with a history of violence often end in divorce .
Concerns about safety of the children are behind some of the most bitterly contested child custody cases .
Unfortunately custody litigation can become a vehicle whereby batterers and child abusers attempt to extend or maintain their control and authority over their victims after the marriage dissolves .
Although , research has not found a higher incidence of false allegations of child abuse and domestic violence in the context of custody / visitation disputes , officers of the court tend to be unreasonably suspicious of claims raised during time .
As a result , abused parents and their children may find themselves re-victimized by the justice system after separation .
Determining which parent should have primary custody when parents cannot agree is not easy .
Custody evaluators often have little training in recognizing and responding to child abuse and domestic violence .
Accordingly , those familiar with current practices have found that too often custody decisions are based on myth , misinterpretation of facts , and evaluator bias .
The following are an overview of some of the erroneous beliefs that contribute to the problem of children not being protected from abuse in family court .
Myth 1 .
Allegations of sexual abuse are common during custody disputes and the vast majority of allegations are false , unfounded or unsubstantiated .
Many people believe abuse allegations are rampant in custody and divorce litigation where they are used primary by mothers to gain a tactical advantage .
When antagonistic parents are locked in legal disputes it is reasonable to be concerned about their motives when abuse allegations are raised .
However , research has consistently shown that sexual abuse allegations are not common during custody litigation and when thoroughly investigated are no more likely to be false than allegations raised when at other points in time .
This matter was investigated by the Denver - based Research Unit of the Association of Family and Conciliation Courts which performed a 2 - year study which explored the incidence and validity of sexual abuse allegations in custody cases .
Contrary to the popular myth that sexual allegations in custody cases are relatively common , the study found that , in the 12 states participating in the study , only 6 % of custody cases involved allegations of sexual abuse .
The belief that these allegations are typically false was also challenged by the study findings .
Half of the allegations were believed by the investigators to be true , and in another 17 % determination of the validity could not be made with any degree of certainty .
The remaining third of the cases were not believed to involve abuse .
However , in most of the cases where abuse was not substantiated , the allegations were believed to have been made in good faith and based on genuine suspicions .
Similar results have been found by other researchers .
An Australian study ( Brown et al. , 1997 ) found the overall rate of false allegations during divorce to be about 9 % , similar to the rate of false allegations at any other time .
Schuman ( 2000 ) reviewed research that found a range of 1 - 5 % for rates of deliberately false allegations , and 14 - 21 % for mistaken allegations .
It is also important to note that when false allegations are raised , it is not always mothers accusing fathers .
Nicholas Bala and John Schuman , two Queen 's University law professors , reviewed Canadian judges ' written decisions where allegations of either physical or sexual abuse were raised in the context of parental separation .
They examined 196 family law cases that were adjudicated between 1990 and 1998 .
The results revealed that the judges felt that only a third of unproven cases of child abuse stemming from custody battles involved someone deliberately lying in court .
In these cases , the judges found that fathers were more likely to fabricate the accusations than mothers .
Of female - initiated allegations , just 1.3 % were deemed intentionally false by civil courts , compared with 21 % when the man in the failed relationship brought similar allegations .
In conclusion , the available evidence refutes the notion that sexual abuse allegations in the context of custody and visitation cases are epidemic , and counters the notion that these cases are commonly reported by a parent who is vindictive or seriously impaired .
There is no evidence from the present research to suggest that a significant number of parents are lodging fabricated reports to win custody battles .

Child Sexual Abuse & Neglect , 14 ( 2 ) , 151-63 Myth 2 : A history of battering has nothing to do with child abuse .
Parents who have been abused by a spouse often fear for the safety of their children -- especially after separation when they are not present to mediate for the child .
Some have suggested that this fear is baseless by claiming there is no significant correlation between wife battering and various forms of child abuse .
Abundant research , however , fails to support this position finding that the power dynamics that lead to domestic violence may also result in abuse of a child .
As a report by the American Psychological Association pointed out , fathers who batter their children 's mothers can be expected to use abusive power and control techniques to control the children too ( APA , 1996 ) .
To date , over 30 studies that have examined the co-occurrence of domestic violence and child abuse found a large overlap .
Overall , both forms of violence were found in 40 % of families studied with the range in the majority of studies varying from 30 % to 60 % of families ( Appel & Holden , 1998 , Edleson , 1999 ) .
Perhaps the most convincing evidence comes from a nationally representative survey of 3,363 American parents .
Marital violence was found to be a statistically significant predictor of physical child abuse ; the greater the amount of violence against a spouse , the greater the probability of physical child abuse by the physically aggressive spouse .
This relationship is stronger for husbands than for wives .
The probability of child abuse by a violent husband increases from 5 % with one act of marital violence to nearly 100 % with 50 or more acts of marital violence .
The predicted probability of child abuse by a violent wife increases from 5 % with one act of marital violence to 30 % with 50 or more acts of marital violence .
Although less research has been done on overlap between domestic violence and child sexual abuse , the available evidence indicates reason to be concerned .
Pavesa ( 1988 ) performed a careful case - controlled study of 34 families in which father - daughter incest occurred and compared these families with 68 control families .
Daughters of batterers were 6.5 times more likely than other girls to be victims of father - daughter incest .
Evidence of an overlap between domestic violence and child sexual abuse has also been uncovered in surveys of children .
For instance , Roy ( 1988 ) interviewed 146 children aged 11 to 17 who had been exposed to domestic violence .
Almost of third of the girls ( 31 % ) either reported that they had been sexually abused by their fathers and / or had documentation of sexual abuse in their case files .
A survey of 313 college women , showed a similar trend .
Nine percent of the women reported having witnessed some type of physical conflict between their parents .
Witnessing marital violence was associated with having experienced childhood physical and / or sexual abuse ( Feerick & Haugaard , 1999 ) .
Still , a child does n't have to be physically or sexually abused to be harmed by domestic violence .
Research on children ’s exposure to domestic violence has consistently identified a range of negative outcomes for these children ( Kernic et al. , 2003 ; Wolfe et al. , 2003 ) .
In fact , children exposed to domestic violence may show comparable levels of emotional and behavioral problems to children who were the direct victims of physical or sexual abuse ( Jaffe , Wolfe , & Wilson , 1990 ) For more information see : American Psychological Association . ( 1996 ) .

Myth 3 : Custody transfers to abusive parents are rare .
Some have suggested that custody transfers to abusive parents are rare events .
Most of us would like to believe this .
Unfortunately , empirical research examining this issue has repeatedly shown that men who ask for custody of their children often get it , whether or not they have a history of violence .
Although women are more likely to get custody of their children , this is often because they are more likely to ask for it .
When men ask for custody , they often get it .
According to a report by the American Psychological Association , an abusive man is more likely than a nonviolent father to seek sole physical custody of his children and may be just as likely ( or even more likely ) to be awarded custody as the mother ( APA , 1996 ) .
A report by the American Judges Foundation , reported that 70 % of the time an abuser who requests custody is able to convince the court to give it to him .
The majority of parents in " high - conflict divorces " involving child custody disputes report a history of domestic violence and / or child abuse .
For example , a review of one sample of parents referred for child custody evaluations by the court found that domestic violence was raised in 75 % of the cases ( Jaffe & Austin , 1995 as cited by Jaffe , Crooks , & Poisson , 2003 ) .
Another study found that between 70 % and 75 % of parents who were referred by the family court for counseling because of failed mediation or continuing disputes over the care of their children described marital histories that included physical aggression ( Johnston & Campbell , 1988 ) .
However , raising allegations of abuse often hurts the abused or protective parent more than the alleged abuser .
An ongoing study funded by the National Institute of Justice study shows that women who inform custody mediators that they are victims of domestic violence often receive less favorable custody awards ( Saccuzzo & Johnson , 2004 ) .
The investigators found that only 35 % of mothers who alleged domestic abuse got primary custody , compared to 42 % of mothers who did not .
Father who were accused of domestic violence were given primary custody in 10 % of cases , father not accused of domestic violence got primary custody 9 % of the time .
Thus , disclosing domestic violence hurt the women who disclosed being victimized ; while alleged perpetrators suffered no ill effects - that is unless the mediator noted evidence of violence when the mother did not allege domestic violence .
When this occurred , mediators recommended protected child exchanges twice as often .
Thus women who were forthright with their domestic violence allegations secured less protection for themselves and their children .
A recent study by the Harborview Injury Prevention & Research Center in Seattle confirms these results ( Kernic et al. , 2005 ) .
The researchers analyzed documentation on more than 800 local couples with young children who filed for divorce in 1998 and 1999 , including 324 cases with a history of domestic violence .
They found that evidence of domestic violence did not appear to change how courts decided custody .
In other words , fathers who were violent were just as likely to receive custody when they asked for it as fathers who were not violent .
Only 17 % of fathers with a known history of domestic violence were denied child visitation and they were no more likely than other fathers to be required by the court to have a third party supervise child visitations .
Concerns about how family courts are handling cases involving abuse were also raised by the findings of Neustein and Goetting ( 1999 ) .
They examined judicial responses to protective parents ' complaints of child sexual abuse in 300 custody cases with extensive family court records .
The investigators found that in only 10 % of cases where allegations of child abuse were raised was primary custody given to the protective parent with supervised contact with alleged abuser .
Conversely , 20 % of these cases resulted in a predominantly negative outcome where the child was placed in the primary legal and physical custody of the allegedly sexually abusive parent ( see , p. 108 ) .
In the rest of the cases , the judges awarded joint custody with no provisions for supervised visitation with the alleged abuser .
To better understand the problems that protective parents face in the legal system , researchers at California State University , San Bernardino , are performing an on - going national survey ( Stahly et al. , 2004 ) .
To date , over 100 self - identified protective parents have completed the 101 - item questionnaire .
The results are quite shocking .
Prior to divorce , 94 % of the protective mothers surveyed say that they were the primary caretaker of their child and 87 % had custody at the time of separation .
However , as a result of reporting child abuse , only 27 % were left with custody after court proceedings .
Most protective parents lost custody in emergency ex parte proceedings ( where they were neither notified nor present ) and where no court reporter was present .
The vast majority of these mothers ( 97 % ) reported that court personnel ignored or minimized reports of abuse .
They reported feeling that they were punished for trying to protect their children and 65 % said they were threatened with sanctions if the " talked publicly " about the case .
In all , 45 % of the mothers say they were labeled as having Parental Alienation Syndrome ( PAS ) .
The protective parents reported that the average cost of the court proceedings was over $ 80,000 .
Over a quarter of the protective parents say they were forced to file bankruptcy as a result of filing for custody of their children .
Eighty - five percent of the protective parents surveyed believe that their children are still being abused ; however , 63 % say they stopped reporting the abuse for fear that contact with their children will be terminated .
Eleven percent of the children were reported to have attempted suicide .

Protective mothers in child custody disputes : A study of judicial abuse .
California State University , San Bernardino .
Myth 4 : Fit mothers do not lose custody .
Many people assume that the only way a mother would lose custody to an alleged batterer or child abuser was if she were proven to be an unfit parent .
Most people have difficulty believing that that a court would take a child away from a mother who has heretofore been the child 's primary caretaker if her only crime is expressing concern about her own or her child 's safety .
Unfortunately , this is happening ; the only real question is why .
There is no single answer to this question .
Instead , it appears that a number of factors are involved .
First , there is a widespread belief in our society that a person who both appears and acts normal could not possibly be a violent batterer or child abuser .
Offenders are well aware of our propensity for making assumptions about private behavior from one 's public presentation and they tend to use this knowledge of our collective blindness to their advantage by appearing to be the perfect parent during court appearances ( Salter , 2003 ) .
Mothers concerned about the safety of their children , on the other hand , often appear overly concerned and as if they are exaggerating the problem .
As a report by the American Psychological Association pointed out :
If the court ignores the history of violence as the context for the mother 's behavior in a custody evaluation , she may appear hostile , uncooperative , or mentally unstable .
For example , she may refuse to disclose her address , or may resist unsupervised visitation , especially if she thinks her child is in danger .
Psychological evaluators who minimize the importance of violence against the mother , or pathologize her responses to it , may accuse her of alienating the children from the father and may recommend giving the father custody in spite of his history of violence .
( APA , 1996 ) A second reason that fit mothers lose custody to alleged abusers is that many officers of the court believe that the only reason women raise abuse allegations during custody disputes is to gain a tactical advantage .
Research , however , fails to find such an advantage .
In fact , women who raise abuse allegations appear to receive less favorable rulings than those who do not ( see e.g. , Saccuzzo & Johnson , 2004 ) .
This may be because women who allege abuse may be seen as fabricating or exaggerating incidents of violence as a way of manipulating the courts ( Doyne et al. , 1999 ) .
For this reason , some lawyers advise women not to tell courts or mediators about child abuse or domestic abuse because , by doing so , they risk losing custody to the alleged abuser ( " Custody Litigation , " 1988 ; Saccuzzo & Johnson , 2004 ) .
A third factor contributing to the problem is statutory .
M ost state legislatures have enacted legislation requiring family courts to favor joint custody arrangements , and when this is n't possible , to favor the parent who appears most " friendly " to a joint custody arrangement .
At least 31 states have statutes requiring courts to consider how " cooperative " the parent is when determining custody arrangements ( Gonzalez & Reichmann , 2005 ) .
The intent of " friendly parent " preferences is to guarantee that children go to the parent most likely to facilitate the child 's relationship with the other parent .
Although this goal is laudable ; in practice , the result has been to penalize parents who raise concerns about child abuse or domestic violence ( Dore , 2004 ) .
Friendly parent preferences tend to favor abusers who rarely object to the nonabusive parent having access to the child .
Protective parents , on the other hand , frequently seek to curtail a violent parent 's access to the child .
Moreover , the very act of raising concerns of abuse , suggests to the court that the protective parent is inherently " unfriendly " and should therefore be denied custody ( Dore , 2004 ) .
Some professionals have found that the friendly parent concept is most often employed against the custodial or primary parent , typically the mother ( Zorza , 1992 ) .
Some states have tried to rectify injustices resulting from friendly parent preferences by enacting presumptions against custody to a perpetrator of domestic violence .
Unfortunately , these presumptions are not always followed , especially when " friendly parent " preferences continue to remain on the books .
For instance , Morrill et al. ( 2005 ) evaluated the effectiveness of statutes mandating a presumption against custody to a perpetrator of domestic violence in 6 different states .
The investigators examined 393 custody and / or visitation orders where the father perpetrated domestic violence against the mother and surveyed 60 judges who entered those orders .
They found that children failed to be protected in states with a statutory presumption against custody to an abuser when the state also had a " friendly parent " provision in their statutes with a presumption for joint custody .
A fourth reason that fit mothers may lose custody to an alleged abuser is due to lax standards that allow junk science to influence custody decisions in family courts .
Over the years a number of " syndromes " have been developed that pathologize the responses of parents who seek to protect their child from an abusive spouse .
The most popular of these syndromes , " Parental Alienation Syndrome . " is discussed in the next section .

Myth 5 : Parental alienation syndrome is a common , well - documented phenomenon .
Those who buy into the myth that mothers frequently raise false allegations of abuse may attempt to explain this phenomenon by relying on a legal theory called Parental Alienation Syndrome ( PAS ) .
Some suggest that the theory is based on science , and that PAS is a well - documented phenomenon .
Although estrangement from one or both parents can occur in children during an acrimonious divorce , Parental Alienation Syndrome ( PAS ) lacks a scientific foundation and has never been shown to be a valid explanation of this process .
In fact , Dr. Richard Gardner , the theory 's creator , developed his theory while working as a paid consultant to men charged with sexually abusing their children .
Thus , the syndrome was created as a defense theory to counter a child 's allegation of sexual abuse ( Dallam , 1999 ) .
Gardner defines PAS as follows :
The parental alienation syndrome ( PAS ) is a disorder that arises primarily in the context of child custody disputes .
Its primary manifestation is the child 's campaign of denigration against a parent , a campaign that has no justification .
It results from the combination of a programming ( brainwashing ) parent 's indoctrinations and the child 's own contributions to the vilification of the target parent . . .
Gardner defines PAS as a psychiatric disorder that arises in the course of child - custody disputes adjudicated in the context of adversarial proceedings .
Gardner 's theory portrays the child 's preferred or protective parent ( usually the mother under PAS ) as an evil " alienator " who is virtually solely responsible for turning a vulnerable child against their estranged parent ( usually the father under PAS ) .
The child is thus viewed as mentally ill and the " alienating ' protective parent ( for example , a mother that raises concerns about abuse ) is viewed as the sole cause of the disorder .
When this parent is judged to be in the " severe " category , Dr. Gardner recommended sole custody to the other parent - the parent that the child claims is abusing them .
Thus , the main cure for this alleged mental illness is for the child to be placed in greater contact with an alleged abuser while their contact with the protective parent is curtailed or halted altogether .
It should be pointed out that Gardner never submitted his theory to testing and it has never been shown to be a valid syndrome .
Despite these shortcomings , PAS has gained traction in the courts as it fits well with court 's friendly parent preference .
Moreover , some courts have accepted PAS because it apparently appears to explain a well - recognized phenomenon within custody battles - the often acrimonious fight between parents for their child 's affection .
Unfortunately , Parental Alienation Syndrome , like the friendly parent concept it is based upon , presents the court with a paradox that seems to undermine rational decision - making when considering the best interests of children .
With PAS theory , the concerned custodial parent 's steps to obtain professional assistance in diagnosing , treating , and protecting the child , constitute evidence of " alienation . "
Attorney Richard Ducote ( 2002 ) noted : " One irony of . . . ' PAS ' is that the increased existence of valid evidence of true sexual abuse leads Gardner and his devotees to more fervently diagnose ' PAS . '
Thus , ' PAS ' is the criminal defense attorney 's dream , since the greater the proof of the crime , the greater the proof of the defense . "
In professional journals , PAS has been cited an example of bad science that has been presented to the courts as credible forensic evidence .
For instance , in an article published in Professional Psychology : Research and Practice , Rotgers and Barrett ( 1996 ) cite PAS theory as a prime example of a nonscientific theory that engages in " reverse logic . "
Moreover , PAS has been widely discredited in academic circles for being biased against women and children , and flawed in its failure to take into account alternative explanations for the behavior of the parties involved .
Further , critics have noted that Gardner 's methods for determining the veracity of an abuse allegation are seriously biased in favor of the alleged child molester .
Lisa Amaya - Jackson , M.D. , Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Medical Director of Child and Adolescent Trauma Treatment Services at Duke University , and Mark D. Everson , Ph.D. , Clinical Associate Professor in Psychiatry and Director of the Program on Childhood Trauma & Maltreatment at University of North Carolina Hospitals , Chapel Hill , reviewed Gardner 's book Protocols for the Sex - Abuse Evaluation and found Gardner 's system for detecting sexual abuse in children to be " seriously flawed . "
They stated : " Bias can be noted in the author 's attempts to discredit a child 's allegations by resorting to narrow , often oversimplified notions of how sexually abused children are supposed to behave . "
They further note that while he discusses the importance of evaluators being neutral and objective , Gardner conveys " a strong bias that the overwhelming majority of allegations , especially in custody - related cases , are false and that the assessment procedures the author advocates are slanted to arrive at such a conclusion . "
Amaya - Jackson and Everson ( 1996 ) conclude : " This book can perhaps best be described as a recipe for finding allegations of sexual abuse false , under the guise of clinical and scientific objectivity .
One suspects that it will be a bestseller among defense attorneys . "
A recent study ( cited by Johnston & Kelly , 2004 ) assessed the multiple factors that could contribute to the child 's rejection of a parent .
They concluded that just as important as alienating behaviors on the part of a parent were the child 's actual experiences of child abuse or lack of parental warmth in their interaction with the rejected parent .
This is not to imply that abuse allegations are always accurate , or that parents do not attempt to manipulate their children during adversarial custody litigation .
However , family courts need to be educated with a more scientific , sophisticated approach to the complexities of determining custody .
The latest research on children embroiled in custody conflicts supports looking at the multiple , interacting , and often complex factors that affect a child 's feelings about his or her parents .
Conversely , simplistic theories such as PAS theory are not sufficiently scientific to be able to make cause and effect determinations and can place children in danger of being revictimized in family court .

Myth 6 : Children are more likely to be abused in the care of a woman than a man .
The myth that women are more violent toward children than men is currently being promoted by some extremist groups .
This claim is based , in part , on a statistical report by the U.S. Department Health and Human Services ( HHS ) which breaks down the number of substantiated reports of child abuse and neglect by gender .
The HHS analysis shows that of children maltreated by their parents , 40.8 % of child victims were maltreated by their mothers acting alone ; another 18.8 % were maltreated by their fathers acting alone ; and 16.9 % were abused by both their mother and father .
Some seek to misuse this statistic to suggest that children are more at risk in the care of mothers than fathers .
When looking at the HHS report , however , it is important to note that most of the instances of substantiated maltreatment involved neglect of children under the age of three years .
Because women tend to spend many more hours in contact with small children than men in our society , it makes sense that overall a young child is more likely to be maltreated by a woman rather than by a man .
[ 1 ]
However , this does not suggest that a child is safer when in the care of a father than a mother .
A recent population - based case - control study reviewed 8 years of child - fatality - review data in Missouri .
The investigators found that females were perpetrators for just 26 % of all inflicted fatal injuries on young children ( Schnitzer & Ewigman , 2005 ) .
The vast majority of perpetrators were male ( 71.2 % ) .
In most instances , the perpetrator was the child 's father ( 34.9 % ) or a boyfriend of the mother 24.2 % .
The child 's mother was the perpetrator in only 19.7 % of fatalities ( see Table 1 ) .
TABLE 1 . Inflicted Fatal Injuries on Young Children :
Gender of Perpetrator and Relationship to Deceased Child * Gender and Relationship Percent Total Males 71.2 % ---- Biological father 34.9 % ----Boyfriend of mother 24.2 % ---- Other male relative 4.5 % ---- Male nonrelative 3.0 % ---- Stepfather 2.3 % ---- Male babysitter 1.5 % ---- Foster father 0.8 % Females 25.8 % ---- Biological mother 19.7 ---- Female babysitter 3.0 ---- Other female relative 1.5 ---- Girlfriend of father 0.8 ---- Female , nonrelative 0.8 Gender unknown
3 % ---- Babysitter or other nonrelative 3 % Total 100 * Adapted from Schnitzer & Ewigman , 2005 , Table 3 Based on their research , Schnitzer and Ewigman ( 2005 ) concluded that children are safest when they live in households with both biological parents or one biological parent and no other adults .
Children appear to be at are greatest risk when they live in households that include males who are not related to them .
Other recent studies reveal similar findings .
For instance , Starling et al. ( 1995 ) identified perpetrators of both fatal and nonfatal abusive head trauma over a 12 - year period ( 1982 -1994 ) at the Children 's Hospital of Denver .
Male perpetrators outnumbered females over 2:1 .
In all , 68.5 % of perpetrators were male , with fathers , step - fathers , and mothers ' boyfriends committing over 60 % of the crimes ( fathers accounted for 37 % of the abusers , followed by boyfriends at 20.5 % ) .
Males were also tended to inflict more severe injuries .
Men were perpetrators in 74.2 % of the cases of fatal abusive head trauma .
The largest group of female perpetrators were female babysitters would were responsive for 17.3 % of cases .
Mothers were responsible for only 12.6 % of abusive head trauma cases .
Courts should to be mindful of the ways that statistical data can be misused when assessing the safety of living situations for children .
In addition , it should be remembered that group data cannot tell us what living situation is best for a child in a specific case .
Currently , the best indicator that we have of a propensity toward future violence is past behavior ( Crowley , 2005 ) .
Thus custody determinations require careful examination of the evidence rather than rhetoric .
Courts should pay special attention to the child 's own report of abuse or neglect , observations of a parent 's interactions with his or her child , and past evidence that a parent has been violent towards others in the household .

1 . When we make judgments based on statistical data , we must place numbers in the context of their denominator rather than simply comparing the raw data .
In other words , for these statistics to be meaningful , we must compare rates of maltreatment that have been adjusted based on hours of contact with the child .
As illustration , consider the following example .
If we compared the murder rate of any small town in American with the murder rate in any large city , we would get the impression that large cities are very dangerous simply because many more people die .
Only when murder rates are adjusted for the number of people actually living in the community is it possible to determine which town is in fact the safest .
For example , if 20 people were murdered in the large town and 2 people were murdered in the small town , some might suggest that small towns are much safer places to live .
However , if we adjust the rates for the actual population , we might find that the population of the large town is 100,000 , while the population of the small town is only 100 .
Thus , the actual murder rate for the large town would be 20 per 100,000 , while the murder rate in the small town would be 2000 per 100,000 !
In this case , the murder rate in the small town would be 100 times higher than the larger one .
For this reason , statistics of maltreatment by gender of caretaker , must take into account the amount of time actually spent with the child .

After an epic but apparently relatively uncontroversial joint partyroom meeting , Malcolm Turnbull emerged at 8.00 pm in Parliament House tonight to delcare he ’d received support from the Coalition backbench to negotiate a series of amendments with the Government over its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme .
The full list of amendments is below .
The key amendment is a massive increase in compensation for emissions - intensive trade - exposed industries , both lowering the threshold at which industries receive compensation and boosting compensation for all recipients to 94.5 % of permits free , including those currently scheduled to receive 66 % of permits free .
UPDATE : A back of the envelope calculation suggests it would cost at least $ 350 m more in the first year of the scheme to provide 94.5 % of permits to all heavy polluters based on a permit price of $ 25 ; more each year thereafter , rising to close to $ 500 m pa after five years .
The Coalition amendments would also extend compensation indefinitely until 80 % of competitors overseas had implemented “ carbon abatement measures ” .
This massive increase in compensation will cost several billions dollars and negate what little effect the CPRS might have had on sending price signals to Australia ’s biggest polluters .
However , the Coalition has left the way open for a deal with the Government on power generation , saying it remains committed to an intensity - based approach – meaning coal - fired generators would only be forced to buy permits above a best - practice energy efficiency level – but accepting the possibility of an alternative approach from the Government to cushion the impact of electricity price rises on small business .
The Coalition also wants to triple compensation to electricity generators to $ 10 b over 15 years , versus $ 3.6 b over five years under the CPRS .
It also supports an unspecified “ voluntary offset market ” to enable individual voluntary action to count towards carbon reduction targets .
The Government is likely to be inclined to seriously consider that , and the removal of agriculture from the CPRS , and a deal on coal mine emissions .
Assistance for small business of some kind can probably be agreed .
The truly massive increase in compensation , however , is likely to be a major stumbling block .
Well is just as well , because if the Government readily agreed to the package , it would lead to the next stage of the conflict between Turnbull and his internal opponents on the issue .
___________________________________________________________
COALITION CPRS AMENDMENTS
Trade Exposed Industries
Amend the CPRS to provide a single level of assistance for emissions intensive trade exposed ( EITE ) industries at 94.5 per cent until 2015 and 90 per cent thereafter .
Lower the threshold for assistance from the CPRS proposal of 1000 tonnes of CO 2 per $ 1 million of revenue to 850 tonnes of CO 2 per $ 1 million .
per $ 1 million of revenue to 850 tonnes of CO per $ 1 million .
Continue to provide assistance to Australian EITE industries at 90 per cent until 80 per cent of their international competitors have also implemented carbon abatement measures .
Include primary food processing such as dairy and meat in the EITE scheme .
Allow industries that include a series of sequential or parallel production processes to have these assessed as a single activity in determining assistance .
Agriculture
Permanently exclude agricultural emissions from the CPRS .
Obtain Government agreement to introduction of an agricultural offset scheme in line with similar offset schemes to be introduced in comparable economies such as the US and EU .
Coal Mine Emissions
Exclude coal mine fugitive emissions from the CPRS .
Provide the Minister with authority to use regulation to control fugitive emissions with the objective of achieving a 30 per cent reduction by 2025 as technology and international best practice allow .
Lower Electricity Prices
The Coalition will continue to advocate an intensity - based cap - and - trade model for generators .
This delivers the same emissions cuts as the CPRS but with a much smaller increase in electricity prices .
This would greatly reduce the burden on small and mid-sized businesses , which receive no compensation for higher power bills under Labor ’s proposals .
Under the CPRS retail electricity prices will rise by close to 20 per cent in the first two years .
Under an intensity approach , retail electricity prices would rise by less than 5 per cent in the first two years .
If the Government continues to refuse to consider the intensity model , the Coalition will negotiate for an alternative approach to cushion near - term electricity price increases for small businesses .
Compensation for Electricity Generators
Coal - fired generators must be better compensated for loss of value they experience from the CPRS , to ensure security of electricity supply and enable them to transition to lower emission energy sources .
The CPRS offers coal - fired generators 130 million permits over five years worth $ 3.6 billion .
Yet three respected private sector analysts estimate their losses at $ 9 – $ 11 billion .
Assistance should be increased to 390 million permits over 15 years ( or about $ 10 billion ) .
Assistance should be allocated to all generators in proportion to the losses they suffer .
In the absence of access to the Government ’s secret Morgan Stanley report , this represents the Coalition ’s best estimate of appropriate generator compensation given the available data .
Energy Efficiency and Voluntary Action
The Coalition will negotiate for a national “ white certificate ” energy efficiency scheme so households and businesses earn credits for efficiency measures , and contribute to reducing national emissions .
Likewise , the Coalition supports creation of a voluntary offset market in advance of the introduction of the CPRS , and amending the CPRS to ensure voluntary abatement leads to a lower national level of emissions .

The “ Martyrdom ” perk was something of a sore spot for at least a few Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare players .
Allowing for a live grenade to be dropped upon being killed , the perk annihilates any aggressor near the perk - holder ’s corpse .
It sounds cheesy , and it is for the most part .
Aware of the reception of the perk , it appears as if it may have been tweaked or refined in Infinity Ward ’s follow - up to the shooter , Modern Warfare 2 .
Chatting it up with VideoGamer , lead character artist for the title Joel Emslie said , " We are very , very aware of the community and what they like and do n't like , and Martyrdom has caught our attention . ”
He added , “ I 'm happy with how the game is . ”
" It 's [ Martyrdom ] treated differently .
And I will say this -- it fits in perfectly . "
Sounds like something is afoot , for sure .
But as Emslie noted when first approached , the perk was n’t in the beta , therefore he could n’t discuss it beyond that bit of information .
We ’re left wondering with twitchy fingers .

Improve Your Entry - Level Resume
Writing an entry - level resume can be a snap , even when you have only a little work experience under your belt .
The trick is to make a lot out of a little by emphasizing your unique abilities .
These 5 tips will help your entry - level resume stand up to scrutiny and stand out from the pack !
1. Maximize your experience .
It ’s effortless and looks streamlined , but listing only your previous employers and job titles on your resume can leave potential employers not only unimpressed , but also wondering what exactly you did .
Add two or three bullet points for each position , detailing a few of your primary ( and most impressive ) responsibilities in the order that they apply to the position you ’re seeking .
To make these positions really pop , use strong adjectives like “ implemented , ” “ created ” and “ maintained ” to describe just how instrumental you were in your previous positions .
You can also include volunteer work on your resume if it shows necessary skills .
You ’ll expand your credentials while also tailoring your experience to fit the job .
And if you happened to volunteer abroad , make sure you highlight that fact as future employers are keen to recruit new hires with international backgrounds .
2 . Show your range .
Employers know you are more than just the jobs you ’ve had .
“ Past experiences ” on your resume can include more than just previous jobs .
Detailing your proficiency in a foreign language from studying abroad or specific computer programs can add a lot of value to your resume .
Even highlighting unrelated but important extracurricular activities can reflect your commitment to a goal — plus , you never know when an employer might bond with you over a shared love of water - skiing !
3 . Use their language .
Incorporating words or phrases from a job listing into your resume is a great way to catch prospective employers ’ eyes .
If they ’re looking for a “ hard - working team player , ” you might mention in your resume that you thrive in “ team ” environments and throw yourself into “ hard work . ”
You ’ll leave your employers musing that they could n’t have said it better themselves .
4. Provide references – even if you are n’t asked .
For job - seekers with little work experience , references can be a huge asset to any entry - level resume .
References can attest to your dedication and drive , even if you have n’t had many chances to prove your abilities in a work environment .
Even if references are n’t required in your application , why leave them out ?
Consider including two or three references on your resume .
It ’s an added convenience , and proves you have people ready to vouch for your skills .
5 . Sell yourself !
When writing an entry - level resume , you might not have the experience that other positions require , but you do n’t have to apologize or sell yourself short .
Even if you can list only a couple of past accomplishments , you can describe the skills you ’ll bring to future positions .
The back - and - forth battle between Palm and Apple continues , as the Pre 's webOS has been updated to once again sync with iTunes , in spite of a USB - IF statement against the practice .
Palm announced Saturday that webOS 1.2.1 was released , and Sprint customers will receive the update automatically , over the air .
It re-enables Palm media sync to work with iTunes 9 , and also addresses problems syncing EAS e-mail .
Earlier this week , Palm released webOS 1.2 which featured a number of fixes , but did not re-enable sync with iTunes 9 .
Earlier in September , when Apple released iTunes 9 , it disabled the ability of the Palm Pre to synchronize media with the software .
When sync worked in previous iterations , the Pre identified itself as an Apple iPod via USB .
That tactic was frowned upon by the USB Implementers Forum .
Weeks ago , the USB - IF issued a letter in response to a petition from Palm over its dispute with Apple .
The non-profit organization that sets standards for the Universal Serial Bus sided with Apple , noting that Palm 's tactic of improperly identifying the Pre as an iPod was in violation of the forum 's policies .
The forum also said that Apple 's practice of limiting first - party devices to sync with iTunes was within the rules .
The full list of fixes in webOS 1.2.1 , according to Palm , is as follows :

The record industry will be reduced to a smouldering ruin , the album replaced by endless individual songs and music rendered pretty much worthless by the fact that it 's universally free .
Empty record shops will be overrun with weeds and old CDs will be used as coasters .
Your Madonnas , U2s and Coldplays will prosper , but for anyone further down the hierarchy , the idea of making much of a living will be a non-starter .
That 's the accepted wisdom , at least .
Some of it will probably prove to be true .
But that grisly picture ignores subtler and more fascinating changes in our relationship with music that people have barely begun to understand .
Fans can instantly discover the Rolling Stones ' 1980s works , if they want to Now , just to make this clear from the off : I 'm nearly 40 .
Having recently moved house and consigned my CD collection to cardboard boxes , I 've been surprised to find that I do n't miss it at all .
I use the free version of the music streaming application Spotify almost every day - and I now understand that it represents a genuine revolution in music consumption ( and makes iTunes look pathetically old - fashioned ) .
Should the music industry finally get its act together and insist on some kind of subscription model , I 'll pay for the same kind of service .
But I would n't imagine that will alter my new listening habits .
All that said , my musical mindset is still rooted in an increasingly far - off past , where to be a true fan of a band took real dedication , access to obscure information - and , frankly , money .
I 've just poured the music - related contents of my brain into a book , and I would imagine that 30 - ish year 's worth of knowledge about everyone from Funkadelic to The Smiths has probably cost me a five - figure sum , a stupid amount spent on music publications , and endless embarrassed moments spent trying to have a conversation with those arrogant blokes who tend to work in record shops .
Last weekend , by contrast , I had a long chat about music with the 16 - year - old son of a friend , and my mind boggled .
What to listen to next : Little Richard or La Roux ?
At virtually no cost , in precious little time and with zero embarrassment , he had become an expert on all kinds of artists , from English singer - songwriters like Nick Drake and John Martyn to such American indie-rock titans as Pavement and Dinosaur Jr. Though only a sixth - former , he seemingly knew as much about most of these people as any music writer .
Like any rock - oriented youth , his appetite for music is endless , and so is the opportunity - whether illegally or not - to indulge it .
He is a paid - up fan of bands it took me until I was 30 to even discover - and at this rate , by the time he hits his 20s , he 'll have reached the true musical outer limits .
What does all this tell us ?
Clearly , for anyone raised in the old world , the modern way of music consumption has all kinds of unforeseen benefits .
A good example : though I 've always heard plenty of talk about the utter awfulness of such infamous albums as Lou Reed 's Metal Machine Music ( a double album of guitar feedback and white noise ) or Deep Purple 's Concerto For Group And Orchestra ( do n't ask ) , I can now listen to them for nothing , and have an opinion of my own .
As one of my music press colleagues use to say , there 's no longer any past - just an endless present
They 're both terrible , incidentally , but that is n't the point .
What really matters is the fact that I can so easily tune in - and what that says about a new world of completely risk - free listening .
Most importantly , as the great digital revolution rolls on , bands are no longer having to compete for people 's money .
Instead , they 're jockeying for our time .
And the field is huge , crossing not just genres , but eras .
Who do you want to investigate today : TV On The Radio or Crosby , Stills and Nash ?
Do you fancy losing yourself in the brilliant first album by Florence And The Machine , or deriving no end of entertainment from how awful The Rolling Stones got in the 1980s ?
Little Richard or La Roux ?
White Lies or Black Sabbath ?
As one of my music press colleagues use to say , there 's no longer any past - just an endless present .
U2's last album may have been a " grower " - but not many let it grow For musicians , it 's self - evident that there are all kinds of new openings for their music , but even if they break through , much less concerted attention will be paid to it .
They may get an audience , but it will be very easily distracted .
After all , endlessly playing the same album so as to extract your " money 's worth " is behaviour that will soon seem like something from the dark ages .
Woe betide the act that decides to make the kind of record that tends to be charitably described as a " grower " - something that may account for , say , the scant interest paid to the last U2 album .
Certainly , as a record company MD told me a couple of weeks ago , stuffing your albums with mere filler is no longer a sensible option .
So , yes , the record industry may yet have to comprehensively reinvent itself , or implode .
Sooner or later , given that the need to read reviews before deciding what to listen to is fading fast , I rather fear that even music journalists may be rendered irrelevant .
But for now , this is a truly golden age - the era of the teenage expert , albums that will soon have to be full of finely - honed hits and the completely infinite online jukebox .
Even if the music business manages to somehow crack down on illicit downloading and claws back a few quid via annual subscriptions in return for that self - same endless supply of music , the same essential rules will apply .
Really : what 's not to like ?

The bombs went off near the Baghdad governorate headquarters and the ministry of justice
By Gabriel Gatehouse
BBC News , Baghdad
The arrest of more than 60 members of the Iraqi security forces in connection with the double suicide bombing in Baghdad has reinforced what many in Iraq already suspect - that the police and the army are open to pressure and infiltration .
Security officials in Baghdad said the detainees included the commanders of 15 checkpoints around the site of the blasts .
Some of those being questioned are senior officers .
The blasts took place in the administrative centre of the Iraqi capital , notionally one of the most highly protected areas in the country .
The question is : how did two car - bombs of such magnitude slip through the security cordon .
Sunday 's attack was one of the deadliest in Iraq since the 2003 invasion .
But it is not the first time this year that government buildings have been hit .
We have concrete evidence the same people carried out the August bombing .
Hoshyar Zebari , Iraqi Foreign Minister
On 19 August 2009 , two truck bombs targeting the Foreign and Finance Ministries killed nearly 100 people .
The Iraqi government is compiling a dossier to present to the United Nations , which it says includes evidence of Syria 's role in supporting and providing refuge to the Saddam Hussein loyalists and members of al - Qaeda that they suspect are behind the attacks .
Syria has denied the accusation , but Iraq 's Foreign Minister says he is in no doubt .
" We have very solid , concrete evidence , " Hoshyar Zebari told the BBC .
" The same people , the same networks that carried out the August bombing , it is the same perpetrators who carried out the Sunday 25th ( October ) bombing . "
The attacks raise serious questions now about the Pentagon 's timetable for withdrawal .
The US force in Iraq is still 120,000 strong .
But the current plan foresees all combat troops leaving the country by the end of August next year , in preparation for a full military withdrawal by the end of 2011 .
" We are committed to the timetable of the withdrawal , " Mr Zebari said .
" But we need to maintain a reasonable level of security and stability .
Otherwise it may impact on their withdrawal plans , they could be modified . "
The Foreign Minister called for more engagement from the US in the aftermath of the attacks , nearly four months after US forces handed over control of security in urban areas to Iraqi forces .
" The Americans can not just wash their hands and say we are no longer engaged or interested , " he said .
" From now until 2011 I think Iraq is going through some very serious challenges .
Iraq is not yesterday 's story .
It is today 's story , for everybody . "

There will come a point where so many atheist candidates are running for public office that we wo n’t be able to keep up with all of them .
We ’re not there yet .
Cecil Bothwell is running for a seat on the City Council in Asheville , North Carolina .
He ’s described as a “ writer , environmentalist , builder , war protestor , gadfly ” … and atheist .
As a journalist , Bothwell often focused on former Buncombe County Sheriff Bobby Medford , and takes much credit for Medford ’s prosecution as part of an illegal gambling ring .
Writings on Medford led to death threats , Bothwell said , and the stuff of one book .
In another book , “ The Prince of War , ” he targets Graham , saying the world - famous evangelist from Montreat was using access to U.S. presidents to push a theocratic agenda .
Bothwell ’s political opponents fired back with a mailed - out flier pointing to statements Bothwell made about his own atheism .
Bothwell said they ’re not wrong .
His spiritual beliefs focus on “ the golden rule ” as opposed to a deity , he said .
As for the mailer , he said it ’s helped book sales .
“ My campaign is offering either of the two books … for a donation of 25 bucks .
We ’re throwing the books at them . ”
What “ mailed - out flier ” are they talking about ?
Check it out — it ’s fantastic :
To quote Bothwell ’s own writing :
“ I suppose that I should also acknowledge that I will find myself labeled as Satan ’s helper , instrument , vehicle and a whole lot more upon publication of this work .
So , for the record , I do n’t believe in supernatural beings of any stripe …
It seems to me that belief in gods has caused a whole lot more problems than it has solved …
I do n’t believe in any of the religious stories of the origin of the universe and I do n’t look to priests for my moral answers . ”
That attack mailer was paid for out by “ Common Sense in government , Cecil Cantrell , Treasurer . ”
I ’m not sure who that is , but the mailer is backfiring .
Ironically , it ends with this lovely quotation :
We need levelheaded common sense leaders on city council , not a radical extremist .
Which is why we should be supporting atheist candidates who have a strong , progressive agenda .
I do n’t know whether Bothwell is the best candidate or not in this race , but a look at his platform suggests he is a levelheaded , common sense sort of guy .
I would n’t vote for him only because of his atheism , but you have to admire any atheist who is willing to run for public office without shying away from that label .
Bothwell ’s response about following the “ Golden Rule ” is precisely what we ought to be hearing from future atheist candidates — not a denial of their atheism , but the idea that they can indeed be good without a god .
It ’s not too late to donate to his campaign .
The election is only days away …

The defense and security company QintetiQ has developed a range of firefighting robots .
It has been testing them in England .
Last week one of the robots was taken to a live incident at Membury Airfield to assess a situation involving gas canisters .
The firefighting robots will be particularly useful in potentially explosive situations .
A two year contract is being made between QinetiQ and the London Fire Brigade .
I wonder if the QinetiQ robots will be at all like the firefighting bots from Segway ?

Ophir is in trouble .
The tiny town south of Telluride is scrambling to keep from going broke .
Solvency may lie in an old greenhouse next to town hall .
Townsfolk will decide Oct. 20 whether to study the possibility of becoming Colorado ’s first municipality to grow medical marijuana .
As proposed , Ophir would use the profits from a town - owned pot dispensary to make up for lost tax revenues .
“ When half your budget disappears overnight , you think about getting creative , ” says town manager Jason Wells who , as it happens , knows a thing or two about growing pot .
Ophir sits in a stunning canyon east of the scenic byway between Telluride ’s ski mountain and Rico .
It was incorporated as a mining town in 1881 , but mostly abandoned by the 1950s after several avalanches .
Now a bunch of young professionals have settled in , intent on raising their families in a quiet valley with no car alarms or traffic .
They keep their doors unlocked and keys in their cars .
The most pressing call made to the San Miguel County Sheriff ’s Office this year involved a leak found in a propane tank .
Winters , families sled through the avalanche field separating East Ophir from West Ophir .
Summers , kids leave their dirt bikes in the park after being called in for bedtime .
For a certain type of backcountry - loving , compost - saving , public radio- listening folks , the town is nirvana .
It ’s the kind of place that just might be perfect to run a humble little pot dispensary .
You know , strictly for medicinal use .
“ It might get us through hard times in a liberal town , ” Mayor Randy Barnes says .
“ But I do n’t want to target our community as being crazy . ”
Ophir relies on real estate transfer taxes for about half its $ 206,351 budget .
Those revenues froze since the economy crashed and homes stopped selling .
In November , voters will consider a steep mill levy to steady the town ’s budget .
If it fails , the town will need another way to replenish the $ 40,000 drained from reserves this year .
That ’s why Sue Beresford started eyeing the old greenhouse as it ’s being renovated by a local group for the purpose of growing vegetables .
“ I ’m thinking forget the veggies , let ’s do a dispensary , ” says Beresford , one of the most - active participants in a town that ’s run by a general assembly in which any adult who shows up may vote in monthly meetings .
Beresford , 78 , serves as the planning and zoning chairwoman .
She does n’t use pot .
But as she sees it , Ophir should be able to profit from Colorado ’s medical marijuana boom just like private growers , dispensaries and so - called caregivers .
Going into the pot business would bring big changes to a community that has no commercial enterprises .
The closest Ophir comes to a business is the tiny post office that sits just outside the town limits .
The postmistress uses an outhouse across the street that she has to shovel her way into during snowstorms .
A greenhouse and dispensary might require changing the city ’s zoning code and installing security measures that could crimp Ophir ’s laid - back lifestyle .
Traffic also could increase , especially near the greenhouse , which sits next to the playground .
In the absence of opinion polling of Ophir ’s 163 residents ( plus 30 dogs and 15 cats , as the town sign boasts ) , there ’s no telling whether residents will go for the plan .
There ’s also no telling how law enforcers might react should it pass .
It would be a risk .
Just liking living in an avalanche zone .

Petrenko's trick is to increase the electrical resistance in cables , something engineers usually avoid because it causes lines to lose energy as heat .
Attached to each end of a line , his device switches the wires inside from a standard parallel layout to a series circuit .
In normal conditions , the cable works like a standard power line , but flipping the line to series increases resistance , and the wires generate enough heat to shed the ice .
The process takes 30 seconds to three minutes and saps less than 1 percent of the electricity running through the lines .
Utility companies could switch the lines remotely , and Petrenko says swapping in his cables would cost less than repairing ice damage .
I was not much of a conspiracy theorist until 1995 when I met a microbiologist / md doctor hired by congress in 1990 to research aids and present his findings to a comittee .
I met him at a gathering of patriots on the national mall .
To make a long technical story short , he found out that a defense contractor with headquarters in falls church , va had registered samples of the antibodies - thus they had the aids virus , five years prior to any known infection .
It was by no means a natural mutation from a wild primate but a bio-weapon created in a lab around 1970 .
This doctor had given up his career and was screaming from a mountain top that our govt .
Had created and released in africa , a virus intended to kill undesirables - IV drug users and casual sex participants .
He had written a book and presented his findings in a fashion befitting a peer reviewed medical journal .
He said he was dismissed as a crack pot on the hill .
For those of you too young to remember , the " population explosion " was the global warming of the early 70's .
It was all over pop culture , in the schools and media .
Something had to be done and apparently somebody did .
Africa was not chosen by accident .
I wish I had purchased his book or even remembered his name .
At the time , I was so shocked by the implication that the government I thought was there to help us , saw us as a growing threat to the survival of the planet .
I think the aids virus did n't do nearly the job it was intended for .
I believe the new manufactured H1N1 virus is the second act in a diabolical plan to cull the herd and maintain a reasonably easy population to control .
The odds of the H1N1 virus naturally occuring is astronomical .
It is a weapon intended to cull you and your family .
DON'T TAKE THE SHOT .
The average cost per month is calculated per 51,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan , but that number likely will increase with the 68,000 troops the Obama administration is planning on having in that country .

Back in April , a Vanity Fair story about Iceland ’s remarkable financial blow up was grist for a Vanity Fair story by Michael Lewis , “ Wall Street on the Tundra “ .
The quick version is that Icelandic men were not merely reckless , that is such a common male pathology as to barely warrant mention , but were possessed of a particular fondness for physical aggression and bullheadedness that helped made Iceland ground zero for the most spectacular banking industry boom and bust in the history of man .
Iceland managed to go on a debt party that saw its obligations soar to 850 % of GDP , leaving America at a mere 350 % firmly in the dust .
So how is Iceland faring now ?
One would assume still broke and chastened .
One would be dead wrong .
The krona is down 50 % from its peak , and it seems to have sparked a speedy revival .
I remarked when Iceland fell apart that someone should swoop in and buy a business that sold strictly in international markets ( I had thought fish oil would be a good candidate ) .
But that takes time , legwork , and walking around money .
This is the same remedy that the Nordic countries used in their banking crises , save they nationalized the banks , put in new management , cleaned them up , and reprivatized them , But they also devalued their currencies versus the ECU .
But Iceland and the Nordic countries can make move like that without precipitating competitive devaluations .
What works individually does not work collectively .
The EU bashing is a bit heavy handed , but the general comments are nevertheless useful
BTW , reader Richard Kiine is in Iceland now , perhaps he can give a report when he returns .
From Ambrose Evans - Pritchard at the Telegraph :
Forty - five years ago this month , the United States signed a piece of legislation to ' protect and preserve America 's wilderness heritage in perpetuity ' .
On 3 September , when the Wilderness Act was passed , 9.1 m acres of America was designated as wilderness .
Today , there are 756 wilderness areas covering nearly 110 m acres in 44 states and Puerto Rico - nearly 5 % of America 's total land area .
To celebrate these habitats and the anniversary of the act , the Wilderness Society asked its members to submit their best images to a photography competition .

Silvio Berlusconi , durante una conferenza stampa a Sofia con il premier bulgaro , Boiko Borisov , torna a commentare il suo difficile rapporto con le stampa e con le critiche che gli vengono rivolte .
" Se la critica dei media - spiega il Cavaliere - resta nel confine della moderazione è utile perché si può usare per colmare le mancanze , se supera certi livelli e diventa calunnia non fa piacere ed è un boomerang per chi le fa .
Se è eccessiva e calunniosa alla fine avvicina la gente a chi è calunniato " .
Comunque , nonostante gli attacchi , il Cavaliere non nasconde l'ottimismo .
E sbandiera i consueti sondaggi : " Il mio gradimento in questo momento è Al 68,7 % " .
Nessun problema , giura il premier , all ' interno della coalizione .
Il rapporto è " ottimo " e " l'alleanza è solida " perché è basata sulla " condivisione di valori , programmi e dalla preoccupazione ad una opposizione come quella che ci troviamo in Italia .
Andiamo avanti " .
Parole pronunciate all ' indomani della cena con il leader della Lega , Umberto Bossi , e dopo il pranzo con il cofondatore del Pdl , Gianfranco Fini ..
Il faccia a faccia tra Berlusconi e Fini è servito ai due leader per fissare alcuni punti fermi .
Come l'accordo sul Veneto , dove il via libera di Fini , Bossi e Berlusconi a un candidato del Carroccio sembra una certezza .
Si delinea il quadro delle candidature anche nelle altre regioni .
Il Piemonte dovrebbe essere assegnato al Pdl e il nome più accreditato è quello di Guido Crosetto , sottosegretario alla Difesa .
In Liguria potrebbe correre , a sorpresa , un esponente della Lega .
Altrimenti , per il Carroccio potrebbe esserci l'Emilia Romagna .
Il punto più delicato resta la scelta dei candidati per Lazio e Campania .
Una delle due regioni spetterà a un ' finiano ' e fino a sera si rincorrono le voci .
Se dovesse essere il Lazio , allora spetterebbe a Renata Polverini .
Ma per alcuni , Fini pensa alla Campania .

Alla presenza di Giulia Bongiorno e Nicolò Ghedini , Fini e Berlusconi hanno spaziato per quasi un 'ora su uno dei temi più delicati dell ' agenda di governo .
Ottenuta la rassicurazione del premier sul fatto che i pm non saranno sottoposti al controllo dell ' esecutivo , i quattro hanno concordato sulla necessità di avviare un percorso di riforma , senza escludere l'ipotesi di separare le carriere dei magistrati .

Centrist Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) suggested that Congress may not vote on healthcare legislation before lawmakers leave Washington for Christmas .
Democratic leaders are pushing to complete healthcare reform legislation before year 's end but key issues in the legislation have yet to be hashed out , such as the inclusion of a controversial public health insurance option .
Democrats have courted Snowe for her support on the bill .
She could become a crucial vote should Senate Democrats fail to attract the 60 votes necessary on their side to invoke cloture .
" Well , Christmas might be too soon , " Snowe told Bloomberg 's Al Hunt in an interview that will air throughout the weekend .
" Well , you know , there 's always that possibility .
I know that 's not what the president prefers . "
Snowe refused to say that such a delay was likely , but added that " nothing would surprise me because of the complexity [ of the issue ] . "
She said that a vote would likely not come much before Christmas should it be held before recess .
She stressed the need to give the bill " the time it deserves , " something she has routinely said during negotiations .
" [ The American people ] do n't want it put on a fast track .
They want us to give it the thought it needs and requires , and that 's why I 've tried to slow the process down , " she said .
Attracting Snowe 's support has become an intricate dance for top Democrats , who prefer to make the bill a bipartisan effort .
Snowe has said she opposes a public option favored by liberals but would support a " trigger " that would enact a public plan should insurance companies fail to meet certain guidelines .
She added this weekend that she opposes a state based public option from which individual states could opt - out , but said she would not characterize it as a " deal breaker . "
Snowe , who voted for the Senate Finance Committee 's bill , said she has met with key Democrats on the issue , such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , Finance chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , and Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb . )
She added that her Maine counterpart Sen. Susan Collins ( R ) has been included in meetings with centrist senators on the topic .

Recently , I wrote of " the ' counterinsurgency doctrine ' so beloved by the Pentagon and eagerly embraced by Barack Obama . "
A reader took me to task for this inflammatory remark , saying :
That ' eagerly embraced ' statement is certainly hard to square with the Pentagon 's annoyance and Cheney 's charge of dithering .
Its inaccuracy suggests either deliberate inaccuracy or judgment clouded by emotion , but either way it is n't good .
To which , this brief reply :
I realize that historical memory has always been a rare commodity in the United States , but one shudders to see that the onset of this chronic amnesia is now down to the merest months .
Was it not just six months ago , in May 2009 , that Obama made a great show of firing the commander in Afghanistan , General David McKiernan , and replacing him with a much - lauded " expert " in counterinsurgency , Gen. Stanley McChrystal -- a close associate of the much - lauded " architect " of counterinsurgency in Iraq , General David Petraeus -- the Bush - appointed officer whom Obama has retained as the top dog in the central fronts of the Terror War ?
Was not McChrystal championed by Robert Gates -- the Bush - appointed factotum whom Obama has retained as the top dog in the Pentagon war machine ?
The fact that Obama has not yet signed off on McChrystal 's latest plan does not mean that he is not now , before our very eyes , promulgating the Pentagon 's time - honored bleed - build - rinse - repeat philosophy of occupation warfare .
He has already launched one major Petraeus - style " surge " in Afghanistan this year ; the current controversy about the McChrystal plan is confined to how many more troops to send , and how far the vastly stupid and dangerous American war in Pakistan should be escalated .
Obama has already explicitly ruled out withdrawing from Afghanistan ; that 's " not an option , " as his mouthpiece put it just a few weeks ago .
So what 's left ?
Only some form of continued " counterinsurgency . "
And so what if the Pentagon is " annoyed " with Obama , or if Dick Cheney is critical of the faction that ousted his faction from power ?
Do you think that factions in regimes of every stripe do n't have very fierce and nasty internal battles , even when they embrace the same general philosophy ?
Ever read any history of the inner workings of Nazi regime , or the Bolsheviks , or the Roman Empire -- or Lincoln 's cabinet ?
Of course , one can always base one 's conclusions on headlines in the NY Times : " Pentagon Annoyed at Not Immediately Getting Its Own Way ! " or even -- gasp ! -- " Cheney Slams Obama ! "
If these " Dog Bites Man , Sun Rises in the East " kind of stories inform your worldview , then more power to you .
Personally , I do n't get much out of them .
[ For a brilliant dissection of the kind of threadbare vacuity that lies behind most " expert " analyses in the Times , see Arthur Silber 's latest :
The Empty Establishment : No One 's Home in an Intellectual Wasteland . ]
As for the particular criticisms on offer , I have to say that sniffy insinuations of " deliberate inaccuracy " are very far off the mark .
Not that I 've never been inaccurate , of course , if led astray by some erroneous source material , or by my own lack of insight or understanding in considering a particular situation .
But I have never knowingly distorted or falsified a fact in order to support an argument or assertion .
And in any case , as noted above , it is no way inaccurate to say that Barack Obama has eagerly embraced the " COIN " doctrine of Petraeus , which has been so blindly feted by the bipartisan elite of our political and media establishments – even though it is merely a regurgitation of similarly debased , and unsuccessful , COIN operations in times past .
And as for judgments " clouded with emotion , " let me say , in all candor , that I honestly do n't give one good goddamn whether someone thinks my writing on this issue is " clouded by emotion " or not .
I mean , Jesus Herbert Walker Christ , we are talking about arms and legs and heads being ripped from the bodies of women and children -- actual human beings , being slaughtered in our names , day after day .
And for what purpose ?
Every ill and evil that the war purports to address is actually made worse by our violent occupation .
Eight years down , and the Taliban is stronger , Pakistan is far more unstable , thousands more civilians have been killed , religious extremism in the region is stronger than ever , the opium trade is more virulent and more devastating , brutal warlords rule with impunity … the list goes on and on .
And all we are being offered by our new " progressive " administration is more of the same .
So yes , when I write about this atrocious and obscene situation , there is a bit of " emotion " in it .
And I guess you 're right : such a thing " is n't good " -- if what you want is to be taken " seriously " by the oh - so - serious , in that world where portentous headlines form the thrice - chewed cud of " conventional wisdom , " But I do n't give a damn about that , not in the slightest .
I write about these things for one reason only : to bear witness , to put down for the record that I saw the evil being committed in my name , and that I spoke out against it , as fully and honestly as I knew how .
That 's it .
That 's all I want to do .
For whatever reason , I feel compelled to give this testimony -- and it really does n't matter to me what anyone else makes of it .
If they find it useful in some way , I 'm very glad ; if they do n't , so what ?
I 'm not saying there are n't many other worthy and effective approaches to confronting the horrific reality of our day -- including , yes , writing dispassionate analyses , or striving to couch your dissent in a form that might get a hearing amongst the cud-chewers who control our national discourse .
I 've done both in my day .
I may do so again .
But that 's not what I 'm doing here .
In any event , to believe that emotion does not infuse , direct and shape all of our judgments is , I think , deeply ignorant – historically , philosophically and biochemically .
We know that consciousness arises from the unimaginably vast , unimaginably intricate interactions of physical and mental states .
There is no airless , emotionless compartment somewhere inside your mind where you can go to hammer out pure , Platonic , disembodied essences of thought .
The most important question in this regard is not whether or not something is written with emotion , because this is unavoidable .
The real question is whether or not that emotion is an informed one – if it is backed by facts , if it has been subjected to a self - aware analysis , and is not simply a regurgitation of conventional wisdom , shaped by emotions and motives which have been left to lie unconscious and unexplored .
Spend a few years writing about consumer culture , and you might get a little jaded about products or brands with cult followings .
The extreme - loyalist customer always insists that there are perfectly rational reasons for his or her devotion ; to the disinterested observer , the reasons seem dubious .
This is good news for me , because it assures that I have plenty to write about .
But this week , for once , I ’m casting myself in the role not of the reasonable observer but of the dubious product - cultist .
The product is Coca - Cola that is made and bottled in Mexico .
I ’m not the only person who believes that it ’s better : there ’s a Mexican Coke Facebook page with more than 10,000 fans .
“ I am a ( Mexican ) Coke fiend , ” wrote Richard Metzger on the Web site Dangerous Minds this past August .
“ It is SO FREAKING DELICIOUS . ” Mexican Coke is “ a lot more natural tasting , ” another fan recently told a news program in Idaho .
“ A little less harsh , I would say . ”
Mexican Coke cultists of course have a rational explanation : Coca - Cola bottled in Mexico is sweetened with sugar , while the U.S. version is ( almost ) always made with high - fructose corn syrup .
That is so .
And it ’s surprising , given the degree to which uniformity defines the Coke idea .
Who knew the “ secret formula ” could accommodate ingredient variation ?
Andy Warhol once suggested that Coke ’s sameness united us all : “ A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking .
All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good .
Liz Taylor knows it , the president knows it , the bum knows it and you know it . ”

My own induction into this product cult was inadvertent and based on aesthetics .
Some years ago I noticed a glass bottle of Coke for sale , and that was something I had n’t seen in a while .
It looked great ; I enjoyed drinking it immensely .
I did n’t notice the “ No Retornable ” and “ Refresco ” phrases on the 12 - ounce bottle , or the ingredients .
My rational explanation was that Coke tastes better from a glass bottle than from a plastic one or from a can .
It happens that Popular Science examined this very contention on its
Web site not long ago and allowed that as the “ most inert ” material in which the cola is packaged , it ’s possible that glass results in a subtly more “ pure , unaltered ” product than plastic or aluminum .
Of course a commenter on that site promptly chimed in that glass - bottle Coke often comes from Mexico : “ In the United States , Coke is made with CORN SYRUP .
. . .
It ’s disgusting . ”
In my career as a developer , I 've worked in a few organizations ( and survived through my fair share of re-organizations ) but the general pecking order stays the same with regards to IT .
Developers work together and take direction from a Project Lead who is directed by a Team Lead , who answers to a Department Lead who in turn receives orders from a person at the Executive level .
There 's the same thing at Hobson 's work , however , their org chart has a additional ... twist .
You see , within its walls , there is a very special team that is above all others , and they are known as the Server Guys .
Whatever they say goes , and nothing goes above what they say .
They are the ones responsible for the maintenance and support of all of the company 's servers , and they know what 's best .
Like the Men in Black , they are not only above the system , they are the system .
Hobson always had a high level of respect for the folks who keep the machines running around - the - clock , but never quite realized the power they wielded at this company .
That is , until he wrote his first application : a simple , web - based , client - side Java applet .
Server Guys vs. Java Applet
For some time , customers had been asking for a way to query their order statuses from the web instead of having to phone customer service , wait on hold , get out their last invoice with their customer id on it , and so on .
When Hobson developed a short and sweet Java applet to do just that , everybody — including the customer service team who manned the phones — was very , very pleased .
But suddenly , after a week of working just fine on the live site , page requests were returning errors , customers were complaining , and management was getting upset .
The root cause : the applet was gone .
Why ?
The Server Guys had removed the applet from the Production web server as it posed a " serious " security threat .
" Your Java applet generated quite a lot of traffic even when customers were n't querying information , " a department - wide email from them read .
" External users could use this to launch a Denial of Service attack on our website . "
Hobson was stunned .
Users could actually DoS their website with the little applet he made ?
Armed with connection monitors and network sniffers , he set about looking for anything strange , and he discovered one thing that could maybe , possibly be to blame .
After the applet was downloaded , whenever it was be opened , it would send one empty HTTP request of about 200 bytes back to the server when the applet VM called getResourceAsStream .
The browser 's Java plug - in tried to retrieve it from the server first instead of looking at the downloaded applet itself .
Was this the DoS attack ?
Most definitely !
According to the Server Guys , his applet was a " no - go " in Production .
Fortunately — and quite coincidentally — a couple days later , Sun issued a Java that allowed the resource requests to be turned off via a parameter .
After it was proven that the 200 byte extra request was no longer being sent , the Server Guys begrudgingly allowed the applet back into Production with the warning " let 's just hope the users have the newest Java update installed . "
It was n't too long after that that Hobson had his second run-in with the Server Guys .
Server Guys vs. System Architecture
The corporate Production servers have a web service that allows customers to electronically submit order forms using a dedicated order entry application .
Once the order is successfully received , the customer receives an email confirmation their order .
Customers liked this because they knew the instant an order was confirmed and they could store the email for reference later .
Of course , some customers preferred a little paper in their paperless process and requested a printed order acknowledgment be sent via snail mail , just in case they network problems , or the email was accidentally deleted , or their computer was struck by a meteorite .
Wanting to implement the change with as little impact as possible , Hobson 's team decided to redirect the XML that would normally be used to a web service running on a dedicated server running Tomcat that would apply the data to a template and spit back a nice , pretty PDF .
It was a pretty simple architecture , and the development team was confident the Server Guys would approve .
Too much time , too little payout , the Server Guys explained .
Installing things like Tomcat , JBoss , or any other fancy - schmancy Java stuff on a server requires too many resources like processing power , memory , and disk space , and Hobsons 's " pie in the sky " Java pseudo - solution was far too complicated .
This was all despite the fact that the " pseudo - solution " was going to be installed on a server dedicated exclusively to this task .
The Server Guys could , however , allow PHP and maybe a stand - alone Java application to do the XML transformation .
To make things easier for Hobson 's team , they outlined the architecture that they might allow , once they see how it works in production :
Before Hobson could even ask why FTP was necessary , the Server Guys explained : directly writing to the disk of a machine which hosts such an important process ( converting XML to PDF ) is far too dangerous .
Despite the FTP storage backbone , Hobson and team were able to get the PDF transformer module up and running without an issue .
Well , that is until the Server Guys shut it down for being a resource hog : it was consuming over fifty megabytes of memory .
But once that was resolved , everyone was happy : the customers got their new features and the Server Guys continued to protect the company from potential IT diasters .
Ich habe gestern Abend das Bundeskriminalamt angefragt , ob die Zensursula - Verträge mit den großen Providern morgen wie geplant in Kraft treten .
Die Antwort ist mittlerweile da .
1. Wird das BKA im Rahmen der vertraglich zugesicherten Sperren am 17 .
Oktober mit der Aussendung von Filterlisten starten ?
Wenn nein , warum nicht ?
Nein .
Im Lichte des derzeit vor dem Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden anhängigen Verfahrens und des durch eine drohende Negativentscheidung zu befürchtenden Schadens sowohl für die betroffenen Provider als auch für das BKA hat das Bundesministerium des Innern entschieden , nicht in den Wirkbetrieb auf vertraglicher Grundlage zu gehen .
Das Zugangserschwerungsgesetz liegt dem Bundespräsidenten zur Ausfertigung vor .
2. Haben die Ankündigungen einer Einigung der Schwarz - Gelben Koalition vom heutigen Abend irgendwelche Auswirkungen auf das Vorhaben der Zugangserschwerrung mittels Netzsperren ?
Zu dieser Frage verweise ich zuständigkeitshalber an das Bundesministerium des Innern .
Die großen Provider habe ich auch alle angefragt .
Bisher haben aber nur Kabel Deutschland und Vodafone reagiert .
Die Antwort von Kabel Deutschland :
1. Wird Kabel Deutschland die vertraglich zugesicherten Sperren am 17 .
Oktober starten ?
Wenn nein , warum nicht ?
Der derzeitige Planungsstand auf Grundlage des mit dem Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) geschlossenen Vertrages sieht noch vor , dass wir die technische Umsetzung der Sperrungen für Anfang 2010 vorbereiten .
2 . Haben die Ankündigungen einer Einigung der Schwarz - Gelben Koalition vom heutigen Abend irgendwelche Auswirkungen auf das Vorhaben der Zugangserschwerung mittels Netzsperren ?
Welche Auswirkungen auf den Vertrag die Ankündigung der Koalition hat , evaluieren wir gerade .
Grundsätzlich halten wir uns zwar an den mit dem BKA geschlossenen Vertrag .
Sollte die Koalition ihre Ankündigung allerdings in die Tat umsetzen , würde das aus unserer derzeitigen Sicht den Vertrag in dieser Form hinfällig machen .
Die Antwort von Vodafone :
Nach heutigem Sachstand wird die vertraglich fixierte Sperrung von „ Kinderpornoseiten “ morgen nicht umgesetzt werden koennen .
Hier noch einmal in Kürze : – die Politik hat die Bekämpfung von Kinderpornographie als wichtiges Thema adressiert
– Vodafone und andere TK - Unternehmen unterstützen dieses Ziel in der Sache
– Wir waren bereit im Rahmen der rechtlichen Möglichkeiten ( Gesetze und AGB ) die von der BReg geplanten Maßnahmen umzusetzen .
– Akteur war und ist die Politik .
Sie muss den
Weg politisch aufzeigen .
– Wir werden den Vertrag vom April vorerst nicht umsetzen , da die Koalition das Ziel auf anderen Wegen erreichen will .
– An unserer Haltung , dass die Bekämpfung von Kinderpornographie eine wichtige Herausforderung für Politik , Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft ist , ändert sich nichts .
— — — — — – Nach Auskunft des Bundeskriminalamt , wird die Ausführung der Selbstverpflichtung ausgesetzt , bis das Gesetz in Kraft ist bzw .
bleibt zu zsehen , ob es ein neues oder kein Gesetz gibt .
Zitat Dirk Ebrecht ( Vodafone - Sprecher ) : „ Wir haben alle Vorleistungen erbracht , um die Umsetzung unserer Verpflichtungen und damit die Sperrung von Seiten mit kinderpornografischem I nhalt zu gewaehrleisten .
Die eingegangene Selbstverpflichtung liegt jetzt auf Eis , da das BKA keine Sperrlisten liefert . “
Den Bundespräsidenten habe ich auch angeschrieben , wann und ob er das Gesetz unterzeichnen will .
Auch hier habe ich bisher keine Antwort erhalten .
Chanterelle Season | Fermentation Friday Written by admin on September 27 , 2008
My first mushroom beers consisted of Winter Chanterelles on a Belgian base .
I tried different quantities of mushrooms and different methods for getting mushroom in to beer .
For the first beer , I used 0.9 kgs ( 2 lbs ) of Winter Chanterelles soaked the mushrooms in vodka for three weeks .
I then added the vodka to the 23 L ( 6 gal ) batch of beer before bottling .
The final beer was a wonderful Belgian
Ale with some strange yeast - like characteristics that would ( very ) occasionally hit you with the full mushroom aroma .
For the second beer , I used 2.3 kgs ( 5 lbs ) of Winter Chanterelles added directly to the secondary and let it soak for several weeks .
The resulting beer tasted like ( big surprise ) Winter Chanterelles and Belgian Ale .
Here in Vancouver we ’ve had some great mushroom weather over the last two months .
That means it ’s been wet .
So , while I ’m not too happy about the weather , I am happy to be planning some more mushroom beers .
It should be a good year for Chanterelles , Hedgehog Mushrooms , and maybe Matsutakes ( aka Pine Mushrooms ) .
I expect to be able to achieve roughly the same effects as I achieved with Winter Chanterelles using the same proportions of Chanterelles and Hedgehog Mushrooms in my brews .
Chanterelle Beers for This Year
Based on how the cousin - of - yeast flavours blended with the Abbey yeast flavours in the first beer , I ’ll be trying to see how Chanterelles sit on a Belgian Blanche .
I really loved the interplay between yeast and mushroom and want to try different combinations of tasty yeasts with mushrooms .
I will probably try the Blanche with 0.9 kgs ( 2 lbs ) of Chanterelles .
I ’d also like to see how the flavours sit in an even stronger beer than the original 7 % Belgian Ale .
So I ’m planning on making my first Barley Wine .
Based on mostly on style , alcohol tolerance , and past experience I ’d like to try Wyeast ’s London Ale III for this beer .
I also think I ’ll increase the amount of mushrooms so they do n’t get lost in a stronger beer .
I ’ll probably try 1.2 kgs ( 2.7 lbs ) of mushrooms .
Matsutake Beers ( Depending on Availability )
The Matsutake is more strongly flavoured .
I estimate that no more the 0.5 kgs ( 1.1 lbs ) would be necessary , or even appropriate .
I have only cooked with these mushrooms a limited number of times , but their flavour tends to taint everything they are cooked with and disappears if they are overcooked or re-heated .
Based on this , I think the best thing to do is make some mushroom tea and add it to the secondary right before bottling .
I might try a small side - batch with the mushrooms added right at the very end of the boil for comparison .
Using Hedgehog Mushrooms in Beer
I probably wo n’t get around to using Hedgehog Mushrooms this fall .
There are just too many beers that I want to make ( I like standard beer - styles too ) .
Although there are clear differences , there are also a lot of similarities between Chanterelles , Winter Chanterelles , and Hedgehog Mushrooms .
I freely switch between these three types of mushrooms when cooking and can’t really tell the difference unless they are served on their own .
My current set of Belgian Blanches are taking forever to finish fermenting , so I ’ll probably start something that uses London Ale III before doing the Chanterelle beers .

Although my main areas of focus are family law and criminal defense , I do so much more .
I can help with a variety of other problems as well .
If you need help securing your legacy after you die , a lawyer well - versed in estate planning is the best option to make sure all of your belongings are distributed as you please .
Without this , the courts will do it as they see fit without your best interest in mind .
There is far more that I can help you with , but I can only do so if you call me and explain your situation .

[ ' Homer in Silicon ' is a biweekly GameSetWatch - exclusive column by Emily Short .
It looks at storytelling and narrative in games of all flavors , including the casual , indie , and obscurely hobbyist .
This week she looks at Lionhead Studios ' Fable 2 . ]
Fable 2 attempts a hard bit of interactive storytelling : it combines a fairly predetermined plot arc , your character 's quest for justice against the world 's chief villain , with more emergent narrative , in which you are allowed to form friendships and connections — and even marry and bear children with — the people you meet along the way .
At the end , the game tries to draw the two forms of player involvement together , having the villain threaten something or someone that you 've grown close to in sandbox play .
The idea , clearly , is to let the player define for the game what he / she will care about , and then use that as emotional leverage .
This is an ingenious design approach , but it works better in concept than in practice — at least for me .
Two moments in particular stand out where this design let me down :
1. Shortly after the system told me that NPCs would have gifts for me , I met a man .
When I talked to him , I saw the symbol of a ring on the meter of how much he liked me .
I reasoned that this meant , if I made him like me more , he 'd give me a ring .
So I spent a little time with him , doing dances and falling over afterward , because he seemed to get a big kick out of this buffoonery .
I made faces .
I gave him the thumbs - up sign .
I flirted a little , just to butter him up .
But when he'd fallen in love with me and wanted to get married , I was startled and not at all pleased .
I realized what the ring on his meter indicated then , when it was too late and I 'd led him on .
I had no intention to get married , but when he started to follow me around ( a mistake thanks to more confused socialization on my part ) , I let him .
I let him follow me out into the wild , and when we were set upon by bandits I did n't give him a second thought , just assumed he'd look out for himself or have the sense to hide behind a rock .
My dog never got killed , after all .
But then the battle ended and he was n't following me any more .
I actually could n't tell what had just happened : did he run away ?
Or — it seemed more likely — did he fight and die because I was too absent - minded to attend to him ?
I felt guilty about that .
It was the first thing in the game that made me feel like I 'd done something wrong .
Sure , I 'd been arrested for trespassing earlier , a faux pas that cost me some morality points , but it was purely because I was trying to talk to the woman inside the house and thought she 'd warm up to me faster than she did .
This time , I 'd coldbloodedly ignored some guy , toyed with his affections and then led him to his death .
That felt culpable .
I resolved , on my character 's behalf , not to tease anyone else into falling in love with me .
I just did n't have time for it ; not as a hero .
I could n't afford the distraction , and the people themselves were just too preoccupied with everyday activities .
Many hours of play later , I had become more cynical about the minor characters , so I decided to seduce and eventually marry Christopher the Alchemist for his cheap supply of resurrection potions .
And when my character was tricked into taking up a mission that angered some people who turned out to be perfectly innocent , I first tried to placate them with gifts and gold , but when that failed I went ahead and killed them .
They kept following me around and trying to shoot me , and I could n't have that .
The interesting moral arc here , for me , was first the realization that my character could not treat " ordinary " people as her equals and her acceptance of emotional distance from them ; and , later , the decision that she was more important than they were , and therefore it was all right to use them or even if necessary kill a few .
There was no way for me to communicate that to the game , though .
It kept treating me as an almost - pure - good character when in my own opinion I had entered a serious grey zone .
The disparity between the story I thought we were telling and the story the game thought we were telling became even more painfully clear at the end .
The assumption was that I had a husband and a son and that I must love them , and that 's what the game worked with — in , I regret to say , a fairly predictable and melodramatic fashion .
2 . The game 's most painful moment for me was when I witnessed a woman losing her father and then deciding that her chosen life of non-violence was n't such a good idea after all .
My own character had gone through something similar .
I wanted to comfort her , tell her I understood , maybe offer a cynical remark supporting her newfound aggressiveness : yes , the world is like this .
Yes , you might as well stand up for yourself because no one else is going to .
Something .
My character had things to tell hers , but I could n't say them .
Both of these issues come back to communication : communication with the other characters , communication with the game engine .
During cut scenes it 's possible to make a few choices , but these are of course out of a small predetermined range .
The rest of the time , Fable 2's freeform communication options are limited to gestures and expressions of mood rather than anything with declarative content .
Before playing Sims 3
I might have said that was inevitable in a sandbox game .
Now I 'm not so sure .
Sims 3 shows that it 's possible for a game to track the context of even very freeform interactions , and offer conversation options based on the current situation .
Something like that would have gone part of the way to resolving the sensation of muteness throughout Fable 2 , and perhaps made it easier to believe I had some kind of genuine or substantial relationship to the other characters .
But what I really found myself wanting , as a player — and this would have addressed both the missed moments — was a way to mark events that I experienced , to tag them for later retelling and give some indication of what they meant to me .
I wanted to be able to remember the catastrophe with my first , doomed lover .
I wanted to be able to retell that story to other people that I met in the game , and I wanted to be able to determine what its meaning and resonance would be .
Over the course of the game , I wanted to develop an inventory of the events that were most important to me and use them to reveal , explain , and persuade .
I know this would be hellaciously hard to design and implement .
But there is so much about Fable 2 that works brilliantly : the sheer beauty of the environment , the accessible but interesting combat , the relative absence of dull grinding missions , the excellent voice acting , the humor .
The most consistent source of frustration to me was my muteness .
The good / evil and pure / corrupt scales allow the player some range for self - customization , but they are not in the end truly expressive .
They do n't allow much scope for the player to pick out what matters .
Letting the player select the anecdotes that constituted his story would make the sandbox a much more powerful contributor to the narrative .

Brawn GP 's Formula 1 future is poised for a major boost , with Mercedes - Benz close to a deal to take equity in the team .
With the world championship leaders already having secured sponsorship funding for the next few years , as revealed by AUTOSPORT last month , the team 's outlook now looks even better following discussions with the German car manufacturer .
Reports first emerged about the plans this morning in The Daily Telegraph , and sources have confirmed to AUTOSPORT that talks are at an advanced stage for the car company to take a shareholding in the team .
It comes on the back of Mercedes - Benz 's increased profile as a customer engine supplier over the past season - with the team set to provide power - units to McLaren , Force India , Brawn and , perhaps , Red Bull Racing in 2010 .
The move is not , however , an attempt by Mercedes - Benz to move away from its long - standing commitment to partner McLaren - and it is instead believed to be part of the car manufacturer 's attempt to increase its presence in F1 .
A McLaren spokesman told AUTOSPORT that the team had no qualms about Mercedes - Benz 's plans for expanding its involvement with its rivals in the sport .
" Mercedes - Benz 's engine supply contract with McLaren is a very long - standing one - it's in its 15th consecutive year , in fact - and it will continue to run for many years to come , " said the spokesman .
" However , we 're supportive of our partner 's plans regarding engine supply of other teams in Formula 1 , and we were delighted earlier this year that a Mercedes - Benz engine supply deal was able to be done with Brawn , thereby saving that team from likely extinction .
" Force India , too , has blossomed as a result of its engine supply / engineering consultancy collaboration with Mercedes - Benz and McLaren - as Giancarlo Fisichella 's impressive second place in the recent Belgian Grand Prix showed all too clearly .
" Both McLaren and Mercedes - Benz remain extremely satisfied with our Formula 1 collaboration , which has netted three drivers ' world championships and one constructors ' world championship as well as dozens of grand prix victories .
" As ever , we 'll be aiming to add to that win tally together at this weekend 's Italian Grand Prix - although we never under-estimate our opposition and the competition will undoubtedly be tough . "
Mercedes - Benz itself denied that the plan was for a full - blown buyout of Brawn , but did not rule out an equity - type deal .
" It 's our policy not to comment on rumours and we want to point out that we have longstanding contracts with McLaren , " a spokesperson for the company told The Daily Telegraph .
Mercedes - Benz is poised to confirm its engine plans for 2010 at the Italian Grand Prix , although there is fresh uncertainty now surrounding whether or not Red Bull Racing will make the switch from Renault to Mercedes - Benz .
Although the deal had appeared to be all but done in recent weeks , sources suggest that the contract has not yet been signed - and it is not impossible that the team could actually stick with its current partner for another year .
Williams is looking at changing its engine supply deal for next year , having asked Toyota to be released from its contract , and had been expected to switch to Renault .
However , there remains a chance the Grove - based outfit could be in the running for a Mercedes - Benz deal if Red Bull Racing opts not to take it .
A new study by researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry ( IoP ) , King 's College London has discovered abnormalities in the white matter of the brain that seem to be critical for the timing of schizophrenia .
The study , led by Professor Phillip McGuire and Dr Sophia Frangou , has been published in this month 's edition of the British Journal of Psychiatry .
The white matter of the brain consists of nerve fibres that connect parts of the brain and help regulate behaviour .
The normal brain develops in a back to front fashion , i.e. posterior regions mature first and the frontal lobes last .
The research discovered that if there are very severe deficits in the white matter in these posterior ( specifically parietal ) regions , then schizophrenia develops early in adolescence .
As people grow older their deficits " migrate " in a back to front manner and in adulthood , they impact the frontal lobes of the brain quite dramatically .
Schizophrenia is a disabling and emotionally devastating illness that affects about one per cent of the population worldwide .
Professor McGuire , from the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health , South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and IoP comments : ' Although we can trace the origins of schizophrenia to early brain development we still do not know what triggers the onset of the full blown symptoms .
Our study suggests that at least part of the answer lies in problems affecting the " wiring " of key brain areas . '
The team used Diffusion Tensor Imaging , a state - of - the - art neuro - imaging technique , to examine white matter connections in adolescents and adults with schizophrenia .
Abnormalities in white matter appeared first in posterior parts of the brain in the younger patients and became more prominent in the frontal lobes in adult patients .
In interpreting the results , Dr. Kyriakopoulos , the lead author , explained that the scans capture the interaction between brain development and disease mechanisms .
Dr Frangou on the value of this research : ' We believe this study is unique as it approaches schizophrenia research from a new perspective .
It takes a life - long view on schizophrenia and thereby bridges traditional barriers between child and adult patients . '
The study adds new insight to mounting evidence that abnormalities in white matter play a critical role in what turns schizophrenia on and may provide clues to new treatments .

Racing across the universe for the last 7.3 billion years , two gamma-ray photons arrived at NASA 's orbiting Fermi Gamma -ray Space Telescope within nine - tenths of a second of one another .
The dead - heat finish may stoke the fires of debate among physicists over Einstein 's special theory of relativity because one of the photons possessed a million times more energy than the other .
For Einstein 's theory , that 's no problem .
In his vision of the structure of space and time , unified as space - time , all forms of electromagnetic radiation - gamma rays , radio waves , infrared , visible light and X - rays - are reckoned to travel through the vacuum of space at the same speed , no matter how energetic .
But in some of the new theories of gravity , space - time is considered to have a " shifting , frothy structure " when viewed at a scale trillions of times smaller than an electron .
Some of those models predict that such a foamy texture ought to slow down the higher - energy gamma -ray photon relative to the lower energy one .
Clearly , it did not .
Even in the world of high - energy particle physics , where a minute deviation can sometimes make a massive difference , nine - tenths of a second spread over more than 7 billion years is so small that the difference is likely due to the detailed processes of the gamma-ray burst rather than confirming any modification of Einstein 's ideas .
" This measurement eliminates any approach to a new theory of gravity that predicts a strong energy - dependent change in the speed of light , " said Peter Michelson , professor of physics at Stanford University and principal investigator for Fermi's Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) , which detected the gamma-ray photons on May 10 .
" To one part in 100 million billion , these two photons traveled at the same speed .
Einstein still rules . "
Michelson is one of the authors of a paper that details the research , published online Oct. 28 by Nature .
In this illustration , one photon ( purple ) carries a million times the energy of another ( yellow ) .
Some theorists predict travel delays for higher - energy photons , which interact more strongly with the proposed frothy nature of space - time .
Yet Fermi data on two photons from a gamma-ray burst fail to show this effect , eliminating some approaches to a new theory of gravity .

Physicists have yearned for years to develop a unifying theory of how the universe works .
But no one has been able to come up with one that brings all four of the fundamental forces in the universe into one tent .
The Standard Model of particle physics , which was well developed by the end of the 1970s , is considered to have succeeded in unifying three of the four : electromagnetism ; the " strong force " ( which holds nuclei together inside atoms ) ; and the " weak force " ( which is responsible for radioactive decay , among other things . )
But in the Standard Model , gravity has always been the odd man out , never quite fitting in .
Though a host of theories have been advanced , none has been shown successful .
But by the same token , Einstein 's theories of relativity also fail to unify the four forces .
" Physicists would like to replace Einstein 's vision of gravity - as expressed in his relativity theories - with something that handles all fundamental forces , " Michelson said .
" There are many ideas , but few ways to test them . "
The two photons provided rare experimental evidence about the structure of space - time .
Whether the evidence will prove sufficient to settle any debates remains to be seen .
The photons were launched on their pan-galactic marathon during a short gamma-ray burst , an outpouring of radiation likely generated by the collision of two neutron stars , the densest known objects in the universe .
A neutron star is created when a massive star collapses in on itself in an explosion called a supernova .
The neutron star forms in the core as matter is compressed to the point where it is typically about 10 miles in diameter , yet contains more mass than our sun .
When two such dense objects collide , the energy released in a gamma-ray burst can be millions of times brighter than the entire Milky Way , albeit only briefly .
The burst ( designated GRB 090510 ) that sent the two photons on their way lasted 2.1 seconds .

An American company is offering two Su - 27 fighters , for the bargain price of $ 5 million each .
The aircraft are demilitarized , but recently refurbished .
Since the refurbishment , the aircraft have been in the air only 16 hours , and the engines only have 19 hours of use .
The aircraft were purchased , from Ukraine , last year by an American firm ( Tac Air ) , to assist the U.S. Air Force is determining how the Su - 27 performs .
This work is apparently done , and now the Su - 27s are no longer needed .
The electronics are up to date , and qualified maintenance services are available , in Nevada ( where Tac Air is located ) .
The two - seat aircraft was refurbished in Ukraine last year , and received further upgrades and modification in the United States earlier this year .
There are dozens of flyable demilitarized jet fighters owned by American collectors , and the two Su - 27s are expected to sell .
Russia 's Sukhoi aircraft company has sold over a billion dollars worth of these aircraft ( plus components and technical services for them ) a year for the last few years .
Sukhoi mainly supplies Su-27/30 jet fighters to India , China , Malaysia , Venezuela and Algeria .
The 33 ton Su - 27 is similar to the U.S. F - 15 , but costs over a third less .
Developed near the end of the Cold War , the aircraft is one of the best fighters Russia has ever produced .
The government helped keep Sukhoi alive during the 1990s , and even supplied money for development of an improved version of the Su - 27 , which was called the Su-30 .
This proved to be an outstanding aircraft , and is the main one Sukhoi produces .
There are now several Su - 30 variants , and major upgrades .
While only about 700 Su- 27s were produced ( mostly between 1984 , when it entered service , and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 ) , add Su-30 production and you have over 1,000 aircraft ( including license built ones in China and India ) .

Since the prostate antigen screening test ( PSA ) began being widely used about 23 years ago , doctors have lauded its ability to detect prostate cancer at a very early stage .
In fact , PSA testing has resulted in over a million additional men being diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer .
The problem is , according to new research just published online in the , most of these cases were overdiagnosed and subjected men to treatment they did n't need .
For their study , H. Gilbert Welch , M.D. , MPH , of the White River Junction VA and the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice . , and Peter C. Albertsen , M.D. , of the University of Connecticut , studied data from the National Cancer Institute 's Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results program .
They looked at age - specific prostate cancer incidence rates to investigate whether there was an excess or a deficit in the number of American men diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer after PSA screening was introduced in l987 .
The results were clear .
The researchers found that an additional 1.3 million men , especially younger men , had been diagnosed with the malignancy who would never have been found to have prostate cancer without the PSA test .
And over one million of these men have been treated since l986 .
So why is n't this good news if cancers are being found and treated earlier ?
Because over a million of these men who were told they had prostate cancer most likely had no real health problem -- until they started down the path of side - effect laden treatments and became labeled as " cancer patients " .
Even more importantly , as Otis W. Brawley , M.D. , chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society , pointed out in an editorial accompanying the study , there has been little evidence that PSA screening has saved lives .
All it has done is surge the rate of diagnosed prostate cancers upward .
Moreover , Dr. Brawley warned that the highly marketed early - detection message has pushed public opinion toward accepting PSA screening as critically important and necessary for men -- when there 's a lack of good science to back up that belief .
" Prostate cancer screening has resulted in substantial overdiagnosis and in unnecessary treatment .
It may have saved relatively few lives .
Results from this article and recent results from prostate cancer screening and prevention trials demand reflection about what we as a society have done and are doing .
Lessons to be learned have ethical and economic implications and involve our lack of respect for the scientific process and scientific evidence , " Dr. Brawley wrote .
Another new study adds even more evidence that prostate cancer is being overdiagnosed and over treated .
According to research just published in the , many prostate cancer patients , including older men and men with small , low - risk tumors , can safely defer treatment for many years with no adverse consequences at all .
" With the advent of PSA screening nearly 20 years ago , we started to detect prostate cancers at much earlier stages , " researcher Martin Sanda , MD , Director of the Prostate Cancer Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) and associate professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School , said in a statement to the media .
" Consequently , while PSA testing has enabled us to successfully begin aggressive treatment of high - risk cancers at an earlier stage , it has also resulted in the diagnosis of cancers that are so small they pose no near - term danger and possibly no long - term danger .
" Dr. Sanda , along with colleagues from Brigham and Women 's Hospital , the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of California , San Francisco , studied data from the Health Professionals Follow - Up Study , a large cohort study comprising 51,529 men who have been followed since 1986 .
Every two years , the participants respond to questionnaires and list information about diseases and health - related topics , including whether they 've been told they have prostate cancer .
In all , 3,331 men reported receiving a diagnosis of prostate cancer between 1986 and 2007 .
Among this group , about ten percent ( 342 men ) decided to put off having any treatment for one year or longer .
Ten to 15 years later , 50 percent of these men who had initially deferred treatment still had not undergone any prostate cancer treatment .
To find out how this group of men fared in the long - term , the scientists looked at the data after an average of eight years after their initial diagnosis and then compared it with information provided by prostate cancer patients who had decided on going ahead with aggressive treatment , including surgery , radiotherapy or hormonal therapy .
"
We found that the deaths attributed to prostate cancer were very low among the men with low - risk tumors , " Dr. Sanda stated .
" Our analysis showed that only two percent of the men who deferred treatment eventually died of the disease , compared with one percent of the men who began treatment immediately following their diagnosis .
This is not a statistically significant difference .
" According to the press statement , the researchers found that men diagnosed with low - risk tumors who deferred treatment were still doing fine an average of eight years and up to 20 years after their cancer diagnosis .
"
Only half of these men wound up undergoing any treatment 10 to 15 years post - diagnosis .
This means that they were able to avoid the disruption in their quality of life which might have occurred had they undergone immediate treatment , " Dr. Sanda explained in the media statement .

This year will be the 2nd annual “ Stop Taser Torture – Blogging For Justice Day . ”
We want to expand the discussion on the issue of tasering and how the issue threatens us all .
Amnesty International says that between 2001 and August 2008 , 334 Americans died after Taser shocks .
The stun gun was deemed to have caused or contributed to at least 50 of those deaths , Amnesty says , citing medical examiners and coroners .
Most suspects were unarmed , and many were subjected to repeated or prolonged shocks , according to Amnesty .
The human rights group has called for governments to limit the use of stun guns or suspend their use .
In November 2007 , the UN Committee Against Torture released a statement saying “ use of Taser X26 weapons , provoking extreme pain , constituted a form of torture , and … in certain cases , it could also cause death . ”
Join us on December 4th .
“ Stop Taser Torture , blogging for Justice . ” as we raise awareness and trigger a global discussion .

And maybe some bread , ham , cheese , lettuce , tomato and onion ?
Michelangelo's famous painting from the Sistine Chapel shows God giving the gift of life to Adam .
It is important to remember that God is the source of all our gifts : life , food , clothing , and even mustard .
We should take time every day to thank God for the many gifts
He has given to us .
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) on Monday urged the United States to advocate an " overthrow " of embattled Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's regime .
The senator 's suggestion — which he stressed could be done without military force — differs greatly from the tone taken by both White House officials and numerous other lawmakers , who have recently exhorted Iran to offer " immediate and unfettered access " to international inspectors .
" [ T ] he solution , I think , not only lies with an attempt to impose sanctions on Iran ...
I have very serious doubts as to whether Russia and China will be able to cooperate with sanctions that have significant effect on Iran , " McCain told Fox News .
" But I think you left out something , and that is our advocacy for regime change in Iran , " the senator added .
" And I do n't mean through military action , [ but ] by helping , supporting , assisting in a variety of ways , including Internet access and other encouragement of elements within Iran , to overthrow the regime . "
McCain might be the first lawmaker this week to suggest Ahmadinejad 's ouster , but he is hardly the only member of Congress clamoring to punish Iran for its clandestine nuclear program .
Soon after evidence surfaced on Saturday that Iran constructed a secret uranium refinement facility in the city of Qom , lawmakers began demanding a new round of sanctions on Tehran .
Their calls grew more strident just two days later , after Ahmadinejad authorized a series of medium - and long - range missile tests — a move the White House quickly condemned as " provocative . "
Despite this latest diplomatic row , the Obama administration still plans to engage Iran during a meeting of the P5+1 — a coalition of British , Chinese , French , German , Russian and U.S. negotiators — scheduled for Oct.
1 . McCain , however , expressed doubt on Monday that the meeting would do any good .
" The talking that 's going to take place on the first of October , I 'm not optimistic , obviously , " McCain said .
" But I also think we have to sit down and talk turkey to the Russians and the Chinese and try to make them understand that if there is conflict in the Middle East , it 's not in Russia or China 's national security interest either in the long run . "
The only fact the Guardian can report is that the case involves the London solicitors Carter - Ruck , who specialise in suing the media for clients , who include individuals or global corporations .
So this company Carter - Ruck is a litigation firm specializing in media law , international law , and commercial litigation .
Has anyone had experience with this company , or with British free speech law ?
There is so little detail here so far that I hesitate to speculate about what might be going on .
But clearly , someone in Parliament has asked an embarrassing question , or one with a potentially damaging answer .
Also clearly , this sort of government response is creepy and must be resisted with whatever vigor the British people can muster .
As writer Warren Ellis said on his site :
If it comes out that the Government were instrumental in having Carter - Ruck gag a national newspaper from reporting on Parliament , all hell will break loose .
Christ , even if it turns out a single MP actually went out of his or her way to engage a legal firm against free reportage in Parliament ...
Hell better break loose over this .

Thanks to all who've joined the conversation and added to it constructively .
It looks as though the question at issue may be the one leaked onto http://order-order.com/
( Thanks , Scarce ! ) .
This is related to a case involving toxic waste dumped in 2006 in Côte d'Ivoire , in which the Trafigura corporation was named .
It will be interesting to see how all this plays out .
Let 's keep the conversation civil , shall we ?
We 're all interested in freedom of information .
So let 's work together .
Updated again :
Morus has brought to my attention a Twitter campaign to make this story blow up .
Go here for more info .
I do n't , um , tweet , but maybe you all do .
Go to it , Kossacks !
As soon as Jeffrey Immelt , General Electric 's chairman , became chief executive in 2001 , his foreign - based managers began pressing him to move some major operations overseas .
" They 'd say , ' GE will never be really global until you do , ' " Immelt recalled .
For years , his reaction was , " That 's really stupid ; no need to do that . "
But his managers kept up the pressure , and Immelt figured that " with so much smoke , there must be a fire . "
So in 2004 , he moved GE Healthcare from Wisconsin to outside London , the home of Amersham , a company GE had just bought .
I 'm fairly certain I recently passed a rather pathetic tipping point , and now own more unread books and unwatched DVDs than my remaining lifespan will be able to sustain .
I can't possibly read all these pages , watch all these movies , before the grim reaper comes knocking .
The bastard things are going to outlive me .
It 's not fair .
They can't even breathe .
The other day I bought a DVD boxset of Carl Sagan 's astronomy epic Cosmos : by all accounts , one of the best documentary series ever made .
On my way home , I made the mistake of carefully reading the back of the box , where I discovered it has a running time of 780 minutes .
Thirteen hours .
It 's against my religion to only watch part of it – it's all or nothing .
But 13 hours ?
That 's almost a marriage .
The sheer weight of commitment is daunting .
So it sits on the shelf , beside similarly unwrapped and unwatched obelisks .
I 'm not buying these things for myself any more .
I 'm hoarding them for future generations .
DVD and book purchases fall into two main categories : the ones you buy because you really want to watch them , and the ones you buy because you vaguely think you should .
Two years ago I bought Dostoevsky 's Crime and Punishment , partly because I 'd heard it was a good book and an easy read , but mainly because I figured reading it would make me cleverer – or at the very least , make me seem a bit cleverer to anyone sitting opposite me on the tube .
I never read it .
A few months ago , having forgotten I already owned a copy , I bought it again .
This means I have n't read it twice .
And I have n't read it ( twice ) because it 's got too much competition from all the other books I 've bought but never read .
Popular science books .
Biographies .
Classic works of fiction .
Cult sci-fi and horror stories .
Reference works .
How - to guides .
Graphic novels .
I can't buy one book at a time : I have to buy at least four .
Which makes it exponentially trickier to single out one to actually read .
When I buy books , all I 'm really doing is buying wall insulation , like a blackbird gathering twigs to make a nest .
Ditto DVDs .
Scenes From a Marriage and The Seventh Seal – two well - regarded Ingmar Bergman films I bought during a short - lived fit of self - improvement .
I should have thrown them in a bin on my way home from the shop .
It 's hard enough to choose between the two : am I in the mood for a lyrical 92 - minute meditation on death , or an unflinching three - hour portrayal of a dysfunctional relationship ?
Neither , as it turns out .
They 'd only be interrupted by emails and texts anyway .
Perhaps something more lightweight ?
They 're sitting on the shelf in - between JCVD ( a post - modern Jean - Claude Van Damme film ) and season two of Entourage .
I 've never seen those either – partly because I feel guilty about not having watched the Bergman films first .
Somehow I 've purchased my way into a no -win situation .
Clearly , some sort of cull is in order .
It 's me or them .
I pick them .
My options need limiting .
Last week I watched the first part of Electric Dreams , the 1900 House - style TV show where a family lives with old technology for several weeks .
For episode one , they were stranded in the 1970s , with no internet , no DVDs or videos , and only three channels on the TV .
It 's fair to say the kids were n't massively impressed .
It was all a bit Guantánamo for their liking .
But to me the limited options looked blissful .
You could n't lose yourself online , so if you did n't want to watch Summertime Special or World in Action , you had to read a book , go for a walk , or in extreme circumstances , strike up a conversation with a fellow human being .
But it was n't just the limitations of the media themselves that appealed .
This was 30 years ago .
Fewer things had been created for them .
Every day we humans gleefully churn out yet more books and films and TV shows and videogames and websites and magazine articles and blog posts and emails and text messages , all of it hanging around , competing for attention .
Without leaving my seat I can access virtually any piece of music ever recorded , download any film ever made , order any book ever written .
And the end result is that I hardly experience any of it .
It 's too much .
I 've had it with choice .
It makes my head spin .
Here 's what I want : I want to be told what to read , watch and listen to .
I want my hands tied .
I want a cultural diet .
I want a government employee to turn up on my doorstep once a month , carrying a single book for me to read .
I want all my TV channels removed and replaced by a single electro - pipe delivering one programme or movie a day .
If I do n't watch it , it gets replaced by the following day 's selection .
I want all my MP3s deleted and replaced with one unskippable radio station playing one song after the other .
And every time I think about complaining , I want a minotaur to punch me in the kidneys and remind me how it was before .
In short : I 've tried more .
It 's awful .
I want less , and I want it now .
Research
In Motion has announced an updated version of its touchscreen phone , the Storm 2 .
The latest BlackBerry handset promises a better display and wireless connectivity .
And like its predecessor , the Storm 2 will be available on the Verizon network .
RIM launched the first Storm phone in November last year .
The device met with some very harsh reviews from critics who derided the phone 's poor touchscreen , glitchy software and lack of Wi-Fi connectivity .
Yet the Storm sold more than one million devices in just about two months after the launch .
With Storm 2 , RIM seems to have taken note some of the criticism .
Here are two things that it has improved on in the device .
Touchscreen :
The biggest criticism against the first generation Storm phone was its touchscreen .
RIM claimed that the screen would offer the ' click ' feedback of a physical keyboard but most users found the touchscreen difficult to use .
A Wall Street Journal review of the Storm 2 says the new touchscreens are better .
The device now " allows for faster , smoother typing , " says the review .
Wireless connectivity :
In a rather puzzling move , the original Storm phone did n't support Wi -Fi .
And since the Storm was billed as a smartphone , it seriously crippled the device .
RIM seems to have fixed that with built - in Wi-Fi connectivity in the Storm 2 .
RIM has n't disclosed pricing or availability for the phone .
But it is likely to launch it in the U.S. next month for under $ 200 with a two - year contract .
The Storm 2 will be available on the Vodafone network in Europe .

The war of words continues unabated with regard to Iran 's nuclear intentions .
The rhetoric emanating from the leaders of Iran , Israel and the United States is filled with suspicion , distrust and dangerous saber rattling .
The tensions are rapidly escalating to the point that just one small spark could ignite a Middle East inferno that could escalate into the next world war .
Words are cheap , actions speak much louder .
Listening to these three parties ' never - ending rhetoric is a monumental waste of time and will solve nothing .
Actions are the things that count when analyzing just what is happening in the Middle East and where this situation may be heading .
Let 's begin with words .
Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a master of obtuse rhetoric .
He craves the spotlight even though that exposure is generally damaging to his image .
He uses every opportunity presented to insult and make threats against the government of Israel .
But this worn out act is meaningless and merely serves to increase the hatred and distrust that his enemies feel for him .
The rhetoric flowing from the government of Israel is deadly serious with a constant menacing threat of potential attack upon the nuclear facilities of Iran .
I can't ever recall hearing a message coming from Israel that has ever attempted to promote any form of diplomacy or to try to reach a middle ground with Iran or other neighbor states .

There are calls to ban two marches planned by a group of football fans called the Welsh Defence League .
They claim it is to protest against radical Islam and they are not racist but opponents accuse them of being a fascist organisation targeting Muslims .
Marches are planned in Swansea and Newport .
Police say they are putting plans in place to avoid a repeat of violent clashes seen in Birmingham .
Football clubs across Wales have also condemned the group .
They were unhappy club logos were used to promote the cause .
Ninety people were arrested when protesters from the English and Welsh Defence League clashed with anti-fascist campaigners in Birmingham in September .
It is understood football fans from south Wales played their part in the demonstrations .
Now the Welsh Defence League is planning to take to the streets of Swansea and Newport in the coming weeks , an investigation by BBC Wales ' Dragon 's Eye programme has discovered .
They say they are against Muslim extremists and the introduction of Sharia law in Britain .
FOOTBALL CLUBS REACTION
Newport wanted to " disassociate itself from this organisation and its campaign " .
Swansea City said it " abhors racism " and " does not support or affiliate itself to this organization , its campaign or any other group of this nature " .
Wrexham said it was " not involved with the group in question and does not support their intentions " .
Cardiff City said it forbids the use of its official material to support , what it calls , racist activity by any organisation .
It also welcomes fans of " all races and creeds " .
Source : BBC Wales Dragon 's Eye One member called Mike said : " We 're not racist , because we 're standing up against Islam .
I mean the police are terrified to upset Muslims , right , and the fact is that militant Islamists in this country , they 're on a jihad , a holy war against us , they want to kill us . "
The Welsh Defence League says Muslim and other ethnic minority groups can join but opponents say this is a smoke screen for their real views .
Jeff Hurford , from Unite Against Fascism , said : " If you actually look at their website the reality is they use the word jihadist for almost any Muslim - for almost anybody who actually speaks out about almost anything whatsoever is a jihadist . "
But a member of the English Defence League ( EDL ) called Michael , who is black , insisted the group is not racist .
" EDL support all English people who are proud of our country ...
That want to stop islamic extremism , " he said .
" We 're not racist .
I 'm a black man and I 'm proud to be English that 's why I joined the EDL . "
The Welsh Defence League has used the logos of football teams to promote its cause but Dragon 's Eye discovered that all Welsh clubs have now spoken out against them .
When the campaign group , Show Racism the Red Card contacted the clubs involved they all said the group did n't have permission to use the clubs logos and Cardiff City has even taken legal action to prevent its crest being used .
The Football Association of Wales said it " in no way condones the practices or ideology of such groups as this " .
Now there are calls for police to stop the marches in Swansea and Newport taking place .
Mohammed Tufail , from Race Equality First , said : " I think they should be banned I do n't think they should be allowed to express the views they 're expressing .
" Because those views are racist , they 're fascist , they 're just picking on a community for no reason other than their faith . "
Police across south Wales say they are putting together plans to prevent a repeat of the violent clashes seen in Birmingham .
Dragon 's Eye is on BBC1 Wales at 2235 BST on Thursday .

I saw this video mentioned on Mike Eades ’ blog and gave it a look .
It ’s a 90 - minute lecture that ’s heavy on biochemistry in some parts , but worth the effort .
In a nutshell , the doctor making the presentation explains how consuming fructose — which makes up about half of both sugar and HFCS — produces most of the same biochemical effects as drinking alcohol , minus the buzz .
The takeaway : if you would n’t serve your kid a beer , do n’t serve him a soda either .
He also gives a nice wrap - up of what ’s wrong with the Lipid Hypothesis and the current advice to eat high - carb and low - fat .
Enjoy .
Mozilla Delivers SeaMonkey 2.0
by Ostatic Staff - Oct. 28 , 2009
Mozilla is out with version 2.0 of its SeaMonkey hybrid browser and email platform , based on Firefox and Thunderbird .
There is a long list of additions to the new version , which you can peruse here .
SeaMonkey did n't use the exact same core as the Firefox browser before , but now shares the the core of Firefox 3.5.4 .
Among other things , that means extensions should work more dependably than they did before .
Here are some of the other important improvements .
SeaMonkey 2.0 builds in a new add - on manager to make working with extensions as similar as possible to using them in Firefox .
Tabbed mail is now supported , and you can dedicate to tabs to separate email accounts , or use them to organize folders .
Toolbars are now fully customizable .
The MailNews component now includes support for reading RSS and Atom feeds .
Session restore ( crash recovery ) has been added .
SeaMonkey 2.0 is downloadable for Windows , the Mac or Linux here .
Many people who like both Firefox and Thunderbird favor it as an integrated platform for browsing and email , and version 2.0 is definitely a major upgrade .
Fiction in any form has always intended to be realistic .
Old - fashioned novels which now seem stilted and artificial to the point of burlesque did not appear that way to the people who first read them .
Writers like Fielding and Smollett could seem realistic in the modern sense because they dealt largely with uninhibited characters , many of whom were about two jumps ahead of the police , but Jane Austens chronicles of highly inhibited people against a background of rural gentility seem real enough psychologically .
There is plenty of that kind of social and emotional hypocrisy around today .
Add to it a liberal dose of intellectual pretentiousness and you get the tone of the book page in your daily paper and the earnest and fatuous atmosphere breathed by discussion groups in little clubs .
These are the people who make bestsellers , which are promotional jobs based on a sort of indirect snob - appeal , carefully escorted by the trained seals of the critical fraternity , and lovingly tended and watered by certain much too powerful pressure groups whose business is selling books , although they would like you to think they are fostering culture .
Just get a little behind in your payments and you will find out how idealistic they are .
The detective story for a variety of reasons can seldom be promoted .
It is usually about murder and hence lacks the element of uplift .
Murder , which is a frustration of the individual and hence a frustration of the race , may have , and in fact has , a good deal of sociological implication .
But it has been going on too long for it to be news .
If the mystery novel is at all realistic ( which it very seldom is ) it is written in a certain spirit of detachment ; otherwise nobody but a psychopath would want to write it or read it .
The murder novel has also a depressing way of minding its own business , solving its own problems and answering its own questions .
There is nothing left to discuss , except whether it was well enough written to be good fiction , and the people who make up the half - million sales wouldnt know that anyway .
The detection of quality in writing is difficult enough even for those who make a career of the job , without paying too much attention to the matter of advance sales .
The detective story ( perhaps I had better call it that , since the English formula still dominates the trade ) has to find its public by a slow process of distillation .
That it does do this , and holds on thereafter with such tenacity , is a fact ; the reasons for it are a study for more patient minds than mine .
Nor is it any part of my thesis to maintain that it is a vital and significant form of art .
There are no vital and significant forms of art ; there is only art , and precious little of that .
The growth of populations has in no way increased the amount ; it has merely increased the adeptness with which substitutes can be produced and packaged .
Yet the detective story , even in its most conventional form , is difficult to write well .
Good specimens of the art are much rarer than good serious novels .
Rather second - rate items outlast most of the high velocity fiction , and a great many that should never have been born simply refuse to die at all .
They are as durable as the statues in public parks and just about that dull .
This is very annoying to people of what is called discernment .
They do not like it that penetrating and important works of fiction of a few years back stand on their special shelf in the library marked " Best - Sellers of Yesteryear , " and nobody goes near them but an occasional shortsighted customer who bends down , peers briefly and hurries away ; while old ladies jostle each other at the mystery shelf to grab off some item of the same vintage with a title like The Triple Petunia Murder Case , or Inspector Pinchbottle to the Rescue .
They do not like it that " really important books " get dusty on the reprint counter , while Death Wears Yellow Garters is put out in editions of fifty or one hundred thousand copies on the news - stands of the country , and is obviously not there just to say goodbye .
To tell you the truth , I do not like it very much myself .
In my less stilted moments I too write detective stories , and all this immortality makes just a little too much competition .
Even Einstein couldnt get very far if three hundred treatises of the higher physics were published every year , and several thousand others in some form or other were hanging around in excellent condition , and being read too .
Hemingway says somewhere that the good writer competes only with the dead .
The good detective story writer ( there must after all be a few ) competes not only with all the unburied dead but with all the hosts of the living as well .
And on almost equal terms ; for it is one of the qualities of this kind of writing that the thing that makes people read it never goes out of style .
The heros tie may be a little off the mode and the good gray inspector may arrive in a dogcart instead of a streamlined sedan with siren screaming , but what he does when he gets there is the same old futzing around with timetables and bits of charred paper and who trampled the jolly old flowering arbutus under the library window .
I have , however , a less sordid interest in the matter .
It seems to me that production of detective stories on so large a scale , and by writers whose immediate reward is small and whose need of critical praise is almost nil , would not be possible at all if the job took any talent .
In that sense the raised eyebrow of the critic and the shoddy merchandizing of the publisher are perfectly logical .
The average detective story is probably no worse than the average novel , but you never see the average novel .
It doesnt get published .
The averageor only slightly above average detective story does .
Not only is it published but it is sold in small quantities to rental libraries , and it is read .
There are even a few optimists who buy it at the full retail price of two dollars , because it looks so fresh and new , and there is a picture of a corpse on the cover .
And the strange thing is that this average , more than middling dull , pooped - out piece of utterly unreal and mechanical fiction is not terribly different from what are called the masterpieces of the art .
It drags on a little more slowly , the dialogue is a little grayer , the cardboard out of which the characters are cut is a shade thinner , and the cheating is a little more obvious ; but it is the same kind of book .
Whereas the good novel is not at all the same kind of book as the bad novel .
It is about entirely different things .
But the good detective story and the bad detective story are about exactly the same things , and they are about them in very much the same way .
There are reasons for this too , and reasons for the reasons ; there always are .
I suppose the principal dilemma of the traditional or classic or straight - deductive or logic and deduction novel of detection is that for any approach to perfection it demands a combination of qualities not found in the same mind .
The cool - headed constructionist does not also come across with lively characters , sharp dialogue , a sense of pace and an acute use of observed detail .
The grim logician has as much atmosphere as a drawing - board .
The scientific sleuth has a nice new shiny laboratory , but I m sorry I cant remember the face .
The fellow who can write you a vivid and colorful prose simply wont be bothered with the coolie labor of breaking down unbreakable alibis .
The master of rare knowledge is living psychologically in the age of the hoop skirt .
If you know all you should know about ceramics and Egyptian needlework , you dont know anything at all about the police .
If you know that platinum wont melt under about 2800 degrees F. by itself , but will melt at the glance of a pair of deep blue eyes when put close to a bar of lead , then you dont know how men make love in the twentieth century .
And if you know enough about the elegant flânerie of the pre-war French Riviera to lay your story in that locale , you dont know that a couple of capsules of barbital small enough to be swallowed will not only not kill a man they will not even put him to sleep , if he fights against them .
Every detective story writer makes mistakes , and none will ever know as much as he should .
Conan
Doyle made mistakes which completely invalidated some of his stories , but he was a pioneer , and Sherlock Holmes after all is mostly an attitude and a few dozen lines of unforgettable dialogue .
It is the ladies and gentlemen of what Mr. Howard Haycraft ( in his book Murder for Pleasure ) calls the Golden Age of detective fiction that really get me down .
This age is not remote .
For Mr. Haycrafts purpose it starts after the first World War and lasts up to about 1930 .
For all practical purposes it is still here .
Two - thirds or three - quarters of all the detective stories published still adhere to the formula the giants of this era created , perfected , polished and sold to the world as problems in logic and deduction .
These are stern words , but be not alarmed .
They are only words .
Let us glance at one of the glories of the literature , an acknowledged masterpiece of the art of fooling the reader without cheating him .
It is called The Red House Mystery , was written by A. A. Milne , and has been named by Alexander Woollcott ( rather a fast man with a superlative ) " one of the three best mystery stories of all time . "
Words of that size are not spoken lightly .
The book was published in 1922 , but is quite timeless , and might as easily have been published in July 1939 , or , with a few slight changes , last week .
It ran thirteen editions and seems to have been in print , in the original format , for about sixteen years .
That happens to few books of any kind .
It is an agreeable book , light , amusing in the Punch style , written with a deceptive smoothness that is not as easy as it looks .
It concerns Mark Abletts impersonation of his brother Robert , as a hoax on his friends .
Mark is the owner of the Red House , a typical laburnum - and - lodge - gate English country house , and he has a secretary who encourages him and abets him in this impersonation , because the secretary is going to murder him , if he pulls it off .
Nobody around the Red House has ever seen Robert , fifteen years absent in Australia , known to them by repute as a no - good .
A letter from Robert is talked about , but never shown .
It announces his arrival , and Mark hints it will not be a pleasant occasion .
One afternoon , then , the supposed Robert arrives , identifies himself to a couple of servants , is shown into the study , and Mark ( according to testimony at the inquest ) goes in after him .
Robert is then found dead on the floor with a bullet hole in his face , and of course Mark has vanished into thin air .
Arrive the police , suspect Mark must be the murderer , remove the debris and proceed with the investigation , and in due course , with the inquest .
Milne is aware of one very difficult hurdle and tries as well as he can to get over it .
Since the secretary is going to murder Mark once he has established himself as Robert , the impersonation has to continue on and fool the police .
Since , also , everybody around the Red House knows Mark intimately , disguise is necessary .
This is achieved by shaving off Marks beard , roughening his hands ( " not the hands of a manicured gentlemen " testimony ) and the use of a gruff voice and rough manner .
But this is not enough .
The cops are going to have the body and the clothes on it and whatever is in the pockets .
Therefore none of this must suggest Mark .
Milne therefore works like a switch engine to put over the motivation that Mark is a thoroughly conceited performer that he dresses the part down to the socks and underwear ( from all of which the secretary has removed the makers labels ) , like a ham blacking himself all over to play Othello .
If the reader will buy this ( and the sales record shows he must have )
Milne figures he is solid .
Yet , however light in texture the story may be , it is offered as a problem of logic and deduction .
If it is not that , it is nothing at all .
There is nothing else for it to be .
If the situation is false , you cannot even accept it as a light novel , for there is no story for the light novel to be about .
If the problem does not contain the elements of truth and plausibility , it is no problem ; if the logic is an illusion , there is nothing to deduce .
If the impersonation is impossible once the reader is told the conditions it must fulfill , then the whole thing is a fraud .
Not a deliberate fraud , because Milne would not have written the story if he had known what he was up against .
He is up against a number of deadly things , none of which he even considers .
Nor , apparently , does the casual reader , who wants to like the story , hence takes it at its face value .
But the reader is not called upon to know the facts of life ; it is the author who is the expert in the case .
Here is what this author ignores : 1 . The coroner holds formal jury inquest on a body for which no competent legal identification is offered .
A coroner , usually in a big city , will sometimes hold inquest on a body that cannot be identified , if the record of such an inquest has or may have a value ( fire , disaster , evidence of murder , etc. ) .
No such reason exists here , and there is no one to identify the body .
A couple of witnesses said the man said he was Robert Ablett .
This is mere presumption , and has weight only if nothing conflicts with it .
Identification is a condition precedent to an inquest .
Even in death a man has a right to his won identity .
The coroner will , wherever humanly possible , enforce that right .
To neglect it would be a violation of his office .
2 . Since Mark Ablett , missing and suspected of murder , cannot defend himself , all evidence of his movements before and after the murder is vital ( as also whether he has money to run away on ) ; yet all such evidence is given by the man closest to the murder , and is without corroboration .
It is automatically suspect until proved true .
3 . The police find by direct investigation that Robert Ablett was not well thought of in his native village .
Somebody there must have known him .
No such person was brought to the inquest .
( The story couldnt stand it . )
4 . The police know there is an element of threat in Roberts supposed visit , and that it is connected with the murder must be obvious to them .
Yet they make no attempt to check Robert in Australia , or find out what character he had there , or what associates , or even if he actually came to England , and with whom .
( If they had , they would have found out he had been dead three years . )
5 . The police surgeon examines the body with a recently shaved beard ( exposing unweathered skin ) , artificially roughened hands , yet the body of a wealthy , soft - living man , long resident in a cool climate .
Robert was a rough individual and had lived fifteen years in Australia .
That is the surgeons information .
It is impossible he would have noticed nothing to conflict with it .
6 . The clothes are nameless , empty , and have had the labels removed .
Yet the man wearing them asserted an identity .
The presumption that he was not what he said he was is overpowering .
Nothing whatever is done about this peculiar circumstance .
It is never even mentioned as being peculiar .
7 . A man is missing , a well - known local man , and a body in the morgue closely resembles him .
It is impossible that the police should not at once eliminate the chance that the missing man is the dead man .
Nothing would be easier than to prove it .
Not even to think of it is incredible .
It makes idiots of the police , so that a brash amateur may startle the world with a fake solution .
The detective in the case is an insouciant gent named Antony Gillingham , a nice lad with a cheery eye , a cozy little flat in London , and that airy manner .
He is not making any money on the assignment , but is always available when the local gendarmerie loses its notebook .
The English police seem to endure him with their customary stoicism ; but I shudder to think of what the boys down at the Homicide Bureau in my city would do to him .
There are less plausible examples of the art than this .
In Trents Last Case ( often called " the perfect detective story " ) you have to accept the premise that a giant of international finance , whose lightest frown makes Wall Street quiver like a chihuahua , will plot his own death so as to hang his secretary , and that the secretary when pinched will maintain an aristocratic silence ; the old Etonian in him maybe .
I have known relatively few international financiers , but I rather think the author of this novel has ( if possible ) known fewer .
There is one by Freeman Wills Crofts ( the soundest builder of them all when he doesnt get too fancy ) wherein a murderer by the aid of makeup , split second timing , and some very sweet evasive action , impersonates the man he has just killed and thereby gets him alive and distant from the place of the crime .
There is one of Dorothy Sayers  in which a man is murdered alone at night in his house by a mechanically released weight which works because he always turns the radio on at just such a moment , always stands in just such a position in front of it , and always bends over just so far .
A couple of inches either way and the customers would get a rain check .
This is what is vulgarly known as having God sit in your lap ; a murderer who needs that much help from Providence must be in the wrong business .
And there is a scheme of Agatha Christies featuring M. Hercule Poirot , that ingenius Belgian who talks in a literal translation of school - boy French , wherein , by duly messing around with his " little gray cells , " M. Poirot decides that nobody on a certain through sleeper could have done the murder alone , therefore everybody did it together , breaking the process down into a series of simple operations , like assembling an egg - beater .
This is the type that is guaranteed to knock the keenest mind for a loop .
Only a halfwit could guess it .
There are much better plots by these same writers and by others of their school .
There may be one somewhere that would really stand up under close scrutiny .
It would be fun to read it , even if I did have to go back to page 47 and refresh my memory about exactly what time the second gardener potted the prize - winning tea -rose begonia .
There is nothing new about these stories and nothing old .
The ones I mentioned are all English only because the authorities ( such as they are ) seem to feel the English writers had an edge in this dreary routine , and that the Americans , ( even the creator of Philo Vanceprobably the most asinine character in detective fiction ) only made the Junior Varsity .
This , the classic detective story , has learned nothing and forgotten nothing .
It is the story you will find almost any week in the big shiny magazines , handsomely illustrated , and paying due deference to virginal love and the right kind of luxury goods .
Perhaps the tempo has become a trifle faster , and the dialogue a little more glib .
There are more frozen daiquiris and stingers ordered , and fewer glasses of crusty old port ; more clothes by Vogue , and décors by the House Beautiful , more chic , but not more truth .
We spend more time in Miami hotels and Cape Cod summer colonies and go not so often down by the old gray sundial in the Elizabethan garden .
But fundamentally it is the same careful grouping of suspects , the same utterly incomprehensible trick of how somebody stabbed Mrs. Pottington Postlethwaite III with the solid platinum poignard just as she flatted on the top note of the Bell Song from Lakmé in the presence of fifteen ill - assorted guests ; the same ingenue in fur - trimmed pajamas screaming in the night to make the company pop in and out of doors and ball up the timetable ; the same moody silence next day as they sit around sipping Singapore slings and sneering at each other , while the flat - feet crawl to and fro under the Persian rugs , with their derby hats on .
Personally I like the English style better .
It is not quite so brittle , and the people as a rule , just wear clothes and drink drinks .
There is more sense of background , as if Cheesecake Manor really existed all around and not just the part the camera sees ; there are more long walks over the Downs and the characters dont all try to behave as if they had just been tested by MGM .
The English may not always be the best writers in the world , but they are incomparably the best dull writers .
There is a very simple statement to be made about all these stories : they do not really come off intellectually as problems , and they do not come off artistically as fiction .
They are too contrived , and too little aware of what goes on in the world .
They try to be honest , but honesty is an art .
The poor writer is dishonest without knowing it , and the fairly good one can be dishonest because he doesnt know what to be honest about .
He thinks a complicated murder scheme which baffles the lazy reader , who wont be bothered itemizing the details , will also baffle the police , whose business is with details .
The boys with their feet on the desks know that the easiest murder case in the world to break is the one somebody tried to get very cute with ; the one that really bothers them is the murder somebody only thought of two minutes before he pulled it off .
But if the writers of this fiction wrote about the kind of murders that happen , they would also have to write about the authentic flavor of life as it is lived .
And since they cannot do that , they pretend that what they do is what should be done .
Which is begging the question and the best of them know it .
In her introduction to the first Omnibus of Crime , Dorothy Sayers wrote : " It ( the detective story ) does not , and by hypothesis never can , attain the loftiest level of literary achievement . "
And she suggested somewhere else that this is because it is a " literature of escape " and not " a literature of expression . "
I do not know what the loftiest level of literary achievement is : neither did Aeschylus or Shakespeare ; neither does Miss Sayers .
Other things being equal , which they never are , a more powerful theme will provoke a more powerful performance .
Yet some very dull books have been written about God , and some very fine ones about how to make a living and stay fairly honest .
It is always a matter of who writes the stuff , and what he has in him to write it with .
As for literature of expression and literature of escape , this is critics  jargon , a use of abstract words as if they had absolute meanings .
Everything written with vitality expresses that vitality ; there are no dull subjects , only dull minds .
All men who read escape from something else into what lies behind the printed page ; the quality of the dream may be argued , but its release has become a functional necessity .
All men must escape at times from the deadly rhythm of their private thoughts .
It is part of the process of life among thinking beings .
It is one of the things that distinguish them from the three - toed sloth ; he apparently one can never be quite sure is perfectly content hanging upside down on a branch , and not even reading Walter Lippmann .
I hold no particular brief for the detective story as the ideal escape .
I merely say that all reading for pleasure is escape , whether it be Greek , mathematics , astronomy , Benedetto Croce , or The Diary of the Forgotten Man .
To say otherwise is to be an intellectual snob , and a juvenile at the art of living .
I do not think such considerations moved Miss Dorothy Sayers to her essay in critical futility .
I think what was really gnawing at her mind was the slow realization that her kind of detective story was an arid formula which could not even satisfy its own implications .
It was second - grade literature because it was not about the things that could make first - grade literature .
If it started out to be about real people ( and she could write about themher minor nor characters show that ) , they must very soon do unreal things in order to form the artificial pattern required by the plot .
When they did unreal things , they ceased to be real themselves .
They became puppets and cardboard lovers and papier mâché villains and detectives of exquisite and impossible gentility .
The only kind of writer who could be happy with these properties was the one who did not know what reality was .
Dorothy Sayers  own stories show that she was annoyed by this triteness ; the weakest element in them is the part that makes them detective stories , the strongest the part which could be removed without touching the " problem of logic and deduction . "
Yet she could not or would not give her characters their heads and let them make their own mystery .
It took a much simpler and more direct mind than hers to do that .
In the Long Week - End , which is a drastically competent account of English life and manners in the decade following the first World War , Robert Graves and Alan Hodge gave some attention to the detective story .
They were just as traditionally English as the ornaments of the Golden Age , and they wrote of the time in which these writers were almost as well - known as any writers in the world .
Their books in one form or another sold into the millions , and in a dozen languages .
These were the people who fixed the form and established the rules and founded the famous Detection Club , which is a Parnassus of English writers of mystery .
Its roster includes practically every important writer of detective fiction since Conan Doyle .
But Graves and Hodge decided that during this whole period only one first - class writer had written detective stories at all .
An American , Dashiell Hammett .
Traditional or not , Graves and Hodge were not fuddy - duddy connoisseurs of the second rate ; they could see what went on in the world and that the detective story of their time didnt ; and they were aware that writers who have the vision and the ability to produce real fiction do not produce unreal fiction .
How original a writer Hammett really was , it is nt easy to decide now , even if it mattered .
He was one of a group , the only one who achieved critical recognition , but not the only one who wrote or tried to write realistic mystery fiction .
All literary movements are like this ; some one individual is picked out to represent the whole movement ; he is usually the culmination of the movement .
Hammett was the ace performer , but there is nothing in his work that is not implicit in the early novels and short stories of Hemingway .
Yet for all I know , Hemingway may have learned something from Hammett , as well as from writers like Dreiser , Ring Lardner , Carl Sandburg , Sherwood Anderson and himself .
A rather revolutionary debunking of both the language and material of fiction had been going on for some time .
It probably started in poetry ; almost everything does .
You can take it clear back to Walt Whitman , if you like .
But Hammett applied it to the detective story , and this , because of its heavy crust of English gentility and American pseudo - gentility , was pretty hard to get moving .
I doubt that Hammett had any deliberate artistic aims whatever ; he was trying to make a living by writing something he had first hand information about .
He made some of it up ; all writers do ; but it had a basis in fact ; it was made up out of real things .
The only reality the English detection writers knew was the conversational accent of Surbiton and Bognor Regis .
If they wrote about dukes and Venetian vases , they knew no more about them out of their own experience than the well - heeled Hollywood character knows about the French Modernists that hang in his Bel - Air château or the semi-antique Chippendale - cum - cobblers bench that he uses for a coffee table .
Hammett took murder out of the Venetian vase and dropped it into the alley ; it doesnt have to stay there forever , but it was a good idea to begin by getting as far as possible from Emily Posts idea of how a well - bred debutante gnaws a chicken wing .
He wrote at first ( and almost to the end ) for people with a sharp , aggressive attitude to life .
They were not afraid of the seamy side of things ; they lived there .
Violence did not dismay them ; it was right down their street .
Hammett gave murder back to the kind of people that commit it for reasons , not just to provide a corpse ; and with the means at hand , not with hand - wrought duelling pistols , curare , and tropical fish .
He put these people down on paper as they are , and he made them talk and think in the language they customarily used for these purposes .
He had style , but his audience didnt know it , because it was in a language not supposed to be capable of such refinements .
They thought they were getting a good meaty melodrama written in the kind of lingo they imagined they spoke themselves .
It was , in a sense , but it was much more .
All language begins with speech , and the speech of common men at that , but when it develops to the point of becoming a literary medium it only looks like speech .
Hammetts style at its worst was almost as formalized as a page of Marius the Epicurean ; at its best it could say almost anything .
I believe this style , which does not belong to Hammett or to anybody , but is the American language ( and not even exclusively that any more ) , can say things he did not know how to say or feel the need of saying .
In his hands it had no overtones , left no echo , evoked no image beyond a distant hill .
He is said to have lacked heart , yet the story he thought most of himself is the record of a mans devotion to a friend .
He was spare , frugal , hardboiled , but he did over and over again what only the best writers can ever do at all .
He wrote scenes that seemed never to have been written before .
With all this he did not wreck the formal detective story .
Nobody can ; production demands a form that can be produced .
Realism takes too much talent , too much knowledge , too much awareness .
Hammett may have loosened it up a little here , and sharpened it a little there .
Certainly all but the stupidest and most meretricious writers are more conscious of their artificiality than they used to be .
And he demonstrated that the detective story can be important writing .
The Maltese Falcon may or may not be a work of genius , but an art which is capable of it is not " by hypothesis " incapable of anything .
Once a detective story can be as good as this , only the pedants will deny that it could be even better .
Hammett did something else , he made the detective story fun to write , not an exhausting concatenation of insignificant clues .
Without him there might not have been a regional mystery as clever as Percival Wildes Inquest , or an ironic study as able as Raymond Postgates Verdict of Twelve , or a savage piece of intellectual double - talk like Kenneth Fearings The Dagger of the Mind , or a tragi-comic idealization of the murderer as in Donald Hendersons Mr. Bowling Buys a Newspaper , or even a gay and intriguing Hollywoodian gambol like Richard Sales Lazarus No. 7 .
The realistic style is easy to abuse : from haste , from lack of awareness , from inability to bridge the chasm that lies between what a writer would like to be able to say and what he actually knows how to say .
It is easy to fake ; brutality is not strength , flipness is not wit , edge - of - the - chair writing can be as boring as flat writing ; dalliance with promiscuous blondes can be very dull stuff when described by goaty young men with no other purpose in mind than to describe dalliance with promiscuous blondes .
There has been so much of this sort of thing that if a character in a detective story says , " Yeah , " the author is automatically a Hammett imitator .
And there arc still quite a few people around who say that Hammett did not write detective stories at all , merely hardboiled chronicles of mean streets with a perfunctory mystery element dropped in like the olive in a martini .
These are the flustered old ladies of both sexes ( or no sex ) and almost all ages who like their murders scented with magnolia blossoms and do not care to be reminded that murder is an act of infinite cruelty , even if the perpetrators sometimes look like playboys or college professors or nice motherly women with softly graying hair .
There are also a few badly - scared champions of the formal or the classic mystery who think no story is a detective story which does not pose a formal and exact problem and arrange the clues around it with neat labels on them .
Such would point out , for example , that in reading TheMaltese Falcon no one concerns himself with who killed Spades partner , Archer ( which is the only formal problem of the story ) because the reader is kept thinking about something else .
Yet in The Glass Key the reader is constantly reminded that the question is who killed Taylor Henry , and exactly the same effect is obtained ; an effect of movement , intrigue , cross-purposes and the gradual elucidation of character , which is all the detective story has any right to be about anyway .
The rest is spillikins in the parlor .
But all this ( and Hammett too ) is for me not quite enough .
The realist in murder writes of a world in which gangsters can rule nations and almost rule cities , in which hotels and apartment houses and celebrated restaurants are owned by men who made their money out of brothels , in which a screen star can be the fingerman for a mob , and the nice man down the hall is a boss of the numbers racket ; a world where a judge with a cellar full of bootleg liquor can send a man to jail for having a pint in his pocket , where the mayor of your town may have condoned murder as an instrument of moneymaking , where no man can walk down a dark street in safety because law and order are things we talk about but refrain from practising ; a world where you may witness a hold - up in broad daylight and see who did it , but you will fade quickly back into the crowd rather than tell anyone , because the hold - up men may have friends with long guns , or the police may not like your testimony , and in any case the shyster for the defense will be allowed to abuse and vilify you in open court , before a jury of selected morons , without any but the most perfunctory interference from a political judge .
It is not a very fragrant world , but it is the world you live in , and certain writers with tough minds and a cool spirit of detachment can make very interesting and even amusing patterns out of it .
It is not funny that a man should be killed , but it is sometimes funny that he should be killed for so little , and that his death should be the coin of what we call civilization .
All this still is not quite enough .
In everything that can be called art there is a quality of redemption .
It may be pure tragedy , if it is high tragedy , and it may be pity and irony , and it may be the raucous laughter of the strong man .
But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean , who is neither tarnished nor afraid .
The detective in this kind of story must be such a man .
He is the hero , he is everything .
He must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man .
He must be , to use a rather weathered phrase , a man of honor , by instinct , by inevitability , without thought of it , and certainly without saying it .
He must be the best man in his world and a good enough man for any world .
I do not care much about his private life ; he is neither a eunuch nor a satyr ; I think he might seduce a duchess and I am quite sure he would not spoil a virgin ; if he is a man of honor in one thing , he is that in all things .
He is a relatively poor man , or he would not be a detective at all .
He is a common man or he could not go among common people .
He has a sense of character , or he would not know his job .
He will take no mans money dishonestly and no mans insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge .
He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him .
He talks as the man of his age talks , that is , with rude wit , a lively sense of the grotesque , a disgust for sham , and a contempt for pettiness .
The story is his adventure in search of a hidden truth , and it would be no adventure if it did not happen to a man fit for adventure .
He has a range of awareness that startles you , but it belongs to him by right , because it belongs to the world he lives in .
If there were enough like him , I think the world would be a very safe place to live in , and yet not too dull to be worth living in .
At last , the wreck of the rainforests is being tackled .
One of the key parts of the Copenhagen climate agreement which the international community will try to construct in December is a comprehensive treaty aiming to reduce deforestation rates in the developing countries by at least 50 per cent by 2020 .
Not before time .
It has been 20 years since we woke up to the reality of large - scale rainforest loss : in the late 1980s , the terrible scale of destruction in regions such as the Brazilian Amazon , and later , in Indonesia and other areas , dawned on the world , but in the time since then , all we have been able to do , in effect , has been to wring our hands .
Deforestation was clearly terrible for wildlife , for the indigenous peoples of the forests , and for the " ecosystem services " , as the modern jargon has it , which forests provide , such as climates which bring rain .
But the whole process seemed so vast , the huge socio-economic forces behind deforestation in the developing countries so intractable , that it seemed impossible that anything could be done to stop it or even slow it .

Things have changed , and the change can be summarised in a single word : carbon .
For , as the threat of climate change has become more and more clear , there has been an growing perception that the biggest benefit of all that rainforests provide is their function as a carbon store , and the biggest danger from their destruction is the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when they are cut down and burnt .
This is happening on a tremendous scale .
In a band around the tropics , shown in the red in our map , about 13 million hectares of natural forest are being chainsawed and burnt every year – an area about the size of England – and the CO2 emissions released total about 5.8 bn tonnes annually .
This is almost as much as the emissions of the US or China , the two biggest carbon emitters ; it is nearly 20 per cent of the global total , more than the whole of the transport sector across the world , which has always been considered one of the major difficulties in dealing with climate change .
The deforestation emissions of Indonesia and Brazil , for example , are now so great that they propel those countries to fourth and fifth place respectively in the world emissions table although , if their places are based just on burning fossil fuels , they are much lower .
It has become clear to policymakers that the now generally accepted goal of reducing global emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 , in the hope of keeping the rise in temperatures to two degrees above the pre-industrial level – thought of as the danger threshold – will be impossible without tackling forest emissions .
So when the Coalition for Rainforest Nations , a grouping of 40 countries with substantial forest holdings from Costa Rica to Papua New Guinea , proposed in 2005 that there could be an agreement – we preserve our forests , you in the rich world pay us to do so – they were met with a sympathetic response .
The issue is known as Redd , reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries , and you will be increasingly hearing the unfamiliar acronym as the Copenhagen meeting approaches .
For Redd is now a key part of the treaty negotiating process under which , it is hoped , the developing countries will agree to tackle their own , mushrooming greenhouse gases , in return for billions of dollars of new aid .
The principal objective of the Redd agreement , put forward by the EU , with Britain leading in the negotiations , is that " all parties should collectively aim at ... reducing gross deforestation in developing countries by at least 50 per cent by 2020 compared to current levels . "
That is widely supported by environmentalists .
But another phrase in the objective , more supported by tropical nations with big logging industries , is also that " all parties should aim at halting forest cover loss in developing countries by 2030 at the latest " .
To decode the text , " reducing gross deforestation " means in essence slowing the rate at which you cut down your virgin , natural forests .
But " halting forest cover loss " means you can cut down the forests but replace them with other trees , so that " forest cover " , the general area covered in trees , remains the same .
These other trees are likely to be commercial monocultures such as eucalyptus or oil palms , not remotely as valuable ecologically , or as a store of carbon , as virgin forest , and although it might be better to have those trees growing than bare ground , many environmentalists would stress that not cutting the virgin forest down in the first place is the best option of all .
The text is still up for negotiation , but the fact that two potentially conflicting stances can be part of the same first sentence of the proposed treaty shows what a difficult matter it is on which to reach agreement .
Even so , both parts of the objective constitute an ambitious aim , and the use of the phrase " all parties " indicates that we are all in this together ; if they are going to stop deforestation in the developing world , we in the rich world have got to help them .
One of the key aspects of Redd is that is conceived of at a national level ; before , attempts at preventing deforestation tended to be local projects .
Now whole countries are being asked to lower their deforestation rates , if we finance it .
How are we to do so ?
There are three options .
The first is to supply substantial new aid funding ; the second is to let countries with high deforestation rates generate " carbon credits " from the forests they preserve , which could then be sold on the growing international carbon market ; the third is a mixture of both .
Using the carbon market is the most controversial , because some policymakers feel this will provide a vast pool of emissions credits which western countries can buy and thus escape much of the obligation to cut back on emissions of their own ( Brazil 's rule of thumb is that a hectare of forest holds a tonne of carbon ) .
There are further objections , such as the " permanence " of the forest which has generated a carbon credit by being left uncut .
What happens if it is subsequently cut down , or burnt , or even dies off because of climate change ?
But others feel the carbon market will be an essential tool , not least as the total funding needed is likely to be very substantial .
Last year , Johan Eliasch , a Swedish - born , London - based businessman with environmental interests , was asked by Gordon Brown to report on how the preservation of global forests could be financed .
Mr Eliasch estimated that , according to one scenario , this could cost between $ 18n and $ 26bn annually , with perhaps $ 7bn of the funding coming from the carbon market .
The rest would have to be found by the developed countries .
It 'is an enormous sum , but Eliasch thought it was worth it .
" Saving forests is critical for tckling climate change , " he said .
" Without action on deforestation , avoiding the worst aspects of climate change will be next to impossible . "

The “ I do n’t have enough faith to be an atheist ” meme is a very popular tract among people who do n’t read books .
Which makes the title of the book currently being promoted on crossway.org / blog / at the very least an interesting experiment in confirmation bias .
I sent the below comment and as of 5 o’clock GMT it is still “ awaiting moderation ” .
Having faith in human beings , despite a wealth of evidence to suggest this trust is misplaced , is the ultimate act of faith .
It is one which is performed by believers and non-believers every single day .
We trust each - other despite our fears .
Saying that it takes this same kind of rational , functioning faith to be confident of the fact that there is no evidence whatsoever of a supernatural aspect to reality — i.e. , a non-physical realm beyond space - time where a creator judge might reside , fundamentally misrepresents the definition of the word faith and the definition of what it means to be a positive atheist , in the tradition of Bertrand Russell , Thomas Paine , Thomas Jefferson , Mark Twain , Voltaire and so on .
These kinds of books borrow the word faith on behalf of an emotional reaction to criticism and give it back as an insult to intellectual honesty .
They appeal to the already convinced and seek solace in the rightful criticism of dishonest discourse from the same quarter .
There is nothing unreasonable about non-Yahweh worship to non-Christians , anymore than there is anything unreasonable about non-Sun -god worship to Evangelical protestants .
What the religious community has to begin to demonstrate , if extremism of all kinds is to be truly stamped out , is that it recognises the mountain of evidence against its truth - claims , but continues to believe in belief regardless , because of an emotional commitment to cultural and ceremonial traditions .
In so doing , then we might all begin to abandon , in the name of simply honesty , these particularly insidious brands of special pleading which insist the bible to be something it is trivial to prove for a fact it is not .
A report by a British risk analysis company says Australians have overtaken Americans as the world 's biggest carbon dioxide polluters .
The report relies on US Energy Department data to highlight the risks business would face in Australia under a global emissions trading scheme .
UK risk assessment company Maplecroft has puts Australia at the very top of the chart when it comes to per capita emissions of CO2 .
Maplecroft finds Australia 's heavy reliance on coal makes for an average output of 20.58 tonnes of C02 per person per year , compared to 19.78 tonnes in the USA .
China , which recently overtook the US as the world 's biggest greenhouse gas emitter overall , has a per capita average of about 4.5 tonnes per person .
The assessment illustrates how much work Australia will have to do if a global emissions reduction target is introduced .
It also means Australia will have a more difficult time convincing developing countries to take responsibility for cutting emissions .
Whether you look at Australia 's emissions in total or per head of population , it is really just another way of illustrating how hard global climate negotiations are .
Poor countries have more to gain by continuing to pollute and rich countries have more to lose by reining it in .
The chair of climate change at the University of Adelaide , Professor Barry Brook , says even compared to other developed countries , Australia would have a lot more to cut .
" The whole idea of per capita emissions means that for each person you 're responsible for more carbon reduction than someone in an economy which has a lower carbon production such as France for instance , which has about a third of the amount of carbon emissions of an Australian , " Professor Brook said .
' Damaged brand '
The Australian Conservation Foundation 's Tony Mohr says Maplecroft 's ranking of Australia will be noted by the international business community .
" This new report has been produced by a business for businesses and that really shows that the leading businesses are interested in what 's going on , " he said .
" Most businesses in Australia already understand that it's a matter of when , not what if we have a price on greenhouse pollution . "
Dan Atkins is managing director of the Shaper group , which gets paid to help companies cut their carbon footprint .
Mr Atkins says the top polluter status Australians have gained will damage the Australian brand overseas .
" It 's certainly not going to increase our reputation if we remain that way in the next five to 10 years , " he said .
He says growing awareness of " food miles " is something that will directly impact on countries which use coal - fired electricity .
" With Australia being so high in terms of CO2 , that 's going to put us at a competitive disadvantage ; both in terms of brand but also in terms of the actual volume of those carbon labelling systems , " Mr Atkins said .
" So that 's going to put Australian companies who export at a competitive disadvantage . "
But not everyone buys the argument that business is damaged by Australia 's ranking as the number one carbon emitter per capita .
The chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia , Mitch Hooke , says the climate change argument should be about commitments to solutions , not seeking concessions .
" Not getting into this business where the developing countries who have a lot more people and therefore lower per capita emissions think there should be less obligation on them to reduce emissions than the developing counties , " he said .
" That 's why we have this continuous per capita debate .
It 's about trying to shirk blame , it 's about trying to shirk responsibility , yet in actual fact everybody has got to focus on solutions to managing climate change . "
Mr Hooke says even if the Australian economy was shut down , it would only contribute to a lessening of global emissions by 2 per cent .
" The accent should be on technologies and developing the solutions to managing climate change , not getting into this warfare about who has the greatest degree of responsibility , " he said .
" I 'm saying to you even if we accepted that we 're the highest per capita , and therefore that means we should be doing more , you still can't do it if you do n't have the technologies .
" And you still can only shut down the Australian economy to the tune of contributing to about 1.5 per cent of emission to the global problem .
" It begs the question , what more do you want ? "
The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen is just months away .
Professor Barry Brook says the two different ways of deciding who is the biggest polluter is likely to be the biggest stumbling block .
" So it 's a bit of a political game like that .
Australia has about five times the per capita emissions of China for instance but China produces over 20 times the carbon emissions of Australia because China has such a huge population , " he said .
" So you can play around with these numbers all you want but ultimately what matters is the total global carbon budget and unless humanity as a whole can find solutions to that problem , then all of that petty bickering amongst nations about who 's more or less responsible is n't really going to be very helpful .

With its buttery leather seats and brilliant platinum finish , the 2004 Volkswagen Jetta looked like one sweet ride .
Priced at just $ 3,400 , it was an irresistible deal , too .
Unfortunately the online ad exhibited all the signs of a scam : there was no phone number , the car appeared to be on a dealer 's lot and the price was one - third of what a model of its vintage should fetch .
To test our theory , we sent a query through the " contact seller " feature on the website .
In two hours , the " seller " responded .
" My 2004 Volkswagen Jetta is in great shape , no engine problems , damages or hidden defects .
The total price is $ 3,400 CAD including shipping and handling .
The sale will be made through eBay protection program for our safety , " read the syntax - riddled email .
Predictably the car was far away , preventing us from inspecting it .
" I have recently moved from Canada to Washington and I took the car with me , that is why I am sending it from here .
The car is still registered in Canada , it 's E - tested and certified so you wo n't have to pay any custom taxes . "
We bit , agreeing to the price .
We supplied a name and Toronto address , as requested .
The seller replied quickly , sensing a mark .
" I will contact eBay and I will open a case with them about our deal , and they will contact you with more details , and explain better the whole process . "
The eBay name is evoked to create a false sense of security .
In reality , eBay does not service transactions beyond its own website .
An email confirmation arrived within an hour .
The message was fabricated using the site 's logo and a lot of legalese lifted from the eBay website .
It claimed the seller was an eBay Motors member in good standing .
The eBay invoice arrived two minutes later .
It revealed a number of red flags : the reply - to email address was incorrect , no phone number was shown , none of the hyperlinks directed us to the eBay website , and it specified Western Union to handle the money .
Most suspiciously , the invoice instructed us to make a $ 3,000 deposit in the name of Edward Reeves , an " eBay Customer Support Agent " in New York .
Some 45 minutes later , the seller emailed again : " eBay informed me that they have contacted you .
Please let me know if you received the information from them and when you will be able to make the deposit , because I need to know when to start the delivery process . "
We sought to clarify to whom to make the money order , and why the deposit was so large .
Sensing our reluctance , the seller assured us the money would be held in escrow by eBay until the car was delivered and met with our approval .
" You need to make the deposit of the eBay agent 's name and address .
EBay chose the amount of the deposit , but I wo n't be able to receive the payment until you receive the car and decide that you want to keep it or not . "
In reality , the Western Union money transfer would go directly to the bogus seller , who would promptly disappear .
The Jetta , a collection of pilfered images , would never materialize .
We received a reminder 24 hours later , wondering if we managed to make the payment .
We decided to end communications and submitted a crime tip to the New York Police Department , though it 's not known if our tip was pursued .

Out of curiosity , we later found a 2004 Acura TL luxury sedan online for $ 4,800 and made an inquiry .
A female identity responded this time , but the story had a familiar ring to it .
" The total price is $ 4,800 CAD including shipping and handling .
The sale will be through eBay protection program for our safety .
I have recently moved from Canada to Washington after divorce and I took the car with me , that is why I am sending it from here . "

A Party that Can No Longer Be Ignored Will Germany Go Left of the Left ?
At the far - left Left Party headquarters in Berlin there is a conflict of cultures , a war between dreamers and realists , mavericks and demagogues .
Yet the party recently celebrated success in state elections .
Once considered a motley crew of outsiders , the Left Party is an increasingly influential political force in Germany .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama White House on Friday said the $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan approved early this year had saved or created 640,329 jobs so far .
The stimulus package of spending and tax measures , pushed through the U.S. Congress in February by President Barack Obama ’s Democrats , has been heavily criticized by Republicans because it has done little to stop U.S. unemployment from rising to its current 9.8 percent .
Vice President Joe Biden , flanked by the governors of California and Maryland at the White House , said the stimulus actually had a larger impact on the work force .
“ So far we ’ve created over a million jobs , ” Biden said .
“ We ’re only about a third of the way through the package . ”
Those who receive grants and loans through the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act for projects such as highway repair are required to make quarterly reports on how the money has been spent .
The information , which covered $ 160 billion of stimulus obligations through September 30 , was compiled into a national snapshot posted at www.recovery.gov.
Only $ 38 billion of those funds have been paid out , said Jared Bernstein , an economic advisor to Biden .
The majority of jobs backed with stimulus dollars were in education -- 325,000 -- and construction -- 80,000 , the White House said .
BREAKING DOWN THE NUMBERS
Debate has erupted over counting a job as “ saved . ”
Recipients indicate the proportion of pay for a full - time job that is covered by stimulus dollars .
Many do not end up with round numbers and the report does not show how many workers would have lost jobs .
Attendees line up for an interview with a prospective employer at a job fair in Washington , August 6 , 2009 .

Most of the projects in the report are not complete , Bernstein said , indicating the jobs will last for a while .
Earlier this month , a report based on information from recipients showed just federal contracts awarded under the plan had translated into little more than 30,000 jobs .
Critics say the recipient data is incomplete and riddled with inconsistencies , especially in defining a full - time job .
The reports do not capture the job impact of the tax cuts , direct payments to individuals through such programs as Pell Grants for college education and unemployment compensation .
They also do not include projections of jobs that may have been indirectly preserved , such as those from vendors providing supplies to construction firms .
Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell told reporters on Thursday the report undercounts jobs created because it does not include these “ secondary ” effects .
“ It ’s just a fraction of the impact that ’s actually happening , ” said Rendell , a Democrat .
Projections of how many workers now draw paychecks backed by the stimulus range from groups such as the Congressional Budget Office and Moody ’s Economy.com range from 600,000 to 1.53 million .
A recent Labor Department report showed that from September 2008 to last month the country lost more than 1 million jobs , and that since February it has lost more 3 million .
Obama has pledged the stimulus will keep 3 million people employed over its two - year life .
REPUBLICANS SKEPTICAL OF EFFECTS
Republicans said the report ’s numbers were likely overblown and pointed to problems in the earlier contractors report .
“ It ’s bewildering to see the same administration claiming it created 1 million jobs ... especially since it is a sad fact 3 million jobs have been lost since the stimulus was signed into law , ” said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell .
Initially Colorado reported having 4,695 jobs through stimulus contracts , but according to the Denver Post the state revised that recently to 830 jobs .
As Friday ’s report was being posted , Rhode Island announced it had cut its job estimate to 1,489.49 from the 1,703.45 it told the federal government .
There will be further revisions to the numbers , said Ed DeSeve , the former Philadelphia finance director advising the White House on the plan ’s implementation , as recipients and the federal government catch errors .
The U.S. government cannot change or edit the data recipients provide .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said his state has received $ 12.5 billion out of $ 50 billion in stimulus money and pleaded for the rest of it to be distributed soon .
“ It ’s not a Democratic or Republican issue , ” the Republican governor told reporters .
“ It ’s all about jobs , jobs , jobs . ”

I 've heard many interesting papers here at AACL 2009 .
Here 's one of them : Bridget Jankowski , from the University of Toronto , " Grammatical and register variation and change : A multi-corpora perspective on the English genitive " .
She was kind enough to send me a copy of her slides , from which I 've taken ( most of ) the graphs below .
In order to study the history of choices like " Ontario's government " ( s - genitive ) vs. " the government of Ontario " ( of - genitive ) , she created two small historical corpora , sampling Maclean 's magazine and the Hansard transcripts of debates of the Ontario Provincial Legislature at three time points : 1906 , 1956 , and 2006 .
She picked three authors or three speakers from each source at each time point .
All of the speakers and authors were men aged 30 - 60 at the time of the sample .
Her first result is a replication of the observation that the s-genitive has been gaining ground :
Compare , for example , this figure from Hinrichs and Szmrecsanyi , " Recent changes in the function and frequency of standard English genitive constructions : a multivariate analysis of tagged corpora " , English Language and Linguistics 11( 3 ) : 437–474 , 2007 :
Jankowski then broke the trends down further by coding the possessors as
Human : a student ’s schoolwork , Mrs. Hale ’s reaction Organizations ( animate “ collectivities of humans which display some degree of groupidentity ” ) : the local school board ’s ruling ; the federal government ’s plan Places : Canada ’s foreign language press , Ontario ’s roads , the streets of Rome , the raw edge of the world , the people of this American continent Inanimate objects , activities , units of time , states
This made it clear that the increase in use of s-genitives has been especially strong in the case of organizations , and even stronger in the case of places :
Her category 4 ( " Inanimate objects , activities , units of time , states " ) was realized overall with of - genitive 96 % in Maclean ’s and 99 % in Hansard .
So her results are generally consistent with Otto Jespersen 's observation in A Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles : Part VII ( 1949 ) that
In poetry and in higher literary style , the genitive of lifeless things is used in many cases where of would be used in ordinary speech . [… ]
During the last few years the genitive of lifeless things has been gaining ground , ( especially among journalists ) …
but only if " lifeless things " is taken to include organizations and places , and not " inanimate objects , activities , units of time , states " .
She also compared her results to data from a corpus of conversational speech collected recently in Toronto , using speaker age to create two " apparent time " collections comparable to the 1956 and 2006 samples .
This suggests that in the spoken language , human possessors have almost always gotten the s-genitive , consistently across time , while inanimate possessors ( in this graph including her categories 3 and 4 ) have consistently gotten the of - genitive :
On this analysis , the increase in s-genitives for human possessors in Maclean 's magazine makes the journalistic prose more and more like the spoken language ; but the parallel increase in s-genitives for inaminate possessors makes the journalistic prose less and less speech - like .
Her presentation also considered the effect of the length of the possessor ( a shorter possessor is more likely to take an s- genitive ) and the possessum ( " shorter possessum will be more likely to take an of - genitive and so appear first in the construction , while a longer possessum is more likely to take the s- genitive " ) , as well as other relevant features such as " lexical density " :
and " thematicity " :
and did a multivariate analysis of all the various factors taken together .
You 'll have to read her ( I trust forthcoming ) paper to learn how it all comes out — I have a 6:40 a.m. plane to catch — but I hope that this much is enough to convince you that there 's a rich and interesting pattern of variation to be untangled here .
It certainly convinced me .
And it also increased my general feeling that the time is right for the application of automatic or semi-automatic methods of analysis ( here in assigning her four categories of possessors , in determining the lengths of the possessor and possessum constituents , in counting local phrases co-referential with the possessor , etc. ) to the study of syntactic variation across time , genre , register and so on .
Because she had to annotate everything by hand , Jankowski 's sample was fairly small — 50 K words of Maclean's , and 100K words of Hansards .
With automatic or semi-automatic annotation , she could look at larger collections with denser time samples of more sources , and easily add other features , like various word and phrase frequencies , grammatical role and phrasal position of the whole genitive construction , etc .

Not long ago , I started an experiment in self - binding : intentionally creating an obstacle to behavior I was helpless to control , much the way Ulysses lashed himself to his ship ’s mast to avoid succumbing to the Sirens ’ song .
In my case , though , the irresistible temptation was the Internet .
But before I began , I wondered about the genesis of the term “ self - binding . ”
So I hopped online and found Jon Elster , a professor of political science at Columbia University , whose book “ Ulysses Unbound ” explores whether voluntarily restricting your choices enhances or curtails freedom .
That reminded me : I had n’t read “ The Odyssey ” since college , and because I was pretty sure that my copy was at the bottom of a carton of books in faraway Minneapolis , I Googled the original text .
I browsed several versions before downloading what seemed like the best translation .
Because my interest lay specifically with the Sirens ( quick Web break to make sure that should be uppercase ) , I sifted through a variety of classicists ’ interpretations of their role .
Then — and this seemed reasonable enough — I searched for the “ Sirens ” episode in James Joyce ’s “ Ulysses . ”
I ca n’t quite recollect how I got to the video for the song “ Sirens , ” by the alternative rock group AVA , but that put me in mind of Blink - 182 ( with whom AVA shares a frontman ) , so I clicked over to that band ’s site to check for any updates on the release of its new album , then watched its reunion performance from February ’s Grammy Awards .

And that is why I need the mast .
It came in the form of an app called Freedom , which blocks your Internet access for up to eight hours at a stretch .
The only way to get back online is to reboot your computer , which — though not as foolproof as , say , removing the modem entirely and overnighting it to yourself ( another strategy I ’ve contemplated ) — is cumbersome and humiliating enough to be an effective deterrent .
The program was developed by Fred Stutzman , a graduate student in information and library science , whose own failsafe self - binding technique — writing at a cafe without Internet access — came undone when the place went wireless .
“ We ’re moving toward this era where we ’ll never be able to escape from the cloud , ” he told me .
“ I realized the only way to fight back was at an individual , personal level . ”

MASONTOWN , Pa. 
For years , residents here complained about the yellow smoke pouring from the tall chimneys of the nearby coal - fired power plant , which left a film on their cars and pebbles of coal waste in their yards .
Five states  including New York and New Jersey  sued the plant ’s owner , Allegheny Energy , claiming the air pollution was causing respiratory diseases and acid rain .
So three years ago , when Allegheny Energy decided to install scrubbers to clean the plant ’s air emissions , environmentalists were overjoyed .
The technology would spray water and chemicals through the plant ’s chimneys , trapping more than 150,000 tons of pollutants each year before they escaped into the sky .
But the cleaner air has come at a cost .
Each day since the equipment was switched on in June , the company has dumped tens of thousands of gallons of wastewater containing chemicals from the scrubbing process into the Monongahela River , which provides drinking water to 350,000 people and flows into Pittsburgh , 40 miles to the north .
“ It ’s like they decided to spare us having to breathe in these poisons , but now we have to drink them instead , ” said Philip Coleman , who lives about 15 miles from the plant and has asked a state judge to toughen the facility ’s pollution regulations .
“ We ca n’t escape . ”
As many heard the other day Netflix will finally be streaming to the PS3 gaming console .
What many did n’t hear is that streaming Netflix to the PS3 wont be done through an application on the XMB menu system , but instead will be using BD Live through a special Blu - Ray Disc to stream content .
The interesting part is that this may be due to a loophole in Microsoft ’s Netflix exclusivity deal .
Hit the jump for more details …
Yes Netflix will be coming to the PS3 , but how when Microsoft have claimed they have exclusivity ?
Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities , everyone ’s favorite video game industry analyst , claims that this workaround avoids violating Netflix and Microsoft ’s exclusivity deal by streaming Netflix to the PS3 via BD Live .
Gamespot and Joystiq have contacted Netflix for more specifics and here are the main details :

Judging from the 70 + reader comments , many from present or former IBM employees , my last column about the arrest of IBM Sr. VP Bob Moffat on insider trading charges hit a nerve .
In a few hours I ’ll be posting another column on a completely different topic , but I ca n’t let this one go without making one more observation .
It has been almost a week since Moffat was arrested and in that time , as far as I can tell , IBM has made no comment on the case to the press or even to its own employees .
Why no comment ?
I ’ve been wondering that aloud for the last day or two , asking my friends and almost anyone I meet why IBM would be so foolish not to at least issue a press release on the arrest ?
After all , the company supposedly cooperated with the SEC investigation .
They should have known the arrest was coming .
Why were n’t they ready with at least some statement reaffirming corporate values or possibly distancing themselves from Moffat ?
Does n’t IBM management owe that to its 398,000 employees ?
They removed Moffat ’s bio from the IBM web site , but that ’s all .
Lack of comment suggests Big Blue does n’t know what to say .
Perhaps the company is paralyzed .
Maybe there is disagreement in the executive ranks about how to handle the problem .
Maybe Moffat , himself , was the guy who would have helped craft any response but now he ’s unavailable .
Beats me .
But it does n’t smell good .
My Mom , who is 85 and , like me , does n’t own any IBM shares , may have put it to me the best .
“ My guess is that this is n’t over , ” she predicted .
“ IBM could declare him innocent until proven guilty or they could write him off , but the fact they have said nothing at all means there are probably more shoes to fall .
They could announce an investigation to ferret out others who made the same mistakes , whether those others exist or not .
And that ’s what they would have done , had all the remaining guilt lay below Moffat ’s level .
But it probably does n’t .

The video from the first game of the Lingerie Football League ‘s season is beginning to find its way online , and the highlight is certainly this doozy :
The Quarterback for the Chicago Bliss is sacked , and her shorts are pulled down revealing a bit of ass .
Obviously the fans love it .
Thanks to Getty Images , there is photographic evidence :
Chicago Bliss ’ quarterback Ellie Cartabiano trys to get away from Miami Caliente ’s Annette Mascaro during first half play of the opening game of the Lingerie Football League ( LFL ) at the Sears Centre Arena September 4 , 2009 in Hoffman Estates , Illinois .
Here is a foreign piece utilizing the same video and some other shots :
I have no idea what they are saying , but I like it .
Here is some additional video showing Chicago scoring , en route to their 29 - 19 defeat of the Miami Caliente :
… and some other random footage of the Caliente on offense :
Overall the footage is pretty scarce as it was only available as a pay per view web event , and not on television .
We were able to find this Photo from the Chicago Tribune , which shows our girl Danielle Moinet with none other than Coach Ditka ( a new investor ) :
… and finally for the best view of the action , we check out this video :

If the seemingly unending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ever do come to a close and a new war with Iran , Somalia , or Sudan can somehow be avoided , the most serious long term damage from the conflicts will be to the fundamental freedoms that Americans have cherished for more than two hundred years .
The erosion of America ’s liberties has been driven by fear of terrorism but it is enabled by leaps in technology coupled with new legislation and a police state mentality that have made every citizen a target .
Hate crimes and laws targeting the internet provide a framework that relies on advanced monitoring technology to criminalize behavior that would have been considered off limits for privacy reasons ten years ago .
The National Security Agency can monitor every phone call made in the United States and quite likely every e-mail .
European security agencies have the same capabilities and have gone far down the road of legitimizing state intrusion into private activities , limiting free speech and free association .
In Britain , most cities and highways are now monitored by CCTV cameras and the police have begun to use aerial drones to observe and record demonstrations of groups considered to be extreme including the right wing British National Party .
New legislation in Germany will require all internet users to be licensed with a backtracking feature that will enable the government to determine where any internet transmission originated .
The new regulations will require all users to have a tamper proof internet ID and will be enforced by special police .
All telecommunications data , to include both internet and telephone , is already retained by the German service providers for six months , a law that has been in effect since 2008 .
The government can obtain the stored information by court order .
It is particularly interesting to note what German politicians and officials said in support of the new legislation .
One commented that it is necessary to stop the internet from becoming a " lawless chaos room . "
Another described the internet as a " source of criminality , terrorism , and much similar filth . "
Yet another said " What is illegal offline is also illegal online . "
Countries like China and Iran already control the servers for internet as well as the cell phone centers in their country and have not been shy about shutting down communications .
In many places in Europe internet services are often screened by software that blocks certain websites and the use of words or phrases that are considered objectionable .
This screening is also becoming common in hotels and other public places that offer internet services in the United States .
But what is really dangerous is the combination of technologies that make it possible to control the internet with legislation that gives the authorities the ability to go after users who are deemed to be breaking the law , such as is happening in Germany .
Can there be any doubt that the monitoring of the internet to control " terrorism " and " filth " will in fairly short order also be used to repress the viewpoints of individuals and groups that are considered to be politically unacceptable ?
And what better weapon to use against dissidents than the criminal justice system , most particularly the hate crime legislation that is becoming both increasingly more common and more draconian in both the United States and in Europe ?
Hate crimes are the antithesis of the old principles that there is " equal justice under law " and that " justice is blind . "
They essentially create specially protected classes of people within the criminal justice system , permitting selective enforcement of the law .
Normally when there is an crime , the police investigate and make an arrest and the judiciary prosecutes .
The perpetrator is punished in a manner proportionate to the seriousness of the offense .
But if an incident is deemed a hate crime , i.e. that it may have been motivated by prejudice or bigotry , the penalties are harsher and the federal government has the option of trying the suspect if the state court for some reason fails to convict .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid justified the dismantling of two thousand years of jurisprudence recently , saying " " There is a difference between assaulting someone to steal his money or doing so because he is gay , or disabled , or Latino or Muslim . "
Reid ’s interesting interpretation notwithstanding , many would argue that hate crimes create an unconstitutional special tier of justice while the ability to try someone twice constitutes double jeopardy .
Hate crimes in Europe , Canada , and Australia include speech .
It is illegal to criticize any ethnic or religious group , homosexuals , the disabled , gypsies , or the elderly .
The European Union even defines anti-Semitism , including in its definition any criticism alleging that Jews might be more loyal to Israel than to their own country of residence .
An Australian professor who wrote a letter criticizing large scale immigration from Africa because it would bring an increase in crime and social problems was summoned before the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and charged with a hate crime .
Another Australian was arrested and charged when he wrote a letter complaining that the numerous Israeli art students selling their wares in Perth might be engaged in espionage .
In Canada , the Canadian Jewish Congress complained that demonstrators criticizing of Israel ’s invasion of Gaza " demonized Jews and Israelis " and demanded an investigation by the Canadian Human Rights Commission .
Hate crimes in many countries punish not only one ’s actions , but also one ’s motives and even one ’s thoughts , if they can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of a judge or prosecutor .
America ’s new HR 1913 " Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Act " together with Senate bill S -909 claim only to prohibit actual crimes and not regulate free speech , but it is n’t necessarily so .
The Senate bill specifically includes " conspiracy to commit a hate crime " as a criminal offense .
The legislation is drawn so loosely that a district attorney can proceed in virtually any case where there is even a suspicion that something hateful might have motivated the perpetrator .
How some activist judges will exploit the lack of any strict guidelines can easily be imagined .
Membership in groups that have what are regarded as extremist policies has been ruled to be enough to bring a prosecution .
And sometimes not even that " extremist . "
A Pennsylvania hate crime prosecution involved Christians who protested a homosexual gathering by carrying signs and singing hymns .
They were charged with felonies .
As should be obvious , free speech on certain issues will quickly run headlong into the hate laws , and not surprisingly , the side that can hire the lawyers to make its case will likely win , First Amendment be damned .
The Anti-Defamation League , which has been a strong supporter of all hate crime legislation , has made it clear that it considers criticism of Israel to be anti-Semitism and therefore a hate crime .
Some leading supporters of the laws have also explicitly included any opposition to Zionism , which they equate to denying Israel ’s right to exist , and any comparison of Israeli behavior with Nazi Germany .
Pro-Israeli groups have been extremely active in promoting hate crime legislation because of their belief that such laws can be used to mitigate criticism of Israel , but the real issue is that the conjunction of hate legislation and the technical ability to regulate the mechanisms of dissent like the internet are creating a new dynamic in which many groups and even governments will be able to exploit the legal system to shield themselves from criticism .
So welcome to the new world order .
In five years , all internet will likely be monitored and regulated , following the German model .
Hate crime legislation will make it illegal to criticize any group or country if it can plausibly or even implausibly be construed that such criticism reflects bias , permitting judges to silence anyone who opposes the status quo .
Together , the technology and the new laws will quite possibly put the websites that readers of Antiwar.com peruse daily out of business .
MELBOURNE is headed the way of Los Angeles , with sprawling suburbs and growing traffic woes because of strong population growth and poor planning , experts and developers have warned .
Federal Treasury has estimated that in the next 40 years Melbourne 's population will increase by up to 75 per cent , to almost 7 million residents .
Based on the State Government 's latest growth projections and land requirements , Melbourne would need to build 1.8 million dwellings to meet the population demand , and its urban boundary would need to expand by 123,000 hectares .
Half of the new homes would be in growth areas .
'' Melbourne cannot survive this kind of sprawl - we are going to end up the way American cities are going .
It is a horrendous future and the Government has got to stop it happening , '' RMIT University associate professor Michael Buxton said .
'' If you look at a city like London , it has a boundary that has been fundamentally unchanged now for over 60 years and they just keep finding vast amounts of land within the metropolitan area , '' he said .

" Does the sun ever shine during a Democratic administration ? " asked Jon Stewart on a recent edition of The Daily Show , in a nod to the rightwing hysteria over the current White House incumbent .
" With Obama in office now , when babies laugh do you hear only the sound of kittens drowning ? "
Stewart is a comedian , but this is no laughing matter .
The lies perpetrated against Obama – that he is a foreigner , a Marxist , a Nazi , a racist , intent on interning the elderly and euthanising the disabled – and the ensuing hatred and virulence , have reached fever pitch .
I could only rub my eyes in disbelief when I saw footage of one protester standing outside an Obama town hall meeting in New Hampshire with a loaded handgun strapped to his leg , holding a placard proclaiming : " It is time to water the tree of liberty , " in reference to the Thomas Jefferson quote " The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of tyrants and patriots . "
In Maryland , one man went even further , holding up a sign saying : " Death to Obama " and " Death to Michelle and her two stupid kids " .
This militant , rightwing craziness comes on the back of the now - infamous ad published in a Pennsylvania newspaper in May , calling for Obama to be assassinated – and , of course , in the wake of a presidential election campaign in which crowds at Republican rallies shouted " Kill him ! " , as well as " Treason ! " " Terrorist ! " and " Off with his head ! "
Less than a year on , and under the spurious guise of a " row " over healthcare , we are left , in the words of investigative journalist Chip Berlet , with " a very dangerous situation that can spin off ' lone wolf ' individuals who decide now is the time to act against people they see as an enemy . "
So why are Republican politicians fanning the flames with talk of " death panels " and Nazism ?
Why are pundits like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh indulging in what the historian Richard Hoftstader described as the " paranoid style " in American politics ?
Do they really not understand that this hysterical wave of hatred and fury against Obama goes beyond healthcare reform , or party politicking , or even the country 's so - called " culture wars " , and now threatens the life of their elected head of state ?
Do they want to be held responsible , through their extreme and dishonest rhetoric and hate - filled divisiveness , for the death of America 's first black president ?
Critics might accuse me of being alarmist , not to mention tasteless .
To even speculate about the assassination of the president is deemed crass and unseemly .
They might point out that this is 2009 and not 1962 , and a lone gunman stands little chance against the modern might of the United States Secret Service .
Perhaps .
But federal agents are concerned about a rise in the number of heavily armed militia groups springing up around the country .
A report this month from the veteran civil rights organisation , the Southern Poverty Law Centre , claimed 50 new extremist militia groups had formed in less than two years , driven by distrust of the government and now angered at having an African - American in the White House .
A spokesman cautioned that the groups had not yet reached the point of violent anti-minority , anti-government attacks , " but we seem to be getting there " .
The report also quoted one senior federal law enforcement official , Bart McEntire , as saying : " You 're seeing the bubbling right now .
You see people buying into what they 're saying .
It 's primed to grow . "
Where will it end ?
Watching television footage of deranged US conservatives screaming hysterical threats at their elected representatives in town hall meetings across America , some turning up to the protests carrying assault rifles , I can't help but be reminded of similar scenes from Israel in the mid-1990s .
In those days , peace - making premier Yitzhak Rabin could not go out in public without being booed or heckled .
He was vilified by the Israeli right in public demonstrations and portrayed as a Nazi and accused of treason by the settler movement .
Members of his party were physically harassed and had their lives threatened .
Sound familiar ?
The mainstream Israeli right was , in the words of Middle East analyst Geoffrey Aronson , " content to lend its aura of respectability to many of these incidents , some of which occurred , without condemnation , during rallies addressed by [ Likud ] party officials .
Netanyahu … saw political advantage in the increasingly poisonous atmosphere . "
Rabin , as we know , was eventually assassinated , despite all his security – killed by a lone gunman .
But his widow Leah never forgave Netanyahu or the Israeli right for indulging the vitriolic rhetoric of the settlers and fostering the hate - drenched atmosphere that led to her husband 's murder .
You might argue that the analogy is flawed and that America is not Israel .
Indeed .
Israel has lost only one of its leaders to an assassin 's bullet .
The US has lost four .
If , God forbid , Obama were to go the way of Lincoln , Garfield , McKinley and Kennedy , as that Pennsylvania newspaper ad demanded , 21st - century America would be engulfed by violence and protests on a scale not seen since the 19th - century civil war .
The country would tear itself apart .
Republicans should beware .
They are playing with fire .
Richard Strandlof said he survived the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon .
He said he survived again when a roadside bomb went off in Iraq , killing four fellow Marines .
He ’d point to his head and tell people he had a metal plate , collateral damage from the explosion .
None of it was true .
On Friday , the FBI arrested him on the rare charge of “ stolen valor . ”
Strandlof , 32 , was held “ for false claims about receipt of military decorations or medals , ” an FBI news release said .
Charges had been filed in Denver , Colorado , the week before , the bureau .
“ The penalty for his crime is up to one year incarceration and a $ 100,000 fine , ” it said .
Before his deception was revealed , crowds ate up his story .
He canvassed Colorado appearing at the sides of politicians .
Inspiring and seemingly authentic , he spoke on behalf of veterans at the state Capitol .
He formed a group called the Colorado Veterans Alliance .
The whole thing was a lie , he admitted to CNN ’s Anderson Cooper earlier this year .
Watch Strandlof discuss case in June .
He was n’t at the Pentagon .
He was never a Marine .
He never served his country .
He never graduated from the Naval Academy .
He claimed his real name was Rick Duncan .
Where was he on 9/11 , the day he said he witnessed heroism firsthand “ I was in San Jose , California , watching it in horror on TV with a few other people , ” Strandlof told CNN .
He was at a homeless shelter at the time .
Strandlof denies being a pathological liar .
He says he suffered from “ some severely underdiagnosed mental illness ” and he got caught up in the moment around “ people who are passionate and loved what they did . ”
He told CNN he had put on a “ production , which I ’m sorry for . ”
“ Hopefully the people that I hurt can in some way gain closure from that , and I myself do n’t know what I can do , short of leaving them alone and not being in their lives , to make that happen , ” Strandlof said .
He said he ’s not sure exactly how he ’s hurt people .
“ It ’s not for me to say , and time will tell , ” he said .
Hal Bidlack , a former Air Force lieutenant colonel , is one of those people .
He ran for Congress as a Democrat and had Strandlof appear with him .
Bidlack — who lost to incumbent Republican Doug Lamborn — is n’t too happy .
“ Once one lie fell apart , the whole series of things … just cascaded into an ocean of lies , ” he said .
Bidlack was at the Pentagon when it came under attack on September 11 , 2001 .
He now realizes that Strandlof stole portions of his own story .
“ Now that we know he ’s a lying fraud , ” Bidlack said , “ I think he was just parroting my own story back to me . ”
“ There are an awful lot of things that he kept straight to try to fool an awful lot of people for an awful long time . ”
Doug Sterner has catalogued hundreds of people claiming to be military veterans who never served in the military .
He says it ’s typical for those perpetuating the hoaxes to claim mental illness .
“ I do n’t buy that , ” Sterner said .
“ What he was doing was looking for a cause to promote himself .
I see this repeatedly .
I ’ve had a hundred cases just this year like Rick Strandlof ’s . …
What they ’re doing is building a kingdom of self and feeding their own ego . ”
Sterner has pushed for a federal database listing the names and citations of all decorated military veterans to help put an end to such cases .
He said Strandlof has robbed true veterans of their veracity .
“ Doing good does not take away from the bad that he did , ” he said .
“ Because of Rick Strandlof , the next global war on terrorism veteran that speaks in a school or talks to the media or gets involved in politics is going to be questioned . ”
Ryan Gallucci , a spokesman for AMVETS , agreed .
“ Strandlof ’s actions dishonor the actual sacrifices of veterans , ” he told CNN Monday .
“ Second , by commissioning his own advocacy group , Strandlof diverted philanthropy dollars for legitimate causes within the veterans community , ” Gallucci said .
“ Personally , it just sickens me , ” Gallucci added .
“ As a veteran of the war in Iraq , it ’s unfathomable that someone would propagate such a lie at a time when American men and women are actually putting their lives on the line , and American families are coping with the loss of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice . ”
According to the Denver Post , Strandlof came to authorities ’ attention first in 1997 , when he was sentenced to five years on forgery and bad - check charges .
The FBI was investigating him for fraud when he spoke to CNN — a charge he denied .
“ We did not take money to use on non-veterans projects .
I did not enrich myself on this .
I did not gain any money from this , ” he said .
He has not been charged with fraud .
That ’s not the point , said Sterner .
“ The one thing he robbed from every veteran that comes out now is credibility . ”
Gallucci called Strandlof a “ con man ” and the case “ morally repugnant . ”
“ Strandlof ’s actions are exploitation plain and simple , and AMVETS is eager to see justice served , ” Gallucci said .
Some time ago we advised to uninstall the Microsoft .NET Framework assistant because it was breaking some Firefox extensions .
Of course , as many noticed at that time , having add - ons from Microsoft installed into Firefox behind your back by a Windows update also expanded the attack surface of the Mozilla browser , by adding the possible ( likely ) vulnerabilities of Microsoft 's technology to the mix .
Ironically , this is the very argument used by Microsoft itself against Google Frame .
This easy precognition is reality now .
According to Microsoft ,
MS09 -054 addresses an IE vulnerability ( CVE - 2009 - 2529 ) , which was discovered and presented by Mark Dowd , Ryan Smith , and David Dewey at the BlackHat conference in July . [...]
A browse - and - get - owned attack vector exists .
All that is needed is for a user to be lured to a malicious website . [...]
While the vulnerability is in an IE component , there is an attack vector for Firefox users as well .
The reason is that .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 installs a â€ œWindows Presentation Foundationâ€ plug - in in Firefox .
Via this plug - in it is possible to launch XBAP , and reach this vulnerability , from within Firefox .
The Windows Presentation Foundation plugin enables " XAML Browser Applications " ( XBAPs ) to run into your browser .

The law firm at the centre of an unprecedented attempt by a British oil trading firm to prevent the Guardian reporting parliamentary proceedings is to be reported to the Law Society , it emerged today .
Gordon Brown described the case as " unfortunate " when he was quizzed about the matter during prime minister 's questions in the Commons today .
And he said the justice secretary , Jack Straw , had spoken to the parties concerned to try to resolve the issue .
Brown spoke after Conservative Peter Bottomley told MPs he was reporting Carter - Ruck , the law firm that acted on behalf of Trafigura , to the Law Society , saying that no lawyers should be able to inhibit the reporting of parliament .
" I will be seeking their advice on whether it is proper for any lawyer to purport or intend to inhibit the reporting of parliament , " Bottomley told the Guardian .
" It is the job of the press to make aware to all what is known by a few .
Any court action which inhibits that should be approved at a very high level , with full justifications , and in normal circumstances , should not be made in secret . "
Carter - Ruck was accused of infringing the supremacy of parliament yesterday after it insisted that an injunction obtained against the Guardian prevented the paper from reporting a question tabled on Monday by the Labour MP Paul Farrelly .
Farrelly 's question was about the implications for press freedom of an order obtained by Trafigura preventing the Guardian and other media from publishing the contents of a report related to the dumping of toxic waste in Ivory Coast .
In yesterday 's edition of the paper , the Guardian was prevented from identifying Farrelly , reporting the nature of his question , where the question could be found , which company had sought the gag , or even which order was constraining its coverage .
But numerous users of the social networking site Twitter posted details of Farrelly 's question and by yesterday morning , the full text had been published on two prominent blogs as well as in the magazine Private Eye .
Carter - Ruck withdrew its gagging attempt by lunchtime , shortly before a 2 pm high court hearing at which the Guardian was about to challenge its stance , with the backing of other national newspapers .
Yesterday Carter - Ruck , whose partner Adam Tudor has been representing Trafigura , issued a press release conceding : " The order would indeed have prevented the Guardian from reporting on the parliamentary question which had been tabled for later this week . "
But the firm said the Guardian 's reporting on the issue had been " highly misleading " .
The firm added : " There is no question of Trafigura seeking to gag the media from reporting parliamentary proceedings , and the parties have now agreed to an amendment to the existing order so as to reflect that . "
Carter - Ruck has been contacted for comment .

Pregnancy ends in death for one in eight mothers in Sierra Leone
By Barry Mason
7 October 2009
Back in 1997 the incoming Labour government in Britain loudly trumpeted its intention to follow an “ ethical foreign policy , ” using humanitarian concerns to pursue an interventionist strategy .
This was strongly endorsed by the Foreign Office first under Robin Cook and later under Jack Straw .
One of the Labour government ’s first opportunities to put this policy into practice was in Sierra Leone .
The former British colony suffered a decade - long civil war , which officially ended in 2002 .
The conflict , which was fuelled by the diamonds with which the country is richly endowed , cost the lives of tens of thousands .
The opposition Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) , backed by the regime of Charles Taylor in neighbouring Liberia , gratuitously hacked off the limbs of men , women and children .
It presented a perfect case for a supposedly humanitarian intervention .
The British intervention in 2000 aimed to prop up the corrupt regime of Ahmad Kabbah , who had come to power in 1996 in a disputed election with the civil war already in progress .
For the British establishment it was a welcome return to the world stage .
The Daily Telegraph , a paper close to the military , described it as “ the most ambitious attempt by Britain to involve itself in an African nation ’s affairs since the colonial era . ”
Now , almost a decade later , the results of that intervention are clear to see in a recent report on the dire situation facing pregnant women in Sierra Leone .
The report has been drawn up by the human rights advocacy group Amnesty International ( AI ) .
Women in Sierra Leone have a one - in - eight chance of dying from the complications associated with pregnancy and childbirth .
Thousands of girls and young women are dying each year from problems that are easily treatable if resources were made available .
Most of the deaths occur in the home , others while making hazardous journeys in private transport .
Others die in spite of reaching a health facility because the necessary treatment is unavailable .
The report notes the effect of various delays in the system .
Initially women delay seeking treatment for complications because of a lack of knowledge or lack of money .
Further delays occur once a decision has been taken to seek help due to poor transport infrastructure .
On average , an 11 - mile journey is needed to reach the nearest hospital or clinic .
Once at a medical facility further delays can result from the lack of finance to pay for the treatment or because of a lack of staff or necessary resources at the facility .
The major causes of maternal death are obstructed labour , haemorrhage , anaemia and ruptured uterus .
Another major cause is the lack of safe blood transfusion facilities .
These are relatively simple things to overcome , given sufficient resources .
Less than 20 percent of births occur in a medical facility , and only around 40 percent of women giving birth have the support of a skilled attendant .
The lack of midwifery staff and medical intervention contributes to the deaths .
Of the 13 administrative districts that make up Sierra Leone , six of them provide no obstetric care .
Less than 10 percent of women have access to contraceptives , making unplanned and risky pregnancies the lot of most .
The World Bank , the British government ’s Department for International Development and UNICEF are supposed to be funding a Reproductive and Child Health Strategic Plan .
The AI report makes it clear that the fine words have had little effect on the ground .
Funding is grossly inadequate .
Government and donor financing amounts to only US $ 16 per capita per year , compared to US $ 45 per capita that comes from patients and their families .
Britain did not just send troops into Sierra Leone .
British personnel are involved in running the state machine that is so palpably failing women and children .
Despite claiming that this was a humanitarian intervention , the main interest of the Labour government lay in the immense natural resources that Sierra Leone possesses .
There are known large deposits of bauxite , iron ore , gold and diamonds , while gas and oil deposits have been discovered off the coast of the country .
Yet Sierra Leone remains one of the poorest countries in the world .
Former Prime Minister Tony Blair retains a personal interest in Sierra Leone .
Commenting on an investment conference due to take place in London this November , the current Sierra Leone president , Ernest Koroma said , “ I am very pleased to announce this Investment Conference that I will be attending with my good friend , Tony Blair .
“ Last year , the country was named the ‘ easiest place to open a new business ’ in West Africa by the World Bank .
From minerals to fishing , from agriculture to energy , the opportunities for investors are enormous and tangible ….
“ For example , tourism is increasing — the first guidebook to the country has already sold out , and we are one of Lonely Planet ’s top 10 destinations this year .
We have beautiful beaches , world class fishing and diving , and a rich cultural and historical heritage to explore . ”
The business magazine Entrepreneur carried an article on its
Web site earlier this year entitled , “ Back in Business : Sierra Leone ’s President and CEO . ”
It commented , “ In a visit to Sierra Leone in April 2009 , Tony Blair …reported that the outlook for Sierra Leone was now the most positive that he had ever seen… economic possibilities offered by tourism h[ave ] given the country a real chance [ of ] becoming an African success story . ”
It is in this British “ success story ” in Africa that women and children are dying because of the absence of the most elementary healthcare facilities .
See the Amnesty International report “ Out of Reach : The Cost of Maternal Health in Sierra Leone ” .
Future handsets will all be able to use the universal charger
A new mobile phone charger that will work with any handset has been approved by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) , a United Nations body .
Industry body the GSMA says that 51,000 tonnes of redundant chargers are generated each year .
Currently most chargers are product or brand specific , so people tend to change them when they upgrade to a new phone .
However , the new energy - efficient chargers can be kept for much longer .
The GSMA also estimates that they will reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 13.6 m tonnes .
" This is a significant step in reducing the environmental impact of mobile charging , " said Malcolm Johnson , director of ITU 's Telecommunication Standardisation Bureau .
" Universal chargers are a common - sense solution that I look forward to seeing in other areas . "
The charger has a micro-USB port at the connecting end , using similar technology to digital cameras .
It is not compulsory for manufacturers to adopt the new chargers but the ITU says that some have already signed up to it .
" We are planning to launch the universal charger internationally during the first half of 2010 , " Aldo Liguori , spokesperson for Sony Ericsson told the BBC .
" We will roll it out with new products as they launch . "

Huh ?
Web Operating Systems ?
Yeah that ’s right !
Now even a noob should be aware what the heck Cloud Computing means and that Web OS must be something on the Cloud … or more precisely something that resembles an OS on the Internet .
It ’s been years before the industry has somewhat finally arrived at a much mature from of Virtualization with several virtualization products released being used at the enterprise level .
Web OS is defined as a virtual desktop somewhere on the internet which is not bound to one physical location and in effect you carry your desktop anywhere you go .
It ’s different from something called remote PC access which is actually accessing your PC that is bound to one physical location and which can be accessed through network after proper authentication and softwares that do the work .
Here are some of the top web Operating Systems that are making headlines especially after all the craze for Netbooks for which OS which are located on the net are ideally suited .
1 ) iCloud
iCLoud comes loaded with anything you find on a normal desktop : most common apps like email client and browser chat client and of course online storage of up to 50 GB with a sleek file browser and other utilities .
Features :
Online Storage : Familiar interface , Files can be managed through Windows Explorer as well which is really handy .
Productivity Tools : Calendars , which can also be shared , nice email app , MS Office compatible Word editor and personal manager .
Entertainment : iPlay which is a great Audio player .
Movie player where you can organize all your favorite Youtube and MetaCafe videos .
Photo Organizer which sharing capability
All in all , it ’s one of the best web OS and that ’s why it tops the list here
Here a video that explains more :
2 ) JoliCloud
JoliCloud is primarily targeted at Netbooks and hence comes packed with almost everything a net - savvy geek would require .
You can easily install in on your favorite netbook and it has a ready support for connectivity hardware like WiFi , Bluetooth and 3G modems .
The call the personal desktop your ‘ homebase ’
It comes packed with pretty much everything !
You have Facebook , Skype , Gmail ( you can try other email clients too ) , Twitter and my favorite Google Reader .
What else you would need on your netbook ?
The best thing is that you can live - sync updates from your netbook to your JoliCloud homebase whenever you are connected to the internet .
And if you ’re wondering if your netbook ’s hardware has support issues , you can always check the support hardware list here .
Here is how some of your favorite apps feel like on JoliCloud :
The great thing is that you can use Zoho apps on JoliCloud and they work perfectly fine as the Zoho Writer in the screenshot above .
3 ) eyeOS
eyeOS can be installed on Netbooks as well as can be used at the organization level by installing it on the server .
It ’s yet another beautiful internet OS with a decent design and loaded with all the necessary apps you would require .
You can create your own account which will create a personalized desktop on the Internet for you which can then be accessed from any machine with internet .
Here are the screenshots of some of the cool apps running on eyeOS .
Address book :
Productivity app :
App manager :
eyeOS is OpenSource and there are many different flavors available and the eyeOS has a buzzing developer community
5 ) Cloudo
Cloudo is yet another internet OS but they like to describe it as a webservice that can run all your favorite web apps on the cloud for you which in effect is same as an Internet OS .
I really like Cloudo ’s interface .
Cloudo comes packed with all of your favorite apps and you can not only access your Cloudo desktop from PCs but also from a mobile phone !
Everyday is Halloween for this clown
It ’s been more than four months since the House Republican leadership broke their promise to release a health reform alternative , and Representative Paul Ryan has yet to offer a meaningful alternative .
Acknowledging the fact that House Republicans have no actual solutions , in what can only be described as a Halloween trick , today the Republican Party of ‘ No Health Reform ’ circulated a memo on how to kill health insurance reform without “ making the Republican Party look bad . ”
“ As a Member of Congress who does n’t have to worry about the taxpayer - funded health insurance for themselves or their family , it ’s easy for Representative Ryan to just say ‘ no ’ to health insurance reform and play tricks on his constituents while continuing to put big health insurance companies first , ” said Ryan Rudominer , spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
“ But , the people of Representative Ryan 's district deserve more than his offering how - to guides for killing health insurance reform ‘ without making the Republican Party look bad , ’ they deserve actual solutions to spiraling health insurance costs . ”
It is also ironic that Ryan and his Republican colleagues have chosen Medicare Advantage as a rallying point for dispensing falsehoods and distortions about health care reform .
In 2003 , Republicans joined forces to create Medicare Advantage as an upgrade to Medicare by allowing private insurers to compete with government plans for seniors .
Medicare gave them the money it would have spent and let private insurers try do a better job .
Except they did n't , in fact , they failed .
Prices shot up and Republicans funneled in more money to increase reimbursement rates .
Today , Medicare Advantage pays private plans 114 percent of the cost Medicare would have paid , with cost projections continuing to rise .
Overpayments resulted in $ 3.36 billion in profits for private insurers in 2006 alone , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
This free market experiment has not yielded the innovations promised and the only " advantage " has been for private insurance companies and not the American people .
Current health care legislation which Rep. Ryan opposes is designed to cut the waste and overpayments in Medicare Advantage , but not benefits .
Any argument against such action is really an argument in favor of waste and abuse .
The America's Affordable Health Care Choices
Act being considered today is committed to protecting and strengthening Medicare for America 's seniors .
It does n't use a dime of the Medicare trust fund to pay for reform .
Instead , it eliminates waste to strengthen the financial health of the program .
The AAHCCA enhances quality and affordability particularly for seniors by filling the " doughnut hole " in Medicare Part D ( prescription drug benefit ) .
AAHCCA will eliminate any deductible , co-payments and cost sharing for preventive services in Medicare and Medicare Advantage .
AAHCCA improves low - income subsidy programs in Medicare ; it improves the delivery and coordination of services for people dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid , enhances nursing home transparency and accountability requirements and makes long - term care more affordable .
The America's Affordable Health Care Choices
Act extends Medicare program solvency by improving payment accuracy to ensure that the right amount is paid , expands funding and authority to fight waste , fraud and abuse and eliminates overpayments to private plans .
When Rep. Ryan argues against health care reform by telling you that it will cut Medicare benefits for seniors , all one has to do is look at his record .
The current system is unsustainable and he helped create it .
During Republican control of Congress , health insurance premiums in Wisconsin increased 108 percent from 1999 to 2009 while wage earnings increased only 30 percent .
In speaking about his failure to act on health care just last week , Ryan said " We should have fixed this under our watch and I 'm frustrated we did n't . "
Because of this inaction : 14,000 Americans lost their health insurance today and another 14,000 will tomorrow .
About 122 Americans died today because they had no insurance and the same number will die tomorrow .
Every 30 seconds today an American will file for bankruptcy in the aftermath of a serious illness .
Ryan had years to fix our broken system ; he failed .
Democrats will protect the promise they made to American seniors with Medicare 40 years ago and pass real health care reform .
The time is now .
The DCCC may have picked a really bad candidate -- another worthless reactionary not even worth voting for -- in NY - 23 , but they sure know how to send out a cool Halloween card .
And speaking of " worthless , " you wo n't find many members of Congress , on either side of the aisle , worth less to working families than Wisconsin bribe - taker Paul Ryan .
It starts with a standard Kenosha Halloween greeting : After Roy Blunt failed , dismally , to come up with a Republican alternative to the Democrat 's plans to offer more choices and less expensive health insurance to Americans , Minority Leader John Boehner popped his head out of his tanning booth long enough to ask Paul Ryan to come up with something that might sound plausible and make people think Republicans were something other than just the Party of No .
He explained that this time they were looking for something with a little more effort put into it that an empty binder , like when he handed in his neat - looking , but kindergarten level , alternative budget .
Ryan is by no means the longest - serving member of Wisconsin 's Washington delegation .
David Obey , one of the most powerful figures in DC , was first elected in 1969 and Ryan 's 2 Republican colleagues , Jim Sensenbrenner and Tom Petri were both elected in the 1970s .
But when it comes to trading votes for Insurance Industry bucks , no one comes close to Ryan .
Tammy Baldwin and Ryan were elected on the same day in 1998 .
She 's taken slightly over $ 50,000 in contributions from the Insurance Industry .
Ryan has taken considerably more : $ 518,051 .
Ryan had n't beenwhen Obey was first elected but Obey 's only gotten $ 123,556 from Big Insurance ( about $ 3,000 a year ) .
When Sensenbrenner was elected Ryan 's mother was still pulling her hair out because her son was still wetting his bed at night .
But Sensenbrenner , a devoted friend and supporter of all Big Business interests , has only taken in $ 252,898 , of Ryan 's haul !
Ryan has taken in over double what all three of the state 's senators in recent times ( Russ Feingold , Herb Kohl and Republican Bob Kasten ) have , .
There 's little doubt that Paul Ryan is the most corrupt man Wisconsin has ever sent to Washington , part of the reason he 's themember of the House with a Blue America page devoted exclusively to defeating him .
The Democrat running against him , Paulette Garin , lists health care as the # 1 issue she wants to address .
And she 's far from the only one living in southeast Wisconsin who has noticed that Ryan is more concerned with the Insurance Industry lobbyists and CEOs than he is with the working families of Racine , Kenosha , Franklin , Janesville , Greenfield and Muskego .
The Racinepublished an OpEd by local health care expert Kelly Gallaher excoriating Ryan for his deceitful approach to the health care debate .
He " establishes his opposition by claiming that ' drastic cuts to Medicare Advantage plans would devastate seniors enrolled in these plans . '
This assertion , " she writes , " is questionable at best , and certainly an ironic role reversal given GOP actions of the recent past . "
Ryan , like most of his Republican colleagues voted to end Medicare as it currently exists and convert it " from a program that guarantees seniors all necessary access to care into a voucher system that provides future retirees only a fixed sum of money to purchase private health insurance .
In Rep. Ryan 's proposal '... new retirees would not even have the option of buying into traditional fee - for - service Medicare once the voucher system is implemented . '
John Rother , Vice President for Policy at AARP called the Ryan plan ' a very dangerous idea . '
Furthermore , Rother said , ' Converting Medicare into a voucher would increase costs for all beneficiaries and over time force less - affluent seniors to accept lower - quality care . '"
There are something like 73,000 uninsured people among Ryan 's constituents .
Under the plan he 's taken a leading role in savaging , 51,000 of them would gain access to high - quality , affordable health insurance , while 14,000 small businesses would qualify for tax credits of up to 50 % of the costs of providing health insurance and 9,400 senior citizens in the district would avoid the Donut Hole annually .
Would taxes go up ?
Yes -- but in WI - 01 , they would rise only for the wealthiest few .
In fact 99.3 % of Ryan 's constituents would see exactly zero dollars in increases .
But he 's more concerned about the 0.7 % of millionaires -- many of whom donate to his campaigns -- than he is about health care or about the 99.3 % .
Please consider donating to Stop Paul Ryan or to electing Paulette Garin ... or both .

Psychology researchers have found the sound of the human voice can be recognised by the brain in less than one fifth of a second .
The study , conducted at the Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging in the Department of Psychology , found that the brain recognises voices within a similar time - frame as it recognises faces - after around 170 ms following presentation .
Ian Charest , a PhD student who conducted the study under the supervision of Professor Pascal Belin , said : “ Because human social interactions rely heavily on facial and vocal expressions , the brain is likely to have developed the ability to process them very rapidly and efficiently .
Since faces and voices are usually paired together in social communication , it makes sense that the brain would process them in a similar time - frame . ”
Researchers tested 32 volunteers in an experiment in which electrical signals generated by the brain were measured using EEG caps as the volunteers listened to series of sounds comprising bird songs , environmental sounds and human voices .
They observed electric potentials related to voice that had twice the amplitude as those related to bird songs and environmental sounds in less than 200 milliseconds .
Ian , from Trois - Rivičres , Québec , Canada added : “ This knowledge may also help us understand conditions such as autism and help develop more accessible diagnostic tools .
Autistic individuals have difficulties in social interactions and we observe abnormal brain activity after presentation of faces or voices in their brains . ”
The study , entitled ‘ Electrophysiological evidence for an early processing of human voices ’ is published online by BMC Neuroscience .
It was supported by grants from the Economical and Social Research Council , Medical Research Council , Royal Society , Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council , Canadian Foundation for Innovation , Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada , Canadian Institute of Health Research , and France - Télécom .

THE Government 's intervention in the Northern Territory has stagnated with no more children going to school now than two years ago and reports of substance abuse soaring .
A six - month progress report on the intervention , quietly posted on the internet this week , showed school attendance rates remained virtually static in affected communities with only two out of three children going to school .
It also states plainly the Government 's commitment to reinstate the Racial Discrimination Act by October 2009 , a promise it has broken .
The intervention was started under John Howard in 2007 and continued under the Rudd Government with extra funding amid criticism from affected communities .
'' This is unacceptable treatment .
Racism and divisions increase and living conditions deteriorate each day the Act remains suspended , '' a petition signed by Aboriginal leaders said .
'' We are like outcasts - denied basic rights afforded to other Australians . ''

Description :
There seem to be a ton of new hot dog and sausage carts cropping up of late .
Historically , hot dog and sausage vendors were the only food carts in town .
Here in Portland , other cuisines and carts have outnumbered them now for awhile , but the tenacious hot dog vendors are back and offering some tasty new options .
Beez Neez is the newest cart to join us in Portland , offering their Reindeer sausage , straight from Alaska .
I visited Beez Neez earlier in the week to talk with the owner Bryan and try one of the reindeer sausages .
Bryan had recently moved here from Alaska via Seattle and brought some of his Alaska with him .
The reindeer sausages are indeed from Alaska as we do n’t have too many reindeer around here .
Bryan described the taste as not being gamey as the reindeer is mixed with beef to create a traditional hot dog .
I decided on the spicy version of the dog and added some caramelized onions , sweet relish and spicy brown mustard .
Bryan splits the dogs on the grill which is my new favorite way of enjoying both hot dogs and sausages .
I like it because some dogs get too juicy inside and upon that first bite , your upper lip is burned with the hot boiling juices .
The sausage itself was just the right spice .
It had some kick , you could taste that it was n’t an all beef dog and there was something different there .
The addition of the onions and mustard made the lunch .
Another great dog in the city of Portland .
Beez Neez does sell other dogs and sausages , so if reindeer is n’t your forte , there are other choices .
As I was condimenting my dog , a businesswoman arived to order a brat , relaying a story of travelling through Germany and eating brats every day .
Ahh , brats every day … makes your mouth water .
Bryan at Beez Neez will offer you a sample of the sausage if you ask .
If you get down there , tell them Food Carts Portland sent ya .
Sample Menu :
Alaska Reindeer Sausage – mild or spicy – $ 4.75
Louisiana Hot Link – $ 4.25
German Bratwurst – $ 4.75
Foot long kosher beef dog – $ 3.75
Foot long kosher polish dog – $ 3.75
add cream cheese and bacon to any dog – 75

Oliver North is the new foreign policy adviser for the House Republicans .
House GOP turns to Oliver North
House Republicans have a new foreign policy adviser with a controversial pedigree : Oliver North .
North , an aide on Ronald Reagan 's National Security Council who is best known for his role in the Iran - Contra scheme to sell arms to Iran and divert the funds to Nicaraguan revolutionaries in the 1980s , was the special guest at a House Republican Conference meeting on Tuesday .
North was convicted on three counts related to the Iran - Contra scandal and his efforts to cover it up , but the convictions were later overturned .

North ’s mission : Relay his insights into the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan , where he recently visited .
North 's message reinforced the advice of Gen. Stanley McChrystal , who wants to add tens of thousands of troops in Afghanistan .
“ Basically , his point was unless we put the troops in there , it ’s lost , ” said Rep. Hal Rogers ( R - Ky . ) .
Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence of Indiana and Rep. Buck McKeon ( R - Calif. ) , who is the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee , joined forces to issue the invitation to North .
“ Col .
North is someone who enjoys the very broad respect of the House Republican Conference , ” Pence said .
So many movies , so many plot holes .
We geeks can find plot holes in almost any movie , no matter how well - written and directed it is .
We may not readily admit it , but we 'd probably be a bit disappointed if we ever saw a movie without a single tiny plot hole .
The first list of unanswered questions ( a kind euphemism for " plot holes " ) we published a couple of weeks ago seemed to be fairly popular ; so , as people in the movie business always do , we 've cooked up a sequel .
This time , we 're making it a little more challenging by avoiding low - hanging fruit like Independence Day .
Thanks to everyone who left comments with their ideas on the original list and on the Neatorama post that linked to it — we have incorporated some of them .
This list is a bit Star Wars - heavy , but we think you 'll agree with most ( if not all ) of them .
10 . Star Trek ( the 2009 movie ) : Nero 's patience - Having destroyed the Kelvin , Nero bides his time until Old Spock appears from the black - hole - created temporal rift .
This takes 25 years , but he waits because he wants Old Spock to watch Vulcan 's destruction as retribution for his failure to save Romulus .
Surely with the advanced technology on his mining ship , Nero could have traveled to Romulus and done something to either warn the Romulans of ( what is to him ) the past about the supernova , or used the magic " red matter " to rectify the supernova situation ahead of time .
Considering how impatient he is after Old Spock shows up , it 's truly remarkable how patient he is before that .
9. Back to the Future II : Marty 's non-disappearance -
In the beginning of the original Back to the Future , Doc Brown sends his dog Einstein forward in time one minute .
For that minute , Einstein does not exist at all , right ?
So why is it , then , that when Marty and Jennifer go with Doc ( and Einstein ) forward to 2015 , the forty - something Marty and Jennifer are there , having lived through all the time in between ?
It would have made much more sense for Marty to hear about how he and Jennifer had vanished all of a sudden one day in 1985 , never to be seen again .
Of course , it would make the movie pretty much impossible to make interesting , but that 's neither here nor there .
8. The Matrix : Why do the machines need humans ? -
The intelligent machines have all humans hooked up to elaborate devices to harvest their body heat and chemicals , right ?
But they also have sophisticated fusion reactors .
The energy production of fusion reactors compared to that of humans ( with all the maintenance required , including The Matrix itself ) is so much more efficient it 's just ridiculous — and we 're supposed to believe that intelligent machines , which would presumably operate logically , would keep the humans around anyway ?
It 's obviously necessary for the plot , but it just makes no sense .

7. Star Wars ( Episode IV ) :
Why did the Empire try to kill the heroes on the Death Star ?
– Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader have a plan , and one that very nearly turns out to work perfectly :
They install a tracking device on the Millennium Falcon so the Death Star can follow it to the rebel base .
In order for this to work , Luke , Leia , Han , Chewbacca and the droids have to actually get to the ship and take off , right ?
So why does the Empire try to crush them in the trash compactor , then send squads of stormtroopers after them ?
I mean , I can understand sending some token troops just to make sure it was n't obvious , but they really seem to be trying to kill them .
Of course Leia does say " They let us go .
It 's the only explanation for the ease of our escape . "
But I 'm inclined to agree with Han that it really was n't that easy , and seriously , Princess , if you 're so sure you 're being tracked , why are you going straight for the place you know the Empire is looking for ?
6 . The Dark Knight : Why is the Joker so poorly guarded ? -
Let 's say you 're an experienced police officer in Gotham City .
You 've just captured a psychopath who wears clown makeup , has killed a bunch of people already and tried to kill more , and has shown himself to be devious and incredibly dangerous .
You lock up his henchmen in holding cells in full view of at least a half - dozen cops , of course .
And you let the Joker sit , unshackled , in an unobserved room , with only one middle - aged cop guarding him .
What could possibly go wrong ?

5. Star Wars ( Episodes III and IV ) : Just how stupid is Obi-Wan , anyway ?
- So Obi-Wan , Yoda and Bail Organa decide that the best thing to do with babies Luke and Leia is to separate them and hide them from their father , because having a dad who 's the second - most evil person in the galaxy can really screw a kid up .
So Organa quite sensibly takes little Leia to Alderaan and adopts her , treating her as though she were his and his wife 's natural - born daughter , including giving her his last name .
This last bit of information may seem obvious , but apparently it is n't to Obi-Wan , because his idea of " hiding " Luke from his father is to take Luke to the planet where Anakin used to live , to the very house he used to live in , to be cared for by Anakin 's stepfather 's son and his wife , and , as if that were n't already akin to hanging a giant sign reading " Future Jedi Here , " to give Luke his father 's last name !
Because " Skywalker " is such a common last name that nobody could possibly make the connection ... if they 're complete morons .
Would it have been so difficult to call him " Luke Lars ? "
4. Spider -Man 2 : Dr. Octavius 's complete disregard for safety -
You know why nuclear experiments are not typically done in the middle of large cities ?
Of course you do , because it 's completely obvious ... unless you 're the brilliant scientist Otto Octavius , in which case you apparently have complete disregard for the possibility of something going wrong .
It says a lot that , when Doc Ock is under the control of his artificially intelligent arms and planning to recreate the fusion reaction , he does it a fair ways away from the city , in a relatively unpopulated area .
Yes , Doc
Ock 's metal arms are more considerate of human lives than he is .

3. Star Wars ( Episode IV ) :
Why did n't the Star Destroyer officers shoot down the escape pod ? -
Say you 're an Imperial officer .
The Star Destroyer you 're on has just captured a ship , and you are assigned the task of making sure nobody escapes alive .
You live in a time and place where sentient robots are completely normal .
An escape pod flies by , and you detect no life signs coming from it , but of course these sentient droids would not be picked up by such a scan .
It would take but the push of a button and an inconsequential amount of energy to shoot down this pod , yet you do n't do it .
Even forgetting the sentient droids , you know the stolen Death Star plans are the main reason for this whole exercise , so why could n't someone have put the plans in a pod with nothing else and fired it off ?
What possible reason , other than that there would be no story for Episodes IV - VI , could you have for not destroying that pod ?
2. Minority Report : Future police with unimaginably bad security - John Anderton gets his eyes replaced so he can avoid detection , but keeps his old eyes with him .
He then uses his old eyes to get back into the Precrime building so he can kidnap Agatha .
For some reason , even though he is a wanted man and has been for a little while by this point , the security system not only lets him into the building using his real eyes , but fails to set off any alarm that would tell someone he 's there .
This is just the worst security system ever , and on a police facility , yet .
1. Star Wars ( most episodes ) : Every computer is a friendly computer -
It is awfully convenient how , whenever he needs to , R2 - D2 can just plug right into any computer system and access all sorts of information .
They waltz into that first room on the Death Star , and Artoo is able to pull up diagrams showing where the tractor beam controls are , that Princess Leia is on the station , and where she is .
Later on , he 's able to shut down the trash compactors at a moment 's notice .
It sure is nice that the incredibly - paranoid Empire did n't put any safeguards on their computer systems , so that anyone with an astromech droid can come in and get tons of sensitive information .
Artoo does the same thing other places , too , and never runs into any real problems except in Jedi when he mistakes a power port for an interface port .
I realize that C3PO says something about some information being restricted , but it's hard to believe when you look at the info Artoo was able to find .
As usual , if you 've got more ideas , and we 're sure you do , please leave them in the comments .

Individual magnetic ‘ charges ’ – equivalent to the north and south poles of a magnet – have been observed inside a crystalline material called spin ice ( Image : STFC )
How to make a monopole
The magnetic equivalent of electricity , dubbed “ magnetricity ” , has been demonstrated experimentally for the first time .
Just as the flow of electrons produces electrical current , individual north and south magnetic poles have been observed to roam freely , generating magnetic “ current ” .
The result could lead to the development of “ magnetronics ” , including nano - scale computer memory .
Advertisement
Magnets normally have two poles , north and south , that are inseparable .
Cutting a magnet in half only results in each piece developing its own north and south pole .
That is true even if one disassembles a magnet all the way down to its individual atoms , since each behaves as a tiny bar magnet with two poles .
But physicists have theorised that magnetic monopoles – individual north and south poles that are not bound in pairs and can move independently of one another – could form inside a crystalline material called spin ice .
Changing patterns
The individual atoms would still have both north and south poles .
But patterns in their orientation would propagate through the material and look just like little magnetic poles roaming around ( see illustration ) .
These patterns would effectively be monopoles , as far as any measurements are concerned .
In September , two teams of physicists fired neutrons at spin ices made of titanium - containing compounds chilled close to absolute zero .
The behaviour of the neutrons suggested that monopoles were present in the material .
Now , another team has managed to measure the amount of magnetic “ charge ” on the monopoles and to measure magnetic analogues to electric current for the first time .
The team calls the motion and interaction of monopoles “ magnetricity ” .
The experiment , reported in Nature , was led by Steven Bramwell of the London Centre for Nanotechnology in the UK .
Bramwell was a member of a team , led by Tom Fennell of the Laue - Langevin Institute in Grenoble , that reported neutron results in September .
Magnetic ‘ charge ’
To get more detailed information on the monopoles than had previously been possible , Bramwell ’s team injected muons – short - lived cousins of electrons – into the spin ice .
When the muons decayed , they emitted positrons in directions influenced by the magnetic field inside the spin ice .
This revealed that the monopoles were not only present but were moving , producing a magnetic current .
It also allowed the team to measure the amount of magnetic charge on the monopoles .
It turned out to be about a 5 in the obscure units of Bohr magnetons per angstrom , in close agreement with theory , which predicted 4.6 .
Unlike the electric charge on electrons , which is fixed , the magnetic charge on monopoles varies with the temperature and pressure of the spin ice .
Shivaji Sondhi of Princeton University in New Jersey , a spin ice researcher who is not a member of Bramwell ’s team , called the new achievement “ a triumph of a bold experimental foray ” in an accompanying commentary in Nature .
“ The experiment itself and the determination of the charge of magnetic monopoles are striking . ”
Shrinking memory
Data is stored on computer hard discs by magnetising their surfaces in patterns that represent 1s and 0s .
Bramwell speculates that monopoles could one day be used as a much more compact form of memory than anything available today , given that the monopoles are only about the size of an atom .
“ It is in the early stages , but who knows what the applications of magnetricity could be in 100 years time , ” he says .
The monopoles in the spin ice are not the same as cosmic monopoles , fundamental magnetic particles theorised to have been forged in the big bang that have never been observed .

Click here for updated information about the Mother ’s Men
Washington University seniors on their class trip accused a Chicago nightclub of racial discrimination over the weekend , protesting nearby after the club allegedly denied entry to six black male students because of their race .
“ I think it ’s because we were a group of predominantly black men and they felt threatened , ” said senior Blake Jones , one of the students who was not allowed into the bar .
About 200 Washington University seniors were attending Mother ’s Night Club Original bar on Saturday night as part of their class trip to Chicago , sponsored by the Senior Class Council .
According to Senior Class President Fernando Cutz , the six black students were told they would not be allowed in because of their failure to comply with the bar ’s “ baggy jeans ” policy .
A few white students who had already been admitted then came out to demonstrate that their jeans were more “ baggy , ” but the black students were still denied admission .
The six students offered to change their clothes , but the bar manager still refused to allow them in .
The white students were allowed to return .
The management at Mother ’s did not immediately return phone calls from Student Life seeking comment .

Two of the students rejected from the club were Iboro Umana and Regis Murayi , the internal vice president and treasurer of Senior Class Council , respectively .
Both of these students were heavily involved in the planning of the trip .
Murayi said he felt the manager was unwilling to listen to what he and the other five students denied entry had to say .
“ From talking to him , I felt that no matter what I said , he already knew his agenda , he knew his plan .
It was hard to get him to budge from that , ” Murayi said .
“ It was not about the baggy clothing .
It was strictly about the people I was with . ”
Other students who went to the bar said they disapproved of the way Mother ’s treated the six students .
“ Honestly , if I ’d known that [ they ] were n’t allowed , I would n’t have wanted to be there either , ” senior Tara Benesch said .
Students protest near bar the next morning
In response to the incident , students staged a 15 - minute protest Sunday morning outside the Hotel Indigo , which is near the bar and is where the seniors had been staying for the weekend .
The students gathered there because they were unable get the proper permits to protest outside the bar .
The protest occurred at 11 a.m. , the original scheduled time for the seniors ’ departure to St. Louis .
Students at the protest held signs and flyers with slogans like , “ Mothers do n’t hate . ”
“ It was really kind of a unique mix of emotions at the protest , ” senior Kim Halom said .
“ It was definitely a somber , serious time , but even more than that people were trying to process how ludicrous it was that this had happened the night before . ”
Students said the experience shows the reality of life outside Wash .
U .
Senior class president Cutz said he has not seen this kind of an incident of discrimination before .
“ I thought I was very well informed , I thought I was aware .
But I had never been direct eyewitness of a clear - cut event of racism , at least not of such good friends of mine , ” Cutz said .
Cutz said the Senior Class Council wants to spread awareness that such acts of discrimination do occur , as well as to discourage future business at Mother’s .
Cutz issued a press release with facts about the event to 26 different news outlets , diversity leaders and senior class presidents at Chicago universities , as well as to the NAACP .
Murayi , for his part , said the incident is nothing new .
He said he has experienced similar treatment at other venues prior to the trip .
“ I would say that a lot of people underestimate how much this stuff goes on outside of the Wash .
U. bubble , ” Murayi said .
“ This happens frequently .
Is this an anomaly ?
No , this happens all the time from a black male ’s perspective , and from an outside perspective I feel like a lot of people do n’t know . ”

Three weeks ago , I announced the automatic rule - based time tracker here , and it seems that there are actually users out there :-) .
Since then , it has recorded more than 240 hours of my computer ’s uptime in about 15000 samples .
Until now , this data was stored in a simple text file , one line per entry , and relying on Haskell ’s Show / Read instances to do the serialization .
Although not quite unexpected , this turned out to be a severe bottleneck :
Already , it takes more than 25 seconds to parse the log file on my computer .
Following an advice given to me on the #haskell IRC channel , I switched to a binary representation of the data , using the very nice Data .
Binary module .
The capture program will automatically detect if the log file is in the old format , move it away and convert the entries to binary data .
And voilà , the statistics program evalutes my data in about two seconds !
This should be fast enough for quite a while , I hope .
In my binary instances , which you can find in Data.hs , I prepended a version tag to each entry .
This hopefully allows me to add more fields to the log file later , while still being able to parse the old data directly and without conversion .
To still be able to manually inspect the recorded data , the program arbtt - dump was added to the package .
The new version is uploaded to hackage as 0.3.0 .
One thing still worries me :
With the old format , I could easily throw away unparseable lines in the log file ( e.g. from a partial write ) and still read the rest of it .
With the new code , there is no such robustness :
If the file breaks somewhere , it will be unreadable in its whole , or at least to the broken point .
I ’m not sure what to do about that problem , but given the very low number of bytes written each time , I hope that it will just not happen .
Hey there , time traveller !

Opinion
There was more NHL / Winnipeg speculation on Saturday night 's Hockey Night in Canada 's Satellite Hotstove .
On the season 's opening weekend , the captivated nation was told that big money from Toronto has done plenty of work already to buy the Atlanta Thrashers and move them to Winnipeg .
Is it just another episode of wishful thinking or a real indicator of what 's afoot ?
GREGORY SMITH / AP PHOTO Atlanta Thrashers left wing Ilya Kovalchuk celebrates a goal against the Tampa Bay Lightning during the third period of an NHL hockey game Saturday at Philips Arena , in Atlanta .
The Thrashers won 6 - 3 . Will Kovalchuk and the rest of the Thrashers soon be plying their trade on MTS Centre ice ?
True North Sports and Entertainment chairman Mark Chipman was n't saying on Sunday , taking his usual tack of the less said the better .
There are several known quantities to this ongoing story :
* The NHL has more problems than just the financially drowning Phoenix Coyotes .
* Chipman , whose company owns Winnipeg 's MTS Centre , has been a consistently keen observer of NHL franchise matters for longer than his arena has been open ( 2004 ) and has never denied his interest in some future deal that might bring the NHL back to the city .
* One of the biggest partners in the True North success story , and certainly its most well - heeled , is Osmington , Inc. , the Toronto - based private real estate company of David Thomson , the richest man in Canada and son of the late Ken Thomson .
* Chipman and True North have been to NHL headquarters in New York to address league executives and governors about their new arena , their situation and their interest and they continue to maintain a very quiet but open channel for dialogue with the league 's leadership .
* In this case of Saturday 's HNIC outburst , the Thrashers ' owners , the Spirit group of eight partners , have been embroiled in disputes and legal wrangling for about four years over control of the NHL team , the NBA Hawks and Philips Arena .
This summer , a judge tossed out a lawsuit that sent the bickering partners back to the starting blocks over share valuation and how one side or the other could be bought out .
It 's thought that the group is far more interested in basketball and could sell the Thrashers , but that 's only speculation .
* In recent years , hopeful yet emotionally battered Winnipeggers have gotten better at not overreacting to every bit of speculation or mention of their city and the NHL , even when it comes from influential or powerful figures like league commissioner Gary Bettman himself .
All of the above considered , the tone of any speculation on Winnipeg seemed to move one grade towards legitimate in the spring when , among the court filings and briefs in the Coyotes ' debacle , it was discovered that Bettman wrote in an email earlier this year that the Coyotes , if they were going to be sold and relocated anywhere , ought to be offered up first to Winnipeg .
That seemed to infer the commissioner , so wildly reviled for chasing teams out of Canada in the mid-'90s , would now give his blessing for a repatriation .
Chipman had almost no reaction to that revelation , too , not only because he had no intention of rocking the boat but also because he was steadfastly sticking to his position that the NHL knows where we are .
Even as the Phoenix mess stumbled from headline to headline to last week 's interim conclusion that Ontario billionaire Jim Balsillie could not buy the bankrupt team and relocate it to Hamilton , the eager return - of - the - Jets type crowd would no doubt urge Chipman to get into the bidding line the NHL will surely seek for Winnipeg 's former team .
But the financial morass in the desert will be more complicated and expensive than most suspect , Chipman said late last week , while hinting he and his group wo n't be rushing into the first money pit that comes along .
He did n't say he was done looking , though .
The group has previously kicked tires in Nashville , and watched with great interest in Phoenix , but both situations are both tainted and inflated by Balsillie 's inept interventions .
Maybe they 're kicking tires in Atlanta , too , or maybe not .
Chipman wo n't say , but you can take this to the bank -- he 's only going to look at the possibilities as sound business propositions and if he has any control over it , Winnipeg wo n't be dragged into any bidding wars and his group continues to have no desire to make a single public proclamation about what it may or may not do until it 's done .
That should suggest to the wise money that the story is a long way from over .

Hello and welcome to The Daily ( Maybe ) archive .
The comments have now been turned off , but feel free to browse anyway .
If you want to keep up with things I 'm doing check out Jim Jepps dot net You may want to check out my twitter .
It 's the place where I tweet .
My pick of the feeds might also be worth a look for the best and worst found on my rss and forwarded on to an eager public .
So I turned 33 the other day and for a birthday gift , my parents bought me one of these :
A DeLonghi Lattissima 660 Nespresso coffee machine .
For those who are not coffee purists , these are usually catalogued under “ Evil ” or “ Wrong ” 😀
…. but when you ’re bleary - eyed in the morning …. kindof convienent … .
In fact , they ’re pretty much designed for use by the bleary - eyed early in the morning .
Take a coffee pod , lift the machine ’s lever , drop in the pod , close the lever , push the button , get coffee .
Want Cappachino or Latte ?
Stick on the foamer attachement , filled with milk , and press a different button .
All automatic .
And while it ’s not as good as the hand - made stuff in a decent coffee shop , it ’s not horrible , and it ’s better than you ’d get in a bad coffee shop .
And early in the morning , you do n’t care so much 🙂
However , there ’s a major , major drawback .
Specifically , it ’s a Nestle product .
Now their ( rather heinous ) ethical record aside , they ’re fairly much dead set against the idea that they ’d sell you the machine and then you ’d buy the coffee elsewhere ; so if you want pods for this thing , you can only buy them via Nespresso .
This is n’t a major hassle if you find you adore the taste of one of the nespresso coffee blends , but to be honest , I do n’t particularly find any of them incredibly good ( “ pretty okay ” seems to be as far as the tastemeter goes with them ) — and more , I do n’t like the idea that if they decide the pods are n’t profitable anymore , I get stuck with a machine I ca n’t use .
So I was rather happy when I noticed a post in the Boards .ie coffee forum describing the NexPod , which is a third party pod for the Nespresso machines :
for those who like their own blends and a fresh grind , but who also like the convenience of a nespresso machine , these are now available : http://www.nexpod.com/
Excellent , I thought , and looked them up .
€ 20 for 80 pods and filters , including delivery .
Excellent , I thought again , and ordered some immediately .
One of the purists did n’t think I ’d be saving a lot of money ( the pods work out cheaper than the nestle pods , but that ’s before you count the cost of the coffee ) , however as I said at the time :
Dude , if it was about saving money , I ’d drink tap water .
I would n’t have gotten the machine myself , but my folks though it was a good birthday present and in the morning when I ’m bleary - eyed , it is .
I ’ll just put better coffee in the pods is all .
Besides , I dislike shopping in Brown Thomas .
I keep wanting to grab someone , slap them about the face and yell “ YOU DO NOT PAY A THOUSAND EUROS FOR A COAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE BY A BLIND TAILOR ’S APPRENTICE YOU IDIOT ! ” .
I ’m getting worried that one day my self - control will slip and next thing you know , I ’ll make the evening news …
A few days go by , and then yesterday , the Nexpods arrived .
Three or four days , over a weekend .
Not too bad , so that ’s a point for logistical availability right there .
Right , time to test !
I started by filling one up half - way , stuck in the filter , put it in the machine , closed the lever .
Noticed the lever was n’t closing as easily as normal .
Hmmm .
Hit the button .
Cue regular noises … and then louder noises … and then mild panic at the thought of burst pressure vessels … and then a stream of pure water instead of coffee from the spigot … and then hitting the button and opening the lever to take a peek .
The NexPod was crushed flat .
Mangled .
Normally the pods are relatively intact after making coffee .
Hmmm .
Maybe I underfilled it .
Okay , user error , try again .
This time taking photos !
First , take one Nexpod :
They do n’t look quite as sturdy as the Nespresso pods , and they do n’t feel that sturdy either .
Hence the mashing flat on the first attempt .
Comparing them side by side , you can see they also have slightly different designs :
But okay .
Fill it up ( slightly messy job this ) :
Then tamp it down , top it up and tamp again and sweep off the excess .
Gloriously messy , this bit – the advice to do it in the coffee grounds bag is good advice , but doing it over the open container works well also .
Just do n’t be enthusiastic 😀
Now insert the filter paper into the lid , which is a bit fiddly ;
And then close the lid .
This bit ’s downright awkward , the lid does n’t want to close and then it snaps shut suddenly , but you can wind up covered in coffee if it goes sideways .
Even when it ’s relatively clean , it ’s not perfect – you can see there that the lid is n’t sitting down perfectly all the way around , and that ’s down to the lid design , not user error .
And the flimsiness of the pods is a bad thing here also – the effort of closing the lid can cause damage to the pod at the rear :
Closing the lid caused that large split and the smaller one to the right .
You have to wonder if the whole thing might not pop open on you when you ’re trying to close it …
Anyway , at this point , it ’s off to Larry .
What , like you do n’t name your kitchen appliances ?
Okay , so first the control run with a Nespresso pod .
Again , the operation of the machine ’s simple .
Open the lever :
Then drop in the pod into the slot :
And close the lever .
Just a quick point to note here – as you close the lever , a piston - tube - thingy is extended out to meet the pod and hold it into the correct place and feed the steam to it , like so :
( That ’s just as it starts to close – the sleeve of the P - T - T then covers the sides of the pod completely and holds it in place as you close the lever fully ) .
I digress to note this point for a reason , more on that in a minute .
Once the lever is closed , you push the espresso button , the machine chugs away and put pours a reasonable espresso .
Open the lever again when it ’s done and the pod drops down into a tray for later easy disposal .
Okay , so much for the control run .
Now for the NexPod .
Open the lever , drop in the pod :
Now here ’s the thing .
One time in three , it works like that .
One time in three it falls right through to the disposal tray .
And the rest of the time , it hangs up somewhere it should n’t along that path .
The different mechanical design causes a bit of fiddliness here .
Not a great thing at bleary - o- clock in the morning .
I think what happened the first time I tried this was that the P - T - T caught the edge of the NexPod and crushed it flat .
So this time , I ’m careful to ensure the pod and the P - T - T engage properly , which necessitates removing the disposal tray and reaching up from underneath , but eventually :
There , seated .
Now close the lever .
If you can .
In fact , it ’s much , much harder to do – the mechanical design differences translate to a lot more force being needed to close the lever .
And in fact , while you do that , the pod does n’t line up with the sleeve of the P - T - T , it goes off to one side and gets crushed .
So you give up on the lever , you get the pod aligned by fiddling with it , and then you shove the pod home in the sleeve with your finger like so :
And then you close the lever , and hit the button .
And you get the normal noises the machine makes .
And then slightly louder normal noises .
And then yay !
Coffee ! Cool .
Open lever to dump pod… nothing .
Hm .
Lever opens , but no pod in tray .
Hmmmm .
Look inside , nexpod is still stuck inside the P - T-T :
Reach in , try to extract with fingernail , curse , pull pocketknife , reach in , extract with blade :
Gah .
But okay , how ’s the coffee ?
How did the results of all this palaver compare ?
The coffee itself tastes as good from one as from the other .
Same end result , more mess and fuss with the NexPod .
Now NexPod do say they intend this for a single use only , but some have said you can clean the pod , replace the coffee and filter and reuse it , and NexPod agree that this can work , at least some of the time .
I dunno – the damage done to the pods by the brewing process is quite significant :
I do n’t think they ’re going to be reusable at all .
You can , of course , clean them out and recycle them , and a lot easier than the Nespresso pods which you have to send off to be recycled — but then , this is Ireland and our idea of recycling seems to consist of collecting recyclables in seperate bins and then burying them in different coloured bags in the same landfill .
So overall ?
Well , yes , they do work , and the coffee is perfectly fine ; but unless I ’m doing something awfully wrong , they ’re not as good as the nescafe pods .
I think it ’s down to the sidewall construction – they ’re definitely more flimsy than the nescafe pod ’s sidewall , and I think they flex too much when you close the lever , so stuff does n’t align well as a result .
Oh well .
Seems , by the way , that others agree on this :
Alain de Botton set off the warning bells to the hazards of the culture of envy in his book Status Anxiety .
" One of the things that 's happened in the modern world is that we believe our societies are more or less fair - if you have talent , and you 've got energy and got something to say , you can make it to the top .
But this creates a horrible nasty streak - if you genuinely believe those at the top deserve their success , you have to believe those at the bottom deserve their failure . "
The likes of Kiyosaki seems to assert those at the bottom deserve their failure .
One of his sayings is " Winners are not afraid of losing , but losers are . "
But for a fee he 'll show you how to drag your sorry arse out of the ghetto of mediocrity .
His three - hour seminar costs $ 75 .
His three - day workshop costs $ 7000 .
But will it make you a winner ?
On his last tour of Australia he spent two hours talking with the South Sydney Rabbitohs .
And where are they now ?
I have n't had time to check out their real estate portfolios , but I can tell you they 're poor when it comes to points on the NRL ladder .
Despite his poor record with the Rabbitohs , Kiyosaki sold out his latest Sydney seminar , thanks to slick marketing and cushy interviews .
Rarely is there scrutiny of the results he gets , the methods he uses and the platitudes he peddles .
As the Dalai Lama once said , " Beware of people selling enlightenment . "
And that 's a worthy sentiment applicable for those looking for spiritual as well as financial salvation .
John T. Reed , an investment adviser in the US , suggests we should all beware of Kiyosaki .
" I do not know anything about Australian real estate .
It is likely that Kiyosaki and I share that characteristic , although he no doubt learnt a little during his speaking visit .
There is an old saying that an expert is someone who carries a briefcase and is at least 50 miles from home .
By that standard , Kiyosaki and [ investment guru John ]
Burley must be absolute geniuses in Australia . "
On the website johntreed.com , Kiyosaki cops plenty of scrutiny - 43 pages of it .
Reed levels numerous allegations against Kiyosaki .
" Rich Dad , Poor Dad is one of the dumbest financial advice books I have ever read .
It contains many factual errors and numerous extremely unlikely accounts of events that supposedly occurred , " Reed says .
We should be wise to these guys by now .
Five years ago there was a big seminar on at the Entertainment Centre called " The World Masters of Business " .
On the bill , among others , were Brad Cooper , Rene Rivkin , " Chainsaw " Al Dunlap and Kevin Trudeau .
At that time Chainsaw Al had already been sued for cooking the books at Sunbeam - for inflating profit margins and misleading investors .
He settled with shareholders out of court for $ 15 million and has since been given a lifetime ban from serving as an officer or director of any public company .
Trudeau had been jailed for credit card fraud and busted for pyramid selling .
His Mega - Memory informercials were banned in NSW for making false claims .
Later on we found out more about Cooper 's ideas on wealth creation during the HIH royal commission .
Rivkin ended up giving free information on his investment strategies at his trial for insider trading .
So beware the prophets of profit .
If someone is heard mouthing wealth creation platitudes on a stage at a convention centre , assume they 're talking rubbish .
Either that or take my advice on making money .
Rich people are often tightwads .
If you want to learn about how they made their money , do it for free .
Go to the library and borrow their books .
That 's what Kiyosaki would do .
His staff at the Rich Dad seminars do n't even get paid .
They have to volunteer .
So if they 're not getting paid , why should he ?

The remarkable eyes of a marine crustacean could inspire the next generation of DVD and CD players , according to a new study from the University of Bristol published today in Nature Photonics .
The mantis shrimps in the study are found on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and have the most complex vision systems known to science .
They can see in twelve colours ( humans see in only three ) and can distinguish between different forms of polarized light .
Special light - sensitive cells in mantis shrimp eyes act as quarter - wave plates -- which can rotate the plane of the oscillations ( the polarization ) of a light wave as it travels through it .
This capability makes it possible for mantis shrimps to convert linearly polarized light to circularly polarized light and vice versa .
Manmade quarter - wave plates perform this essential function in CD and DVD players and in circular polarizing filters for cameras .
However , these artificial devices only tend to work well for one colour of light while the natural mechanism in the mantis shrimp 's eyes works almost perfectly across the whole visible spectrum -- from near - ultra violet to infra-red .
Dr Nicholas Roberts , lead author of the Nature Photonics paper said : " Our work reveals for the first time the unique design and mechanism of the quarter - wave plate in the mantis shrimp 's eye .
It really is exceptional -- out - performing anything we humans have so far been able to create . "
Exactly why the mantis shrimp needs such exquisite sensitivity to circularly polarized light is n't clear .
However , polarization vision is used by animals for sexual signalling or secret communication that avoids the attention of other animals , especially predators .
It could also assist in the finding and catching of prey by improving the clarity of images underwater .
If this mechanism in the mantis shrimp provides an evolutionary advantage , it would be easily selected for as it only requires small changes to existing properties of the cell in the eye .
" What 's particularly exciting is how beautifully simple it is , " Dr Roberts continued .
" This natural mechanism , comprised of cell membranes rolled into tubes , completely outperforms synthetic designs .
" It could help us make better optical devices in the future using liquid crystals that have been chemically engineered to mimic the properties of the cells in the mantis shrimp 's eye . "
This would n't be the first time humans have looked to the natural world for new ideas , for example the lobster 's compound eye recently inspired the design of an X - ray detector for an astronomical telescope .
The mantis shrimp research was conducted at the University of Bristol 's School of Biological Sciences in collaboration with colleagues at UMBC , USA and the University of Queensland , Australia .

With the world 's governments working feverishly to create climate change legislation standards , a Columbia University study on drought conditions in the southeast disputes prior conclusions on the ties to global warming .
However , science has largely not supported these claims .
The latest example of this lack of support can be found in a The Columbia researchers found that the severe shortage was directly attributed to a significant rise in population growth .
Prior explanations for the southeast drought centered on rainfall amounts and concluded falsely that global warming was to blame .
The team analyzed data from weather instruments and compared the numbers with regional data that spanned a century .
This information yielded findings that were " pretty normal and pretty typical by standards of what has happened in the region over the century . "
The connection between water scarcity and population growth is consistent with what has been experienced “ I am not going to criticize any governments for what they did or did not do , ” Douglas LeComte , a drought specialist at the Climate Prediction Center of the National Weather Service , told The New York Times .
“ But if you have more people and the same amount of water storage , you are going to increase the impact of droughts . ”
European leaders and worldwide environmental organizations have been pressuring the United States to move forward with a climate change bill .
It 's part of an ongoing effort to further the pressure on India and China to comply with emission standards and to help shape a global continuity on cap - and - trade legislative structure .
To this end , there have been numerous attempts to attach randomly - occurring weather events to a bigger global warming umbrella - and to create a sense of urgency for the U.S. Congress to act .
However , science has largely not supported these claims .
The latest example of this lack of support can be found in a study from Columbia University on the underlining causes of a long drought in America 's southeast region .

Getting My Portrait Drawn By Herb Trimpe
One of my favorite comic book artists growing up and the greatest artist ever to draw The Incredible Hulk , Herb Trimpe has always had a signature style that dazzled me .
I recently interviewed Trimpe for ADD , but beyond that the one thing I really wanted was to have my likeness sketched by him .
I did not have time while I was attending New York Comic Con this past February because I was busy on assignment .
So when the Big Apple Comic Con rolled into town last weekend , I made sure I attended and got what I craved .
Trimpe admitted that he had not sketched someone on the spot in awhile , so I felt honored that he took a shot at it .
Both he and I were pleased with the result !
It ’s the closest I ’ll get to looking like a real superhero .
The only other story set in England , “ Come Rain or Come Shine , ” descends from farce almost into slapstick .
An unambitious young man comes to stay with a more go - ahead couple who had been his friends at university .
The purpose of the invitation soon discloses itself : Ray is supposed to act as an emollient on the evidently fraying marriage of Charlie and Emily .
The crucial thing Ray and Emily have in common is that , as the slightly unexciting opening sentence informs us : “ Like me , Emily loved old American popular songs . ”
But he is sternly instructed by Charlie to discard this , his only ace , and indeed if Emily even mentions “ that croony nostalgia music ” to pretend that he knows nothing of the subject .
So that ’s the end of music as the food of love or indeed the fuel of narrative , and the action downshifts into Ray ’s accidentally disfiguring Emily ’s private diary and then trying to make enough of a mess to convince her that the apartment has been invaded by a dog .
The “ croony nostalgia ” theme is back in the story “ Nocturne , ” where we meet again a character from the opening tale , “ Crooner . ”
She is now a hysterical and fading star , recovering from plastic surgery in a private wing of a Beverly Hills hotel .
Meeting a face - lifted saxophonist from an adjoining room , she forms an apparently spontaneous love - hate attachment and in the course of the “ love ” part incites him to help steal a music - award statuette that she abruptly decides should be rightfully his .
All you have to believe is that two still - heavily - bandaged middle - aged people would escape arrest as they roamed a hotel ballroom and crammed the statuette up the rear end of a turkey .
Oh , you would also have to believe that the star , Lindy Gardner , has taken the same surname as her crooner ex-husband , Tony .
Ishiguro does n’t put himself to very much trouble with his names .
The cop who fails to see what ’s in front of his nose in the above story produces his ID and says , unmemorably , “ L.A.P.D. . . . Name ’s Morgan . ” Charlie and Ray were at school with someone named Tony Barton .
In “ Malvern Hills ” the young man ’s former schoolteachers are identified as having been just plain Mrs. Fraser and Mr. Travis .
One of them is awarded an unsurprising nickname .
The prospective lover of the mystery woman in “ Cellists ” is a certain Peter Henderson .
In the same story there appears a relatively exotic Hungarian .
His name is Tibor .
As if in recompense for this banality , Ishiguro does like to afflict his characters with something like Tourette ’s syndrome .
Whether it ’s Venice or Malvern , it is perfect strangers who are told , without any appreciable loss of time , that the long - standing marriage of the person who is doing all the talking is coming to an end .
In one instance this disclosure is made in the glare of full morning sunlight , in the other it does take place during an attempted nocturnal serenade , but there ’s no evocation of the lengthening shadows .
( In any case , people surely tend to make these tragically abrupt confessions to strangers somewhat nearer to the end of the night . )
The story that most justifies its inclusion under the book ’s title is “ Cellists , ” where it is only by means of a slowly developed series of “ movements ” and after a long sequence of late après - midis that we are led to appreciate the world of mania and deception that can underlie , as with the world of chess , the universe inhabited by the fanatically musical .
This time I should n’t say anything about the plot or rather its absence , except that it , too , has its jokey element : the old joke about the person who does n’t know whether or not he can play the violin , because he ’s never tried .
It ’s set at the end of the season as well , as if to emphasize the evanescence of everything , but it ’s somehow a slight waste of Venice , and if Ishiguro ’s narrator — all five stories are first person — had omitted to mention “ the evening passeggiatta , ” the setting could have been anywhere .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House on Monday blasted a report from the health insurance industry that said Senate healthcare legislation would lead to increases in annual insurance premiums of as much as $ 4,000 by 2019 .
The report for the industry trade group America ’s Health Insurance Plans represented a shot across the bow at Democratic plans to overhaul the $ 2.5 trillion healthcare system as President Barack Obama has been gaining momentum on the issue .
A top goal of Obama in seeking to revamp healthcare is to rein in costs that have soared in recent decades .
The report , prepared by consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers and posted on the industry group ’s website over the weekend , said costs would increase for Americans rather than decline .
“ Health reform could have a significant impact on the cost of private health insurance coverage , ” the report concluded .
The report ’s release comes as the Senate Finance Committee plans to vote on Tuesday on its healthcare bill after budget analysts gave it a rosy report card , saying it would meet Obama ’s goal of reducing the budget deficit over 10 years .
A Finance Committee aide called the report “ blatantly false and misleading . ”
The finance panel bill calls for sweeping insurance market reforms , requires most individuals to obtain medical policies and provides tax subsidies to help people afford coverage .
The bill also would tax high - cost insurance plans and would place a $ 500,000 limit on the amount of executive pay that health insurance companies could deduct from taxable income .
The insurance industry group , which represents Aetna Inc , Cigna Corp , UnitedHealth Group Inc , WellPoint Inc and others , defended the report , saying lawmakers have abandoned any effort to slow healthcare costs .
Instead , the bill looks to raise money from insurance companies and , ultimately consumers and employers , to help pay for healthcare costs that outpace wages each year , the group ’s president Karen Ignagni told reporters .
“ Because we do n’t see comprehensive cost control in any piece of legislation , we ’re looking at continuing those projected 6.2 percentage point increases ...
I think it ’s time to bring that back , ” she said .
A spokesman for Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said the report “ excludes all the provisions that will actually lower the cost of coverage , ” including tax credits and an increased enrollment .
The Obama White House had sought to work with the industry but the report was a clear indication that this strategy was no longer operative .
It has brokered deals with drugmakers and hospitals , but no such deal has been struck with insurers .
“ This is a self - serving analysis from the insurance industry , one of the major opponents of health insurance reform , ” White House spokesman Reid Cherlin said .
“ It comes on the eve of a vote that will reduce the industry ’s profits .
It is hard to take it seriously , ” he added .
Ignagni , asked about whether the group was changing tactics , said its strategy is consistent and that the group was committed to working with Congress to pass reforms .
But she added that other sectors need to play a greater role in reducing healthcare spending rather than imposing taxes and fees .
“ We need now to have a broader discussion about how all the other stakeholders fit into this ... conversation , ” she said .

HIGHER COSTS ?
The industry group ’s report identifies four key factors in the Senate Finance Committee bill it says will drive up the cost of health insurance premiums , including a weak mandate that could result in many young people opting not to buy insurance .
A weak mandate coupled with measures preventing insurers from barring people with pre-existing conditions will fuel rapidly rising costs , as will other factors like taxes on high - cost healthcare plans and new taxes on some healthcare sectors , the report said .
A family of four under current law could expect to pay $ 15,500 by 2013 , but that would rise to $ 17,200 if the new measures were adopted , the report found .
The cost would be $ 21,900 by 2019 under the current system or $ 25,900 if the changes are implemented , it said .
“ Efforts to increase coverage and promote quality could lead to a more efficient healthcare sector , but they could also lead to increased growth in costs if implemented without a full appreciation of the downstream impact on cost of health insurance coverage , ” the report said .
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office last week put the cost at $ 829 billion , below Obama ’s $ 900 billion goal .
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the industry group ’s report should not be ignored .
“ Higher premiums , higher taxes , and more government -- that ’s not reform .
But that ’s precisely what the American people , the Congressional Budget Office and now outside experts have identified with this $ 1 trillion experiment that cuts Medicare , raises taxes and premiums , and threatens the health care options that millions of Americans enjoy . ”
A number of consumer advocacy groups that back reform echoed the White House ’s criticism , calling the report a scare tactic meant to derail Tuesday ’s Senate vote .
They also pointed to insurers as a main driver in ratcheting up healthcare costs over the years .
Recent data shows premiums for health plans sponsored by employers , who provide coverage for most non-elderly adults with insurance , have more than doubled in the last decade .
“ The insurance lobby now claims that health care reform will cause significant premium increases , conveniently forgetting that they imposed significant premium increases during the past decade that are making health coverage unaffordable for families and businesses , ” said Ron Pollack , head of the consumer health group Families USA .
Microsoft has confirmed a serious security issue affecting Windows 7 Release Candidate ( RC ) -- the version that was made available to the public prior to the full release of Windows 7 .
The problem also currently affects Windows Vista and Server 2008 , but not Windows XP or Server 2008 R2 .
The issue involves the Server Message Block ( SMB ) system which is a part of Windows itself and is used for sharing files over a network .
A bug in the system means anyone could take advantage of the exploit and use SMB to gain remote access to ( and take control of ) a remote computer .
Temporary Solution : Block or Disable SMB
Microsoft has issued an advisory to customers showing how to temporary block the problem until a permanent solution is issued via a security update .
One solution is for users with a customizable firewall to block ports 139 and 445 .
This should stop any attacks -- but will also cause problems with some network tools .
Another option is to disable SMB completely .
Doing so is a complicated process involving editing the registry , and thus should not be attempted unless you are confident about doing so .
Microsoft 's guide to the process , thankfully , provides plenty of detail .
( Source : microsoft.com )
Announcement Made Just After Patch Tuesday
The SMB exploit was announced just hours after this Tuesday 's scheduled monthly security update , meaning that if a fix is ready soon the firm could have to choose between issuing an emergency patch or holding off the update for several weeks .
Exploit Could Affect Consumer Confidence
The fact that the problem affects the Release Candidate of Windows 7 is perhaps a public relations nightmare for Microsoft .
Though final retail edition of Windows 7 ( due October 22nd ) does not suffer the SMB exploit , some consumers will be wary of the bad news , nonetheless .

Cambodia is a country in South East Asia with a population of over 14 million people .
While the largest city is Phnom Penh , the most attractive and popular city is a Siem Reap , where the tourists can see the magnificent Angkor Wat .
Cambodia is the successor state of the once powerful Hindu and Buddhist Khmer Empire , which ruled most of the Indochinese Peninsula between the 11th and 14th centuries .
A citizen of Cambodia is usually identified as “ Cambodian ” or “ Khmer , ” though the latter strictly refers to ethnic Khmers .
I found that the smiles of these people are very honest and serene .
What do you think ?
Do n’t you agree ?

Imagine this : in the middle of the day , all at once , a sea of suits pours out onto the streets of Lower Manhattan .
With them come as many somber faces , cast down , but bearing a glint of tranquility not often seen in that neighborhood .
No press conference was scheduled , but reporters descend , and something like one materializes out of the crowd , centered around the chief executives of the top investment banks .
They , we learn , arranged this together the night before in lieu of their usual cognac and cigars .
It has been a year now since the American people rescued the financial industry with gargantuan loans and benevolent takeovers .
The Dow is on the upswing again , and some of the biggest banks have paid back what they borrowed .
But the executives know that , even as their fortunes turn , employment nationwide continues to plummet .
People all around the globe have fallen into poverty as a result of the crisis that their markets engineered .
Now is the time , they declare , for a change .
It begins with this gesture of repentance .
“ We humble ourselves before the world , ” announces Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs , “ in awe of the enormous trust you place in us .
We hereby declare our rightful measure of guilt for allowing this crisis to happen , and we want to stand in solidarity with people who have suffered as a result of it ” ( his predecessor , Hank Paulson , is seen standing behind him ) .
Executives take their turn at the makeshift podium , announcing a moratorium on all bonuses , a commitment to developing regulatory structures accountable to the people , and a plan to put the dividends to use in the communities from which they came .
Uttering only a few words before stepping down , each accepts his share of responsibility for the business culture he helped foster and promises to be part of a new era of righteousness .
After not more than ten minutes , Timothy Geithner appears from the crowd .
“ Greed is no longer good , ” he says .
“ And may God forgive America . ”
The suits disappear back into their buildings , and the labyrinthine streets of Wall Street go silent .
Of course this is a ridiculous scenario .
Much more to be expected is what is actually happening .
The big banks are bigger than ever .
Restrictions on executive pay move forward in Congress only after many of those most responsible managed to duck out from federal oversight .
Recently , over dinner , I had the opportunity to hear a leading financial executive with tremendous influence in Washington explain that he and his ilk should n’t really be blamed for all this .
The rest of us should have been saving more , he said ‚ despite the frenzy of predatory lenders , fueled by a flourishing derivatives trade , and our president ’s injunction that patriotism equals endlessly shopping .
The convenient God of civil religion in the United States offers much in the way of blessing , favor , and exceptionalism , but far less in the way of repentance .
Politicians , like their televangelist spiritual advisors , are perfectly apt to humble themselves before television cameras when their sexual improprieties are revealed , but far less for what we should actually care about : how they do the jobs with which voters have entrusted them .
President Obama shows some sign of changing this tune with his spate of apologies for America ’s past behavior toward Europe , the Middle East , and Latin America .
But what he means is that his predecessor did wrong ; it remains to be seen whether he finds himself capable of being culpable too .
Save for the help of the Yes Men , the team of pranksters who apologized on the BBC for Dow Chemical ’s role in the 1984 industrial disaster in Bhopal , corporate repentance has been even rarer .
Apology is bad for business , since a public corporation ’s value is based more on the imagined confidence it inspires among stockholders than the contribution of the things it produces .
Business and politics alike embrace the public - relations insight that all news is good news .
Our culture generally , as Barbara Ehrenreich ’s new book Bright - Sided documents , has come to persist in an absurd spell of groundless optimism .
After a century spent imbibing the stuff of New Thought , a Gospel of Wealth , and the Power of Positive Thinking , this habit is as American as Johnny Appleseed ’s hard cider .
I bring this up , I should probably admit , after an evening curled up with the early chapters of Isaiah , the Bible ’s record of an eighth - century BCE Jerusalemite preacher .
He describes again and again the cycle of , first , humility and repentance and , then , restored trust and righteousness .
“ The haughtiness of people shall be humbled , and the pride of everyone shall be brought low . ”
In their own suffering , kings can finally see the widows and orphans whose cause they ’ve neglected .
Then , and only then , the prophet promises , “ You shall be called the city of righteousness , the faithful city . ”
The powerful must not lose sight of who entrusted them with power to begin with : in the case of Judean kings , God .
For American democracy , it would be more proper to direct such appeals to the people .
During the darkest days of the Iraq War , I would go to protests and find myself , rather than protesting what has already been done , simply mourning , simply repenting .
It was good to do it in a group , good to accept what we had done and what we had failed to do , and then to move on .
It is a thing I wish the country could do together , in every necessary way , offering some assurance to ourselves and the world that we will not be so blind to those at our mercy again .
Professor Jastram found that , over a period of more than 400 years , gold had proved an effective store of value and an ounce would usually buy a good , but not luxurious , outfit of clothes .
Extreme pessimists may note that he added : " When the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse galloped , a stock of gold pieces , cunningly concealed or surreptitiously carried , has often meant the difference between living and dying . "
The Globe and Mail reports that wireless providers Bell and Telus will begin selling the iPhone in Canada next month , ending the exclusivity arrangement enjoyed by Rogers Wireless since the iPhone 's introduction there in July 2008 .
Neither Bell nor Telus would confirm that they would add the iPhone to their lineups .
Apple also declined to comment .
But people familiar with the matter said the two carriers will announce a working partnership with Apple as early as Tuesday or Wednesday and begin selling the device in time for the launch of their new network next month .
The news comes just a week after O2's exclusivity arrangement with Apple for the iPhone in the UK crumbled as both Orange and Vodafone announced plans to begin offering the iPhone in the near future .
Update : Both Bell and Telus have released brief statements confirming that they will begin offering the iPhone for sale in November .
Mother :
I am debating whether Caitlin should get the H1N1 shot tomorrow .
I am not inclined to give her the normal flu shot , mostly because I prioritize vaccines for measles and other things that seem more life - threatening , but H1N1 is scarier .
She 's 17 months old .
What do you think ?
( names changed )
Rob :
This vaccine , like nearly every effective treatment ever made , has dangers .
The relevant question is not whether danger exists , but whether likely benefits outweigh likely harms .
In prior years the flu vaccine 's ability to reduce death was much greater than its likelihood of causing any side effect more serious than a sore arm .
In otherwise healthy kids Caitlin's age who got flu last spring , the probabilty of death from H1N1 " swine " flu was between .001 and .0001 ; the probability of serious side effects in flu vaccines historically ranges around .00001-.000001 .
The incidence of H1N1 flu this upcoming fall is unknown , and is important in this analysis .
Studies on the new vaccine could not determine the risk of serious side effects because no serious side effects were reported so far in over 39,000 people who have received it .
These studies found that the vaccine is good at preventing swine flu .
Between now and when you 'll have to decide what to do for Caitlin , it 's unlikely that we will obtain new , useful information to help guide this decision .
Will this vaccine be different from prior flu vaccines ?
It 's probably just like every other flu shot .
It was made using the same process to make the standard seasonal flu vaccine .
There could always be a new , common , and devastating side effect with this vaccine -- just because something has never happened before does n't make it impossible ( e. .
Popper 's black swan , also the 2008 housing crisis ) .
You said the process for making H1N1 vaccine was the same as for prior flu vaccines .
Why then are there all these worries about the safety of it ?
If there is any scientific basis for the worry , I am not aware of it .
Popular culture concerns over health issues follow a rhythm and a logic that I do not understand .
Did you read the New Yorker article about the 1920's Parrot Fever that spread in the US ?
It probably addresses your question better than I can .
Timing .
It takes a while between when we identify a pathogenic flu strain and when we can create a vaccine , establish saftey / efficacy , and produce hundreds of millions of doses .
If the swine flu outbreak last winter had begun a few months sooner , then there would have been enough time to incorporate the swine flu vaccine into the seasonal vaccine this year .
For other flu shots , last year 's seasonal flu shot for example , do they test the safety of that specific flu shot before distributing it for widespread public use ?
Yes .
Same process .
Do you think that if we waited another month we'd have any more info - if the 39,000 people were to become 100,000 , for example , as a result of widescale vaccination campaigns ?
Sure , but this also increases Caitlin 's risk of catching swine flu during the wait .
One more - what is the likelihood of side effects occurring a while after the vaccine - i.e. for the 39,000 people to be fine now but develop a problem sometime in the near future ?
How long does Guillain - Barre take to manifest ?
Another good question .
And a tricky one .
Some scientists argue that the flu vaccine does not cause Guillain - Barre syndrome ( GBS ) , and that the extra GBS cases we saw during the 1976 round of flu vaccination were coincidental .
It 's usually challenging to establish causality in anything that 's occurring in 1 in 100,000 people .
I do n't have an opinion here .
How much time passes between vaccine administration and GBS ?
I do n't know the answer .
I suspect the data set we have on this is so tiny that you can't figure it out -- which is to say , I 'm guessing that it is not knowable .
For what it 's worth , I 've never seen a case of GBS in my 10 years of doing medicine .
Here 's more info on the history of GBS and the flu vaccine :
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/09/health/09vaccine.html
What 's your personal opinion ?
I 'm getting my H1N1 shot in the next few weeks ; got the seasonal shot 3 weeks ago .
" Doctors aim to prevent death .
The long - term death rate is 100 % .

Sonette Ehlers , of South Africa ( the rape capital of the world ) , has invented an anti-rape device that goes by the name , Rapex .
The device is basically a female condom with teeth lining the inside that work just like the protective spikes in a parking garage …
You can go in , but whatever you do , do n't back out .
The teeth are angled so they allow penetration , but bite like a shark as the penis is removed ; supposedly causing so much pain that it will give the woman a chance to escape .
Further , according to Ms. Ehlers , the device will need to be surgically removed at a hospital , which will lead to the capture of the rapist .
Lawyers , Guns , and Money
As the Obama administration ’s Sudan policy review drags on , the Sudanese government , led by a wanted war criminal , President Omar Hassan al - Bashir , clearly looks to Washington and dreams of normalizing relations .
So how has Bashir tried to work his way back into the good graces of the United States ?
Well , there has been a recent spate of government attacks in Darfur , and a recent Small Arms Survey report suggests that most of the new and heavier weaponry appearing in militia clashes in South Sudan likely comes from government stockpiles .
Certainly , the government has not given the slightest suggestion that it will hand Bashir over to the International Criminal Court to face charges .
Khartoum has not been on a charm offensive .
Instead of actually changing its behavior , Sudan ’s ruling National Congress Party wants to return to favor in Washington the old - fashioned way : by swamping a bunch of high - powered lobbyists in a sea of money to make its case .
Thanks to two excellent recent articles by the Washington Post ‘s Dan Eggen , we have gained a much clearer window into the behind - the - scenes machinations of the National Congress Party and the greedy inside - the - Beltway types lining up to do the party ’s bidding .
In the process , we have also gained some alarming insight into how the administration is dealing with this mess .
As actress Lily Tomlin once said , " No matter how cynical you get , you just ca n’t keep up . "
The first bombshell dropped when former U.S. National Security Advisor Bud McFarlane of Iran-Contra fame was outed by the Post as having accepted $ 1.3 million , passed through the government of Qatar , to represent the Sudanese government as it tried to warm relations with Washington .
McFarlane somehow forgot that this kind of representation usually requires registering as a lobbyist on behalf of a foreign government , something he did not do for either Qatar or Sudan .
Making matters worse , Sudan is still on the state sponsors of terrorism list .
But the niceties of paperwork never appear to have been McFarlane ’s strong suit .
So what did the Sudanese get for their $ 1.3 million ?
According to the White House , current National Security Advisor James L. Jones and the special envoy for Sudan , retired Maj. Gen. Scott Gration , had " conversations " with McFarlane to discuss " the urgent need to improve the security situation in Sudan and the need for development in southern Sudan . "
It does not pass the laugh test to believe that the Sudanese government was spending more than a million dollars to express its concerns , via McFarlane , about development prospects for South Sudan given that the ruling party views the South as a mortal enemy .
On one level , you can certainly understand how Jones and Gration got mousetrapped into taking the meeting with McFarlane ; he is a former national security advisor after all .
But Jones has also failed to detail whether he has held any other meetings with outsiders on Sudan , leaving as a real likelihood that the only outsider he has consulted on Sudan policy is a disgraced former national security advisor on the take from Khartoum .
The second shoe fell with Eggen ’s article revealing that Robert B. Crowe , a partner at Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough ( and a prominent fundraiser for the Democratic Party ) , has been working behind the scenes to lock down a lobbying contract with the Sudanese government .
Crowe , who might be every bit as ethically challenged as McFarlane , at least had the good sense to try and garner support from Gration and Sen.
John Kerry , with whom he reportedly has good ties , to ensure that he could get legal approval to sign a lobbying contract .
And because truth is invariably stranger than fiction in this business , celebrity television doctor Bob Arnot also appears mixed up in all of this .
To quote the article :
The lobbying proposal arose out of discussions this year between aides to Kerry , who led a congressional delegation to Khartoum in April , and Bob Arnot , a physician and television personality active in humanitarian causes , according to several of those involved in the debate .
Arnot then approached Crowe with the idea , leading to an application this summer with the Treasury Department ’s Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ) , which must approve any U.S. firm doing business with Sudan .
A State Department official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said OFAC rejected the initial application on Gration ’s recommendation .
That led to further talks between Crowe , Gration and other administration officials .
" It was our understanding that Nelson Mullins was going to work on getting support from key members of Congress about the work they wanted to pursue in Sudan , " the official said .
This passage may shed light on a curious exchange Gration had when testifying before Kerry in July .
At that hearing , when discussing Sudan , Gration declared , " At some point we ’re going to have to unwind some of these sanctions . "
Many were baffled by Gration ’s comments at the time because exemptions already exist for humanitarian relief and South Sudan has argued strongly that sanctions against the government should stay in place .
What Gration might actually have been doing , with a wink and a nod , was offering the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee assurance that his favored lobbyist would also be eligible for a piece of Khartoum ’s pie .
None of these stories looks very good for an administration that promised to take a very tough line with Khartoum upon entering office .
Perhaps a shorter response from the administration would be more appropriate when addressing those who seek to lobby on Khartoum ’s behalf at a time when almost 3 million Darfuris remain displaced :
Get lost .
As for the lobbyists themselves , with health - care reform , energy legislation , and a hundred other issues working through Congress right now , are times really so hard that the only work they can find is representing war criminals ?
16 August 1957 : a nurse at Montefiore Hospital gets the first Asian flu vaccine shot in New York ( Image : Associated Press )
Six months ago , swine flu emerged as a massive threat to global health .
It seemed to come out of nowhere , but our timeline explains how the origins of the H1N1 pandemic go back more than a century
1889
Prior to 1889 , the main flu virus circulating in humans has been from the H1 family .
But this year , a new strain of H2 flu emerges in Russia and spreads around the world , killing about 1 million people .
Afterwards , H2 replaces H1 in humans .
Such replacements seem to be a regular feature of flu pandemics .
People born before 1889 , who have been exposed to H1 flu , have some immunity to it .
This affords them some protection in the deadly H1N1 epidemic of 1918 .
Those born after 1889 do not have any immunity to H1 .

1918
The “ Spanish flu ” epidemic of 1918 kills at least 50 million people worldwide .
It is caused by an H1N1 virus which evolves directly from a bird flu into a human flu .
After a mild wave of infections in the summer , the epidemic goes global : one - third of the population eventually get sick .
Although most cases are mild , many sufferers develop a rapidly fatal infection deep in their lungs .
People born before 1889 are less susceptible , thanks to their previous exposure to H1N1 .
Most deaths are caused by bacterial lung infections that move in after the virus .
Modern antibiotics might mean that a re-run of the 1918 pandemic would be less dangerous .
After 1919 , the descendants of the H1N1 virus continue to circulate and cause seasonal flu outbreaks in humans – and pigs .
1931
Swine flu is first isolated from a pig in Iowa .
1933
The first human flu virus is isolated at Mill Hill in London .
When given to ferrets , it produces a disease whose symptoms are all but identical to the Iowan pig virus .
But ferrets that have had the human virus are not fully immune to the pig virus , showing that the two viruses have already started to evolve apart .
1957
An H2N2 virus causes the “ Asian ” flu pandemic , completely displacing the H1N1 viruses that have been circulating in humans since 1918 .
The pandemic is fairly mild , killing 1 to 1.5 million people worldwide .
The virus is produced by a reassortment , in which human - adapted H1N1 swaps genes with an H2N2 bird flu .
The new H and N surface proteins mean most people do not have antibodies to the virus , allowing it to go pandemic .
However , its human - adapted genes mean it is not as lethal to humans as the 1918 virus , which came , with few changes , from birds .
People tend to mount the best immune response to the first kind of flu virus they experience .
Because of this , people born before 1957 , whose first experience of flu would have been the H1N1 viruses then in circulation , have some immunity to the 2009 H1N1 strain causing the current pandemic .
People born after the 1957 pandemic do not have this immunity .
1968
An H3N2 virus causes the “ Hong Kong ” flu pandemic , which is even milder than the Asian flu , killing an estimated 0.75 million to 1 million people worldwide .
The virus only differs from H2N2 in one of its surface proteins , the H ; since many people still have antibodies to the unchanged N2 protein , its effects are less severe .
But because H3N2 completely replaces H2N2 in people , no one born since 1968 has any immunity to H2 .
1972
Researchers Graham Laver and Robert Webster discover that waterfowl are the natural hosts of influenza viruses .
The birds harbour strains unknown in humans that could reassort with human strains and give rise to new human pandemics .
1976
An H1N1 virus jumps from pigs to humans and kills a US army recruit .
However the virus does not spread beyond the army base and fizzles out without triggering a pandemic .
Nevertheless , fears of a replay of the 1918 pandemic lead to 48 million people being hastily vaccinated against the swine flu virus .
The vaccine is associated with an unusual number of cases of Guillain - Barré syndrome : 532 people get it , and 25 die .
1977
An H1N1 virus appears in north - east China and starts circulating in humans .
It causes seasonal flu in every subsequent year .
No one knows where it came from , though it looks like an H1N1 that circulated in the Soviet Union in 1950 and some suspect it escaped in a laboratory accident .
The virus causes a mild flu pandemic , which mainly affects people born after H1N1 flu disappeared in 1957 .
However , the real surprise is that it does not displace the previous , and more virulent , seasonal flu , H3N2 .
Instead , it continues circulating alongside it .
The antibodies people produce after being infected by this new seasonal H1N1 do not protect against 2009 H1N1 .
However , infections also trigger another reaction called cell - mediated immunity , in which certain white blood cells target and destroy infected cells .
Tests of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine show that , unlike antibodies , cell - mediated immunity to seasonal H1N1 may help protect against the pandemic virus .
This does not prevent disease altogether , but can reduce its severity
1998
The predecessor of the 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus emerges in the US .
It is a hybrid of human , bird and swine flu viruses , and by 1999 it is the dominant flu strain in US pigs .
US pig farms try to control it with vaccines , but these attempts are largely ineffective because the virus evolves too rapidly , changing the surface proteins targeted by the vaccine while keeping its internal genes unchanged .
The 2009 pandemic virus is a variant on this 1998 flu , and behaves the same way .
2004 -2006
H5N1 flu , first identified as a threat to humans in Hong Kong in 1997 , spreads from Asia around the world , apparently carried by wild birds .
While this “ bird flu ” proves deadly to humans , killing more than half of its victims , it is kept in check by its inability to spread readily from human to human .
H5N1 is also found in pigs in Indonesia , raising fears that it might reassort with other human flu viruses that pigs can harbour .
The threat posed by bird flu leads to the first real efforts to be made at pandemic planning : governments start to stockpile antiviral drugs , and the world ’s drug companies start doing serious research on pandemic vaccines .
These plans are made with the highly lethal H5N1 in mind , meaning that they are not always appropriate for the 2009 pandemic .

2007-2008
Pandemic fears boost spending on flu research .
European scientists start organising to track flu in wild birds , Vietnamese scientists find that antibodies from bird flu victims can cure other cases of the virus ( a technique used in Hong Kong in 2009 ) , the risk of dying of flu is found to be partly genetic , and it turns out that your mother was right to warn you about catching the flu when it ’s cold out .
However , Indonesia , where most H5N1 outbreaks are happening , refuses to share samples of the virus , arguing that it will not benefit in return from any vaccines developed as a result .
This means scientists cannot monitor the virus ’s evolution .
But worries about H5N1 subside as it fails to become contagious in people – although virologists continue to warn that it is not the only threatening flu virus out there .
Viruses from the H9 , H7 and H2 families all give cause for concern .
March 2009
The first cases of a new type of swine flu are reported in California and Texas in late March .
Subsequent genetic analysis suggests that it may have started circulating in humans in January .
April 2009
On 27 April , with 900 cases of suspected swine flu reported in Mexico , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) upgrades the pandemic warning level from 3 to 4 on a six - point scale .
Intensive efforts to understand the virus and develop a vaccine begin immediately .
The US government advises against travel to Mexico , although research suggests that travel bans will not stop the virus spreading .
May 2009
Although swine flu seems to be spreading slowly , it is still progressing quickly enough to justify preparing for a pandemic .
However , the WHO delays declaring a pandemic , partly because there is not enough evidence that the virus is spreading in the general population outside the Americas , where it originated .
New Scientist reveals that Europe is not testing people with flu symptoms unless they have recently travelled to an affected area in the Americas , or have had close contact with someone who did .
As a result , Europe cannot detect spread in the general population .
These restrictions may be making the pandemic “ invisible ” to the monitoring authorities .
As concerns mount , it transpires that many countries are poorly prepared for this scenario and that supplies of H1N1 vaccine cannot be prepared in time to catch the second wave .
June 2009
The UK and other countries change their rules and start testing people who have flu but no North American contacts .
Cases of swine flu are soon detected .
On 11 June the WHO officially declares swine flu to be a pandemic .
This is the signal for the vaccine industry to start making pandemic vaccine ( paid for by governments ) , rather than conventional flu vaccine ( paid for by ordinary health services ) .
July 2009
Treatment plans are shaken by the discovery of swine flu that is resistant to the antiviral drug Tamiflu and the realisation that the H1N1 vaccine is growing only half as fast as the ordinary flu vaccine .
The US decides to use its standard formulation for flu vaccine , so no new regulatory tests will be needed .
This will allow it to authorise pandemic vaccine before September , when a renewed wave of the pandemic is expected .
But this formulation uses a lot of virus , and so reduces the number of doses that can be made .
Researchers discover that the swine flu virus binds far deeper in the lungs than ordinary flu , possibly explaining why it is sometimes fatal .
However , the majority of cases are still mild , and it appears that many of the people with severe cases have an underlying health problem – although some of these “ problems ” are no more remarkable than being overweight , pregnant or unborn .
In the southern hemisphere , where it is winter , swine flu apparently replaces the usual seasonal flu .
This suggests that the pandemic virus will displace the two previous seasonal flu strains , as previous pandemics have done .
However , after the experience of 1977 , when this did not happen , scientists do not rule out the return of H3N2 after the autumn wave of swine flu .
August 2009
A New Scientist poll reveals widespread concern about swine flu among public health officials and epidemiologists , many of whom have obtained supplies of antiviral drugs for their own families .
September 2009
Four major vaccine manufacturers report that their swine flu vaccines work with only one shot .
This is good news , given that vaccine is in short supply despite researchers ’ success in finding faster - growing strains .
The vaccine ’s effectiveness suggests there must be pre-existing cell - mediated immunity , possibly because of similarities between the surface proteins on swine flu and the seasonal H1N1 flu that emerged in 1977 .
As autumn arrives in the northern hemisphere , experts are on tenterhooks : a particular worry is that swine flu will hybridise with bird flu to create a readily contagious human flu armed with a lethal H5 surface protein .
At time of writing , the virus had not become more severe , causing mild disease in most sufferers but making a small number – probably less than 1 per cent – extremely ill .
October 2009
Vaccination programmes begin in the US and Europe , but many healthcare workers are reluctant to have the vaccine , even though it is virtually identical to the seasonal vaccines used in previous years , which have a good safety record .
Production delays also continue to plague the deployment of vaccine .
By 22 October , the US has only 27 million doses available , compared with the expected 45 million .
Researchers show that this much vaccine will reduce the number of cases in the second wave by less than 6 per cent – but that is still enough to save 2000 lives .
Six months after swine flu first shot to world attention , US President Barack Obama declares the virus a national emergency .

The pandemic of 2009
Citigroup is in serious trouble .
It 's easy to tell by what they are doing .
Inquiring minds note that Citi Abruptly Shutting Down Gas -Linked Credit Cards .
Citi ( C ) is abruptly shutting down credit cards linked to gas station partners .
The bank is offering few details :
The bank said in a statement it " decided to close a limited number of oil partner co-branded MasterCard accounts . "
That includes not only Shell , but Citgo , ExxonMobil and Phillips 66 - Conoco cards .
The close date was Wednesday , and letters were sent out Monday to customers informing them of the change , a Citi spokesman said .
The bank would not say how many cards were shut down or how much available credit they represented .
Yesterday , we reported on how scores of people across the country had found their gas station - linked credit cards from Citibank had been canceled .
One reader , Rachel , emailed us and explained her frustration .
I received two letters by mail from Citibank yesterday .
One said that because I always paid my account on time and that I was such a great customer they were increasing my credit limit .
The next letter I opened stated that Citibank was raising my interest rate from the current 18.99 % to 29.99 % .
My husband and I have good credit and are making a genuine effort to get out of debt by purchasing next to nothing on credit .
While I am ashamed to admit this to you we owe $ 25,000 to Citibank , our choices at this time are very limited .
I have made some calculations and in order to pay the balance before they forcibly close my account , my husband and I must make payments of $ 1400 per month , this is a substantial increase from the minimum balances they require of $ 665 per month .
I have not opted to pay Citibank the 29.99 % interest .
...
Citigroup Pressure Builds
Citibank 's average yield year - to - date ( consumer and plastic ) was about 12 % .
But they 're suffering 10 % defaults , making their true margin about 2 % .
That 's still a positive number .... if it 's accurate .
This spread , of course , has a lot to do with previously - issued fixed - rate 12.99 % cards ( they and everyone else had a lot ) that were handed out like candy to everyone and their brother , frequently with $ 10,000 , $ 20,000 or even $ 50,000 credit lines .
Huge numbers of small business owners - especially sole proprietors - use these cards as a means of financing operations .
They relied on that 10 or 12 % interest rate , and most of them have huge balances outstanding .
I have since confirmed that this letter is not just going to people who have had credit " challenges " .
Indeed , this appears to be a blanket change on the part of Citibank .
I now have multiple copies from people who assert that they have 750 +
FICOs and have never missed a payment on this or any other obligation - the " paragon " of so - called " responsible " credit use .
All of the letters are identical .
The problem should be obvious - for someone with one of the 12.99 % cards that is now 30 % , this is a radical change that more than doubles monthly interest expense .
Of those who have sent me copies of this letter and disclosed their previous rate , none were over 20 % , meaning that these changes represent 50 % or greater interest rate increases .
If you 're anywhere near the edge of being unable to pay , this will shove you off the bridge and into the deep , shark - infested water of bankruptcy .
Perhaps what we 're really seeing is a business reacting to hidden deterioration of asset bases that are not known by investors and the public due to the legitimation of bogus accounting that happened this last March , but which is known by company executives !
This sort of " terms change " , which is an effective declaration of default even against those who have n't defaulted ( see above ; the same 30 % rate is being applied to defaulted and non-defaulted accounts ! ) , will drive two consumer behaviors that could ultimately destroy Citibank 's credit card business and perhaps the bank as a whole :
1 . Those who can transfer balances out somewhere else and / or pay them off will immediately do so .
Nobody is going to pay a 30 % interest rate and an imposition of default rates on non-defaulted balances willingly and on purpose unless they have no other choice .
2 . A significant number of people , on receipt of this notice and understanding what it means ( a declaration that non-defaulted accounts are being charged the same penalty rate as a defaulted account ! ) will immediately go out and charge up the entire unused balance on their card and then intentionally default .
In short , this looks to me like a " Hail Mary " pass .
So long as this remains a Citibank - only story my interpretation is that Citibank is in a lot worse financial shape than is being let on - perhaps poor enough that they 're at risk of imploding anyway , " too big to fail " or not .
nice
Perhaps what we 're really seeing is a business reacting to hidden deterioration of asset bases that are not known by investors and the public due to the legitimation of bogus accounting that happened this last March , but which is known by company executives !
Citigroup 's Shadow Assets
The Financial Accounting Standards Board postponed a measure , opposed by Citigroup Inc. and the securities industry , forcing banks to bring off - balance - sheet assets such as mortgages and credit - card receivables back onto their books .
FASB , the Norwalk , Connecticut - based panel that sets U.S. accounting standards , voted 5 - 0 today to delay the rule change until fiscal years starting after Nov. 15 , 2009 .
The board needs to give financial institutions more time to prepare for the switch , FASB member Thomas Linsmeier said at a board meeting .
" We need to get a new standard into effect , " Linsmeier said , though " it 's not practical " to begin requiring companies to put assets underlying securitizations onto their books this year .
Enquiring minds may wish to consider Citigroup 's $ 1.1 Trillion in Mysterious Shadow Assets .
If Citigroup is looking for an award , it can take the blue ribbon for greed , arrogance , and stupidity in the off balance sheet category .
There are plenty of other categories and more blue ribbons will be awarded .
Nominations are being taken now .

SHANGHAI ( Reuters ) - China ’s carbon emissions will start to fall by 2050 , its top climate change policymaker said , the first time the world ’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases has given a timeframe for a decline , the Financial Times reported Saturday .
The comments by Su Wei did not indicate at what level emissions would top out .
He restated Beijing ’s view that because China still needs to expand its economy to pull people out of poverty , it was too soon to discuss emissions caps , the Financial Times said .
At a G8 meeting in July , China and India resisted calls to agree to a 50 percent cut in global emissions by 2050 , posing a major obstacle for a new United Nations pact due to be agreed upon in Copenhagen in mid-December .
“ China ’s emissions will not continue to rise beyond 2050 , ” the Financial Times quoted Su , director - general of the climate change department at the National Development and Reform Commission , China ’s top planning body , as saying in an interview .
“ China will not continue growing emissions without limit or insist that all nations must have the same per-capita emissions .
If we did that , this earth would be ruined . ”
Go tell it on the mountain !
Today the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finally put an end to the saga of the infamous Spruce Mine , jamming a stake in the heart of what would have been the largest mountaintop removal project in the history of West Virginia .
EPA rejected the permit for this mine due to massive water quality impacts that would have resulted from a series of mega-valley fills .
As the agency said in its just - released statement :
File this under " No Cool , Wacky Deed Shall Go Unlitigated . "
John Schnatter , Papa John of Papa John 's Pizza , put out a $ 250,000 A.P.B. to find his long lost 1971 1/2 Camaro Z28 .
According to the folks at Papa John , the person who won the money was the one whose name was on the title of the car – that is , the owner of the car was paid the dosh for selling the car back to Schnatter .
Kentuckian Jeff Robinson came forth with the car and took home the cash .
The Papa John 's folks say the rules never said anything about finder 's fees .
But when the Sloanes of Indiana helped point Schnatter to Robinson , Schnatter offered them $ 25,000 for the assist .
How did the Sloanes know about the car ?
They had owned it previously and sold it to Robinson .
Now the Sloanes are n't happy about " only " getting $ 25,000 .
Billie Sloane wants more of that quarter million , and will sue Papa John if he does n't pony up the cake .
Her evidence is " advertisements and a press release that promised the money to whomever could ' reveal the car 's whereabouts . ' "
Jeff Robinson chimes in , though , and says Sloane came to him and said the original owner would buy the car from him for $ 125,000 , and says that she did n't mention the contest nor the full amount of the reward .
No matter .
Now it 's between Sloane , Papa , and potentially the courts .
If only Papa John had listened to the late M.J. about another famous Billie : " So take my strong advice , just remember to always think twice ... "
Um , yeah , never saw this one coming .
Good luck , Papa John ... [ Source : WLKY News
16×24 deck built of Yellawood .
Back in October I built a 7×7 hot tub platform with utility pole posts , 2×8 joists and 2×6 decking .
It is about 11 ” high on the short side and 19 ” on the high side .
We set the hot tub up and allowed it to settle over the winter ( all that water really helps it settle ! ) .
Once spring arrived ,
The deck was built around it .
The deck was framed up in two sections .
First section was 16 × 16 butted up against one side of the hot tub , then extended 8 ’ past and around it .
The inner post of the stairs is the extension point .
4×4 posts at 8 ’. 2×8 joists at 16 ” .
2×8 beams .
5/4×6 decking and top rail .
I decided to make the rails “ backwards ” from what you would normally see simply because I like the idea of having some “ knee area ” when you ’re leaning on the rail , and I think the balusters look a little slicker this way .
Just personal preference .
The wife loves it and is very glad that she does n’t have the rickety old steps that were there before , or have to climb up and down out of the hot tub any more !
Things I learned while building this project :
My level is n’t perfectly level
My square is n’t perfectly square
Just because this board was straight yesterday does n’t mean it is today

I apparently missed the largest flash mob in American history today , and it took place just a few blocks from my house .
Michelle Malkin and the redstaters have been abuzz about how there were more than two million people marching on Washington today , ( that would make it bigger than even the inauguration ) but all anyone who was n't a right - winger saw today was 30,000 to 60,000 right - wingers bused in from around the country .
Here 's what the organizers themselves told us to expect .
Dick Armey told the right - wing Newsmax that they 're generating hundreds of responses in interest to the 9/12 March .
The tea party patriots told us that they were expecting as many as one million to turn out and that they had permits for a one million man march on Washington .
After reading breathlessly on the twitter feeds of several right - wingers that millions of people were descending on the capital , Michelle Malkin on her blog estimated two million people .
I went up to take pictures of crazy signs , of which there were many , many , many , many samples .
Now , there were real people at the rally .
At certain points organizers for different county Republican parties would use a bullhorn to try to round up their members back to the buses for the trip back to Pennsylvania and Virginia .
But one would think that after six months of organizing by Fox News and local Republican parties , the 9/12 protests could get more than thirty to sixty thousand people to come out to D.C.
After all , there 's apparently a groundswell of anger at the President .
If nothing else , there 's got to be more than 30,000 Republicans who live around the DC area .
I wanted to provide some perspective about the difference between thirty thousand people and one million people .
For reference , the teabaggers were mostly in front of the Capitol and around the Capitol 's reflecting pool .
For anyone not familiar with DC , they were directly to the east of 3rd Street in Washington .
For reference , I crossed 3rd Street and took a picture facing west from the Capitol at the Washington Monument , similar to some of the crowd shots we 'd seen after the inauguration .
Here 's the difference between the teabaggers ' protest today vs. President Obama 's inaguration crowd , which included anywhere from 1 million to 1.5 million people .
So , what happened to all that grassroots anger ?
The largest annual study of patient outcomes at each of the nation 's 5,000 nonfederal hospitals found a wide gap in quality between the nation 's best hospitals and all others .
According to the study , issued today by HealthGrades , the leading independent healthcare ratings organization , patients at highly rated hospitals have a 52 percent lower chance of dying compared with the U.S. hospital average , a quality chasm that has persisted for the last decade even as mortality rates , in general , have declined .
The study also found that hospitals that have received the Stroke Certification from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations ( JCAHO ) had an eight percent lower risk - adjusted mortality rate than hospitals that have not received this certification .
The twelfth annual HealthGrades Hospital Quality in America Study examined nearly 40 million Medicare hospitalization records from the years 2006 , 2007 and 2008 .
The study looks at trends in mortality and complication rates and also provides the foundation for HealthGrades ' quality ratings of procedures and diagnoses at each individual hospital .
The new 2010 ratings for individual hospitals are available at http://www.healthgrades.com, HealthGrades ' public
Web site designed to help patients compare the quality of care at their local hospitals for 28 different procedures and treatments , from hip replacement to bypass surgery .
" The fact is , patients are twice as likely to die at low - rated hospitals than at highly rated hospitals for the same diagnoses and procedures , " said Rick May , MD , an author of the HealthGrades study .
" With Washington focused on rewarding high - quality hospitals and empowering patients to make more informed healthcare choices , this information comes at a turning point in the healthcare debate .
For patients , sites like HealthGrades.com already provide the objective information needed to choose a high - quality hospital .
And for hospitals themselves , HealthGrades ' hospital ratings provide the benchmarking data that can help them reach the benchmarks set by top performers . "
The study also found the following :
Overall , inhospital , risk - adjusted mortality at the nation 's hospitals improved , on average , 10.99 % from 2006 through 2008 .
Across all 17 procedures and diagnoses in which mortality was studied , there was an approximate 71.64 % lower chance of dying in a five - star rated hospital compared to a one - star rated hospital .
Across all 17 procedures and diagnoses studied , there was an approximate 51.53 % lower chance of dying in a five - star rated hospital compared to the national average .
If all hospitals performed at the level of a five - star rated hospital across the 17 procedures and diagnoses studied , 224,537 Medicare lives could potentially have been saved from 2006 through 2008 .
Approximately 57 % ( 127,488 ) of the potentially preventable deaths were associated with just four diagnoses : sepsis ( 44,622 ) ; pneumonia ( 29,251 ) ; heart failure ( 26,374 ) and respiratory failure ( 27,241 ) .
Over the last three studies , Ohio and Florida consistently have had the greatest percentage of hospitals in the top 15 % for risk - adjusted mortality .
Complications
Across all procedures in which complications were studied , there was a 79.69 % lower chance of experiencing one or more inhospital complications in a five - star rated hospital compared to a one - star rated hospital .
Across all procedures studied , there was a 61.22 % lower chance of experiencing one or more inhospital complications in a five - star rated hospital compared to the U.S. hospital average .
If all hospitals performed at the level of a five - star rated hospital , 110,687 orthopedic inhospital complications may have been avoided among Medicare patients over the three years studied .
Stroke
Joint Commission stroke - certified hospitals were almost twice as likely to attain five - star status in stroke ( 30.1 % of certified hospitals were five - star versus 15.7 % of non-certified ) , and fewer of the stroke - certified hospitals fell into the one - star category ( 12.3 % versus 19.6 % ) .
Joint Commission stroke - certified hospitals have an 8.06 % lower risk - adjusted mortality rate compared to hospitals that were not stroke - certified .
HealthGrades ' Hospital Ratings
HealthGrades rates each of the nation 's 5,000 nonfederal hospitals in nearly 30 procedures and diagnoses , allowing individuals to compare their local hospitals online at http://www.healthgrades.com.
The ratings are objective , created from data provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and 17 states that publish outcomes data .
HealthGrades ' hospital ratings are independently created ; no hospital can opt - in or opt - out of being rated .
No hospital pays to be rated .
Each hospital receives a one - , three - or five - star rating for each procedure or diagnosis , reflecting the mortality or complication rates at that hospital .
Mortality and complication rates are risk - adjusted , which takes into account differing levels of severity of patient illness at different hospitals and allows for hospitals to be compared on equal footing .
What 's worse than downloading fake antivirus software and paying to " clean " your system of a virus that never existed in the first place ?
How about being locked out of your PC and having your files held for a $ 79.95 ransom ?
Malware Peddlers Up the Ante with Ransomware
In the past , malware peddlers cashed in after coaxing innocent people into purchasing fake software they do n't need .
In an effort to spike profits , however , malware scammers are now upping the ante by infecting PCs and demanding users pay a set ransom to retrieve their files and documents .
All it takes is 1 wrong click or a visit to a malicious website and your PC could become infected .
Total Security 2009 : Total Scam
One particular rogue antivirus program ( Total Security 2009 ) assumes control and restricts access to your PC until you purchase a serial number from them .
The software becomes , essentially , a double - edged sword .
Those who purchase the serial number ( with the price currently hovering around the $ 79.95 mark ) will re-gain access to their computer , but will be stuck with the unwanted and , for all intents - and - purposes , unsafe , scamming software .
( Source : yahoo.com )
Unfortunately , attempts at bypassing the fake warnings have proven unsuccessful .
Instead , fake pop -up warnings will appear claiming that any file the user opens is infected .
The only resolution , the user is led to believe , is to purchase the rogue software to alleviate the problem .
Surprisingly , attempts at holding files hostage ( otherwise known as Ransomware ) has existed for years now , but its spread has been confined to select online black markets .
Still , this contemporary form of " ware " ( to accompany the infamous list of malware , spyware , scareware , etc. ) presents an even more disturbing twist to yet another layer of dubious " safety measures " .
Panda to the Rescue
Victims of a Total Security 2009 Ransomware attack need not fret for too long .
Antivirus maker Panda Security has stepped in to offer assistance , posting a whole batch of serial numbers that will trick the fake app into unlocking your files without the fee .

Panda does warn , however , that these rogue companies are constantly changing their numbers in an effort to stay ahead of the " real " security companies , so running legitimate antivirus programs as often as possible is always going to be the most immediate prevention tool .

Hatch Creating New Network To Cultivate User Generated Content
If Richard Hatch ( Battlestar Galactica ) has his way , the future of great science fiction programming will be user generated , not studio produced .
In an interview with Geeks of Doom , the actor / writer / director says he plans to launch an online network ( first reported last year ) comprised of original web based series that would not only unleash the creativity and talent in the sci- fi / fantasy community , but also cultivate it .
“ So often sci - fi shows are run by people who , I do n’t really think , understand Science Fiction .
Too many great shows go down way too soon , ” says Hatch , who listed Firefly , Babylon 5 , and others involving spaceships as just some of the casualties .
“ They ’ve all gone off the air because those networks are n’t set up to serve the sci - fi community . ”
This new network would do precisely that , serve the community , he says , adding , “ [ it would ] … begin to open up a doorway to so much more exciting programming than what ’s being offered now . ”
It would also allow talented people to expose their ideas to the masses , much in the same way user generated videos get their start on YouTube .
The shows that generate excitement and gain an audience would then start getting developed , gain a real budget and begin getting produced , according to Hatch .
While the project is still in development , it will be partnering with the SoulGeek dating site , which Hatch currently doing exclusive programming for , including Who the Frak is Richard Hatch , a new reality show that will document a group of people ’s journey through the industry ’s up ’s and down’s .
Holder Decides No Death Penalty for U.S. Embassy Bomber U.S. will not seek death penalty for for accused terrorist Ahmed Ghailani .
Oct. 5 , 2009  -- Attorney General Eric Holder has decided that the United States will not seek the death penalty for Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , who is on trial in New York city for the deadly 1998 U.S. embassy attacks in Tanzania and Kenya .
Prosecutors say he was a key facilitator in the attacks .
Ghailani is the first Guantanamo Bay detainee to come to the United States and face trial .
He is a Tanzanian national who had been held since September 2006 at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba until his transfer to New York City last June .
The decision not to seek the death penalty in the case was disclosed in a one sentence letter from the Attorney General to the U.S. Attorney in New York asserting , " You are authorized and directed not to seek the death penalty against Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani . "
The letter was dated last Friday but was entered into court records on Monday afternoon .
The accused al Qaeda operative is facing 286 separate counts for his alleged role in the Aug. 7 , 1998 , bombing of the U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania and Nairobi , Kenya that killed 224 people .
Asked about the Attorney General 's decision in a statement DOJ spokesman Matthew Miller said , " Ahmed Ghailani is on trial for the murder of 224 people , and we are committed to bringing him to justice for his alleged crimes .
Other defendants in the embassy bombings case have either already either received life sentences or will not be subject to the death penalty because the United States agreed not to seek it as a condition of their extradition .
Given those circumstances and other factors in this case , the Attorney General authorized the U.S. Attorney to seek a life sentence . "
One official noted that military commission prosecutors were n't seeking the death penalty for Ghailani when he had been going through the Commission process at Guantanamo Bay .
In the wake of 9/11 accused Al Qaeda suspect Zacarias Moussoaui faced the death penalty for his knowledge of Al Qaeda operations around the globe and his plotting with senior members of Al Qaeda to possibly take part in a second wave attack after 9/11 .
During his federal court trial in Virginia a jury decided that Moussaoui had no role in the 9/11 attacks and decided against giving him the death penalty in a two phase trial .
The lead prosecutor in the Ghailani case David Raskin was also part of the trial team that prosecuted Moussaoui .
Ghailani was originally indicted in 1998 , and a superseding indictment , for which he is facing trial , was returned in March 2001 .
Captured in July 2004 in Pakistan , Ghailani was part of the CIA 's High Value Terrorist Detainee program and was eventually transferred to Guantanamo Bay .
Defense attorneys for Ghailani could not be reached for comment Monday evening .
The vehicle shown above may be both yellow and submersible , but please do n't call it a submarine .
It 's a Scubacraft , the first self - contained submersible that 's also a capable surface watercraft .
The brainchild of engineers and entrepreneurs from Wales , Scubacraft uses an internal - combustion engine to reach a dive site where it can descend to a maximum depth of about 100 feet .
" The experience is simply exhilarating , " Scubacraft sales and marketing director James Browne told Wired.com .
" Nothing else can compare to traveling to a dive site at 50 mph and then powering effortlessly under the water . "
It 's not a pressurized submarine , which means that those on board must wear scuba gear before submersion .
With no cranes needed to lower the craft below water and no boat needed to carry it out to sea , a Scubacraft is significantly more versatile and less expensive than similarly sized submarines .
Scubacraft wo n't say how much the craft costs , but other sources put the figure at $ 164,000 .
That 's a lot of cash , but Browne says you might recoup pretty quickly .
While the company is n't ignoring the lucrative Dr. No-wannabe market , Browne says that Scubacraft ownership " presents a range of commercial applications , as well as the opportunity [ to ] offer people underwater adventure tours and generate revenue . "
Beyond underwater tourism , Browne says film producers are especially interested .
A future Scubacraft concept even features a dedicated filming platform that hopefully will be used for IMAX nature films , not Waterworld 2 .
" We are actively engaged with a number of film producers who have expressed interest in using it as a filming platform due to the unique opportunities it presents in being able to track subjects on the surface and then enter underwater , " Browne said .
" This ability has never before been available in the film and television industry . "
The company will eventually offer two models : the SC3 , currently in prototype form , and a larger SC6 that has yet to be built .
Both will use internal - combustion engines on the surface ; batteries will power electric thrusters underwater .
As a precaution against the bends , computerized " automatic depth control " ensures that the Scubacraft wo n't descend or climb too quickly .
Browne says that in the week Scubacraft has been on sale , " the response has been simply overwhelming .
We are working our way through these inquiries and actively engaging with prospective customers to specify their requirements . "

Open up a toy chest and a child 's imagination takes flight , especially if the chest itself is part of the fun .
This toy chest looks like a barn , designed to make even a city dweller feel a little bit country .
A bonus :
With wheels on the bottom and special toy box lid supports , it 's easier than ever for kids to round up their toys when playtime is over .
You can make this chest in an afternoon with tools on hand and materials available at the home center .
Kids can handle most of the work that includes measuring , nailing , sanding , and painting , while adults should do the sawing and clamping .
Once the toy chest is put together , kids will be scrambling to fill it with their prized possessions .
Download a template for this project
Step 1 : Toy Chest Overview
The toy chest is made from birch veneer plywood , with four sides that fit around a rectangular bottom .
The roof fits over the two triangular gables at the ends .
It 's easiest to build the roof by first clamping the gables to the box , then attaching the front and back roof pieces in place .
That way you 're sure to end up with a lid that fits the box perfectly , with a pleasing overhang on the front edge that makes it easy to flip open .
For sturdiness , the roof is attached to the bottom box with a long continuous hinge all the way across one edge .
To accommodate the hinge , the back of the box and the roof are both slightly shorter than the corresponding front pieces , and the back ends of the gables are clipped off slightly .
For safety , there are also two toy box spring lid supports , which hold the weight of the roof and close softly with a gentle push of your child 's hands .
These keep the box from slamming on little fingers .
Casters attached to the bottom of the chest make it easier to move around for play and cleanup .
Step 2 : Lay out the Parts
Using a tape measure and straightedge , lay out the chest 's nine individual pieces on a half sheet of ½- inch birch veneer plywood : front , back , two sides , bottom , two roof sections , and two gable ends , using the measurements in the illustration .
Clamp the plywood to a worktable .
Using a jigsaw , cut the front , back , two sides , and the bottom pieces .
To make the roof pieces , set the saw blade at a 26 - degree angle .
Cut along one long edge of each roof piece at that angle ; when mated together , these cuts will form the angle of the peak .
Cut all the other edges with the blade set straight at 0 degrees .
On each side piece , mark out a 3 - by - 3 - inch square for the handle .
Drill ⅜- inch holes inside the four corners of each square to fit a jigsaw blade .
Using a jigsaw , cut out both squares .
Also cut a ⅛ - by -½ - inch notch on the top back corners .
Cut each gable out of a 4 - by - 18 - inch piece of plywood .
Clip ½ inch off the back corner to match the notch in the side pieces .
Step 3 : Sand the Pieces
Clamp the pieces to the worktable and sand them with 120 - grit sandpaper on a random - orbit sander until the wood is free of splinters .
Make sure to hold on to the sander tightly because is can spin away from you .
Step 4 : Glue the Pieces
Put a thin bead of wood glue at the lower edges of the front , back , and two side pieces , then stand them up around the bottom piece .
Let the sides overlap the front and back and make sure their notched corners line up with the back .
Step 5 : Clamp the Box
Hold the box together with bar clamps .
Use a damp rag to wipe up any glue that squeezes out .
Step 6 : Nail the Box Together
Nail along all the edges — sides as well as bottom — with 4d finish nails every 3 to 4 inches .
Using a nailset , sink all the nails below the surface .
Fill the holes with wood putty .
Step 7 : Build the Roof
Stand the triangular gable ends on edge with the cut - off corners to the back , and clamp them in place on top of each side of the bottom box .
Use pieces of scrap wood to bridge the seam , and brace them so that they stay vertical .
Be sure not to glue or nail these gable ends down — they are meant to be the forms on which the roof is built , and assembling the pieces in place on the box will ensure that the roof ends up straight .
Glue and nail the shorter roof section onto the gable ends , aligning it so that the angled edge is centered over the peak of the gables and the back edge is even with the back of the box .
It should be perfectly centered at the top but overhang the cut - off corner of each gable by about ½ inch .
Position the front of the roof to meet up with the back so that the angled edges form a tight peak .
The front of the roof should overhang the front of the box .
Step 8 : Nail the Roof Together
Glue and nail the front section of the roof onto the gable ends , making sure the whole roof assembly looks centered , with a ½-inch overhang on the gable ends .
Set all the nails below the surface , and fill the holes with wood putty .
Step 9 : Paint the Toy Chest
Once the wood putty is dry , sand it smooth with 120 - grit sandpaper .
Turn the box over and mount the casters to the four corners .
Using rollers and brushes , paint the barn roof silver and the base red .
Let it dry .
Mark off the front door , corners , and frames around the handles with painter 's tape , then paint them white .
Step 10 : Put the Roof on with Hinges
Line up the continuous hinge on the top back edge of the box .
Make small divots at each screw hole along the back of the box with a nail .
Using a drill / driver , screw the continuous hinge to the box .
Then screw the hinge to the roof .
Attach the right and left lid supports according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Now fill your toy chest with your favorite toys !

The recent upturn in house prices from April to July ( 3.6 % ) is the sharpest change in direction professor Robert Shiller has ever seen .
It could signal a v-shaped recovery in house prices .
Or it could be the " mother of all head fakes , " as investor Whitney Tilson has described it .
Robert Shiller 's recent survey of attitudes about house prices suggests it 's probably the latter .
The survey also suggests that Americans are still delusional about the long - term trajectory for house prices .
In the survey , Shiller and his partner Karl Case ask Americans what they think home prices will do over the short and long term .
The expectation for long - term price changes has n't changed much since before the bubble ( it 's now down to 11 % a year appreciation ) .
This outlook is more reasonable now than it was at the peak of the bubble , but it 's still extraordinarily optimistic .
This suggests that Americans still regard the last couple of years as a freak anomaly -- even though house prices are just now hitting the range of " normal " on key price ratios like price - to - rent and price - to - income ( see charts below ) .
The outlook for short - term changes ( one year ) , meanwhile , has changed a lot in the past year .
Specifically , it has gone from negative a year ago to 2 % this summer .
Thus , Americans are expecting a near - term housing recovery -- in part , perhaps , because of the recovery from April to July .
Shiller thinks this change suggests that buyers are now trying to time the housing market by getting in at the bottom .
This could be contributing to the surge in prices we 've seen over the last few months .
It 's always possible that Americans are right , that we 've passed the bottom and are on the way up .
If so , however , this would mean remarkable foresight on the part of the average buyer .
Around major changes in market direction ( the peak of the housing bubble , for example ) , there is widespread agreement about what future prices will do -- and this consensus is usually 100 % wrong .
If the consensus is right this time that we 've just passed the bottom , therefore , it will be because the average American has suddenly gotten a lot smarter that usual about what the future holds .
Here 's Robert Shiller 's conclusion in the NYT :
WHAT should we conclude ?
Given the abnormality of the economic environment , the sudden turn in the housing market probably reflects a new home - buyer emphasis on market timing .
For years , people have been bulls for the long term .
The change has been in their short - term thinking .
The latest answers suggest that people think the price slide is over , so there is no longer such a good reason to wait to buy .
And so they cause an upward blip in prices .
At the moment , it appears that the extreme ups and downs of the housing market have turned many Americans into housing speculators .
Many people are still playing a leverage game , watching various economic indicators as well as the state of federal bailout programs — including the $ 8,000 first - time home - buyer tax credit that is currently scheduled to expire before Dec. 1 — in an effort to time their home - buying decisions .
The sudden turn could signal a new housing boom , but is more likely just a sign of a period of higher short - run price volatility .

Here are recent price - to - rent and price - to - income charts from Calculated Risk .
Note that prices are just now reaching NORMAL levels .
To think that they 'll suddenly go shooting upwards from here means thinking that they 'll go right back to being overvalued .
( That 's not impossible , especially with the government giving away money .
But it 's not a conservative bet .

The Democratic Party and the Republican Party are the two major parties in America .
Before the general election takes place , there is a process called the primary election .
The primary election is how registered voters determine the candidate for the nomination of each political party for the general election .
The general election is the election that determines who becomes the President of America .
The question is , can a democrat vote for a republican ?
In answering the question on whether a democrat can vote for a republican , it is essential to note that the answer depends on the type of election in question .
For closed primary elections , only persons that register as members of a particular party can vote , and in such a situation , they must vote for their party candidate .
For an open primary election , the voters can vote for any party without declaring their affiliation to a political party .
The American Presidential Electoral Process
Before anyone can become a president of America , such a person must be a natural - born citizen of at least 35 years old and resides in the United States for a minimum of 14 years .
The individual that meet these requirements must declare his intentions to run as a candidate and must be able to generate campaign funds , while also setting up a committee to create more funds and manage the spending of the fund .
The Types Of Elections
There are several kinds of elections in America .
We have the special elections , the primary elections , and the general elections .
Special elections are elections that are for filling up a vacant space where they exist .
The primary elections are elections that voters use in determining the candidate that comes up for nomination under a political party .
It is the medium that generates the candidate for the general elections .
Primary elections are in two variants .
It could be a closed primary election and could also be an open primary election .
In a closed primary election , voters cannot vote outside of the political party of which they are members .
It means that in a closed primary election , a democrat cannot vote for a Republican candidate , and a republican cannot also vote for a democratic candidate .
It is not the same as an open primary election .
In an open primary election , voters can vote for candidates of their choice irrespective of membership of a political party .
It means that in an open primary election , a democrat can vote for a republican and a republican can vote for a democrat .
Apart from the open and closed primary elections discussed above , other variants could be partially closed or partially open .
At other times , it could be a combination of both .
In some jurisdictions , an election might be closed .
However , those without party affiliations can vote for their preferred candidate without having to belong to any political party .
The general elections are the final elections that conclusively determines who becomes the President of the United States .
Arguments On The Open And Closed Methods Of Electing Leaders
Political and social analysts have discussed extensively the manner of conducting open and closed primary elections .
Some argue in favor of the open primary election .
Some also argue in support of the closed primary election .
Let us look at their various views to understand what the electoral process stands to benefit from the use of these forms of elections .
Proponents of the closed primary elections are of the view that only members of a political party should be able to vote for the candidate that the political party presents .
In this regard , their opponent political party will be unable to influence who the party presents in a general election .
They believe that in open primaries , other political parties could play dirty to control the candidate that emerges on the platform of a particular party at the primaries .
That way , they can ensure that the candidate representing the other party is the one not likely to draw the popular vote from voters at the general elections .
Thus , the advocates for a closed primary election are of the view that only those of a political party should participate in deciding who represents them as a political party .
The proponents of the open primary elections do not agree with this .
They propose that elections being a democratic process should be open to all .
They also believe that where the primary election is limited to only members of a political party , the election can no longer be a democratic process because everybody does not have access to determine who makes it to the candidacy at the general elections .
The Role Of Political Parties In An Election
Political parties are key players in the political space .
In a country like America , we cannot discuss political interests without looking at the importance of the various political parties on the playing field .
The existence of political parties flows out of the need for a democratic system of electing our leaders .
Political parties have their internal systems that bring people of the same political ideology together .
It is on the platform of these political parties that candidates stand to run for an election .
It gives the members of the political parties the ability to participate in the processes that leads to who becomes their leader and directly determines the leader .
A political party is primarily responsible for mobilizing the citizens of a country to be a part of the decision - making process in the country .
They organize political meetings and conferences that enlighten the voters and also boost their interest in political activities .
They also take part in several activities that target securing political power .
Political parties also assist in the development of policies in the country .
They also communicate these policies to the voters during campaigns .
Political parties present candidates for elections .
Thus , they secure the persons to occupy political positions , train them and actively promote their candidate to voters via massive campaigns and public events .
America runs a multi-party system which tends to look more like a two - party system because of the overbearing dominance of the two political parties know as the Republican Party and the Democratic Party .
The record keeps showing the influence that these two parties have in the political space .
It also shows the insignificant impact of the other political parties .
How Can An Individual Participate In The Political Process ?
The citizens of a country participate in the political process in various ways .
From the discussion on the roles that political parties play , it becomes clear that these units of participation cannot be operative without human factors driving it .
Getting citizens to participate in the political process help to enhance the quality of the process .
One primary way that the citizens of a country participate in the political process is through the election of their leaders .
Using the power of voting , citizens can determine the outcome of political activities in the country .
Not only can they vote for their preferred candidate , but they can also participate in soliciting votes for their preferred candidate and join political campaigns .
The political parties are essential in developing policies that govern the affairs of the country .
Thus , individuals can participate in the process of policy formulation by joining political parties and actively participating in its activities in a bid to shape and strengthen the quality of policies that the government formulates .
When the citizens want to upturn specific policies of the government , they have the power to sign petitions as a way of expressing their disapproval and advocate for a change in the status quo .
It is their power to influence the decisions and actions of the government .
A Look At The Democratic Party And The Republican Party
The Democratic Party and the Republican Party are the major political parties in America .
They are based on different philosophies and thus hold different views on public policies .
To understand their operations , we need to understand the standpoints of each of these parties .
The ideology of the Democratic Party centers on modern liberalism .
It believes in the promotion of economic as well as social equality .
Thus , it tilts toward increasing the rate of the involvement of the government in economic affairs .
The Republican Party , on the other hand , is a political party that centers on the principles of conservatism .
It believes in securing individual rights , giving the people more power to determine their affairs .
Thus , it considers that the efforts of the government should protect the welfare of individuals .
Conclusion
Participation in the activities of a political party is central to enhancing the tenets of democracy in the political space .
Thus , becoming a member of the Democratic Party , Republican Party , or any of the other political parties in America helps to promote democracy .
However , the question is , can a democrat vote for a republican , and vice versa ?
The answer to this question depends on the form of an election in place .
It is essential to understand what method of election that is obtainable in your state ’s primary elections .

Is A Degree In Political Science Worth It ?
A new gene therapy procedure to restore function in lungs damaged during harvesting from donors could make more of the organs available for transplanting , Canadian researchers reported Wednesday .
Currently , only about 15 % of potential donor lungs are used because the rest are too damaged to implant .
The new technique , which has not yet been tested in humans , could prevent that damage or even reverse it , potentially expanding the supply of lungs sharply .
Lung transplants are the definitive therapy for many end - stage lung diseases such as emphysema and cystic fibrosis , but they are fraught with problems .
Because lungs are more likely to be rejected by recipients ’ bodies than other organs , the five - year survival rate is only about 50 % , lower than that for heart , liver or kidney transplantation .
And because of the shortage of donor lungs , an estimated 234 people in the United States died last year while waiting for a lung transplant , according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network .
About 1,800 people in this country are now on the waiting list for a lung , the agency said .
The problem in both cases is inflammation caused by insufficient amounts of an immune molecule called lL - 10 .
Donated lungs are immediately chilled on ice , which destroys any IL - 10 that may remain in the lungs , allowing substantial damage to occur before the organ can be implanted .
And a lack of the molecule after transplantation increases the likelihood that inflammation will damage the organ and induce rejection .
“ Anything that can decrease inflammatory processes would make them more suitable for transplantation and also impact the recipient ’s ability to reject the organ , ” said Dr. James McPherson , a thoracic surgeon at Marina Del Rey Hospital who was not involved in the research .
“ This looks very promising . ”
To circumvent inflammation , Dr. Shaf Keshavjee and Dr. Marcelo Cypel of the University Health Network in Toronto and their colleagues developed a two - pronged approach .
First , they devised a domed chamber that keeps the lungs at body temperature , preserving IL - 10 , and that pumps a solution containing oxygen and nutrients through the lungs to keep them alive .
That alone prevented the lungs from deteriorating and improved the success of transplants in animals .
The researchers then performed gene therapy on the lungs , using a defanged adenovirus to deliver a gene that is the blueprint for IL - 10 into the lung tissue .
The gene was quickly taken up by the cells and began producing the molecule , which reduced inflammation .
“ We ’re transducing the cells in the lung to become little IL - 10 factories , ” Keshavjee said in a statement .
The team reported Wednesday in the new journal Science Translational Medicine that they used the technique to remove lungs from pigs -- whose metabolism is similar to that of humans -- perfused them in the domed chamber for 12 hours , then successfully reimplanted them .
They then took human lungs that were considered too damaged for transplantation and subjected them to the same procedure .
The treatment significantly improved blood flow through the lungs and improved their ability to take in fresh oxygen and remove carbon dioxide .
The higher levels of IL - 10 persisted in the lungs for 30 days , suggesting that the procedure could also reduce rejection of the organs .
The lungs were not implanted in humans .
The procedure “ not only may result in improved preservation of lungs [ before transplantation ] but also may repair lungs otherwise not suitable for transplantation , ” Dr. David S. Wilkes of the Indiana University School of Medicine wrote in an editorial accompanying the report .
But several questions remain , he said .
Implanting lungs from a human donor might present more problems .
And the use of adenoviruses has caused complications in some gene - therapy experiments when the virus inserted the added gene at an inappropriate location .
Keshavjee said the team hopes to begin human trials in a year or so .

A pair of enormous knickers which belonged to Queen Victoria have been uncovered after being hidden away in a private collection for more than 100 years , it was announced today .
The linen bloomers , which measure more than 50 inches around the waist , have been added to the Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection , housed at Kensington Palace in west London .
The royal underwear , known as " split drawers " , is embroidered with a small crown and the initials VR , and comes with a large matching chemise .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It is thought to date from the 1890s .
The knickers were bought by Historic Royal Palaces at auction for £ 600 earlier this summer .
Alexandra Kim , curator of the Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection , said : " The drawers have quite a large waist - about 56 inches .
" By this stage in her life , Queen Victoria had gained quite a few inches .
" When she was about 18 , her waist was about 20 inches ...
Over the years , particularly having given birth to nine children , that changed entirely . "
As well as featuring Queen Victoria 's monogram , the underwear has a laundry mark - a number which allowed it to be traced after it was sent to be washed .
It is thought the item survived when the Queen 's clothes were divided up after her death and distributed amongst her staff as mementoes .
Ms Kim said : " There is a long tradition of items being handed down to trusted servants as a perk . "
The Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection , which has been given a national Designated status in honour of its importance , features some 12,000 items belonging to royalty and courtiers from the 17th century to the present day .
It includes a safari suit worn by King Edward VIII , who was later to abdicate .
He used the outfit on a visit to Africa in around 1926 , when he was still the Prince of Wales .
It featured adjustable shorts designed by the Prince himself , which could be worn long or buttoned above the knee depending on the terrain .
Diana , Princess of Wales 's tweed sports suit made for her honeymoon , William III 's 17th century knitted green silk stockings and a turquoise silk damask waistcoat believed to be one of the last things George III wore before his death also form part of the collection .

It is hoped Queen Victoria 's underwear will be put on display following a £ 12 million project to redevelop Kensington Palace by 2012 .
El premio Nobel de literatura 1998 , José Saramago en El Cuaderno , que es la recopilación de algunas de las participaciones de su blog , se pregunta " ¿Dónde está la izquierda ? " y para responder recuerda una frase que él mismo pronunció en alguna entrevista para un diario sudamericano : " La izquierda no tiene ni puta idea del mundo en que vive " .
Confieso que en principio la frase me molestó y me pareció una generalización excesiva .
Sin embargo , cuando veo la reacción de algunos militantes y activistas de la izquierda mexicana , la frase me pone a pensar ...
La liquidación en México de la Compañía de Luz y Fuerza del Centro , la ineficiente empresa estatal que prestaba el suministro de energía eléctrica en el la ciudad de México y sus zonas aledañas , ha generado varios debates interesantes , y ha colocado a muchos actores en el límite , y ante dilemas y situaciones complejas .
La izquierda mexicana , sin duda , ha llevado la peor parte en este debate .
Sencillamente , porque la decisión del Gobierno de derecha , del presidente Felipe Calderón , los ha puesto en aprietos .
Los ha colocado ante el dilema : apoyar la medida del Presidente de la República de desaparecer una empresa corrupta , ineficiente , que representa el pasado y con ello un sindicato lleno de abusos y privilegios , o asumir la defensa dogmática , ideológica y tradicional de clase , y apoyar porque sí , a un sindicato por el simple hecho de serlo .
El dilema se manifiesta en los partidos de izquierda , entre los intelectuales y en los medios de comunicación , y ha revivido un puritanismo en algunos simpatizantes y militantes de izquierda , que señalan con gran elocuencia que defender al sindicato es una cuestión de principio .
Pareciera que si se es militante o simpatizante de izquierda , necesariamente se tiene que estar en desacuerdo con una medida que golpea a un sindicato , siempre , cualquiera que éste sea .
Aunque dicho sindicato encarne y represente los peores vicios , y evoque los episodios más emblemáticos del autoritarismo del viejo régimen , que todos los demócratas debemos rechazar .
Lo que se está planteando en este debate es : la izquierda por encima de la democracia ; la ideología por encima de la ética ; la militancia a pesar de la corrupción ; el sindicalismo a pesar de la evidencia , en resumen , el pensamiento de izquierda por encima de las convicciones democráticas .
Esta posición llevó la semana pasada al líder más importante de la izquierda mexicana , Andrés Manuel López Obrador , a marchar por las calles de la ciudad de México en defensa del Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas ( SME ) , el gremio que agrupaba a los trabajadores de Luz y Fuerza del Centro .
¿ Qué hace Andrés Manuel López Obrador defendiendo lo que combate y cuestiona , prácticamente en todos sus discursos ?
López Obrador , que a fines de los ochenta y principios de los noventa estaba del lado del ingeniero Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas en la lucha por la democracia y contra el fraude electoral , sale hoy a defender por la calle a uno de los sindicatos emblemáticos que apoyaron y pactaron con el presidente Carlos Salinas de Gortari .
Además , López Obrador , que ha cuestionado la corrupción de las elites del poder en México , el charrismo sindical ( así llamamos en México a la simulación sindical ) , el corporativismo , el clientelismo y el abuso de los derechos de los trabajadores , hoy marcha y defiende a uno de los sindicatos y líderes que mejor representan todo lo que ha combatido .
Sale a manifestarse para defender a uno de los más claros enclaves autoritarios del viejo régimen .
Es una incongruencia que no la explica ni el pragmatismo electoral , ni los principios .
Porque con total pragmatismo la decisión no genera ni adhesiones , ni popularidad , las encuestas revelan que la mayoría de los mexicanos apoyan la medida del Presidente ; y en el terreno de los principios , se trata de una defensa contraria a la izquierda e incongruente con la construcción de la democracia .
Defender la cueva de Alí Babá y los 40 ladrones sólo porque ellos se nombran a sí mismos como un sindicato , me parece un error y un despropósito .
Por fin , después de nueve años , los gobiernos de la alternancia democrática se atreven a enfrentar uno de los enclaves autoritarios del viejo régimen .
Por fin , un gobierno de la democracia , decide ir en contra de uno de los soportes autoritarios y pícaros , que representa las peores prácticas y vicios del pasado .
¿ Y cual es la reacción de los demócratas de izquierda ?
La decisión es tan significativa , y ha creado tal expectación , que ahora muchos analistas hacen apuestas y proponen al gobierno seguir , en esa misma línea , con otros sindicatos , con monopolios empresariales y con otros enclaves autoritarios .
Los demócratas de todas las corrientes deberían encontrarse en decisiones como esta .
La desaparición del SME debería unificar a todos los demócratas .
Ha sido claramente un sindicato que abusó .
Es verdad que no es el único .
Pero hoy por lo menos es el primero que un gobierno de la democracia se atreve a tocar .
Además , los trabajadores serán recontratados e indemnizados y los pensionados mantendrán su actual sistema de pensiones .
¿ Cuál es el problema y el afán de defender a un grupo de líderes corruptos que medran con el sindicalismo y con la izquierda ?
Oponerse por oponerse es absurdo , ocioso y antidemocrático .
Hay mil cosas en las que no es posible coincidir con Calderón , pero cuando toma una decisión por la democracia ¿por qué no acompañarlo ?
En este debate se han escuchado frases como : " La verdadera izquierda defiende siempre a los sindicatos " .
La pregunta es : ¿ Los sindicatos corruptos son la izquierda ?
¿ Debe alguien con ideas de izquierda solapar y aplaudir como foca todo lo que hacen todos los sindicatos ?
¿ Es condición necesaria para ser de izquierda , ser defensor del SME ?
Creo que no .
Personalmente estoy convencido de que el sindicalismo corrupto y simulador es realmente el mejor aliado de la derecha .
Pero más allá y por encima de visiones y convicciones ideológicas , el sindicalismo corrupto y corporativo pone en riesgo la viabilidad de nuestra democracia .
Me niego a ignorar el enriquecimiento de los líderes del SME , me rehúso a cerrar los ojos ante el uso patrimonialista del sindicato , rechazo pasar por alto los excesos y los abusos que todos conocemos .
Creo , sinceramente , que eso no es la izquierda .
Desde mi punto de vista , uno de los sustentos más importantes de la democracia y de la izquierda está en la crítica : en el juicio crítico y en el pensamiento crítico .
La democracia está obligada a construir y a crear las reglas y los espacios necesarios para que funcione la crítica .
Por eso la tolerancia es la esencia de la democracia .
Es cierto , fácil de decir , difícil de hacer .
Esto en la práctica obliga a que por encima de los credos y los dogmas , seamos capaces de instalar la crítica .
Razonar , valorar y dudar .
Poner a debate las ideologías y las convicciones , pero no como pose , sino porque realmente estamos dispuestos a cambiar de opinión , a corregir nuestra visión de la realidad y a pensar diferente .
En este contexto , nada es más contrario a la democracia , que el debate de la pureza , como el que hoy protagonizan algunos representantes de la izquierda que exigen apoyar al SME , colocados desde el atalaya de la pureza ideológica , señalando que la verdadera izquierda está con el sindicalismo .
Personalmente soy alérgico a las verdades emitidas por papas y comités centrales .
Para que haya democracia , antes y por encima de las preferencias político ideológicas , de las simpatías y convicciones partidarias , debe haber convicción democrática , si no , el juego sencillamente no funciona .
Un demócrata de izquierda debe preferir primero aquello que garantiza el funcionamiento de una buena democracia , y después aquello que , en democracia , permite colocar los principios y los preceptos de su visión política , partidaria o ideológica .
Creo que en principio el demócrata debe hacer primero profesión de fe democrática , y después profesión de fe ideológica : ya sea de izquierda , de derecha , de centro ( si es que existe ) ; socialista , socialdemócrata , liberal , radical , demócrata cristiana , verde , rosa o lo que se quiera .
Si se entiende superado el paradigma revolucionario en la izquierda y se asume a plenitud el paradigma democrático , la izquierda mexicana debe entender que primero necesita consolidar la democracia , y que para lograrlo es necesario distinguir y desmantelar los enclaves autoritarios y los nudos del viejo régimen , que se resisten a desaparecer .
La izquierda debe asumir el proceso del SME con crítica y autocrítica .
No solapar y acompañar la corrupción que lo aleja de sus luchas , de sus principios y de sus convicciones .
La militancia acrítica y dogmática aleja a la izquierda de la sociedad y del electorado , la hace inviable y la muestra inmadura en la democracia .
La política está en los matices .
En la capacidad de cada doctrina de construir sus asideros y verdades , discriminando lo bueno de lo malo , lo ético de lo corrupto , lo correcto de lo incorrecto .
México necesita una izquierda que aprenda a distinguir matices y sutilezas .
Una izquierda democrática , crítica y autocrítica .
La esencia de la izquierda está en la crítica .
En la no aceptación de las razones naturales , las explicaciones de autoridad y las fatalidades del destino .
Necesitamos una izquierda que entienda que primero es ser demócrata , y después ser de izquierdas .
Una izquierda que no le dé la razón a Saramago .
Naughty
Dog must be feeling pretty good right about now .
Their little known Uncharted series has just spawned a sequel which is getting rave reviews .
Some chatter recently popped up on the Uncharted 2 multiplayer beta forums that has given the cross game chat rumor more credence then it ’s ever had .
One of the Naughty Dog devs who is active in the PlayStation forums recently made a mention about cross game chat which is about as close to a confirmation that has been heard up until this point .
“ Not to mention that the next PS3 firmware update is going to allow cross game chat .
So if players use that instead of in game communication then they would also be able to communicate enemies positions . ”
At the time of press , this message has been edited and the reference has been removed .
This may mean the feature is not ready for prime - time or someone took this dev behind the woodshed and told them what for .

Pope Benedict sees opportunity in conflict , welcoming gay - hating Anglicans to his Church .
Reuters reports :
" Pope Benedict on Tuesday took a major step to make it easier for
disaffected Anglicans who feel their Church has become too liberal to
convert to Roman Catholicism .
The move comes after years of discontent in some sectors of the
77 - million - strong worldwide Anglican community over the ordination of
women priests and homosexual bishops … The Vatican said the Pope had approved a document known as an ' Apostolic Constitution ' to accept Anglicans who want to join
Catholicism , either individually or in groups , while maintaining some
of their own traditions .
It marks perhaps the clearest and boldest institutional step by the
Vatican to welcome disaffected Anglicans into the fold since King Henry
VIII broke with Rome and set himself up at the head of the new Church
of England in 1534 .
The new structure allows for the appointment of leaders , usually
bishops who will come from the ranks of unmarried former Anglican
priests , to oversee communities of former Anglicans who become
Catholics and recognize the pope as their leader . "
And ( fresh from his 700 Club appearance ) one - man Catholic League President Bill Donohue , the Pope 's biggest mouthpiece in America , penned a guest column for the Washington Post .
Some excerpted gems :
— " Sexual libertines , from the Marquis de Sade to radical gay activists ,
have sought to pervert society by acting out on their own perversions .
What motivates them most of all is a pathological hatred of
Christianity .
They know , deep down , that what they are doing is wrong ,
and they shudder at the dreaded words , " Thou Shalt Not . "
But they
continue with their death - style anyway . "
— " The ACLU and Americans United for Separation of Church and State
harbor an agenda to smash the last vestiges of Christianity in America .
Lying about their real motives , they say their fidelity is to the
Constitution .
But there is nothing in the Constitution that sanctions
the censorship of religious speech .
From banning nativity scenes to
punishing little kids for painting a picture of Jesus , the zealots give
Fidel a good run for his money .
Catholics were once the mainstay of the Democratic Party ; now the
gay activists are in charge .
Indeed , practicing Catholics are no longer
welcome in leadership roles in the Party : the contempt that pro-life
Catholics experience is palpable .
The fact that Catholics for Choice , a
notoriously anti-Catholic front group funded by the Ford Foundation ,
has a close relationship with the Democrats says it all . "
With healthcare in the national spotlight , last week 's Newsweek.com article , Ignoring the Evidence :
Why do psychologists reject science ?
was timely .
But to me and many of my colleagues , it was alarmingly misleading .
Basically , author Sharon Begley indicts psychologists , in general , for failing to practice evidence - based and for rejecting the relevance of science to our profession .
I think that she has gotten caught up in some of the more controversial within the field .
She based her article 's conclusions on a report published by the Association of Psychological Science ( APS ) .
( Another article Where 's the Science ? on sciencedaily.com also summarized the findings in this APS publication . )
The APS report largely represents the views of a group of clinicians who strongly advocate ( often short - term treatment ) to the exclusion of other treatment types .
This camp sometimes challenges their colleagues , such as those psychologists who practice treatment ( which is often longer - term ) .
There is a philosophical and political struggle between the group represented by the APS report and the mainstream .
And each side does have its merits .
But to air the strong - worded challenges of the report , without presenting the other side 's rebuttal , is not only unbalanced ; it further serves to unfairly stamp all psychologists as rejecting all forms of science .
Note that the title of the report did not ask , " Why do other psychologists reject our science ? "
Though maybe it should have .
The average time it takes psychologists - from either camp -- to earn their doctorate is six to seven years after they receive their undergraduate degree ; followed by a year of postdoctoral work and the time it takes to study for their licensing exams .
Contrary to the Newsweek article , over the course of our training , we study methodology and statistics essential to conducting and evaluating research .
In addition , the APA mandates that its member psychologists use their scientific knowledge in their clinical judgments .
Cumulative psychological literature shows that when competing forms of therapy are compared , the outcomes almost always come out about the same .
The quality of the therapist - patient alliance is the best predictor of outcome ( see Let 's Face Facts article ) .
This means that people who need help will benefit most from finding a qualified therapist with whom they connect and who expresses views that fit with how they think .
( I have no doubt there are nuances to this rebuttal that can be argued by those supporting the APS perspective . )
The issues debated among psychologists of varying therapeutic orientations are complex ; more complex than I can present here .
( To read more , see Doctors and Psychologists Don't Hate Science . )
I think this is inevitable , just as it is in any developing field .
And , in reality , many ( if not most ) therapists are skilled in multiple approaches and try to blend and match their treatment to the person who is in the room with them .
As such , the misinformation in Begley 's article has been distressing to a large number of my colleagues .
I know this because I first learned of the Newsweek.com article on the New Jersey Psychological Association listserv ; where many psychologists share our thoughts about effective treatment , among other issues .
By stereotyping us all on Newsweek.com as " rejecting science " , Ms. Begley was not only disparaging to psychologists , but she may also have steered many of her readers away from the very help that they need most , leading them to spurn the professionals best qualified to help them in the real world .
Dr. Leslie Becker - Phelps is a clinical psychologist in private practice and is on the medical staff at Somerset Medical Center in Somerville , NJ .
But soon after , in January 2008 , he lost his job .
His company was shutting down much of its student loan business .
Still , Mr. Blattman was n’t worried .
He received a $ 188,000 severance package and says , “ I thought I ’d find another job quickly , and actually wind up ahead . ”
He is well regarded in his field .
Jim Murphy , a former president of the New York State Financial Aid Administrators Association , calls him “ innovative , dependable , an asset to any organization . ”
Tony Doyle , a dean at Widener Law School , describes him as “ a highly capable , dedicated professional . ”
None of that matters in this economy .
Mr. Blattman has been out of work ever since , 18 months .
He moved to New York because he thought prospects would be better than in Florida .
( “ I could n’t go back to Maryland , tail between my legs . ” )
But after applying for 600 jobs , he ’s had just three interviews  two of them over the phone .
At the only in - person interview , for a position supervising international admissions at a Westchester County college , he was asked about salary .
“ I said : ‘ Whatever you ’re paying , I ’ll take it .
I understand it ’s a different world now , I can adapt . ’ ” The job went to someone half his age , he says .
Being single , he wants to be in New York City , but lives in a studio apartment in this middle - class suburb , because rents are cheaper .
He let his online dating membership lapse because , he says , once women figured out he was unemployed , it killed things .
He can walk to shopping , but often drives his secondhand S.U.V. to a grocery store two towns away just to have someplace to go .
“ If I walk to the store , I ’m back in 10 minutes , and then what ? ”
Last Monday , asked what he had planned for the week , he said , “ As of now , I have zero planned , not a thing . ”
He has enough to live on for two to three years and knows he ’s luckier than many .
Still , he wakes in the night , scared .
“ If I do n’t find work by then , ” he says , “ I do n’t know what I ’ll do . ”
The Hillary Clinton doctrine
24 July 2009
At the beginning of 1980 , President Jimmy Carter inaugurated a major American military buildup in the Middle East .
In his State of the Union address of that year , the US president outlined what became known as the Carter Doctrine , declaring , “ An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America , and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary , including military force . ”
The doctrine was pitched as the Carter administration ’s response to two events that had taken place the year before .
The first was the Iranian Revolution that overthrew the US - backed dictatorship of the Shah , who had served as Washington ’s loyal gendarme in the region .
The second was the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan , which Washington itself had provoked to — in the words of then - Carter and now - Obama advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski — “ give to the USSR its Vietnam war . ”
Carter left no doubt as to what “ vital interests ” Washington was prepared to defend with force .
He stressed that Afghanistan was of “ great strategic importance ” because it lay in a region that “ contains more than two - thirds of the world ’s exportable oil . ”
Nearly three decades later , the US is fighting a bitter colonial - style war in Afghanistan , occupying Iraq and continuing to engage in overt threats and covert destabilization operations against the clerical regime in Iran , all for the purpose of defending these same “ vital interests . ”
This is the context in which Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s remarks Wednesday in Thailand should be understood .
Clinton appeared to be expounding her own doctrine ( or perhaps a Clinton corollary to the Carter Doctrine ) by threatening to extend a US nuclear umbrella over the oil - rich nations of the Middle East in response to an alleged threat that Tehran will acquire a nuclear weapon .
She added that the US would arm Iran ’s Arab neighbors ( a collection of monarchies and emirates , together with US - occupied Iraq ) .
“ We ... have made it clear that we ’ll take actions , as I ’ve said time and time again , crippling action , working to upgrade the defenses of our partners in the region , ” Clinton said in a Thai television interview .
Her remarks echoed a statement she made during her unsuccessful run for the Democratic presidential nomination last year , in which she threatened to “ totally obliterate ” Iran should it attack Israel .
She continued : “ We want Iran to calculate what I think is a fair assessment : that if the United States extends a defense umbrella over the region , if we do even more to develop the military capacity of those in the Gulf , it is unlikely that Iran will be any stronger or safer because they wo n’t be able to intimidate and dominate as they apparently believe they can once they have a nuclear weapon . ”
The Iranian regime maintains that its uranium enrichment program is intended solely for the generation of power .
Clinton ’s remarks drew immediate fire from Israel , which has threatened to carry out a unilateral attack on Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
It cast her call for a nuclear umbrella as signaling Washington ’s resignation to a nuclear - armed Iran and the resurrection of Cold War - style methods of “ containment ” and “ mutually assured destruction . ”
State Department spokesmen denied that Clinton was in any way softening the US position on the Iranian nuclear program .
The introduction of a US military umbrella in the Persian Gulf on the pretext of answering an Iranian threat would serve to further Washington ’s aim of imposing American hegemony over the oil - rich region .
This was spelled out in a report issued earlier this year by a “ presidential task force ” that included Dennis Ross , who was subsequently named by the Obama administration as its special adviser for the Gulf and Southwest Asia .
“ Confronting the Iran nuclear program also offers opportunities to advance US interests , ” the report stated , adding that it would allow Washington “ to deepen US relationships with its Middle East friends . ”
Clinton ’s saber rattling , however , serves another more immediate purpose .
It is aimed at exploiting as fully as possible the bitter internal struggle between the rival bourgeois factions in Tehran ’s clerical regime that has erupted in the aftermath of the disputed June 12 presidential election .
Her remarks follow the recent statement by Vice President Joseph Biden vouching for Israel ’s “ right ” to attack Iran militarily if it deems such an attack necessary to defend its security interests .
The US secretary of state repeatedly pointed to the conflict within the Iranian regime as impeding direct talks between Tehran and Washington .
“ We ’ve certainly reached out and made it clear that ’s what we’d be willing to do , even now , despite our absolute condemnation of what they ’ve done in the election and since , ” she said , “ but I do n’t think they have any capacity to make that kind of decision right now . ”
This was coupled with renewed warnings that the US offer of negotiations would not be extended indefinitely .
“ The nuclear clock is ticking , ” she said .
The US , she added , “ will not keep the window open forever . ”
And she renewed her threat that Washington would impose “ crippling sanctions . ”
All of this is designed to exert maximum pressure on an Iranian government that appears increasingly unstable in the hope that it will shift the balance of power toward the camp of the defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi and his patron , the billionaire former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani .
This faction has criticized the foreign policy of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as reckless , while signaling its support for a more rapid introduction of free market economic policies , a wider opening to foreign capital and a rapprochement with US imperialism .
All of this explains Washington ’s outrage over the Iranian election results and the unbridled enthusiasm of the US media for Mousavi ’s so - called “ green revolution . ”
Given the immense strategic interests of US imperialism in the region — US armed forces are waging wars on both Iran ’s eastern ( Afghanistan ) and western ( Iraq ) borders , while the country ranks number three in terms of proven oil reserves — the Obama administration is prepared to expend considerable resources to effect a change at the top of the regime in Tehran .
Such considerations are regarded as irrelevant by the petty - bourgeois pseudo - “ left ” in the US , which is hostile to any class analysis , attention to program or consideration of the long history of American intervention in Iran in evaluating the real content of the movement led by the improbable “ reformers , ” Mousavi and Rafsanjani .
For them , the Iranian events have served chiefly as a means of solidifying their support for the Obama administration and US imperialism as it escalates the war in Afghanistan and prepares for new interventions .
There are immense dangers in the escalating US intervention .
The talk of a nuclear umbrella , a regional arms buildup and possible Israeli air strikes all pose the threat of a conflagration that could dwarf the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , while drawing in other major powers with their own considerable interests in the region .
Only the working class — in Iran , the United States and internationally — can defeat these dangers by mobilizing its strength in independent political struggle against the profit system that produces war .

It ’s official .
Those discerning car critics , the black bears of Yosemite , have voted the minivan their most sought - after vehicle .
Not to drive , of course , just to break into .
Year after year , foraging bears have made minivans their first or second choice among tens of thousands of SUVs , sedans , sports cars and other vehicles in Yosemite National Park .
At least that ’s the conclusion of an article in this month ’s issue of the Journal of Mammalogy , which details a study of 908 bear - on - vehicle break - ins from 2001 to 2007 .

Bears searching for the most calories ( who knows when they ’ll eat again ? ) at the least risk ( in this case , harassment by park rangers ) judged minivans the best source , according to the study .
The minivan earned this dubious distinction for a variety of reasons , but the primary one was this : Minivans reek of food .
Study authors surmise that the minivans are more aromatic than other cars because they are designed for families with children , “ and small children in particular are notorious for spilling food and drink while riding in vehicles . ”
Researchers also suggest that minivan passengers are more prone to leave coolers and bags of food in their cars .
The exposed snacks are an invitation to vandalism , because the bears have learned to open the rear side window of a minivan like the pop - top on a soda can .

The report also raises the possibility that the break - ins are the work of just a few recidivist bears ; once they realized what a find the minivans were , they targeted them specifically .
Moral of the study :
If you ’re going to Yosemite , store your food in a food locker -- but first get the minivan washed .

While its proponents may be correct that its technical problems can be overcome , do other issues make it unwise to continue to pursue development of the Ares 1 ?
( credit : NASA ) Is Ares 1 too little , too late ?
Is NASA ’s much - maligned Ares 1 rocket program getting a bad rap ?
Many at the agency think so .
I tend to agree with NASA engineers who say problems like thrust oscillation and liftoff drift are being blown out of proportion .
I also agree with former NASA chief Mike Griffin ’s comments that problems with Ares 1 are being encountered precisely because there is actual work being done on the vehicle .
( He suggested that design problems are par - for - the - course with rocket development programs , while “ paper rockets ” will always be problem - free . )
Oddly enough , by criticizing Ares 1 ’s technical problems , its detractors may actually be boosting its credibility in Washington .
As Dr. Griffin might point out , big aerospace programs are no strangers to cost overruns , technical problems , and schedule delays .
It seems to me , however , that the problems with Ares 1 are more fundamental .
Originally envisioned as a simple and low - cost reuse of Space Shuttle hardware , Ares 1 has become increasingly complex and expensive while its scheduled availability slides farther and farther to the right .
Adding to Ares 1 ’s complexity and cost are challenges with the upper - stage “ common bulkhead ” and the J - 2X engine , which have been cited by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) in a recent report as adding significant risk to the program .
Efforts to mitigate these and other risk factors have contributed to the Aerospace Corporation ’s finding that we should n’t expect an operational Ares 1 until 2017 , five years beyond the 2012 target originally put forward by NASA in 2005 .
As Dr. Griffin might point out , big aerospace programs are no strangers to cost overruns , technical problems , and schedule delays .
It seems to me , however , that the problems with Ares 1 are more fundamental .
According to the GAO report released on September 25 , the development costs for Ares 1 and its Orion crew capsule are likely to reach $ 49 billion , nearly double the $ 28 billion originally proposed .
That ’s billion with a “ B ” for a limited - mission rocket whose lift capacity is similar to already - developed Atlas and Delta rockets — vehicles that could be human - rated and ready sooner than Ares 1 and at a lower cost , according to the Aerospace Corporation study .
While Dr. Griffin and others may be able to argue that Ares 1 costs are on track , and provide reasons against relying solely on commercial rockets for crew flights , it is harder to deny that Ares 1 is becoming a too - little / too - late solution as scenarios for Constellation and the International Space Station ( ISS ) evolve .
The Augustine committee ’s eight human space exploration options , as presented in their Summary Report to the White House , bear this out .
Specifically , Ares 1 and the International Space Station ( ISS ) do not operationally or fiscally coexist in any of the options presented in the Summary Report , rendering the vehicle useless for ISS crew carriage .
In other words , the Augustine Panel believes NASA can fund Ares 1 or the ISS , but not both .
I believe Ares 1 has become a solution in search of a problem and a symbol of the government ’s role as a gatekeeper for space .
Furthermore , with its limited performance , the operational Ares 1 would be all dressed up with nowhere to go , waiting several more years for a heavy - lift partner to enable exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit .
This “ heavy - lift gap ” is my biggest problem with Ares 1 .
The Augustine committee correctly asserts that a heavy - lift rocket is required for any meaningful exploration program , whether to the Moon , Mars , or other destinations .
However , by sticking with Ares 1 , NASA would actually prolong that gap until the mid- to late - 2020s .
So , although I too am concerned about changing rockets mid-flight , I believe Ares 1 has become a solution in search of a problem and a symbol of the government ’s role as a gatekeeper for space .
Unless the Augustine committee ’s conclusions change significantly in their final report , it seems NASA should focus its efforts on developing a heavy - lift vehicle and give the private sector more responsibility for servicing the ISS .

There ’s a concept in programming called “ feature creep ” — when a software developer continually adds one feature after another because “ would n’t it be nice ” and “ why not ” and “ is n’t it cool ” and “ some users asked for it ” .
The end result is often a bloated program that tries to do everything but ends up being not very good at any of it — and hogs your system resources , crashes , and has a complicated interface .
Feature creep is a bad thing in programming , and it ’s a bad thing in our personal lives as well .
We all have feature creep in our lives .
It ’s a part of the modern world .
Think about how life was like only 20 years ago — no one was using the Internet ( basically ) , we did n’t have IM or email or Twitter or blogs or any of the other complications we have today .
And 50 years ago , no one had personal computers , caller ID , cable TV , fax machines , washing machines , CD players .
Go back 100 years , a thousand , and then ten thousand , and you ’ll see how many features have been added into our lives .
Think about when you started out as an adult : you might have had basically nothing , including no debt ( until you got that first student credit card , car loan and perhaps student loan ) , no furniture , no house full of stuff , no long to - do list .
Now , this might not be the ideal life ( you also might have had no means to do anything , or a solid career , or skills ) … but you had a fresh slate .
No features was a negative , but there was also no bloat .
Some of you might still be at that point — so let this be a cautionary tale .
Those of you who are 10 or 20 or more years beyond that point know that life is n’t that simple anymore — at least , not for most of us .
Life tends to add features as we go along , and as they come out into the marketplace .
We now have all the Internet technology we mentioned above , but there ’s more .
There ’s debt and all kinds of payments to make .
There ’s kids and all the things that come with that ( an amazing array of features , good and bad ) .
There ’s more responsibilities and commitments and a more crowded schedule .
We ’re not bored , and we have more means , and a career , likely .
But these features bring much more : burdens , and an overloaded schedule , and conflicts that can lead to crashes .
Headaches we do n’t need .
The solution to feature creep in our lives :
1. Start from a blank slate .
2 . Only add the features you really use and love .
3 . Slowly implement the reduction in the code of your life .
4. Avoid future feature creep .
Let ’s look at these steps .
Step 1 . Start from a blank slate .
I ’m not saying you should abandon your home and cars and family and job and go live in a cave .
I ’m saying take out a fresh sheet of paper ( or a blank text file — but do NOT use Microsoft Word ) and re-image your life .
From a blank canvas .
Imagine your life had nothing in it .
We ’re going to be bolder than Microsoft and Adobe and do what they need to do : abandon software that has become bloated over a decade or two of feature creep , and start our code from scratch .
You might also make a list of everything you have in your life now : job , commitments , goals , activities , clubs , hobbies , meetings , relationships , technology , possessions .
Anything that takes up your time and space and mental energy .
These are the things we ’re putting on the table .
They are going to be tossed out if they do n’t survive the next section .
Step 2 .
Only add the features you really use and love .
What do you want in your life ?
Focus on fewer features done well .
What is your ideal life ?
Your ideal day ?
What do you want to do , for work and play and love ?
Look at the list you made in the first section — what do you want to keep ?
Do n’t keep them because they ’re nice , or have sentimental value .
Keep them because they ’re a part of the life you want .
Pick only a few things .
This will allow you to have the space — time and physical space — to really enjoy them , to do them well .
Step 3 .
Slowly implement the reduction in the code of your life .
You probably ca n’t just toss out your old life and implement the newly re-imagined life .
Unfortunately .
It takes time to get out of commitments , to make the big changes that are required to get to this new life .
But it can be done , slowly , gradually , over time .
Not overnight .
You can do some things right away : go through your home and toss out stuff you do n’t want .
You have control over that .
You can also call or email people to get out of commitments , projects , meetings , jobs you do n’t want and do n’t absolutely need at the moment .
Other things can be done in the coming weeks .
Slowly find ways to get out of tough commitments .
Let others fade away .
Still others will take more time : changing houses , jobs , getting rid of cars , moving to a new place , getting out of debt .
I ’ve done all these , but it did n’t happen immediately .
It takes a decision to make an eventual change , an awareness of opportunities as they arise , and the will to carry out the change .
Step 4 . Avoid future feature creep .
Let ’s say you simplify the features in your life in the next couple of weeks , and eventually get to a life of few but great features .
What ’s to stop feature creep from insinuating itself again ?
Nothing except your awareness , and constant vigilance .
Being aware of feature creep is really the only way to combat it .
Often these features come into our lives without much thought — we buy new things , agree to new projects , start using new technologies , one little thing at a time .
But if we question everything , and are aware of what we ’re adding and the big picture , we can say no .
Constant vigilance is simply saying no if it ’s not a feature you absolutely need .
Try out new features , and reject all but the best .
And when you add new features , consider dropping old ones .
Revisit this issue every few months to see if you need to eliminate unnecessary code in your life .

Elsewhere :
Should an internet service provider ( ISP ) be allowed to block , prioritise or degrade network traffic ?
This issue , otherwise known as network neutrality , is a fundamental to the establishment of a competitive European market in telecommunications .
Such a market is the aim the EU Telecoms Package , which contains the new rules for the telecoms industry .
It is currently being discussed in Brussels .
Once in place , the new rules will define the continental telecoms market for the next few years .
The review aimed to deal with uncompetitive practices in some European countries and to open up market access for new network operators .
This would make it easier for BT , for example , to set up a competing service to Deutsche Telekom in Germany .
However , the insertion of provisions to support internet restrictions as part of copyright anti-piracy measures has proved controversial .
As it stands , the package will allow network operators to restrict access to certain internet services and applications .
It will support " three strikes " measures for copyright enforcement against peer - to - peer ( P2P ) users .
Its sharpest critics say that it will limit competition and create a fragmented market for internet services across Europe .
The Telecoms Package text says that restrictions on access to internet services and applications are " neither mandated nor prohibited " .
The legal meaning of this phrase is unclear .
Some say it means that ISPs are permitted to restrict traffic flows ; others say it means there is nothing to stop them .
Either way , the effect is that network operators and / or ISPs will be licensed to interfere with internet traffic on their systems .
They will have the right to block , slow or degrade specific services , or any other services that do not suit them , provided they note it in the users ' contract .
The law would appear to allow them to prioritise services too , or least , it would not prevent them from doing so .
This means they could segment the market by providing different network speeds for different prices , or slowing iPlayer downloads by giving preference to voice traffic or Google searches service , or even how many people can share the network simultaneously .
The rules have been discussed in the context of home users .
However , under EU law the " user " is defined as a business or a consumer .
Business users who use voice over IP or peer - to - peer services will be affected , although the full implications are not yet clear .
The most immediate candidate for blocking is Skype , which is already blocked by T - Mobile in Germany and slowed down by others .
Malte Behrmann of the European Games Developer Federation ( EGDF ) says that online computer gaming services could also be hit .
" We are affected by the Telecoms Package , " he said .
" What happens when they misuse filtering technology in order to prioritise their own content ? "
The EU is positioning the remedies as part of its " transparency " rule ; operators must tell users precisely what services and applications they block .
But Brussels telecoms lobbyist Caroline de Cock says transparency in the Package is a one - way communication .
She says users will be told what is being blocked , but the proposed law does not establish a reciprocal right to complain against unfair blocks , nor does it create a way for regulators such as Ofcom to monitor the operators and act against those who block unfairly .
The Package raises the network neutrality debate at a political level for the first time in Europe .
According to the French internet activist organisation La Quadrature du Net , the Telecoms Package challenges the principle of net neutrality .
La Quadrature has called for the removal of the provisions that relate to restrictions , and for the principle of net neutrality to be enshrined in EU law .
This would bring Europe into line with moves at the Federal Communications Commission , the US telecoms regulator , to preserve net neutrality , and in passing to enhance users ' online privacy .
The alternative could be a patchwork of networks and a myriad of different rules across the 27 EU countries , which will raise costs and hinder economic development .
Copyright
The sticking point for the Telecoms Package is copyright .
Strictly speaking , copyright does not belong in telecoms law .
It got there because of attempts by content industry lobbyists to create a legal basis in European law for the French government 's " three strikes " measures .
A counter - amendment by the French MEP Guy Bono , who was concerned about users ' rights to freedom of expression , is the reason why the Package was held up .
" Three strikes " or " notice and take down " entails a series of warnings sent to users by their ISP , followed by suspension of their internet .
In France , it will be a complete suspension of their internet account .
In the UK " technical measures " are proposed , meaning users could be temporarily suspended , throttled , or blocked .
Under current EU law ( the E - Commerce Directive ) ISPs are not liable for the content they transmit .
They are " mere conduits " .
According to Innocenzo Genna , of EuroISPA , if they take any action in respect of the content they carry , for example , to enforce copyright , they would be breaking the law .
The Telecoms Package provides a legal workaround for the E- Commerce Directive .
It can not mandate ISPs to filter or police their networks .
Instead , national regulators such as Ofcom will be able to ask ISPs to " co-operate " with rights - holders on copyright enforcement .
ISPs will have to ensure that their contracts include information on any service restrictions .
This means they could use the contract to suspend service access or impose any other restriction for copyright enforcement purposes .
The relevant clauses in the Package are Articles 33.3 , 20.1 b , and 21.3 in the Universal Services .
The Telecoms Package is symptomatic of a more general trend to get ISPs to police copyright infringers .
The Belgian ISP Scarlet is being sued by the music royalties collecting society Sabam , and has been fighting a court order to filter Sabam 's content on peer - to - peer networks .
In Ireland , Eircom was taken to court by the Irish music industry , and reached a private , out - of - court settlement to apply " three strikes " measures .
The counter - amendment in the Telecoms Package is known as Amendment 138 .
The text means that sanctions against internet users may not be made without a court order .
Some think it also means that access to services may not be blocked without a court ruling .
The principle it enshrines is to guarantee rights of access to content and services on the internet , says Andriani Ferti , a lawyer with Clifford Chance .
" Conditional access to the internet should not be imposed on European citizens , " she says , adding that the Article also protects the freedom to conduct business .
National governments are blocking Amendment 138 .
They want to force through the Telecoms Package without it .
If they get their way , the barriers to " three strikes " and other copyright enforcement measures will be lowered , and net neutrality irretrievably compromised for the foreseeable future .
Who has a political interest in the Package ?
Why would an amendment that protects users rights of access to internet services cause such controversy ?
Amendment 138 has acquired political weight well beyond its plain text .
It has prevented the European Commission from drawing up EU - wide proposals for " three strikes " or " notice and take - down " .
It has delayed the French government 's law and could put bar certain aspects of the British government 's plans to police the net , which could explain why the British and French governments are leading the charge against it .
However , it is not just government .
Effectively , the Telecoms Package brings together two industry agendas which collide over copyright .
The content industry or publishing sector seeks to prevent all downloading of copyrighted content without the rights - owners ' express permission .
The telecoms industry wants to be able to charge users for priority delivery of content .
The content industry agenda was driven by music and film industry bodies such as the IFPI and the Motion Picture Association .
In 2006 IFPI wrote in response to a European Commission consultation , " If ISPs continue to be unwilling to improve their cooperation , this could require a revision of current legislation such as the E- commerce directive or the Telecoms Package ... "
The telecoms agenda is spearheaded by ETNO , the large telecoms operators ' club .
ETNO has sided with US telecoms multi-national AT&T , which put forward amendments to the European Parliament to restrict users ' access under certain conditions .
In a lobbying document , AT&T argued that " mandating non-discriminatory treatment of network traffic in the directives would reduce innovation and ultimately consumer choice . "
AT&T 's wording is remarkably close to the final text in the Telecoms Package .
The telcos argue that if they are to invest in new infrastructure , they should be able to do what they like with their networks .
Ilsa Godlovitch , director of regulatory affairs at the European Competitive Telecommunications Association ( ECTA ) refutes this argument .
She argues that it is better for overall economic growth to address the problems that prevent new competitors from entering the market .
" If you address the infrastructure bottlenecks , the content will take care of itself , " she says .
In Brussels , the pundits admit that the Telecoms Package is unlikely to meets its original goal of opening up competition .
Joe McNamee , lobbyist for European Digital Rights ( EDRi ) , says that it enables the operators and regulators " to extend the excuses available to limit competition " , and that it does not address , still less remove , barriers to entry for new entrants .
There are very powerful industrial interests pushing for the Telecoms Package to go through .
Amendment 138 is the only thing stopping it and creating breathing space for a wider policy debate .
Unless the European Parliament stands firm and endorses Amendment 138 , Europe risks a return to the days of national networks run by dominant or monopoly operators , with fragmented service offerings .
The full text of Amendment 138
The national regulatory authorities shall promote the
interests of the citizens of the European Union by inter alia
( h ) applying the principle that no restriction may be imposed on the fundamental rights and freedoms of end -users , without a prior ruling by the judicial authorities , notably in accordance with Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union on freedom of expression and information , save when public security is threatened

British Airways has broken new exciting new ground in the race to make flying as awful as possible : they have announced a fee ( ranging from £ 10 - 60 per passenger ) for advance seat selection , explaining that this will be the only way that families and other groups travelling together can be assured that they 'll be sitting next to each other .
I wonder what happens if you do n't pay it while flying with a two - year - old in her own seat ; do they seat her at the other end of the plane from you and explain to the strangers on either side of her that they 're responsible for her well - being for the duration ?
Best part : BA is billing this as a way of improving the flight " experience " because you can now be certain you 'll get the seat that you want .
War is peace , love is hate , the airline industry cares about passengers .
A BA spokeswoman said : " Customers frequently request specific seats , but in the past we 've only been able to confirm them 24 hours in advance or on the day .
" We know people want to secure them in advance and have real control over their flying experience .
This will allow them to do that . "
British Airways sets seat charges
Once again , our Supreme Court is shamed by another country
Regular readers have heard me rail against Caballes v. Illinois , the truly awful Supreme Court decision that allowed searches based only on the whim of a dog , thereby encouraging fishing expeditions .
Well , the Supreme Court of Canada Saskatchewan Court of Appeal just ruled on a similar case .
Seven members of the Court sat on the case and all agreed that the case should be thrown out .
Since the officer had no reasonable suspicion that the car contained drugs , calling in a dog to sniff was unacceptable .
In one of the separate , yet essentially concurring decisions upholding the Queen ’s Bench decision , Chief Justice John Klebuc and justices Gary Lane , Robert Richards , Gene Anne Smith and Ysanne Wilkinson said Yeh ’s rights were violated by the sniffer dog search “ and the trial judge made no error in excluding the evidence obtained as a result of that breach . ”
Justices Georgina Jackson and Darla Hunter concurred with that finding in their decision . [ … ]
Meanwhile , Jackson — writing also on Hunter ’s behalf — said “ there is a good reason to limit dog searches when a person is detained . ”
Jackson said police powers should n’t be expanded to allow the use of dogs in searches in instances where police officers themselves could n’t by law perform a search .
“ Police conduct must be considered objectively from the perspective of the ordinary travelling public , as well as from the perspective of crime prevention , ” Jackson wrote .
“ If the police can use a sniffer dog when a person is detained in the circumstances such as the case at bar , the traffic stop runs the risk of becoming a pretext for a search for drugs . ”
See that last sentence ?
“ … the traffic stop runs the risk of becoming a pretext for a search for drugs . ”
Exactly the place we ’re at in the United States .
We even have officers who brag that it ’s the only reason they do traffic stops .
STOCKHOLM , Sweden —
When she was 11 , a Swedish - born girl was taken on vacation to her mother ’s native Somalia .
The mother wanted to “ make her daughter clean ” and paid a man to cut off her daughter ’s clitoris and labia while two women held her down .
Afterward , the girl was stitched to her urethra .
No anesthesia was used .
Last year , at age 19 , a Swedish court convicted the mother for those illegal acts , awarding the victim record demages .
Scandinavians — rather than quietly recoiling as immigrant mothers take their Europe - born daughters on vacation to Africa be circumcised — are fighting the traffic in female genital mutilation ( FGM ) .
Sweden , Norway and Denmark are doggedly pursuing perpetrators of FGM , practiced by African and Middle Eastern cultures .
Those perpetrators are mostly the immigrant mothers of the young girls .
Jail sentences , record damages and controversial immigration laws are Scandinavia ’s weapons in this war .
Meanwhile Africans — who have immigrated with their families for a better life in northern Europe — wring their hands , imploring Westerners to understand that they are doing what they think is best for their daughters .
“ The reasons given for female circumcision are traditional , cultural and religious .
It is believed to encourage cleanliness , to control promiscuity , enhance the males ’ sexual pleasure , preserve virginity and protect against unwanted pregnancies , ” said Timnit Embaye of the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) in Kenya .
But Scandinavian leaders refuse to interpret tolerance of female circumcision as politically correct .
FGM " is a very serious assault on children , ” said Norway ’s Secretary of Justice Knut Storberget .
“ It is important that they will be given a chance to value this independently when they are old enough to understand . ”
In Scandinavian countries , female circumcision is illegal even if it happens in another country and even if the practice is legal in that country .
It does not matter if the victim said yes , it is still illegal .
Perpetrators — such as a girl ’s parents — are being prosecuted upon return to Scandinavia and face up to 10 years in prison .
The graphic details revealed in the ensuing trials have shocked people here .
Young women have told horrible stories confirmed by medical reports .
In Norway , the Immigration Appeals Board has allowed African families to remain in the country even if they do not fulfill immigration criteria .
The board fears that sending families back to Africa will leave their daughters vulnerable to circumcision .
In 50 cases of asylum applications rejected by the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration , appeals were filed not by the families as usual , but by the appeals board itself .
“ Female genital cutting is a serious assault and contradicts basic human rights , ” said Jan Olav Barstad of the appeals board .
Earlier this year a Danish court handed down the country 's first jail sentence for carrying out female circumcision .
A 40 - year - old mother from Eritrea , where circumcision is practiced among more than 98 percent of the female population according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , was sentenced to two years in jail after forcing her two daughters , 10 and 12 , to be circumcised on a trip to Sudan in 2003 .
When the parents planned another trip to Sudan with their 6 - year - old daughter , the two elder girls alerted other adults .
The police seized the parents , and the shocking story took center stage in Danish media for months .
The father claimed he had no idea what was happening and was acquitted of any charges .
“ Although women are often responsible for the practical arrangements , members of the extended family are usually involved in the decision - making , ” said Margaret Chan , WHO 's director - general , in a statement .
“ Female genital mutilation is a manifestation of gender inequality .
It represents society ’s control over women . ”
Without support from men in societies where FGM is practiced it will never be stopped , experts say .
“ There is often an expectation that men will marry only circumcised women , ” Chan said .
“ Anyone departing from the norm may face harassment and ostracism . ”
In Eritrea , if a girl is not a virgin , she will be returned to her parents ’ home after marriage .
Circumcision is seen as evidence that a girl is a virgin .
Embaye of IOM , who is originally from Kenya where circumcision rates affect about 32 percent of the female population , said that for these reasons mothers are reluctant to object to the circumcision of their daughters .
“ Women in most African communities are taken as second - class citizens .
Although the mothers may not want to circumcise their daughters , it is often very difficult for them to openly oppose the practice , ” she said .
“ It would be a bold woman to stand up against a practice that has been endorsed by all her women ancestors for centuries . ”
So Scandinavian governments are trying to stand up for the women .
The Swedish government has launched a national campaign trying to stop female circumcision in Sweden , including among immigrants without citizenship .
It has also moved to support girls and women in Sweden who already are victims of circumcision .
The act directs Swedish schools , preschools , hospitals , local health centers , social services , police authorities and prosecutors to understand , prevent and deal with circumcision .
Police and prosecutors have attended regional conferences on how to do that .
A new law in Norway that goes into effect nationwide Jan. 1 will offer free genital screenings to all girls emigrating from countries where 30 percent or more women are circumcised .
If the offer is not accepted , immigration authorities can alert the Children ’s Welfare Institution .
Girls who reside in Norway will have health checks in the fifth and 10th grades .
“ Genital cutting is illegal and results in incurable damage for the victims , ” said Norway ’s Secretary of Health Bjarne Hanssen .
“ Therefore , we launch this additional rule . ”
Laws regarding female circumcision were adopted in Sweden in 1982 , in Norway in 1986 and in Denmark in 2003 .
In the U.S. , it has been a federal crime since 1997 to conduct female genital mutilation on anyone younger than 18 .
However , IOM believes approaches must be delicate .
“ Forceful means — including laws — will not bring any success , " Embaye said .
" The approach should be respectful and not militant .
The whole issue needs careful talking and patience where the communities concerned are slowly but readily educated . "
But patience and slow action is not the Scandinavian approach .
Fourteen reports on female circumcision are under investigation at the Oslo Police Department and in June , Norway ’s parliament made a move that is likely to increase that number even more .
The statute of limitations was changed from 10 years after the offense occurred to 10 years after the victim turns 18 .
COLUMN : The combat objective for feminists is to marginalize and bring all men to irrelevance and obsolescence , and they ’re winning !
Men are wimping out , turning tail , and in retreat on the run .
Men , do you wonder why women generally ignore you or do n’t bother to take you serious ?
Are you perplexed when you find you ’re treated more like a nuisance by women than an interesting person they ’d like to get to know ?
You got it !
You as a man are ancient history ; you ’re virtually dead , a fossil , as far as women are concerned .
Exceptions to this rule are as rare as chicken teeth .
Given this social scene , men could just as well ignore women , do n’t look at them , and avoid them as much as possible , and it would n’t bother women one single bit ; as a matter of fact , they would be delighted and grateful , not grateful to men , just grateful .
If you as a male could suddenly disappear , that would be even lovelier for women .
The sooner you understand that women are just putting up with you because they ca n’t get rid of you , the better you will understand women today and why the social scene between men and women is what it is , totally screwed up .
But the real downer for all men is that according to credible reports which will be examined here , feminists are not just content to ignore men as ancient history , they have declared all - out war on them because they do n’t know what else to do with them .
The “ maleness ” of men in all the negative stereotypes that this represents , has continued to be a bother to women .
Feeling pushed to the limit of what they will put up with as liberated women , going for all - out combat was the last desperate measure they had left to be rid of having to deal with maleness .
Hence , I believe it was an actress in a film or TV show who , expressing the latest feminist sentiment on the subject , exclaimed in exasperation concerning men , “ You ca n’t do with them and you ca n’t shoot them . ”
In other words , since feminist - minded women , which are most women today , ca n’t get rid of men whom they have come to detest , the only option they see left is finally to drive men from the position they now occupy as virtually obsolete and useless beings to a state of total wimpified passivity , submissive inferiority , and meaningless human significance .
This is envisioned as a state where men no longer make demands on women but instead only receive gratefully that which women in their absolute gratuitous kindness let them have , which most often is nothing .
The whole thing is similar to what a benevolent master would do gratuitously for a meek and submissive plantation slave , mostly nothing .
Because most women today are feminist - minded if not actual raging feminists , virtually any woman you run into and with whom you actually manage to communicate , especially if they ’re single , young or old , will be affected and influenced by the war feminists have been waging against males for decades .
In this combat that feminists have instigated and forced upon us for being so unfortunate as to have been born males , all but an extremely rare minority of women carry with them anti-male rage , while clueless men run around in a daze trying to figure out why no matter what they try to do that ’s nice or pleasant to get a woman ’s serious attention , totally fails to get a serious response .
I ’m telling you , if you ’re a man , you ’re dead to women , not only dead , but dead , disgusting and contemptible , though most women wo n’t tell you this to avoid nasty confrontations .
So the war we ’re in is mostly silent , though deadly real nonetheless .
So men , do n’t be surprised if what women communicate to you outwardly turns out to be different from what they actually think and feel about you inside .
In an effort to interpret ( or mind - read ) how a women may feel inside about a man by how friendly she seems outwardly and / or by her speech , some single men have naively been led to propose something friendly to a women and are subsequently surprised to find out how wrong they were in their assumptions of the woman ’s actual thinking and inner feelings .
So it has come to the point that if you as a man assume that most women you meet basically do n’t like or trust you merely for the fact that you are a male , regardless of what the woman may say or do outwardly that appears to contradict your presumption , the chances are 99.9 % that you are correct in assuming you ’re not wanted or welcome for even a close friendship , however harmless that may be .
The very moment you try for something like this , women will immediately distance themselves from you .
I ’m telling you , it takes a miracle nowadays for you as a man to win with a woman , no matter how nice and polite you might be with them .
Hence , in this sexual combat we ’re in , women themselves do n’t really know what ’s truly safe with men their chosen adversary .
As a result , single men keep getting wishy - washy responses from women or get stonewalled with no response at all with what appears to be “ silent treatment ” every time they try to communicate something serious to an overwhelming number of women and expect to receive something rational in response .
Yes , women are winning the sexual fight , that ’s why nothing rational works anymore in men- women communications , and we ’re in this ride for a long , long time to come .
So do n’t hold your breath ; things can only get worst , definitely not better .
After centuries of tension between the sexes , “ Armageddon ” seems to have finally arrived for men- women relations .
Living as a young adult in the late 1950s to the beginning of the 1960s , I had the great privilege to live through , taste and witness first hand how life was with respect to women under what is now the extinct social system called “ chivalry . ”
In case you did n’t know , chivalry was that system under which women were still treated by men with respect as “ ladies ” and women in the majority were not at all paranoid and hostile toward men .
By and large , this was generally a time of social peace when men and women in the majority behaved toward each other in peaceful , civil and friendly ways , and were generally very accepting and accommodating with respect to each others ’ differences .
But as every properly informed person knows , this brief historical period was also to be the very last stage of the chivalry system before it disappeared altogether as a casualty under the feminist onslaught that began in the 1960s .
While I had an idea that since the 60’s something had gone extremely wrong between men and women , seeing that too many women were not acting the same as I knew them prior to the 60s , I really could not figure out precisely what it was that had gone wrong , even though I suspected that feminist ideology had something to do with it .
It was not until this year of 2009 , when I finally read the renowned American historian Christopher Lasch ’s widely acclaimed book , “ The Culture of Narcissism , ” first published in 1979 , that I finally learned what it was that had gone wrong and of a sexual combat that Lasch said was taking place between men and women .
In fact , this was the first most significant thing that “ jumped out ” big time in my mind from reading Lasch , that men and women were actually at war with each other and that all this was first instigated by feminists .
Now all the pieces of the puzzling enigma I was wrestling with , trying to understand the modern woman , began to fall in place , providing me with a wealth of knowledge and understanding as to the nature of the current men- women social scene .
In his section dealing with the now ongoing sexual combat , Lasch referred to an “ escalating war between men and women ” which he also referred to as “ the recent intensification of sexual combat ” .
I do believe Lasch was correct .
It is now very clear to me that men and women in the 1970s , when Lasch ’s book was first published , were in an escalating sexual combat .
But while Lasch tells us about an ongoing sexual combat in the 1970s and the why of it , he does not tell us precisely the how , when , who , or where , concerning the beginning of this war .
To discover this missing information , I had to do research apart from Lasch .
Eventually , this led me to discover that it was one person who , at least in effect , first declared war on males .
Her name was Betty Friedan ( 1921-2006 ) , who has since become known as the chief matriarch of feminism ’s so - called “ second wave . ”
In effect and / or principle , Friedan ideologically declared war on males by convincing millions of women through her book , “ The Feminine Mystique , ” published in 1963 , that they were being oppressed by males dominant in society , their husbands of course were included , who were keeping them tied to the home and kitchen , unable to fulfill themselves out of the home as men were doing .
“ The Feminine Mystique ” became a virtual feminist manifesto espousing radicalizing propaganda along typical feminist lines which , as you guessed , radicalized the millions of women who read it .
As a result , these women , while initially making in the 60s an attempt to be at peace with males , eventually reversed course and became eager to join a fight against males who came to be viewed as the oppressors who had to be overthrown as the dominant social power .
In the style of Karl Marx against capitalists , Friedan ’s ideology in effect convinced millions of women that they had nothing to lose but their “ household chains ” by revolting against their oppressors .
Consequently , it was Friedan ’s book that led to the production of the modern “ liberated ” woman and to the coining of the phrase “ Woman ’s Lib ” into the social jargon .
Friedan liberated women from the nursery looking after her babies , from the kitchen , the laundry and ironing room , from having to be the only one in the house who wore dresses and not pants , and from helping their husbands while they as wives worked at home in a marital unit ’s joint effort to achieve survival in our harsh world of existence .
Was Friedan correct in doing what she did ?
Before answering , please consider the following in case you failed to catch the full breadth and scope of what Friedan accomplished :
To begin with , please note that feminism , as Friedan presented the movement , was an ideology that had elements of what some have called an “ ideology of discontent . ”
In case you are not aware of what an ideology of discontent consists of , a Jewish writer named Levi Brackman , with an article posted in the internet gave us a useful example of such an ideology when he sought to explain the basis of radical Arab hate for Israel ’s existence as a political state .
Brackman ’s explanation began by demonstrating elements that are peculiar to an ideology of discontent .
Briefly stated , these elements consist , in a prelude , of arousing strong negative emotions such as fear or envy in those who are led to consider themselves “ oppressed ” through the propagation of a radicalizing idea .
Once this first stage is achieved , it is followed , as natural consequence , by more negative emotions , such as hatred and / or disgust .
In the end , it is the combination of all these strong negative emotions that can lead in conclusion to some form of violent or highly disruptive action .
In the context of the Arab - Israeli conflict , following is how Brackman described the concluding sequence in an ideology of discontent : “ disgust is only a short step away from a hatred that can lead to cold - blooded killing ” and “ discontent with one ’s lot often leads to the disgust and hate of others , and then tragically to carnage . ”
Using Israel and radical Arabs as an example , Brackman said all this to show what are typical elements in an ideology of discontent , which essentially is just another way of repeating what is now proverbial , namely , that ideas ( or ideologies ) have consequences .
That Friedan ’s feminist ideology is a radicalizing ideology of discontent arousing strong negative emotions in those who are led to believe they are oppressed is clear when you consider that prior to her book , there was no female discontent of the magnitude and scope that erupted and spread to millions of women as a result of The Feminine Mystique .
In other words , Friedan ’s book first aroused strong emotions of disgust and envy among millions of women ; this was essentially women ’s disgust over their lot as housewives and mothers and an envy of their husband ’s life , which appeared more liberating and fulfilling .
This was followed in conclusion by a highly disruptive , feminist - driven , social and family upheaval that the entire world is now experiencing and which is causing violence against women , and against children as an added side - effect , to go from bad to worse .
The following description of the essentials of Friedan ’s feminist ideology will make clear that such an ideology qualifies as an ideology of discontent because the description makes it obviously evident that such an ideology has all the essential and requisite elements of an ideology of discontent .
This description that now follows is given by Joanne Boucher , Ph.D. , who has been a Professor at the University of Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada and has specialized in feminist political thought , feminist theory and women ’s studies :
“ Betty Friedan is universally regarded as one of the founding mothers of feminism ’s Second Wave .
In The Feminine Mystique , published in 1963 , Friedan aimed to expose the sexist underpinnings of America ’s post - World War II complacent prosperity .
Friedan argued that millions of American housewives found the destiny of mother and housewife which society mapped out for them stifling , repressive and even dehumanizing .
“ Anna Quindlen , in her introduction to the most recent paperback edition of The Feminine Mystique , proclaims that this book changed her life and that of millions of other women who became engaged in the women ’s movement and ‘ jettisoned empty hours of endless housework and found work , and meaning , outside of raising their children and feeding their husbands .
Out of Friedan ’s argument that women had been coaxed into selling out their intellect and their ambitions for the paltry price of a new washing machine …came a great wave of change in which women demanded equality and parity under the law and in the workplace . ’
“ Friedan ’s self - presentation in The Feminine Mystique is that of a rather naive and apolitical albeit bright and university - educated suburban housewife who stumbles onto a startling discovery - that America ’s housewives are , in fact , miserable .
Friedan depicts herself as sharing in all the experiences of her fellow housewives .
She is one of them and has experienced their plight .
However , Friedan also uses another voice in the text , that of the expert , the university - trained researcher and psychologist .
This perspective lends her work scientific authority .
The combination of the two voices - the personal and scientific - gives The Feminine Mystique much of its dramatic force .
“ However , for all its acclaim and its status as the book that ignited the women ’s movement , praise for Friedan ’s Feminine Mystique has never been unqualified .
Indeed many feminists have criticized its myopic representation of women .
There is hardly a word in The Feminine Mystique that would indicate that American women in the 1950s were dealing with problems other than the trap of suburban domesticity which , after all , was a consequence of economic prosperity [ in those days for middle class families , only the income of the husband was necessary to support the entire household ] .
The problems facing , for example , millions of poor , working women or non- white women - oppressive working conditions and low pay , racism , and the burdens of a double day - barely register on the radar screen of The Feminine Mystique .
As Rosemarie
Tong remarks , ‘ Friedan seemed oblivious to any other perspectives than those of white , middle - class , heterosexual , educated women who found the traditional roles of wife and mother unsatisfying . ' ”
So was Friedan correct in radicalizing and inciting the millions of women as she did with her explosive , highly consequential , and disruptive ideology of discontent ?
Of course not !
At least such is my view .
Why ?
Consider this as a starter :
A whole new social order between men and women that in all the centuries of human history never existed before 1960 , was first instigated by only one single , solitary female human being named Betty , was never put through any careful planning , consultation , and approval between the two main parties involved to make it a success , and which is genetically against the nature of at least one of the main parties involved , is now being forced fascistically on humanity under conditions of combat and war , mostly by females alone , without the unanimous agreement , support or cooperation of the other half of humanity composed of males .
Briefly stated , the whole of human civilization is being put through a wrenching and highly damaging , devastating , human and social upheaval by the inane idealism of a female - driven movement that , in its idealism and fascistic imposition on humanity , is similar to Marxism .
In the worldwide sexual combat that has erupted as a result of this , men and women no longer pull together as they formerly did , as partners with mutual respect for each other and as a unit to accomplish the important goal of mutual survival in the midst of a dangerous and brutish world that all humans now face every day .
Families have been consequently torn apart , and children , caught helplessly in the middle , have also suffered and have been abused in the midst of such upheavals .
Finally , I further submit that Friedan feminism and feminism in general , because such ideologies subvert the social and sexual order that God Almighty set in place at the time of human creation , such feminist ideologies are anti-God and therefore ungodly .
Because of this , feminism really has no place in biblical religion , Jew or Christian .
We will look at the Jewish - Christian biblical record to demonstrate this .
Violence against women , feminist or not , can never be justified .
But feminism has not only wrongly incited women to reckless behavior , it has also wrongly provided male perversity an encouraging pretext to rely on as justifying cause in male crooked minds for perpetrating violence against women .
It is feminism , especially that espoused by Friedan , that is ultimately to blame for all this since it was Friedan ’s feminist ideology of discontent in the first place that started this whole mess and caused all hell to break loose on women and children as well as men .
Until Friedan came along , all was relatively peaceful between men and women .
It should therefore be clear that feminism is a reckless social experiment gone wrong which , as such , can be aptly compared to the rise and fall of Karl Marx ’s communistic experiment .
As for what is written here , one thing has to be made totally clear : nothing in this article is intended to provide any justification or encouragement whatsoever for violence against women or anyone else .
On the contrary , all that is said here is merely to show reasons why Friedanism and feminism in general is itself recklessly causing highly adverse effects to fall on the very same women they have sought to “ liberate . ”
Having stated all the necessary disclaimers that are called for , I can now proceed to demonstrate the accuracy of the assertions I have made on the subject of feminism .
Based on what I have learned about that controversial decade of the 1960’s , I have come to understand , rightly or wrongly , that the currently ongoing sexual war began in the 60s with women being “ demystified ” and liberated by Betty ( more on Friedanistic demystification later ) .
It appears to me that , as liberated females , it was women in the 60s who began to change the attitudes women in general had held in pre-60s times .
To be precise , what originally made things so radically different in feminist women of the 60s is that they took a radically different position than that which pre-60s women had about sexual differences between men and women .
Pre-60s women believed , and peacefully accepted , that men and women were different .
But being now liberated by dear old Betty from their thinking in the past , liberated women in the 60s began presuming and acting as if females , now demystified , were actually and basically no different than males .
Because of this feminist assumption of equality between men and women , it was thought by liberated women in the 60s that women could play and cavort with men as “ pals ” on an equal footing of togetherness and peace , sharing a nature that women assumed they possessed perfectly equal as that of men .
On this presupposition of equality of nature , it seemed right that men and women should come together to celebrate and enjoy their presumed similarities .
On this same basis , women could then , equally with men their new - found pals , be promiscuous together and have free sex with anyone and with however many they wanted , just like most men naturally , or at least privately in their erotic cravings , wish to do .
So at this early stage , males seemed to be setting the model for women to emulate .
Briefly stated , the 1960s seemed to be a time when women wholeheartedly wanted to celebrate togetherness , oneness , and peace with men .
“ Make love not war ” became the ubiquitous slogan for these 1960s avant - garde men and women , while the Viet - Nam War raged on .
However , it did not take long for women to realize that this option of “ loving men thy neighbor ” was not a realistic one that female nature could tolerate indefinitely .
They quickly came to discover that men and women were not by nature actually the same ( or as equal ) as women had first thought immediately after Betty had liberated them .
Men in general , or at least the lustful men these early Friedans cavorted with , turned out to be too irremediably hurtful and seductively manipulating , and too morally unreliable and emotionally insensitive to suit a woman ’s distinctly different nature .
As a result , women were forced to make a hasty retreat from their experiment with sexual equality shown in their attempt at being pals with men at their level .
Another option that opened up was that of going into sexual combat with men with the objective of seeking to neutralize and control what was viewed as men ’s ingrained perversity .
This was highly disturbing for a majority of males who felt offended at the drastic change : first men were considered pals by liberated women who wanted to “ join ” and emulate them ; now these same women were turning in the exact opposite direction treating men as detestable enemies , beings of a different nature , with whom they now had to compete and win against to continue their march to full liberation from their domination .
When men in an effort to resist and put down the whole idea of women ’s liberation , responded irrationally by trying to ridicule in various ways the newly emerging and determined “ liberated woman , ” such women in response became more and more determined to show men what classless losers they were .
Finally , toward the end of the 1970s , when Lasch ’s book came on the scene , the sexual combat had already intensified and turned into a social brawl .
Hence , it was when liberated women first became convinced that no matter what they did to win with males and that men remained irremediably “ men ” who apparently could or would not change in their stereotypical “ male ways , ” that these early Friedans turned to all - out combat against them .
But this modern sexual combat , which at least in effect began in the 60’s with Friedan , has never been resolved ; it has only gotten worst , at least in the sense that more and more , with each passing year , the hopelessness of a resolution becomes ever more hopeless .
It appears now that there is more hope that radical Arabs will reconcile with Jews before feminist - minded women will reach a peace accord with men in the sexual combat they ’re waging against them .
This war continues to rage unrelenting into this our first decade of the twenty - first century .
Moreover , this is not only happening in America , but everywhere else in the world that militant feminism is forcefully exerting its influence .
Lasch went on to give the following explanations or reasons why modern “ sexual combat ” came into existence in the first place and why it is persistent :
1 . The collapse of paternalism and , with this , the end of chivalry .
2 . The liberation of sex from many of its former constraints ( primarily reproduction , but also moral restraints that passed away with the demise of religious authority in the social scene ) .
3 . The pursuit of sexual pleasure as an end in itself .
4 . The emotional overloading of personal relations ( which it appears for Lasch to be due to the excessive , unrealistic , and narcissist expectations men and women were placing on their relationships ) .
5 . Finally , what Lasch calls the most important factor : “ the irrational male response to the emergence of the liberated woman ” ( which has already been noted above ) .
The word “ collapse ” seems to be a favorite word for Lasch when referring to the cessation or end of something .
For example , there ’s the collapse of religious authority , the collapse of paternalism and the collapse of chivalry .
Of all the reasons Lasch gave for sexual combat between men and women , I will focus primarily on the demise of chivalry because it is here , above everything else that went wrong , where I believe feminism made its most grievous error against a woman ’s vital interest .
Directly connected with this error is the erroneous thinking or assumption in liberated women that views life as a kind of field that has been provided for every human being , male or female , to be “ fulfilled ” equally .
But other than a bare assumption based on the invention of a relative ( as opposed to absolute ) human ideology called “ democracy , ” feminism has not shown where it is written , declared , or confirmed with the force of absolute moral authority that “ getting fulfilled ” or getting fulfilled “ equally ” is , above all else , what existence is about .
On the other hand , there is empirically verifiable evidence that in absolute terms ( that is , not in any way dependent on the support of relative human authority or human ideologies such as democracy or feminism ) which categorically , absolutely , and authoritatively declares ( 1 ) that men and women are each uniquely different and , thus , not equally the same , but without implying by this that one has less human worth than the other , and ( 2 ) that as uniquely different beings , men and women have each a distinctively different destiny to fulfill , which ( 3 ) leads to the conclusion that it therefore does not follow that men and women NECESSARILY must fulfill themselves equally in every way ; such a thought is a mere unsubstantiated assumption based on relative ( not absolute ) human ideologies .
All this will be examined more at length below .
With respect to chivalry , it appears that Lasch uses the concept of chivalry to apply not only to the respectful deference that men used to extend to women as “ ladies , ” but also to the long history of paternalistic relations in which those in dominant positions of power behaved as benefactors of those beneath them to make their subordination as inferior players more tolerable .
He gives the familial or patriarchal form of capitalism as an example .
But then , Lasch turns to what he calls “ the [ male ] domination of women ” and asserts the following concerning chivalry in this context :
“ It has been clear for some time that ‘ chivalry is dead . ’
The tradition of gallantry formerly masked and to some degree mitigated the organized oppression of women .
While males monopolized political and economic power , they made their domination of women more palatable by surrounding it with an elaborate ritual of deference and politesse . ”
As a prime factor for the feminist war against males , chivalry was rejected and made obsolete by feminists mainly because they interpreted chivalry as being too often a ploy used by corrupt - minded men to try to convince women they were totally inferior to men and that they should therefore simply accept as a trade - off the honor such men were giving them as ladies .
Not accepting this accommodation offered by corrupt males , feminists demanded that men no longer place women in a platform of adoration , and consequently for this reason , demanded that women be “ demystified ” out of being so honored and respected as they were under chivalry .
However , from my perspective , I do believe there have always been corrupt - minded men who abuse and / or take advantage of women in various ways ( as it is even now in the age of the liberated female , proving that even women ’s lib cannot eradicate male perversity ; it is universally persistent and ineradicable ) .
But I certainly do not believe that all males who were chivalrous to women in the days of chivalry were simply for the reason of being chivalrous , necessarily behaving with a hidden purpose to put women down as inferior or to abuse them in any way .
Yet whatever be the case , sincere or not , feminists despised chivalry and killed it .
But one wonders if this feminist success might not have been a classic pyrrhic victory : winning , but at a great fundamental female loss , perhaps even greater than it was worth the winning .
I say this considering the following :
The demystification process that Betty ’s feminist ideology put all women through , regardless of whether all women universally approved of it or not , is a process that stripped all women of the high and lofty honor , sanctity , and respect in which the age of male chivalry had placed them .
Now that feminism has successfully and decisively blotted out chivalry from the human race as something they despise , women in the minds of men have become mere common “ females ” in the best of light and “ bitches ” in the worst .
Betty , in other words , made women ripe and inviting as a ready target for desecration and concomitant violence and abuse .
Women had been “ demystified ” by their own kind , and sincerely decent and chivalrous men , taking full notice of this , lost all the respect they formerly had for women under the chivalry system because women no longer cared for this and actually came to hate it .
Thus , with liberated women having cast off and rejected sincere male respect and honor for females , Betty ’s demystification process quickly backfired once chivalry “ collapsed ” ( Lasch ) .
Consequently , “ men no longer treat women as ‘ ladies ' ” ( Lasch ) .
Moreover , now that men know that feminist - minded women , which are the majority of all women , have declared war on men seeking their obsolescence , how much less do you suppose men will now honor or respect females ?
How much less will they treat women kindly as friends ?
If we ’re at war , then there can be no kindness , respect , or friendship between the two adversaries involved in combat .
Left without the overwhelming , strong defense and security that men voluntarily had provided women under chivalry , which optimized a woman ’s ability to dwell safely in the midst of males , and was something for which women did not have to fight for or have laws passed to attain , demystified women then became fair game for anything and male abuse of females rose sharply .
In the following decades since Betty ’s female demystification up to our present times , female abuse continues unabated regardless of how many laws have been passed to curb this modern , post - chivalry phenomenon .
Campaigns to stop household violence against women are springing up everywhere .
This was something virtually unheard of while chivalry was alive and thriving .
But , as we have seen , men and women are at war now and , as in all wars , violence happens and becomes a daily routine and way of life .
The good old peaceful days of chivalry are gone , thanks to feminists ; all we hear about now is sexual war and combat .
War is a time when all civility and civil law loses its power as an inhibiting force on human violence .
There is a breakdown in the ability of such controlling elements to effectively control , and life and living then becomes a jungle where the rule is to destroy or be destroyed and the weak suffer the most .
But off course , women are strong , or so the feminists tell us ; they can take abuse as good as any man .
So let the sex war rage on , shall we ?
May the best man win !
Yet , in any case , it is because of the profound negative results for women resulting from the feminist victory against male chivalry that the feminist success in overthrowing chivalry appears like a classic pyrrhic victory .
In addition , reaching an accommodating compromise between men and women is out of the question , given the thinking among a significant number of feminist - minded female combatants .
Following is how these ferocious females reason : “ Why capitulate to a peace with men when we already have them wimping out and on the run ?
Why not just continue with the drive to complete the objective of marginalizing males and forcing them into irrelevance and obsolescence and be done with the intolerable problem of maleness once and for all . ”
Yes , indeed , for feminist - minded females “ a problem ” is the only thing “ maleness ” can mean .
This brings up the issue of genetics as an important point to consider .
FEMALE DOMINANCE AND THE FIGHT AGAINST MALE GENETICS
Can anybody really ever win the ongoing war between the sexes that has been raging since modern feminism began with its so - called “ second wave ” of the 1960s ?
I very , very seriously doubt it .
I believe that this war will go on without end , with females trying to force males to accept and do what they think and males feeling they are being “ pushed against the wall , ” resisting and sabotaging every female move in any and every way they can .
Yes , I do realize there ’s a lot of sex - whipped male wimps who can be dominated by women who use sex as a weapon to get their way with them .
These male weaklings will cry and moan , “ Oh !
We gotta do what the women tell us ; otherwise we get no warm nookie ! ”
But unfortunately for women , there will always be enough stalwart men who would rather withstand sexless years without the hot stuff if they have to , rather than to cave in to fascistic female demands unilaterally pushed on them against their will .
For this reason , I do not believe the feminist solution to achieve an all - conclusive feminist victory is sex - whipping enough wimpy males into submission .
On the contrary , I believe the root of the male - female problem that makes it a never - ending one is that both parties in the fight are so genetically unlike each other , it affects inescapably , unavoidably , and inevitably , their ability to reach agreement on many of the most vital things that are important to their lives .
Finding a way to survive life , together or separately , with or without each other ’s help , is about the only vital thing that men and women can agree on has to be done .
Yet , this provides a vital key to demonstrate how a return to chivalry , if it were not for the fact that its loss is irreversible , could have represented the best possible resolution to the present conflict .
Despite its faults ( which could have been improved ) , chivalry was the best possible social system devised for men and women to work together as a team , constructively and in peace , for the commonly - held objective of life - survival .
Chivalry was also the best possible social system devised to bring about and sustain peace between two utterly different types of beings whose persistent and unalterable differences are genetically based , and therefore genetically predestined , and therefore genetically doomed to be unchangeable .
Even the urbane scholar and historian Lasch seems to have indirectly acknowledged this by pointing out the existence of a persistent difference in men that women do not naturally possess , hence suggesting genetics at the root , when he wrote the following :
“ Polite conventions [ i.e. , chivalry ] , even when they were no more than a façade , provided women with ideological leverage in their [ incessant , I will add ] struggle to domesticate the wildness and savagery of men . ”
Clearly , if men generally could naturally think , feel and be like women in every aspect , this male “ savagery ” would never have existed in the first place .
Or if such a thing was a learned behavior , it would have been wiped out long ago by our modern civilizing systems of education to which both men and women have had equal access .
But male savagery persists , unlike anything generally coming close to it in women , no matter what feminists do and no matter how many laws are passed to change this persistent and characteristic attribute in men .
Also relevant here is the following that Lasch mentions :
“ The woman who rejects the stereotype of feminine weakness and dependence can no longer find much comfort in the cliché that all men are beasts [ in other words , if she hates to be stereotyped as “ weak , ” she would be hypocritical to stereotype all men as “ beasts ” ] .
She has no choice except to believe , on the contrary that men are human beings [ genetically different , I will add ] and she finds it hard to forgive them when they act like animals .
Although her own actions , which violate the conventions of female passivity and thus appear to men as a form of aggression , help to call up animal - like actions in males , even her understanding of this dynamic does not make it any easier to make allowances for her adversary .
‘ You want too much , ’ an older woman says to a younger one .
‘ You are n’t willing to compromise .
‘ Men will never be as sensitive or aware as women are .
It ’s just not in their nature [ hence again , suggesting genetics ] .
So you have to get used to that , and be satisfied with …either sexual satisfaction or theoretical intelligence or being loved and not understood or else being left alone to do the things you want . ”
In other words , because of men ’s genetic nature , women simply can’t have it all with men .
With some men , women can of course come close to it rather than with others , it ’s totally relative and that ’s about the best women can hope for in genetically determined males .
So the real fundamental root problem in the men- woman conflict as I see it is genetics , nothing else .
Everything else that has been pointed to as the real problem , such as the “ sexist structure of power ” that “ second - wave ” feminism used to justify its attack on males , when you actually trace it down to its final origins , is really nothing other than the end - result of male genetics .
Is there room for improvement in genetically - determined male savagery ?
I certainly believe so .
Civilized men , for example , have come a long way from the primitive brute savagery they displayed in earlier epochs of history .
But as far as a total domestication , or the effeminate transformation of males after the female image , do n’t count on it because within all men generally there ’s always the “ call of the wild . ”
So do n’t hold your breath waiting for total domestication to happen , unless you ’re inclined to be satisfied with gay men , whose queer genetics seem to have fixed them as female - like .
Incidentally , since we ’ve hit on the topic of gays , I will in passing say that , unless I ’m presented with compelling evidence to the contrary , I am personally convinced that gays whose gayness cannot be explained by some traumatic event in their growth environment , such gayness has to be genetically - determined .
Gayness is a universal phenomenon that I ’m sure you can find naturally occurring even among primitive Amazon Indians and Australian aborigines .
On the other hand , forget about this idea among certain “ religious ” gays who feel so good and proud about their gayness as to believe they can rejoice in their deviation from general manhood because “ God made them that way . ”
Simply because gays are presumptively genetically determined to be what they are does not follow that they can therefore attribute their gayness to God ’s handiwork .
I say this because the Bible clearly states that homosexuals will be thrown in hell for being homosexuals : “ Stop deceiving yourselves !
Sexually immoral people , idolaters , adulterers , male prostitutes , homosexuals , thieves , greedy people , drunks , slanderers , and robbers will not inherit the kingdom of God ” ( 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 ISV ) .
Does this mean there ’s no Christian hope for homosexuals ?
I would not say this because , except for the sin of unbelief , any or all sin , no matter how grievous , morally debased , genetically determined or not , is forgivable through faith in Christ , who himself affirmed this in the following : “ I tell you with certainty , people will be forgiven their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter ” ( Mark 3:28 ISV ) .
But this universal forgiveness of all sin , except the sin of unbelief , presupposes that the offending person has expressed self - judgment , that is , a sincere acknowledgment that their moral behavior is not right and not good in any way and that a sincere effort to control it if not eradicate it altogether has been or is being made .
In this light , a homosexual who is homosexual and shamelessly proud of it and / or one who flaunts his or her moral deviation publicly without shame is a sure candidate for hell .
But with respect to “ straight ” male - female genetics , since no one can re-engineer the basic and different genetic - driven natures of men and women , without creating other problems … monsters , for example , I believe we are all doomed to never - ending sexual combat as a race composed of two utterly disparate and disagreeing beings called men and women .
The chivalry system of men- women social rules was really the best that could be hoped for and socially arranged for men and women to get along constructively and not be constantly at war with each other .
But as Lasch has observed , all that is gone and unlikely to ever return :
“ Feminism …has caused women to make new demands on men and to hate men when they fail to meet those demands .
Feminist consciousness - raising , moreover , has had irreversible effects .
Once women begin to question the inevitability of their subordination [ by males ] and to reject the [ chivalry ] conventions formerly associated with it , they can no longer retreat to the safety of those conventions . ”
Please note that in saying , “ Feminism …has caused women to make new demands on men and to hate men when they fail to meet those demands , ” Lasch is indirectly and concisely describing the nature of the male - female fight we ’re in .
Feminism does not like men at all because it does not like the way men stereotypically behave .
So , in reaction , feminism demands of men that they stop behaving like men and start behaving like women want them to be .
But since it is genetics that makes men be what they are as men , distinctly different than women , they ca n’t do anything to change being “ men ” in how they think , emote , and act .
But feminists are not content with this answer .
Thus , unable to please feminist - minded females because of their genetics , men are hated and detested by most women , at least in advanced societies like America , because most women in these societies are feminists or feminist - minded females .
Let ’s face it men , the situation is now hopelessly fatal as to the likelihood of a dawning of peace between men and women .
Because of male - women genetics and because of the estrangement , tantamount to an irreversible divorce , that has taken place between men and women , we , men and women , face nothing but unending sexual combat now and in the future , barring some unforeseen and unlikely miraculous resolution .
What has really made matters worse for male - female relations is a new twist that has evolved within feminism .
The second feminist wave that began in the 1960s was mainly concerned with achieving a more equal standing between men and women culturally and with respect to women ’s treatment under the law .
But the feminist third wave appears to have become dissatisfied with how far the feminist fight was carried by the second wave .
It now appears that feminism does not simply want equal treatment between the sexes ; it wants to change the world ’s thinking altogether on how anyone , but especially men , think about the real differences that exist between male and female .
Feminists now want to obliterate all thinking and / or language that suggests or refers to differences of any kind between men and women .
This can become as petty in the minds of some of these females as stating a harmless personal opinion as to how a woman dresses as opposed to men .
If you as a male express the wrong or politically incorrect personal opinion in any matter , no matter how trivial , suggesting a sexual difference between men and women , you are , in the minds of these ferocious , feminist females being “ sexist . ”
Prior to mid-twentieth century , such a thing or ideology as “ sexism ” was unheard of ; this has all been a very recent female invention .
Prior to the advent of sexism as an ideology , if a woman felt uncomfortable about something a man said to her without it necessarily being a gross vulgarity or without any harm intended , the woman would simply ask the man politely not say that again because she felt offense at the remark .
Assuming that the man was decent ( or “ chivalrous ” ) enough , he would just simply apologize sincerely to the woman for the unintended offense and back - off .
But now that we ’re in the age of sexual combat and chivalry is dead thanks to the feminist triumph , every male move not “ sounding ” or “ looking right ” to feminist ideology is viewed with paranoia by ferocious , feminist - minded females as a combat suppressive put - down on women .
As such , the most severe , counter - offense is called for in the thinking of such combative ferocious feminists .
This is an example of what feminists are combatively ( or in combat ) putting males through in their drive to turn a former male dominance of society into a new far greater and starkly fascistic female dominance of their own .
So forget about the problem of the sexes being one of male dominance of society with “ helpless ” women arising to overthrow male authority “ to defend themselves from abuse . ”
It is more than that ; it is clear that the real issue now is not male dominance , but who it is that will dominate or who will decisively win the sexual combat war and come out dominant over human society and culture .
Feminists are hell - bent to make it the female sex who will dominate , turning all men into sex - whipped wimps and they are winning .
Society is already female dominated with a whole lot of male wimps running around with their “ tails between their legs , ” as the proverb goes , crying out , “ Oh !
We gotta listen and do what the women tell us … ”
Yes , indeed , the proverbial “ tables ” of who will dominate have completely turned to the opposite side .
As already suggested , there was a time when rampant un-civility did not exist between men and women .
This was generally true up to the middle of the twentieth century .
In those days , the majority of men and women in society got along royally well and could even be cheerfully friendly with each other in a healthy moral way .
Feminist male - paranoia was virtually non-existent .
Then along came feminism ’s second wave in the sixties and changed all this .
Since then , the male - female world has descended into a horribly devastating social combat .
So in case you wonder why relations between men and women stink and are so rotten today , or why social relations in general ( husbands , wives , children , singles , whole families ) are so screwed up and dysfunctional , with everybody confused as to what ’s right or what ’s wrong , WAKE UP , get off your sleeping bed , and look around , it ’s time you realized that feminist - minded females have been very busy for at least the last four decades cooking up something , and it has n’t been dear old mom ’s apple pie .
Feminist - minded females have cooked up a war against males ; they declared it years ago and immediately started an all - out fight against males with the objective of achieving a final male submission to their thinking and social dominance .
As with all wars , this one is also deadly and devastating , not just for adult males , but for women themselves as well as children .
As I said earlier and must repeat now , a whole new social order between men and women that never existed before 1960 , and was never put through any careful planning , consultation , and approval between the two main parties involved to make it a success , and which is genetically against the nature of at least one of the main parties involved is being forced fascistically on humanity by females .
I again repeat , the whole of human civilization is being put through a wrenching and highly damaging , devastating human upheaval by the inane idealism of a female - driven movement .
In this war , men and women no longer pull together as partners with mutual respect for each other as a unit to accomplish a mutual goal .
All such cooperation came to an end beginning with the 1960s .
Yes , war is hell and supremely destructive and we ’re living through one right now , except that you do n’t hear bombs and cannons going off and the destruction being caused is not buildings or the infrastructure of cities ; it is the destruction of human society with its families and children ’s lives , thanks to muddle - headed feminism .
The war of the sexes that we ’re in right now - and make no mistake about it , it is a war , a kind of mortal combat where only one victor can come out of it and dominate the land ( and women are winning , do n’t you know by now ) - can be compared to a marriage which at first seemed right suddenly go wrong .
This is when a husband and wife all of a sudden realize how mistaken they were in the beginning , thinking they had enough in common to make their marriage a peaceful and lasting one .
Now they find themselves constantly bickering with each other and engaged in a struggle to see who in the end will dominate .
When no happy solution seems to be in sight and only constant conflict and bickering goes on , the decision is finally made to separate and divorce and in bitterness go into all - out war .
Unfortunately , the human race does not have divorce between men and women as an option to end the sexual conflict in which the whole world is in now .
These two utterly different beings are stuck with each other on this planet earth , whether they get along or not .
Yet it remains true that male - hating feminists have seen how hopeless it is to successfully change and “ fix ” men according to their own female image , and so they really want a divorce that will make men disappear from the human scene but ca n’t get one .
Yet in spite of this impossibility , it seems that in the minds of these wishful - thinking women , such an event would solve the problem the human race is struggling with right now between the sexes : “ Would n’t it be just grand and lovely if we women could in a moment somehow make all men simply disappear ?
Then we women would be the only ones owning the planet and never again have to contend with “ the male problem . ”
I have said women are winning the combat we ’re in , and to an overwhelming extent that ’s true .
That ’s why , men , no matter what you try with women , nothing works with them anymore .
For many years now , the men- women rules have changed under the increasing female domination of our society .
In the past , you never saw so many women on the street and everywhere else you look , because most of them were at home cooking up savory dishes instead of dumb , divisive , destructive and confrontational ideas like feminism which destabilize entire societies .
Some women are smart enough , but others are too dangerous to leave alone for too long unsupervised .
Now you know what dear old Betty was up to when she was messing around with her IBM Selectric unsupervised .
But now women are everywhere .
What used to be male - dominated workplaces are now overrun with demanding , dominant females who have already taken societal command .
Women are taking over and dominating in banks , in sales and merchandizing , in construction , in the legal and medical industry , in government , in politics , and so on infinitum .
That ’s why the rules have been changing everywhere ; women are taking over and exerting a dominant rule .
However , because of this change to a female dominated society , it ’s now the old American Wild West when it comes to knowing how to handle a relationship with a woman .
This is true because when we conceive of a feminist rule change in the sexual combat we ’re in , we should not , to be accurate , conceive it as an abolishment of rules that were previously in place and the institution of new rules that were carefully planned , designed , examined and implemented with due public notice so that everyone affected would know how the new game of men- women relations is supposed to work or be played .
Rather , it is the thoughtless female move to overthrow previous rules and let a void develop where there are no new rules .
So you ’re now left with only your imagination as to what you ’re supposed to do and , most often , what you imagine is wrong .
Even women do n’t safely know what to do ; that ’s why they ’re just as confused as men and have become as unpredictable and wishy - washy as they are .
This is why I say that under the new female - dominated social regime that is overwhelmingly and rapidly emerging , it is now like the old American Wild West where everyone is on their own to try anything .
If you ’re bold and lucky , sometimes fortune will bless your efforts , but sometimes it wo n’t because everything is fluid , constantly changing , and you therefore ca n’t depend on anything for sure anymore .
It ’s all in the blind luck of the draw .
But how was it that before the 1960s , this ferocious , feminist female problem did not exist ?
Had the vast majority of women up to that point really been so stupid as to believe all was well , and it took just one solitary female by the name of Betty to demonstrate in her book that this was so and then use her book to start the sexual combat we ’re in ?
No , I do not believe that was the case .
It was not stupidity in pre-1960s women or brightness in post -1960s women that made the difference and brought about the change in the male - female rules and the sexual combat we ’re in .
I believe that apart from the important issue of genetics , what brought about the rule change and the combat was the inevitability of it all resulting from the final success of secularizing forces in society , where humans and not God , would solely determine not only their own affairs but their moral norms and human destiny .
It was all the result of the “ collapse of religious authority , ” as Lasch has correctly observed .
All this is the same as to assert that the chivalrous social order that existed prior to the 1960s was based on the traditional biblical belief , basically involving Jewish biblical concepts but shared as well by Christian culture , since Christianity came from the Jews , that God had created men and women differently in very significant ways .
These are ways which , with the advent of genetics science , we now see were genetically - based .
In other words , we who still believe can now say that God created men and women genetically different and that such genetic differences impose an inevitable and unalterable biological predestination that makes men and women unlike each other in vital aspects , such as how they view reality , how they think , and how they emote or experience and express emotion .
We will delve into this biblical religious root in chivalry after we touch briefly on its medieval roots .
THE DEMISE OF CHIVALRY AND THE RESULTING FEMALE CURSE
It has been said by social historians that the idea or social concept of “ chivalry , ” at times also referred to as “ gallantry , ” which was manifested in the now - extinct respectful deference ( or honor ) that in the pre-1960s past men directed toward women as “ ladies , ” had its earliest origins in the ethical ideals of knighthood during the medieval period of European history .
Insofar as knighthood was a factor , knights were expected to be gallant ( or chivalrous ) in all their deportment , which was to be directed not only to women as “ fair damsels ” ( or ladies ) but to humanity in general .
With respect to women generally , looked upon in the early days of chivalry as “ fair ladies ” or the “ fair sex , ” the word “ fair ” implied simply the opposite of being coarse or rough .
The word “ lady ” was a synonym for a polite , well - mannered , respectable female .
Because of positive qualities like these with which females were socially associated as well as encouraged to possess , in the early days of chivalry , chivalrous men generally treated the female sex with honor and respect , not just as mere women or females but as fair ladies .
Thus , in the old and early days of chivalry , to be honored as “ a lady ” by men , all a woman needed to be was nothing more than a decent female ; she could not , in other words , be such a thing as a common “ tramp . ”
To be a decent woman , she needed to be someone who first of all exuded self - respect in how delicately discriminating she behaved and in the way she took care of her overall feminine appearance and , secondly , she was a woman who demonstrated delicate , discriminating poise in accepting something beneficial from a man or was very polite and courteous to him if she felt she had to refuse it .
Femininity in attire took in dresses , not pants , made of such things as fabrics of soft cotton or silk , with embroidery , ribbons and lace that might or might not be added .
Such “ lady - like ” behavior and appearance alone would mark a woman as being a “ lady . ”
Added to this , making a woman more lady - like , would be an air of studied grace , charm and social refinement .
In modern times up to the emergence and success of feminism , the old knighthood ethical ideal called chivalry came to mean , in its best form , simply the deferential , respectful and honorable way , which largely by implicit social custom , men were expected to treat women .
Feminism came to despise all this .
Why should women be expected to be different from men ?
Why should they be placed in a pedestal of respectful sanctity above them ?
My basic argument in answer to this is that unless this is done , as we shall see , dire and adverse consequences inevitably come to women , not to mention society as a whole , and that the basic reason why this happens is that men , no less than women , are fundamentally , genetically , and thus irredeemably , “ wired ” different than women .
As such , this cannot be changed unless feminists find a miraculous way to genetically re-program men without adverse consequences for both .
Hence , any movement to superficially impose a social change of the magnitude that proposes women should be like men or , even more hopeless , that men should be like women , is predestined to backfire because such a move ignores the genetic factors involved and is driven instead by pure idealism rather than the brute reality of genetics that stand against it .
Hence , the feminist idealistic stance of trying to lower themselves to the level of men or to raise men to act , feel , and think at the female level can be likened , at least in one important aspect , to what happened with the liquor prohibition ’s Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
Many idealistic females were involved in the drive to bring about prohibition and the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment .
Idealistically driven , the female thinking was , “ If men ca n’t stop drinking , well simply pass a law to FORCE them to do so .
Well , it did n’t work !
Because it did n’t work , the Amendment finally had to be repealed .
But why was it that even a constitutional amendment could not stop men from drinking ?
Because men are so genetically wired that when they are determined to do something , they will find a way to do it , law or no law .
By the same token , men are so wired that when they are determined NOT to do something , they will find a way NOT to do it , law or no law .
For example , it made no difference that many men were “ busted ” by prohibitionist laws ; men are wired to withstand abuse and “ take it like a man ” if they have to when pushed against the wall .
The builders of feminism never consulted men universally to get their approval and cooperation on the idea of feminism .
Feminism was virtually a unilateral move by females seeking to fascistically push and impose on men something that is overwhelmingly against their will and their genetically - determined nature .
Using the same idealistic mentality that the prohibitionists did , feminists simply and casually thought , foolishly I will add , “ We ’ll fix these men .
If they wo n’t go along with our unilateral program of bringing about unqualified , total sexual equality in human society , an equality that will wipe out all sexist distinctions between men and women , we ’ll see to it that laws and regulations are passed to force it on them . ”
I keep telling you ladies , you forget the male genetic factors ; men do n’t think like you .
Because it is an issue of genetics , men have never thought like women and they never will .
The chivalry system , in spite of whatever bearable faults it had , which again I repeat , could have been improved without throwing out the whole system , was the best way for men and women to get along .
But you succeeded in giving it a bad name and successfully got rid of it in total .
As a result , men are now giving women a worst kind of hell than they ever did when chivalry was alive and well .
They have lost all the respect they had in the past for women as ladies and are showing it by different forms of sheer irrational behavior that was not as rampant then as it is now .
I repeat this because it is so crucial .
Under chivalry , women got the overwhelming male respect they not only needed but required to live most safe and secure in the midst of males , and men got the female rewards they have always thrived on .
Once feminism succeeded in throwing all this out , and against the dictates of genetics began a fight against males , seeking fascistically to impose their new social order where all sexual distinctions are forbidden , all hell broke loose .
So are you now surprised that we ’re in sexual combat ?
Again , men are so wired that they simply will not peacefully acquiesce to anything that ’s pushed on them against their will , especially by women , law or no law .
Men will inevitably defeat such a thing ; they have to ( or must ) because they are so genetically wired .
Hence , because of genetics , men as a whole , unless they are sex - whipped wimps , will never under any circumstance be willingly subjected to being dominated by women .
Again , this is not an issue of male stubbornness ; it is an issue of genetics , what is natural against what is unnatural .
So in case you did n’t already picked up on it , the bottom line conclusion on genetics is this :
It is really a war against genetics , specifically men ’s genetic code and genetic nature , which is totally unlike theirs , that feminists have declared war on and are engaged in .
In this war , feminists do n’t even show interest in a truce to find peaceful co-existence .
Instead , idealistic and not reality driven , feminists obstinately push on to soundly establish their genderless new order , come hell or high water , which they envision will be completely theirs once total societal dominance falls in their hands and all men have been wimpified .
Lot ’s of luck ladies , or whatever you are , now that chivalry is dead .
CHRISTIAN CHIVALRY AND ITS CORRUPT ABUSE
In any case , in addition to its medieval knighthood roots , it appears that the concept of chivalry up to its demise in the 1960s also had Christian , biblical roots .
However , and unfortunately , this Christian , biblical root of chivalry , while good when it ’s original stated intent was correctly understood , became open to corruption .
The openness to corruption of the Christian version of chivalry seems to have been based on a multifaceted meaning of the word “ vessel ” that is found in what the Christian - Jewish Apostle Peter wrote in 1 Peter 3:7 .
This controversial passage , as well as all of the biblical New Testament , was originally written in the Greek that was current in the geographical area and time of Christ
“ Vessel , ” the word in question , had been in the King James Bible , translated from the Greek , for centuries in 1 Peter 3:7 before a flurry of modern English Bible translations sprouted in the twentieth century seeking to improve on the old English style in which the King James version was written .
In the King James , at 1 Peter 3:7 , we find the word “ vessel ” referring to women in the following way in old English language : “ Likewise , ye husbands , dwell with [ your wives ] according to knowledge , giving honour unto the wife , as unto the weaker vessel . ”
The openness or susceptibility to corruption which the words “ a weaker vessel ” had , was the fact that many came to assume that the word “ vessel ” in reference to the female sex meant that the 1 Peter 3:7 passage was saying that a women in her entire being as the female sex ( or gender ) that she was , happened to be in some way totally inferior and totally unequal to the male sex .
Consequently , the presumed interpretation of “ vessel ” found in 1 Peter 3:7 came to mean or refer in the minds of many in Christian culture , to the entire being of a women .
In some , not all , modern English versions of the Bible where “ the weaker vessel ” is translated as “ the weaker sex , ” the susceptibility to a corrupt understanding is there because just the words “ the weaker sex ” alone clearly and immediately suggests or implies to most readers , in an unqualified way , that a woman as to her entire being or female gender is referred to .
For example , although the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible states in the margin that the literal meaning of the original Greek word translated “ sex ” is actually the word “ vessel , ” it goes on to use the word “ sex ” in the main body of its translation of the controversial passage of 1 Peter 3:7 .
Following is how this passage in the NRSV is found translated from the original Greek : “ Husbands … show consideration for your wives in your life together , paying honor to the woman as the weaker sex , since they too are also heirs of the gracious gift of life . ”
However , in the New American Standard Bible , woman as “ the weaker sex ” in the NRSV is translated instead as “ a weaker vessel , ” similar to the usage found in the King James .
To clear this apparent confusion , we need to know that the word which is translated “ sex ” in one Bible version and “ vessel ” in another is really , in the original language , the Greek word “ skeuos . ”
The Greek word “ skeuos , ” according to a standard biblical concordance , literally means “ vessel ” as its primary meaning , it does not mean “ sex . ”
However , in the Greek , there are also other ( or secondary ) usages or connotations to “ skeuos . ”
This word can also secondarily mean instrument , equipment , or apparatus .
It is for this reason that I have said that this Greek word is multifaceted .
Accordingly , here are three different ways or senses in which the word “ skeuos , ” translated as vessel , is used in the Bible .
You will notice that in each case , the words make it clear the sense in which “ vessel ” is intended to be understood :
1 . A literal vessel – Mark 11:16 ISV : “ He would n’t even let anyone carry a vessel through the temple . ”
2. Vessel as symbolic of a human being in his or her entirety to be used as an instrument for some end – Acts 9:15 AKJ : “ Go your way : for he is a chosen vessel to me , to bear my name before the Gentiles . ”
3. Vessel as symbolic of the human body – 1 Thessalonians 4:4- 5 NASB : “ Each of you [ should ] know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor , not in lustful passion , like the Gentiles who do not know God . ”
This third sense of “ vessel ” as symbolic of the human body is very pertinent for our purpose here and , accordingly , it is worth elaboration .
We begin by asking why would the Bible refer to the human body as a vessel or container ?
The answer to this has to do with how the Bible conceptualizes the make - up of human beings ( both male and female ) as being composed of three distinct entities : body , soul and spirit .
According to the Bible , the physical body is the “ vessel ” ( or container ) that holds within it the soul and the spirit .
There are some theologians who believe that the words “ soul ” and “ spirit ” refer to the same thing under two different names .
But in my work on biblical psychology , I demonstrate why this view is faulty .
The biblical view of who we are as humans is a complex one .
However , to explain this in the simplest way possible , we can basically say that , according to the Bible , the human soul is the conscious or consciously thinking person in a human being .
The soul , in other words , is the “ I ” or the “ me ” that we consciously know ourselves to be and through which the outside world gets to know us .
The spirit , on the other hand , is the seat or source of life and rational thinking ; it is the source of life both of the body and of the soul .
The spirit is also the seat or source of what we and the Bible call our moral conscience .
Sigmund Freud , who plagiarized the Jewish - Christian Apostle Paul , referred to the soul as the “ ego ” and to the biblical conscience as the “ super - ego . ”
The human spirit ’s center of power dwells in the subconscious mind .
Consequently , it is from the subconscious mind , where the spirit ’s center of power dwells , that our soul ( or conscious mind ) receives mental , moral promptings that either approve or disapprove morally whatever we think or do .
Knowing then , that “ skeuos ” as “ vessel ” can refer symbolically to the human body , it does not appear to me difficult to assume , based on this technical linguistic knowledge , that the use of the controversial phrase “ a weaker vessel ” might just have been the Apostle Peter focusing ( or placing emphasis ) on the part of the human female he had in mind as being weaker than the male .
He was not , in other words , saying that the entire being of a woman , body , soul , and spirit , was weaker than the man , only her physical or bodily constitution .
Other textual evidence clearly visible and inherent in this 1 Peter 3:7 passage as a whole serves to support this assumption .
For example , there is no question that the passage in 1 Peter 3:7 affirms a foundational life and spiritual equality between men and woman .
This is implied and made clear when it is said that women , equally as men , “ are also heirs of the gracious gift of life [ from God ] . ”
A man and a woman , in other words , are both equally bodily vessels containing a soul and a sexually - neutral spirit and this spirit ’s life within .
Also equal between them is the value and worth of the spirit life they both equally possess inwardly .
As already indicated , it is through the spirit ’s life , manifested through the conscious living soul acting on the body , that the indwelling spirit of men and women makes its presence felt and known outwardly .
Yet it is not the sexually - neutral spirit in the subconscious , but the soul in its intimate connection to and thus identification with the sexual body , that gives men and women their outwardly - expressed sexual differentiation .
In other words , body and soul , working together in close connection , coordination and intimacy , allow women and men to express outwardly their respective sexuality in the varied and distinct ways that men and women do this .
In consequence , following what has been said of the passage in 1 Peter 3:7 , no one would then be correct in assuming that this passage suggests a total inequality between men and women .
It does no such a thing .
Accordingly , as to the CONTENTS of the male and female bodily vessels , there is absolute equality between men and women .
However , the passage at 1 Peter 3:7 does affirm that , notwithstanding feminist protests to the contrary , God and the Bible view the female body ( or bodily vessel ) next to that of the male as , relatively speaking , the physically weaker , more feeble and delicate of the two .
Since there have always been exceptions to general rules , this passage out of 1 Peter 3:7 must therefore be interpreted in the sense of what is generally true between men and women .
Men generally , I repeat , generally , tend to be physically sturdier , tougher and stronger than women and can thus endure a greater degree of physical exertion and abuse , as opposed ( again , generally ) to the more delicate , softer and feebler nature of a woman ’s body .
The passage in 1 Peter 3:7 actually embodies an admonition given to Christian husbands on how they ought to treat their believing wives .
It simply says that because of their weaker physical or bodily constitution , Christian husbands should treat their believing wives with delicate care , respect and honor .
In the development and history of Christian culture , this principle of deferential honor to be given to Christian wives for the actual limited reason stated , which was made morally obligatory on Christian males through a biblical command , became immediately applicable to all females generally in Christian culture .
This , briefly , became the Christian , biblical - based version of medieval knighthood gallantry or chivalry .
Nevertheless , the misunderstanding of this passage in 1 Peter 3:7 , eventually became at least partly responsible for a huge controversy that developed between men and women ; it was a controversy that feminists turned into a huge tempest that is still ongoing .
It is a tempest that never had the factual basis it was presumed to have and was the result of a gross misunderstanding of the biblical text .
Furthermore , the problem of this whole issue of “ weakness ” in women that turned into the full - blown controversy that feminism instigated became a problem only after men in power misunderstood , and thus through misunderstanding , corrupted the actual intended meaning of 1 Peter 3:7 , as if the passage had said that women in their entire being of body , soul and spirit were weaker ( or inferior ) to that of men , which , as we have seen , is not necessarily true of this passage .
In any case , once the actual , intended meaning of 1 Peter 3:7 was corrupted , the sincere and harmless respectful honor that the biblical concept originally admonished Christian husbands should direct to their believing wives as the weaker ( bodily ) vessel , was eventually transformed within a bastardized and nominal Christian culture into a subtle form of oppression against women generally .
In an insulting way , women as to their entire being were being degraded and “ put - down ” simply because they were females .
Men exercising power in a male dominated society , who never really had a genuinely vibrant Christian faith , or the love of God , or a genuine Christian respect for women in their hearts , transformed the Christian , biblical version of chivalry , against the actual intent of 1 Peter 3:7 , into an instrument of subtle abuse that was detrimental rather than enriching to a woman ’s life .
We should know that all human beings ( unless they happen to be atheist psychopaths with a dead conscience ) , whether they are religious or not , or regardless of what religion they profess , cannot claim to be continually consistent in living up to the moral ideals which their religion or personal moral views espouses .
As a Christian , I definitely know this applies to me .
If it were not because I rely on the compassion and forbearance of God as much as I do , I would become a dysfunctional mess continually beating up on myself because of all my moral lapses , the number of which is beyond remembrance and overwhelming .
Religious hypocrites , on the other hand , are people who pretend they are super - holy , as if they can do no wrong .
These religious misfits totally overlook and disregard that the Bible itself has affirmed that “ there is not one just man upon the earth who continually does good and never sins ” ( Ecclesiastes 7:20 ) .
All this is simply to say that not all who call or have called themselves Christian in present or past Christian culture , are or have been entirely consistent in living up to Christian ideals .
Either that , or they are Christian by name only and not by inherent substance .
In a Western culture that had largely lost its genuine Christian religious fervor due to the successes of secularizing forces , with only an empty shell or façade of Christianity remaining , male perversity emerged by default within that culture to do its dirty work of transforming a good thing , based on Christian religious faith , into a grotesque social and secular corruption .
In the case of the Christian , biblical version of chivalry , based on the biblical mandate in 1 Peter 3:7 discussed above , this mandate intended as a deferential honor to be extended to women in view of their bodily constitution , was perversely corrupted and transformed as an instrument to “ put down ” women as to their whole being in a most insulting way .
Under this corruption of 1 Peter 3:7 , women were looked upon as being entirely inferior to men as a “ weaker sex ” or human being in the totality that this entails .
To repeat here what Lasch observed , he briefly described this subtle corruption as follows , “ The [ now extinct , post - feminism ] tradition of gallantry [ or chivalry ] formerly masked and to some degree mitigated the organized oppression of women [ I would now add , ‘ by those who perversely had transformed an already corrupted form of Christian chivalry into a virtual social secular institution ’ ] . ”
Feminists saw this end result of the corrupt degeneration of the sincere and harmless Christian version of chivalry into a means of subtle female abuse and jumped on it as the “ cause célèbre ” ( or grand issue ) they would attack .
They then went on to make their attack an unceasing , all - consuming , obsessive and self - defining identity .
However , carried to extremes , the presently ongoing , modern sexual combat that feminism instigated between men and women eventually resulted in highly adverse consequences for both women and men .
As we have seen and shall further see , the results have been a significant , currently ongoing painful loss for both .
Feminism in the beginning represented a struggle among liberal - minded women to stop the social put - down of women so as to gain equal rights next men in such areas as politics , education and employment .
However , the movement , at least in some quarters , eventually went beyond a struggle to gain equal rights next to men ; it became a movement as well to obliterate all sexual distinctions between men and women .
It was at this point that the ideology of “ sexism ” so - called arose as an effort to shame men who would dare to imply or suggest that the female sex was different in any way than that of males .
Traditionally in the past , the preponderance of women consistently wore dresses , not pants .
This is the same tradition that architects still rely on in public buildings to visually differentiate on bathroom doors which is the men ’s room and which is the women ’s room .
However , in their effort to affirm their imagined brand of equality next to men , feminists began to dress , talk and act like men and to lead all other females to do the same .
As a result , we now see the reverse of the old tradition of female attire with a preponderance of women wearing pants rather than dresses or skirts .
Originally , this turn - about began as an effort on the part of women to improve their chances of competing well against men in the workplace .
In those early times when feminism was on the march to success , one could see many professional women dressing up for their office jobs in attire that closely resembled that of a man ’s business suit .
But it turned out that this was a “ two - edged sword , ” for in seeking to dress , talk and act like men to better compete against them , women were in fact ironically , unwittingly and unconsciously playing up to the idea of male supremacy by making themselves appear as aspiring male wanna - be’s .
In any case , it remains true that once feminists went on the attack against a corrupted chivalry and largely succeeded , along with the impetus and assistance given to feminists in their struggle by the success of democracy and the end of feudalism beginning in the eighteenth century , all this made chivalry or gallantry toward women in any form , Christian version or other , a doomed tradition in secular society .
Accordingly , the gallant tradition of chivalry became socially extinct thanks to the triumph of feminism .
Now , in the ongoing , raging sexual combat between men and women , the preponderance of women , young and old , look at and judge all male action , sincere or not , through the paranoid , biased prism of feminism .
While a corrupted form of Christian gallantry became an obstacle that ideological feminism successfully overthrew , in the train of this success came , as we shall see below , other forms of abuse of females proving that , in the words of historian Lasch , “ the male sex [ I assume he does not mean every single male ] at no time [ has ] ceased to regard most women as fair game . ”
Apart from some countervailing and revolutionary “ spiritual ” transformation that will make them more sensitive to a woman ’s needs , men are hopelessly and irremediably men , that is , totally unlike women in sexual and emotional attitudes because of the way they were genetically wired at Creation .
Which is simply and only to say that the quixotic quest of feminism to “ fix ” men by forcing them , through laws or through public shame heaped on them , to think and feel like women is hopelessly doomed .
Again I say that , apart from some countervailing and revolutionary “ spiritual ” transformation , men will never , ever change and become like women in any meaningful way under any circumstance .
This is true because such a thing is totally against their inherited genetic nature .
Consequently , just the thought of this alone is detestable to men generally .
At least in the chivalrous respect and honor that men in pre-feminist times felt as a duty they owed women , any gross physical abuse of women that we see rampant today was socially inhibited because the male perpetrators would be shamed and socially ostracized if they failed to observe the respect that society insisted men owed to women .
Again , we listen to how Lasch expresses this :
“ [ The ] polite conventions [ or traditions of gallantry or chivalry toward women ] , even though they were no more than a façade , provided women with ideological leverage in their struggle to domesticate the wildness and savagery of men .
They surrounded essentially exploitative relationships with a network of reciprocal obligations , which if nothing else made exploitation easier to bear . ”
With the triumph of feminism , all this was transformed and moved on into ancient history , the likes of which has never been seen again .
Have women won as a result of this ?
I greatly question the accuracy of a positive answer to this question .
Decent men love and crave exceedingly being a hero in women ’s eyes .
Chivalry gave them a pathway to achieve this .
Decent men loved this because chivalry during its time was a voluntary behavior they could creatively work at to achieve and then feel deep satisfaction and a woman ’s gratitude as a reward for succeeding .
However , with the triumph of feminism , this creative and voluntary pathway to the benefit of women was effectively overthrown and shut for men .
So now women are reaping abuse by default , again , it ’s a simple matter of male genetics .
You who were not around in the last two decades before the 60s feminist hurricane hit and destroyed society , if you want to get an idea of what men- women relations were immediately prior to the 60s when feminism struck and scrambled everything , see if you can find and view old re-runs of such TV shows as Father Knows Best , Leave it to Beaver , or Mayberry RFD .
I ’m sure you will agree that the male leading actors here would not be men you could classify as feminist - wimpified males like many today who are running around saying , “ Oh !
We gotta do what the women tell us , otherwise we get no warm nookie ! ”
Just remember that these old TV shows were the ideals that equally both men and women of pre-feminist times held up as models of healthy men-women relations .
They were not , in other words , an exact replica of real life in every detail and for every family unit of the time , but they will at least give any viewer an adequate representation of what was the ideal that men and women equally nurtured and looked up to in those days now extinct .
Then compare this chivalric ideal with a TV show like Roseanne after Betty had already radicalized women and feminism had successfully impacted and transformed the entertainment industry .
I ’m sure that this comparison of old TV shows will reveal to you how stark the change was after feminism destroyed chivalry .
For example , the feminist Roseanne is the dominant character in the TV show whereas Arnold , her husband , is what has become the classic feminist - wimpified male : “ Oh !
We gotta do what the women tell us , otherwise we get no warm nookie ! ”
It is easy to conceive how the dominating feminist Roseanne could get into black leather boots , pants and jacket with a whit to whip a naked Arnold chained to the love bed .
On the other hand , there ’s no way you could easily conceive Margaret of “ Father Knows Best ” as wearing anything other than her very feminine dresses .
Forget it !
You may as well conceive of pigs sprouting wings and flying if you ’re going to think that .
It is good that feminism put a stop to a corrupted form of chivalry .
But seeing that it was not chivalry that was causing the problem , but a corrupted form of it , such a thing could therefore not be accurately called chivalry .
At least historic , Christian biblical chivalry , based on 1 Peter 3:7 , was never in principle ( or as intended ) an instrument of social abuse against women .
It was inculcated instead as an essential and vital need women required to be most safe and secure among males , again , because of a male ’s genetically - determined nature , which if not properly socialized , controlled , and / or civilized can , unlike the nature of a woman generally , be naturally very lustful , narcissistic and hurtfully brutish .
Now , with feminism under control of social norms between men and women , men are being confronted with a female ideology that indiscriminately considers all men jerks and demands them to perform female dictated behavior .
Hence , voluntary chivalry is no longer in vogue ; women despise it .
This is understandable when one considers that the corruption of genuine chivalry gave chivalry in any form a disgusting meaning to women .
But , in any case , as a result of feminist - dictated behavior that is being fascistically demanded of males , a feminist - instigated battle rages on where men refuse to be so demeaned as to cave in to what they see in feminist ideology as arrogant , chauvinistic and high - handed demands .
Moreover , in a new simmering and intensifying male rage , men offer nothing but creative passive resistance to feminist ideological demands at every point , and even new kinds of gross abuse against women ; this is abuse the likes of which did not exist prior to the triumph of feminism as grossly and as rampant as it does now .
Consequently , after the success of feminism , the biblical admonition to Christian men to honor their wives as the weaker vessel is now , on the basis of modern - day feminist and secular thinking , a sexist anachronism .
But this raises the question as to whether it took ideological feminism to reveal that the Bible and the biblical God have been “ sexist ” all along .
Well yes , the Bible and the biblical God are and have been “ sexist ” all along , that is , if we are disposed to believe that feminist ideology has the status of absolute moral truth .
But the whole world has known about what the Bible has been saying all along .
For thousands of years , before anyone even knew that such an ideological invention as feminism had come into existence , the Bible had been saying and affirming that men and women are different .
They are different in mode of creation , in inherent biological design , and in God-ordained roles .
But is n’t sexism morally wrong under any circumstance , feminism or not ?
Actually , this depends on whether the feminist ideology behind sexism represents or embodies an absolute moral commandment like “ Thou shall not murder ” as well as who has the last word determining what is an absolute moral truth .
If there is no absolute God or absolute moral authority to determine this , then no human being can determine such a thing absolutely for the simple reason that humans are relative ( as opposed to absolute ) beings .
In other words , apart from the force of human - made laws or the use of brute , irrational force to compulsorily or fascistically establish what is right or wrong , there is not a single human being or group of humans , females or males , who can claim moral absoluteness or absolute authority to justifiably dictate to other fellow - humans what is absolutely morally right or morally wrong .
My assertion at this point is that the biblical Creator - God is an absolute God whose existence ( 1 ) has been made empirically known through the documented history of the Jews , ( 2 ) through the Jews ’ testimony as empirical eyewitnesses to the presence , reality and works of this God , and ( 3 ) through the Jews ’ indestructible endurance as a people and nation from the beginning of human history which testify that what they have been saying through their recorded history has been true all along .
For those who care to look it up , in another page of this site , I have written more at length on this topic of the Jews as empirical proof of the biblical God ’s existence ( see https://enewschannels.com/2009/06/16/enc7545_110938.php).
Hence , given that there is such an absolute God , attested to by the documented history of the Jews , and given that the founders of feminist ideology never consulted with this God as to the moral standing of their philosophy , and that this God actually created a humanity that is inherently and innately sexually discriminating between males and females , which alone , under ungodly feminist standards , makes this God and his human creation inherently and ideologically sexist and thus anti-feminist , then the answer to the question , “ Is n’t sexism morally wrong under any circumstance ? ” is no ; sexism is NOT morally wrong under any circumstance .
To elaborate on these assertions about God , feminism , and sexism , we must first consider one cardinal aspect concerning the nature of the biblical God as he is portrayed in the Bible .
I am referring to the fact that the Bible views this God as being an “ absolute autocrat . ”
DEMOCRACY , AUTOCRACY AND THE ABSOLUTE BIBLICAL GOD
So what ’s an “ absolute autocrat ” ?
In political science , the word “ autocrat ” by itself simply means an absolute ruler or monarch who can do or will as he pleases and get away with it .
In modern political parlance , until they are removed from power , dictators like Venezuela ’s Hugo Chavez and tyrants and despots like the North Korean ruler , Kim Jong-il , are classified as autocrats and their rule or reign is referred to as an “ autocracy . ”
That the biblical God is portrayed as a God possessing an enduring , absolute and autocratic sovereignty is made clear by the following passages drawn from the Bible :
Daniel 4:34-35 NRSV : “ For his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty , and his kingdom endures from generation to generation .
All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing , and he does what he wills with the host of heaven and the inhabitants of earth .
There is no one who can stay his hand or say to him [ prevailingly ] , ‘ What are you doing ? ' ”
Job 9:12 NRSV : “ He snatches away ; who can stop him ?
Who will say to him , ‘ What are you doing ? ' ”
Romans 9:19 - 20 NRSV : “ For who can resist his will ?
But who indeed are you , a human being , to argue with God ?
Will what is molded say [ prevailingly ] to the one who molds it , ‘ Why have you made me like this ? ' ”
We who enjoy a democracy in government are very happy about it , at least in the sense that , in such a political arrangement , we do not have a minority or one person dictating to the whole country what ’s acceptable and what ’s not .
As an independent - minded people , we would therefore understandably despise an autocrat to run our government .
For this same reason , it is also understandable that we may find it difficult to accommodate ourselves to the thought of even a God who autocratically commands and tells us under the threat of adverse consequences what ’s right or wrong .
Nevertheless , the fact remains that , according to the Bible , the rule of the biblical God is not a democracy ; it is an autocracy .
However , unlike human autocrats who do not create the living beings and the physical realms they unjustly rule by force and / or political corruption , in the case of the biblical God , the Bible claims that this God rules justly as an autocrat over the infinite universe of all living and non-living realities .
According to the Bible , what makes the autocratic , universal rule of the biblical God a just ( as opposed to an unjust ) autocracy is that ultimately , all that exists and has being owe their being and existence to this biblical God who originally created everything that exists from ( or out of ) nothing , “ ex nihilo , ” as the theologians call it .
The logic here is one analogous to that of an independent potter who designs , fashions , creates and owns in an absolute way whatever clay vessels this potter designs and creates .
Being the absolute owner of the clay , this potter will design and create clay vessels according to whatever he or she sees fit for each clay vessel created .
Finally , this potter as owner of the clay will then have the unquestioned authority and / or power , by virtue of independent and absolute ownership of his or her creations , to treat , conserve or destroy , as the potter sees fit , any or all of the vessels the potter created .
In other words , if you totally , independently and lawfully own something you create , like a paper - doll for example , you have the perfect right and authority as sole owner of your creation to design , treat or use your creation as you perfectly see fit .
Atheists of course , who both bristle at any assertion of a god who may exist and , worst yet , of a god who rules autocratically , think they have found a sure - fire , rationally undefeatable way to get around our defining assertion about the biblical God .
Finding unacceptable any assertion of an existing biblical God who is also autocratic , they think they can “ pull the rug ” from under this idea by simply declaring , as the typical “ know - it - all ” simpletons that they are , that there is no such god , much less an absolute , autocratic one .
Furthermore , in arrogant hubris , such atheists fancy themselves as heroes of humankind , thinking that by asserting what they do , they will be loved and welcome as “ liberators ” of humanity from a burden of guilt over a fictional biblical God who autocratically demands moral performance .
But what about the universe in its infinity ( or unending reaches ) as evidence that there is such a biblical Creator - God who was behind astronomy ’s “ Big Bang ” ?
Well , the atheists have an answer for this .
They seek to instruct us on how we should accept that the material universe , notwithstanding all its mysteries , is merely a huge mass of physical reality that is no more special in nature than any other physical reality we know , such as trees , chairs and tables that we see every day without thinking there is a god behind them .
But it is exactly here that simpleton , know - it - all , shallow atheists make their most crucial error .
These atheists , in other words , desire us simply to take for granted the highly complex , colossal , mysterious and immense fact of the visible , infinite universe of living and non-living phenomena .
I know that some atheists will answer and say , “ We do no such thing ; we do not take the universe for granted ; we marvel at such a wonder - filled universe . ”
But that ’s not the point .
The point is that while atheists can easily dismiss the entire infinite universe of living and non-living realities as mere “ physical stuff , ” they cannot explain why such a highly complex , colossal , mathematical , mysterious and immense universe , of which , by the way , we humans are an integral part , exists in the first place .
In other words , why do we or anything else exists at all ?
Why not nothing , including us humans ?
These are questions an atheist cannot answer with any satisfying rationale .
It is in this sense that atheists take the mysterious existence of the universe ( including us humans ) for granted .
But the universe , in the meantime , refuses to be taken for granted .
Everywhere our eyes turn to see , this universe , as it were , shouts and screams at us , “ Look !
I ’m here .
Explain why I ’m here . ”
Moreover , it is this same universe that brought us into existence from the chemical stuff that is found in the dust of the earth .
It is also this same universe that brings hardship , pain , disease and old age to our lives and bodies .
Finally , it is this same universe that brings about the end of our earthly existence when we again , whether we like it or protest , shall return to the dust of the earth from whence we came .
Yes , indeed , the universe will thus not allow us to take it for granted .
Not only is the biblical God autocratic , but reflecting the nature of its Creator who uses it as a tool to accomplish his ends in space and time , God ’s created universe is itself most autocratic , painfully forcing its power upon us whether we like it or not in a host of ways , and there ’s not a damn thing anyone can do to stop it , just like with God its autocratic creator .
All of this is what goes into the universe screaming at us , “ Look !
I ’m here .
Explain why I ’m here in the way that I am , in what I ’m doing to you , and in what empirical science has told you I say about my nature .
Explain why I ’m here instead of nothing , including you .
Explain why you were born to see , experience and hear all that you do about me ?
Or are you just a meaningless accident resulting from a brief moment of parental pleasure ?
Is that all you are …a freaky accident , really ? ”
Nor is it true , as an answer to these troubling human dilemmas , that the biblical God has left the human race devoid of any tangible , empirical proof of his existence .
I have already referred to the Jews .
They are the empirical proof .
I have already said that the Jews are the empirical , live evidence that denies the thought that the biblical God has left us without empirical proof of his existence .
It is on the basis of this Jewish evidence that I assert not only the existence of the biblical God but also his autocratic rule with the absolute power and authority that goes with this .
Anyone , after all , who has all - prevailing power also rules correspondingly and has the authority to do so for the same reason .
I thus assert that the authority and power that the biblical God has is that of an autocratic or absolute ruler who in designing the human race as he did , such a design cannot be messed with without adverse consequences .
I say this analogous in the sense in which some human designs cannot be messed with without painful and unhappy consequences .
For example , happiness is not the result when you stick your fingers inside a running garbage disposer or put leaded gasoline in an automobile where unleaded gas is called for .
These machines were not designed and created by humans to safely allow for such things to be done .
Likewise , humans were created and designed to work happily and well only according to the nature the biblical God gave their design .
Accordingly , adverse consequences can be expected if one tampers with the design the biblical God desi
