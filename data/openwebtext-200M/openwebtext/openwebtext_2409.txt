Not only does Saturn have a mysterious hexagonal shape etched into the bands of cloud above its north pole , it also has a unique magnetic structure .
This is suggested by recent results recorded by the NASA Cassini probe that passed over the pole to see a huge active auroral region , much larger and more dynamic than expected .
Interestingly , the NASA press release has not linked the strange aurora with the long - lived hexagonal shape in the gas giant ’s atmosphere .
Could the hexagon be formed by a unique magnetic structure above Saturn ?
Or could both phenomena be connected in some other way ?
Tom Stallard , a scientist working with Cassini data at the University of Leicester , describes the new Cassini infrared observations above the north pole of Saturn :
“ We ’ve never seen an aurora like this elsewhere .
It ’s not just a ring of auroras like those we ’ve seen at Jupiter or Earth .
This aurora covers an enormous area across the pole .
Our current ideas on what forms Saturn ’s aurora predict that this region should be empty , so finding such a bright aurora here is a fantastic surprise . ”
– Tom Stallard , NASA press release
So , it would appear we have another piece in the puzzle that is Saturn ’s north pole .
Recently , Cassini returned high resolution images of the magnificent pattern etched into the clouds around the pole .
The ( almost ) perfect hexagon has been observed since 1980 when the Voyager 1 probe journeyed past the planet , and the same pattern exists 28 years later .
So , we are dealing with a long - lived , stable pattern , that remains unaltered even when vast and powerful cyclones buffet its hexagonal boundary .
Last month I investigated what could be causing the pattern , and the only explanation I had was the possibility of some kind of standing wave ( a Rossby - like process ) .
As the atmosphere of Saturn is more dense than the Earth ’s , perhaps a global wave could endure for decades , possibly longer .
However , over at the Universe Today , some readers commented that a pattern like this had been seen before during Danish experiments on spinning fluids .
Occasionally a fluid being spun inside a smooth - sided beaker will spontaneously snap into a geometric formation .
An explanation for this fluid behaviour has , so far , not been found .
So we already have two possibly explanations for the near - perfect hexagon in Saturn ’s atmosphere , one that dominates weather processes here on Earth ( Rossby waves ) and one that has been observed in the dynamics of spinning fluids in the laboratory .
Now there is another , attractive possibility .
Aurorae are generated when charged solar wind particles interact with the magnetospheres of planets .
Ions are channelled to the polar regions where the magnetic field feeds down into the planet ’s atmosphere .
As the energetic ions interact with the atmospheric gases , light is generated .
Depending on the density of the atmospheric elements , light will be emitted when the gases are excited through particle collisions .
For example , in the Earth ’s atmosphere green and red light in optical wavelengths can be observed when molecular oxygen is excited .
It is unclear what component of Saturn ’s atmosphere is glowing in the infrared part of the spectrum , but the interesting thing is that the auroral oval appears to be located directly above the atmospheric hexagonal shape .
The auroral oval above Earth ’s poles sketch the location of the point at which magnetosheath plasma ( i.e. the outer “ edge ” of the magnetosphere ) can access the Earth ’s upper atmosphere ( the ionosphere ) .
This is basically where energetic particles ( originally from the solar wind ) trapped inside the layers of the Earth ’s magnetic field are “ funnelled ” downward via the “ polar cusp ” , so auroral interactions can occur ( refer to the diagram above ) .
A similar magnetic configuration is assumed for Saturn .
It seems that scientists working with the Cassini data are surprised by the size of Saturn ’s auroral oval , suggesting we do not fully understand the configuration of Saturn ’s magnetosphere .
The infrared auroral oval is the point at which Saturn ’s own polar cusp is located , magnetic fieldlines feeding into Saturn ’s atmosphere , blasting solar wind ions into Saturn ’s atmospheric gases .
Could there be a connection between solar wind processes and the enduring “ Saturn hexagon ” ?
This does n’t really explain why it should be hexagonal in shape , but the coincidence of the mystery auroral oval located directly over the mystery hexagon is too stark to ignore .
NASA details about the aurora image ( top ) :
This image of the northern polar region of Saturn shows both the aurora and underlying atmosphere , seen at two different wavelengths of infrared light as captured by NASA ’s Cassini spacecraft .
Energetic particles , crashing into the upper atmosphere cause the aurora , shown in blue , to glow brightly at 4 microns ( six times the wavelength visible to the human eye ) .
The image shows both a bright ring , as seen from Earth , as well as an example of bright auroral emission within the polar cap that had been undetected until the advent of Cassini .
This aurora , which defies past predictions of what was expected , has been observed to grow even brighter than is shown here .
Silhouetted by the glow ( cast here to the color red ) of the hot interior of Saturn ( clearly seen at a wavelength of 5 microns , or seven times the wavelength visible to the human eye ) are the clouds and haze that underlie this auroral region .
For a similar view of the region beneath the aurora see http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09185 .
This image is a composite captured with Cassini ’s visual and infrared mapping spectrometer .
The aurora image was taken in the near - infrared on Nov. 10 , 2006 , from a distance of 1,061,000 kilometers ( 659,000 miles ) , with a phase angle of 157 degrees and a sub- spacecraft planetocentric latitude of 52 degrees north .
The image of the clouds was obtained by Cassini on June 15 , 2008 , from a distance of 602,000 kilometers ( 374,000 miles ) and a sub- spacecraft planetocentric latitude of 73 degrees north .

If you have n't already listened to it , do listen to the LRC podcast where Lew Rockwell interviews Peter Schiff .
As usual with Peter Schiff , he provides a lot of valuable insight , but what I actually found most interesting is how he reveals that with the bailout package , it is economically rational to stop paying off your mortgage .
Because if you do , your lender will sell the mortgage to the government who under the package must do everything they can to prevent foreclosure , which will mean that they will have to offer you a sweeter deal .
So when Rockwell asked Schiff what an ordinary person can do to save themselves in the ongoing economic meltdown Schiff replied that the most obvious and best thing to do is stop paying your mortgage .
I spontaneously laughed when I heard that as I figured he was only ridiculing the irrationality of the bailout plan .
But maybe Schiff is right , maybe it would be rational ( at least for some people ) to stop paying your mortgage with this bailout plan .
Can anyone find any reason why Schiff is wrong on that ?
OURS is notoriously a wet country , and the climate change projections say that it will get wetter .
But at the same time , our capital city is running out of water .
A report by engineers for consideration by the Dublin City Council forecasts shortages by 2011 , and permanent rationing by 2016 .
By 2031 , the population of the capital will have risen , according to authoritative predictions , by half a million .
And right now the city has no spare capacity for the existing population .
In any other European country , the situation would be regarded as critical .
In Dublin , it became the subject of pub humour when the idea of tapping the Shannon was mooted .
Meanwhile , environmentalists and local politicians joined in with predictable protests .
There was some talk , intriguing in its way , of refusing to share " our water " .
The engineers ' report should encourage more serious discussion -- and help to bring rapid action .
It sets out a number of proposals , among them a revival of the Shannon option , which , on this reading , appears both feasible and attractive .
It says that water pumped from the Shannon could be stored in a 300 - acre reservoir created from a bog in Westmeath .
This would have no impact on power generation or navigation .
On the contrary , the artificial lake would provide a tourist attraction , a new venue for water sports .
More to the point , it would save Dublin from dying of thirst .
And it would cost only € 100 m -- if we can believe the estimated cost of any project .
It will be the American people who will choose their country ’s next president tomorrow , and not an English gent who can tell the time from Big Ben by looking out of his office window .
Yet John Micklethwait has an exceptional grasp of American politics and his views are all the more important because he edits The Economist , one of the most influential titles in the US .
On Friday , The Economist endorsed Barack Obama .
“ It ’s time , ” runs the leader in the current edition of the magazine that still likes to be known as a “ newspaper ” .
“ America should take a chance and make Obama the next leader of the free world . ”
The decision to support the Illinois senator was taken at last Monday ’s editorial meeting .
That meeting followed a conference call between Micklethwait and 15 members of his US based staff , working in offices in San Francisco , Los Angeles , Chicago , New York , Washington DC and Texas .
And it seems that John McCain ’s selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate became the deciding factor in the decision .
When Micklethwait visited America for the conventions , The Economist was still running a cover demanding “ Bring Back The Real McCain ” , an acknowledgement of the Arizona senator ’s links to western Republican traditions and individual freedoms .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Such views play well with a publication set up by a Scottish hat maker in 1843 with a promise that “ free - trade principles will be most rigidly applied to all the important questions of the day ” .
But Micklethwait observes gravely that “ it ’s safe to say that picking Palin was not a move in our direction ” .
Micklethwait , 46 , was in the US at the weekend to partake in The Economist ’s first New York - based festival , moderating a debate yesterday on “ The Future of Brand America ” at Gotham Hall on Broadway .
One nagging issue over Micklethwait ’s apparent enthusiasm for Obama is that he , along with fellow Economist journalist Adrian Wooldridge , is the author of The Right Nation , a book that brilliantly identified the innate conservatism in America and called the 2004 election for the Republicans when most commentators believed George W Bush was history .
Micklethwait , then USeditor of The Economist , became an in - demand pundit .
Has he now changed his theory ?
“ The thesis of the book was that America is a ‘ right nation ’ in two ways .
One , that it was more conservative than other countries .
We would stick with that , come what may .
If you took David Cameron and Hillary Clinton and lined them up on issue after issue , on each one Hillary would be further to the right than Cameron ; from the size of the state , to crime , to interventionism abroad , and religiosity .
You could go through the whole list . ”
But on the other part of the thesis he equivocates .
“ The idea that is open to question is where we said America was a fundamentally conservative country where Republicans had an edge .
I think our response to that would be that Republicans have roadtested that theory to destruction .
To be as incompetent and as sleazy as they have been has made it very difficult for any inbuilt advantages they might have in the system to survive . ”
It is clear that he has some reservations about Obama , questioning whether he is capable of standing up to a strong Democratic Congress on protectionism and tax hikes , and being uncomfortable with the senator ’s championing of public service in his Denver convention speech .
“ Bits of that picture are very attractive , but it could also carry the message that you think that people working in business are somehow second rate . ”
Although The Economist championed Ronald Reagan and also backed George Bush senior in the 2000 election , it supported Democrat John Kerry in 2004 , on the grounds that he was merely “ incoherent ” , rather than “ incompetent ” like his opponent , George W Bush .
It is primarily a business journal , but has a broad readership .
While most print - led media organisations are contracting , The Economist has continued to buck the trend and grow , with a latest circulation of 1,337,184 ( up 6.1 per cent year - on - year ) .
Micklethwait argues that the title benefits not just from globalisation , which it emphatically endorses , but from a trend that is benefiting other upmarket offerings .
“ There ’s a broader phenomenon , ” he says .
“ There are quite a lot of clever products that are doing well .
The New Yorker is doing well , Atlantic Monthly is doing well . ”
He discussed the success of the British periodical Prospect at a recent lunch with his old friend Toby Young , author of How to Lose Friends and Alienate People , who has , it seems , not alienated the genial Micklethwait .

Those who value The Economist ’s ability to be “ a cipher , a discriminator ” may also be drawn towards popular culture Micklethwait has discovered with surprise .
Among magazines most likely to be purchased at American airports along with The Economist is the celebrity gossip title US Weekly .
He cites an acquaintance who “ was going to watch Millwall and then watch The Lives of Others ” , which is not something Micklethwait ( Ampleforth and Magdalen College , Oxford ) would have done when he was a young man .
“ You were either a clever person who dressed in black , went to watch The Lives of Others and visited art museums , or else you were n’t .
Now people are switching backwards and forwards and we are a part of that . ”
The credit crunch acts as a circulation driver for The Economist and Micklethwait says he is unaware that advertising revenues have dropped off “ in any meaningful way ” .
He claims not to be irked that BBC business editor Robert Peston has enjoyed a higher public profile than his specialist magazine during the financial meltdown .
“ It depends what you want your impact to be , ” he sniffs .
“ He ’s a good journalist , Peston .
It ’s a different thing , he ’s trying to explain things to one group of people and does it very well .
The other obvious point is he ’s British and not immediately known outside these isles .
I ’m not trying to disparage him at all . ”
The US website Gawker lampooned The Economist for its doom - mongering covers .
“ We tend to defend capitalism , but some people think we are much too pessimistic , ” says Micklethwait .
As for Gordon Brown , he praises him in one breath and then criticises him in the next .
“ Brown deserves credit for coming up with the best plan in what one hopes is the final moment of doom .
The idea of the guarantee I think was very , very clever , albeit borrowed from the Swedes , ” he says .
“ What he does n’t deserve credit for is all the dithering beforehand . ”
It is wrong , he says , to portray the crunch as a global issue in the face of which the Government was helpless .
“ It ’s not totally a global thing .
It has been exacerbated by things which happened here .
Britain is more vulnerable than other economies partly for reasons Brown has been complicit in . ”
Micklethwait admits his own theory on the robust nature of the American right might have to be revised a little .
The Prime Minister , too , must be realistic .
“ What is transparently wrong is to claim the credit on the up and then deny it on the down . ”
I could hardly believe it when a few weeks later I first heard about the preliminary results from the JUPITER trial .
They had chosen patients with normal levels of cholesterol but with elevated levels of C - reactive protein ( CRP ) to study the effect of Crestor® .
Predictably those with elevated levels of CRP got the best response to the statin .
The test , which can cost $ 20 to $ 50 , measures inflammation .
There is now little doubt that people with high CRP are at higher risk for heart attack , regardless of cholesterol levels .
A reasonable interpretation of the data tells me that cholesterol is not the CV risk marker we once thought .
C- reactive protein comes very close to being the best available marker for CV risk .
Those at risk based on elevated CRP levels should be treated with an appropriate dose of statin or other anti-inflammatory agent .
Physicians have been blindly dosing statins at cholesterol reducing doses when all the time it appears the dose should be based on inflammatory response .
Why use 80 mg of a statin for example with its established potential for glial cell inhibition and mevalonate blockade when much lower anti-inflammatory doses are all that is needed .
Naturally the statin lobby would prefer to treat both cholesterol and CRP elevations .
In so doing they are denying the tens of thousands of statin disabled victims as well as the underlying biochemistry in their priority to maximize profits .
The issue here is side effects .
We had to wait until 2002 for Frank Pfrieger to announce to the world the special importance to the human brain of cholesterol .
The thousands of cases of amnesia , confusion , forgetfulness , disorientation and dementia associated with statin use are because of the effect of statins to inhibit glial cell cholesterol synthesis .
The higher the statin dose , the greater the glial cell inhibition .
Shortly after this reality ( which incidentally , the drug companies failed to warn us about ) we learned that in their capacity as reductase inhibitors these statins blocked the vital mevalonate pathway in each of our cells , the pathway that synthesizes not only cholesterol but also CoQ10 , dolichols , selenoproteins , Rho and normal phosphorylation .
To block the mevalonate pathway sufficiently to inhibit cholesterol synthesis means that inevitably you are reducing bioavailability of these other vital biochemicals as well .
It was Shovman who told us in 2002 about the powerful anti-inflammatory effect of statins and Hilgendorph , who suggested in 2003 such effect was obtained at doses far lower than those required for cholesterol reduction .
The pursuit of cholesterol reduction has been misguided from the very beginning .
It is perhaps our most essential biochemical , intimately involved in every aspect of our lives .
The JUPITER data has served to guide treatment along its proper path .

This is a continuation on part one , which was a very basic introduction to functional programming .
In this portion I ’m pointing out some aspects of Haskell which I find to be fairly kick - ass . 🙂
My apologies if 80 - 90 % of this post is gibberish to you .
I try to be clear , but I ’m also trying not to spend a copious amount of time writing this post .
Think of it as a rather detailed “ best things about Haskell ” list , rather than anything remotely like a tutorial , or something that otherwise gives you an actual decent understanding of Haskell as a language .
The idea is to try to whet your appetite to investigate further .
Death to Parentheses
Well , the first thing that impressed me is going to be small hat to folks whose primary experience with functional programming is with languages other than Lisp or Scheme , or to folks who have no FP experience at all ; but Lisp is notorious for its excessive use of parentheses .
Every function call gets its own pair , and since invoking functions is a frequent occurrence in functional programming , you get quite a lot of them .
Even better , when you ’re done with all your nested function calls , you ’re left to figure out how to place the dozen or so closing parentheses .
Here ’s an example of the crappy powers function from part one of this miniseries , in Lisp :
( defun powers ( i v ) ( if ( = i 8 ) ( ) ( cons v ( powers (+ i 1 ) (* v 2 ) ) ) ) ) 1 2 3 4 5 ( defun powers ( i v ) ( if ( = i 8 & # x29 ; ( ) ( cons v ( powers ( + i 1 ) ( * v 2 ) ) ) ) )
For this example , it ’s not too terrible ; but it ’s a simple function , and already we end up with five successive closing parentheses at the end .
Imagine how more complex code might look !
Still , you get used to it ; and at least there ’s never a question of what ’s an argument of what .
The parens tend to bunch up when you nest function calls :
( reverse ( mapcar ' 3 * ( filter ' oddp ( number - sequence 1 10 ) ) ) ) 1 ( reverse ( mapcar ' 3 * ( filter ' oddp ( number - sequence 1 10 ) ) ) )
The example above includes non-standard functions ( 3 * and filter ) whose definitions I have not provided ( they ’re trivial ) ; it takes a list of numbers from 1 to 10 , then filters the list so it ’s just the odd numbers in that range ( 1 3 5 9 ) , multiplies each element of the list by three , and then reverses the list ( largest to smallest ) .
You may note that it ’s sometimes easier to read expressions like the above from right to left .
In Lisp there ’s no way to avoid these parens in a series of nested function calls .
In Haskell , you could also write something similar to the above …
reverse ( map ( 3* ) ( filter odd [ 1..10 ] ) ) 1 reverse ( map ( 3 * ) ( filter odd [ 1..10 ] ) )
However , Haskell provides a “ dot ” operator , which applies the function on the left to the output of the function on the right , so you can also write this snippet like :
( reverse . map ( 3* ) . filter odd ) [ 1..10 ] 1 ( reverse . map ( 3 * ) . filter odd ) [ 1..10 ]
The outer set of parentheses are necessary in the above example , because the dot operator takes a function on either end ; and the result of filter odd [ 1..10 ] ( which binds more tightly than the dot operator ; function applications always bind more tightly than operators ) is not a function , it ’s a list result .
You might wonder how filter odd and map ( 3* ) can be functions ; they look more like the result of a function applied to an argument .
And they are : one of Haskell ’s great features is partial function application : you can pass one argument to a function that takes two , and the result is a function that takes the “ second ” argument .
The ( 3* ) is actually a partial application too : in the Lisp example , I would have had to define a function named 3 * to make it work ; but in the Haskell example ( 3* ) is a partial application of the * operator .
I like to read the dot operator as “ of ” .
So you can read ( reverse . map ( 3* ) . filter odd ) as ” reverse the order of mapping the multiply - by - three operation across the elements of the result of filtering for just the odd - numbered values of … ”
We can even get rid of those outer parentheses , too , if we want :
reverse . map ( 3* ) . filter odd $ [ 1..10 ] 1 reverse . map ( 3 * ) . filter odd $ [ 1..10 ]
The dollar operator takes a function on the left and applies it to everything on the right as a single argument .
It ’s right - associative , so we actually could also write this expression as :
reverse $ map ( 3* ) $ filter odd $ [ 1..10 ] 1 reverse $ map ( 3 * ) $ filter odd $ [ 1..10 ]
The only set of parentheses we ca n’t get rid of is the ones in ( 3* ) , where they are used in the partial application of the * operator , called a section .
Parentheses are part of the syntax required to designate a section .
Of course , if we really wanted , to , we could just write a function that does the same thing , and name it mulThree or what have you .
Personally , I like this one best :
( reverse . map ( 3* ) . filter odd ) [ 1..10 ] 1 ( reverse . map ( 3 * ) . filter odd ) [ 1..10 ]
Function Definitions and Pattern Matching
In part one of this overview , we presented this version of our powers function in Haskell :
powers i v | i >= 0 && i < 8 = v : powers ( i+1 ) ( v * 2 ) | otherwise = [ ]
1 2 powers i v | i & gt ; = 0 && i & lt ; 8 = v : powers ( i + 1 ) ( v* 2 ) | otherwise = [ ]
The truth is , though , we do n’t need both i and v .
One value could be deduced from the other .
I just kept both parameters because they ’d been needed in C ( they could each be deduced from the other in C as well , but at a performance penalty ; there are other ways to write the example in C without using i ; but the example was written for readability ) .
A common way to write function definitions in Haskell , is to first write a definition of the function for a concrete value , and then define the function for other values in terms of that first definition .
For instance , we could ’ve written powers like :
powers 0 = 1 : powers 1 powers 8 = [ ] powers n = 2 * head ( powers ( n - 1 ) ) : powers n+1 1 2 3 powers 0 = 1 : powers 1 powers 8 = [ ] powers n = 2 * head ( powers ( n - 1 ) ) : powers n + 1
Note that this assumes no one ever calls powers 9 ; and also that powers now takes one argument instead of two ( we dropped v ) .
This series of definitions means that
“ powers 0 ” is a list whose first element has the value 1 , and whose remaining elements are defined by “ powers 1 ”
“ powers 8 ” is the empty list .
“ powers n ” for any other value n is a list whose first element is twice the value of the first element of “ powers ( n - 1 ) ” , and whose remaining values are defined by “ powers ( n+1 ) ” .
This winds up giving us the same list result for powers 0 as we previously got for powers 0 1 in our original definition of the function .
Note that there ’s just one function powers , but there are three definitions for that function .
These definitions combine to provide the complete description of what powers means .
Pattern Matching
We ’ve just made a slight use of a very powerful Haskell feature , pattern matching .
In this case , we ’re matching arguments to powers against various possibilities of 0 , 1 , or n ( where n can be any value ) .
But pattern matching can actually be performed against any sort of value or partial value .
For instance , if we wanted to write a very simplistic function to convert a string into 1337 - speak , transforming
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog 1

to
Th3 quick br0wn f0x jump5 0v3r 7h3 14zy d0g.
1 Th3 quick br0wn f0x jump5 0v3r 7h3 14zy d0g .
we could write it like :
leetize " " = " " leetize ( 'l ' : xs ) = ' 1 ' : leetize xs leetize ( 'e ' : xs ) = ' 3 ' : leetize xs leetize ( ' a ' : xs ) = ' 4 ' : leetize xs leetize ( 's ' : xs ) = ' 5 ' : leetize xs leetize ( 't ' : xs ) = ' 7 ' : leetize xs leetize ( 'o ' : xs ) = ' 0 ' : leetize xs leetize ( x:xs ) = x : leetize xs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 leetize " " = " " leetize ( 'l ' : xs ) = ' 1 ' : leetize xs leetize ( 'e ' : xs ) = ' 3 ' : leetize xs leetize ( ' a ' : xs ) = ' 4 ' : leetize xs leetize ( 's ' : xs ) = ' 5 ' : leetize xs leetize ( 't ' : xs ) = ' 7 ' : leetize xs leetize ( 'o ' : xs ) = ' 0 ' : leetize xs leetize ( x : xs ) = x : leetize xs
The above could have been written somewhat more tersely , but it ’s a good demonstration of using pattern - matched function definitions .
The ( x :xs ) patterns describe a list ( : is the list - construction operator ) , whose first element is x and whose remaining elements are the ( possibly empty ) list xs .
The first definition in this example simply says that applying leetize to an empty string will yield an empty string as the result .
The following definition means that if the leetize function is applied to a string whose first character is the letter ell , then the result is the one digit , followed by the application of leetize to the remaining characters of the string .
The final definition matches ( x:xs ) , for any string beginning with an arbitrary character x that does n’t match any of the previous patterns ; it just leaves that character as - is , and continues to transform transformations on the remaining characters .
Roll your own operators
Another thing that I think is really cool in Haskell is the ability to invent or redefine your own operators .
Languages like C++ let you override the definition of existing operators for new types , but Haskell lets you invent entirely new operators .
Want to define a new operator *! ?
It ’s as easy as writing
x *! y = x * y / 2 1 x * ! y = x * y / 2
You can also use normal functions as if they were operators .
This is common with functions like elem , where elem x mylist evaluates to True if x may be found as an element in mylist .
While elem x mylist is fine , the meaning of x elem mylist seems just a little clearer .
For both operators and functions - applied - as - operators , you can specify associativity and precedence .
( You can only define binary operators ; all operators in Haskell are binary operators , except for unary - , as used in expressions such as - 3 . )
Lazy Evaluation
One of the things that many people find really cool about Haskell ( not just me ! ) , is that it follows a “ lazy ” or “ non-strict ” evaluation scheme .
The value of an expression is only calculated when it is required .
This has some rather interesting consequences .
One consequence is that Haskell allows you to define lists that do n’t end .
Among other things , this means I ’ve been making our running powers example way more difficult than it needs to be .
Instead of defining a function that takes some starting value and keeps doing calculations until it reaches a maximum , I can have it just keep calculating that result forever :
powers = 1 : map ( * 2 ) powers 1 powers = 1 : map ( * 2 ) powers
Note that this latest powers does n’t need any arguments at all .
It ’s just bound to the set of all 2n , n≥0 .
That ’s a list without a limit ; but that does n’t matter , so long as we never try to evalute the entire list .
But if I ask Haskell to give me just the first eight elements of that list ( with take 8 powers ) , it works just fine .
Haskell performs the necessary calculations to bring me the first eight elements , and does n’t continue trying to calculate any further elements .
Infinite - length lists are fun , but when you come down to it , they ’re really just neat sugar .
One area where Haskell ’s lazy evaluation really comes in handy is in code like :
import Char ( toUpper ) main = do slurp <- getContents let upperCased = map toUpper slurp putStr upperCased 1 2 3 4 5 import Char ( toUpper ) main = do slurp & lt ; - getContents let upperCased = map toUpper slurp putStr upperCased
This is a complete program to convert the standard input to all - uppercase , and print the results to the standard output .
It binds the variable slurp to the full contents from standard input as a string , then binds the variable upperCased to a string which holds the result of mapping the toUpper function against each character in slurp .
Finally , the string held in upperCased is printed to the standard output using putStr .
Similar code in Perl might look like :
undef $ / ; my $ slurp = < STDIN > ; my $ upper_cased = uc $ slurp ; print $ upper_cased ; 1 2 3 4 undef $ / ; my $ slurp = & lt ; STDIN & gt ; ; my $ upper_cased = uc $ slurp ; print $ upper_cased ;
The difference is that the Perl example will happily try to take a 5 GB file and shove it all into memory ( or , much more likely , make the attempt and choke ) , whereas the Haskell version , which looks nearly identical , will process input a bit at a time — how much of a bit depends on the buffering scheme , which depends on the implementation — but the point is , it ’s not going to try to slurp it all into memory .
It ’ll process data a bit at a time , converting it to uppercase , and spitting it out .
It only grabs input when it ’s ready to print out the next few characters .
Then it looks at what it ’s printing — upperCased , and sees that it ’s supposed to hold the uppercasing of slurp .
It then sees that slurp is supposed to be a string holding the content from standard input , so it goes ahead and reads the next bit from standard input , uppercases it like it ’s supposed to … rinse , lather , repeat .
What ’s neat about this is that it frees you from having to think about the details .
Your code does n’t need to “ know ” that it ’s dealing with input piecemeal : as far as it ’s concerned , it ’s just transforming a string .
Naturally , Perl is just as capable as Haskell at processing input a piece at a time ; the difference is that the Perl code will be very aware that it ’s doing things one bit at a time , while the Haskell code “ thinks ” it ’s just working on the whole data .
Note , the Haskell example is for illustration .
A much simpler program that does the same thing is :
import Char ( toUpper ) main = interact ( map toUpper ) 1 2 import Char ( toUpper ) main = interact ( map toUpper )
Monads
You may have noticed that the original version of the uppercasing program looked somewhat procedural - ish .
The do keyword introduces a block of code that is essentially procedural ; but it never for a moment violates the rules of a pure functional language .
The behavior of do is defined in terms of a series of function applications and nested name - bindings .
The important thing is that Haskell preserves the principle of non-destructive , immutable data , and do does n’t let you do anything you ca n’t do without it ; it just looks much cleaner than its equivalent .
What ’s cool about the do block , though , is that it actually provides a mechanism that many people refer to as overloading the semicolon .
The do block is defined in terms of a couple of operators , >> and >>= , that the user can overload in the types phe creates .
All types that can be used as the types of the expression - statements in a do block , and as a do block ’s own type , belong to a class called Monad .
For instance , take the Maybe parameterized type ( parameterized means it takes another type as a parameter ; for instance , it can be a Maybe String or a Maybe Integer ) .
This is a type provided by the Haskell standard library , that provides a way to represent a “ null ” - like value .
For instance , an expression that returns a Maybe String can construct return values such as Just " hello " or Just " what is your name ? " ; it can also use the constructor Nothing , to represent no value ( often used to indicate an error condition ) .
For instance , Haskell provides a find function that takes two arguments : a predicate function , and a list .
If it finds an element a that matches the predicate in the list , it will return Just a ; if it does n’t find anything , it returns Nothing .
So , find (< 2 ) [ 1 5 3 9 8 ] will return Just 1 ; but find (> 10 ) [ 1 5 3 9 8 ] would return Nothing .
So , what happens if you need to use the result from several successive finds ?
Say , to find the customer ID corresponding to a name , and then use that to find a sales record ?
You could end up with successive , nested if expressions to check for Nothing before proceeding .
Rough pseudo - Haskell :
getSalesRecord name = let cust
Id = find ( == name ) customers record = find ( == cust Id ) salesRecords in if isJust cust
Id then if isJust record then Just record else Nothing else Nothing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 getSalesRecord name = let cust
Id = find ( == name ) customers record = find ( == cust Id ) sales Records in if isJust cust
Id then if isJust record then Just record else Nothing else Nothing
( There are severe glitches in the above , but it was written for human readability , and not actual compilability . )
Note that it ’s safe to bind record as above , even though we have n’t yet checked isJust record , because it ’s not actually evaluated until we use it , and we do n’t use it until after we check .
Imagine if there were even more dependent lookups we needed to perform !
The nested if expressions would quickly become unweildly .
However , since the Maybe type is a Monad , we can write it with the do block , like this :
getSalesRecord name = do cust
Id <- find ( == name ) customers record <- find ( == cust Id ) sales Records return record 1 2 3 4 5 getSalesRecord name = do cust
Id & lt ; - find ( == name ) customers record & lt ; - find ( == cust Id ) sales Records return record
The Maybe type overloads the meaning of the name bindings done with <- ( actually , it overloads >>= , but <- is defined in terms of >>= ) .
If the result of the right - hand side is a Just x ( for any x ) , it binds cust Id to x ( stripping off the Just ) for the remaining statements .
If either of the two <- statements result in a Nothing value , then the remaining statements are not processed , and the result of the entire do block is Nothing .
I was at first dismayed when I discovered that Haskell ’s exception mechanisms are not as powerful as one might hope .
However , as it turns out , it does n’t actually pose a problem , because you can just use Maybe and do blocks , as in the example above .
The first <- binding or statement that evalutes to Nothing will short - circuit the rest of the code , and eliminates the need to manually check for error - status results after each statement !
This “ semicolon - overloading ” mechanism is really very powerful .
The do block provides a mechanism for compactly and abstractly representing a sequence - of - statements , where a statement is either a Monad - returning expression or a name - binding ; but the monadic type gets to decide what “ sequencing ” these things actually means .
A great example of the power of Monad s is that simple lists are also Monad s.
But with list types , the name - binding <- notation is overloaded so that x <- someList will result in x being set to each element of someList in turn , and then all the remaining statements that appear after the <- binding statement in the same do block will be evaluated in turn , for each x .
The result of the do block will be the list of each of those results .
As an example , here ’s a simple permuation of two lists :
example = do word <- [ " foo " , " bar " ] num <- [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] return ( word , num ) -- evaluates to : [ ( " foo " , 1 ) , ( " foo " , 2 ) , ( " foo " , 4 ) , -- ( " bar " , 1 ) , ( " bar " , 2 ) , ( " bar " , 4 ) ] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 example = do word & lt ; - [ " foo " , " bar " ] num & lt ; - [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] return ( word , num ) -- evaluates to : [ ( " foo " , 1 ) , ( " foo " , 2 ) , ( " foo " , 4 ) , -- ( " bar " , 1 ) , ( " bar " , 2 ) , ( " bar " , 4 ) ]
As perhaps you ’re beginning to see , Monad s are an incredibly powerful feature of Haskell .
In fact , Monad s combined with Haskell ’s lazy , evaluate - as - needed behavior is what enables Haskell to be capable of elegantly dealing with interactive with user input , without sacrificing its status as a pure functional programming language .
Interactivity ( such as might be found in a typical text - editor ) is not possible in languages that are purely functional ( immutable data ) , and use strict ( non-lazy ) evaluation , because such languages require that they have all the input at the beginning before processing can even begin .
String Literals
I have n’t seen this emphasized anywhere , and it ’s a small thing , but one more aspect of Haskell that strikes me as particularly elegant is the ways in which Haskell deals with string literals .
One of the things I really like , is that Haskell ’s string literals can include spans of whitespace that are ignored , when they are enclosed within backslashes ; this whitespace can include newlines .
So you can write something like :
main = putStr " _ _ _ _ _ _ _
\ \| | | | ___| | | ____ _ _ ______ _ __| | __| | |
\ \| |_| |/ _ | | |/ _ | | | |/ / _ | ' __| |/ _` | |
\ \| _ | __/ | | ( _ ) | | V / ( _ ) | | | | ( _| |_|
\ \|_| |_|____|_|_|____( ) |_/|_/|____/|_|
|_|___,_(_)
\ \ |/
" 1 2 3 4 5 6 main = putStr " _ _ _ _ _ _ _
\ \| | | | ___| | | ____ _ _ ______ _ __| | __| | |
\ \| |_| |/ _ | | |/ _ | | | |/ / _ | ' __| |/ _` | |
\ \| _ | __/ | | ( _ ) | | V / ( _ ) | | | | ( _| |_|
\ \|_| |_|____|_|_|____( ) |_/|_/|____/|_|
|_|___,_(_)
\ \ |/
"
The large “ Hello , World ! ” will be printed flush - left , but we were able to align the literal rather nicely in the Haskell source .
This sort of thing can be a little more difficult in some other languages .
Also , in addition to the usual C - style \r ,
, \b , etc , and hexadecimal and octal notations ( which differ slightly from C’s ) , Haskell also provides a \ ^C notation ( where '\ ^C ' represents “ Control - C ” ) , and a \ESC notation ( representing the escape character , using its ASCII acronym ) .
Thus , the ASCII backspace character can be represented as any of ' \b ' , '\ BS ' , '\ ^H , ' \ o33 ' , or ' \x 1B ' .
Every one of those representations can be useful in different circumstances , especially for a terminal enthusiast and GNU Screen co-maintainer such as myself .
Well , that pretty much sums it all up .
This took a lot longer to write than I really wanted it to , so maybe I ’m finished talking about Haskell for a while .
In presenting all the things that really impress me about Haskell , I ’m perhaps painting an unrealistically rosy picture of the language .
I do believe that Haskell , and its current best implementations , have some significant shortcomings ( but none that actually render Haskell impractical , as is sometimes suggested ) ; if I get around to writing a “ part 3 ” , I ’ll probably dwell on those , to counter - balance the wondrous things I covered here .
However , that one might be a while in coming , as I think I ’ve spent quite enough time writing about Haskell for a limited audience , for now . 😉
If you ’re a college student applying for jobs or summer internships , you ’re at something of a disadvantage when it comes to negotiation .
That ’s because the recruiter does these negotiations for a living , while you ’re probably doing it for the first time .
I want to warn you about one trick that ’s very common with on - campus recruiters : the cynical “ exploding offer . ”
Here ’s what happens .
You get invited to interview at a good company .
There ’s an on - campus interview ; maybe you even fly off to the company HQ for another round of interviews and cocktails .
You ace the interview , of course .
They make you an offer .
“ That sounds great , ” you say .
“ So , when can you let us know ? ”
“ Well , ” you tell them , “ I have another interview coming up in January .
So I ’ll let you know right after that . ”
“ Oh , ” they say .
“ That might be a problem .
We really have to know by December 31st .
Can you let us know by December 31st ? ”
Tada !
The magnificent “ exploding offer . ”
Here ’s what you ’re thinking .
You ’re thinking , well , that ’s a good company , not my first choice , but still a good offer , and I ’d hate to lose this opportunity .
And you do n’t know for sure if your number one choice would even hire you .
So you accept the offer at your second - choice company and never go to any other interviews .
And now , you lost out .
You ’re going to spend several years of your life in some cold dark cubicle with a crazy boss who could n’t program a twenty out of an ATM , while some recruiter somewhere gets a $ 1000 bonus because she was better at negotiating than you were .
Career counselors know this , and almost universally prohibit it .
Every campus recruiting center has rules requiring every company that recruits on campus to give students a reasonable amount of time to make a decision and consider other offers .
The trouble is , the recruiters at the second - rate companies do n’t give a shit .
They know that you ’re a college kid and you do n’t want to mess things up with your first real job and you ’re not going to call them on it .
They know that they ’re a second - rate company : good enough , but nobody ’s dream job , and they know that they ca n’t get first - rate students unless they use pressure tactics like exploding offers .
And the worst thing that career centers can do is kick them off campus .
Big whoop .
So they hold their recruiting sessions and interviews in a hotel next to the campus instead of at the career center .
Here ’s your strategy , as a student , to make sure you get the job you want .
1. Schedule your interviews as close together as possible .
2 . If you get an exploding offer from a company that ’s not your first choice , push back .
Say , “ I ’m sorry , I ’m not going to be able to give you an answer until January 14th .
I hope that ’s OK . ”
Almost any company , when pressed , will give you a chance to compare offers .
Do n’t worry about burning bridges or pissing anyone off .
Trust me on this one : there ’s not a single hiring manager in the world who wants to hire you but would get mad just because you ’re considering other offers .
It actually works the other way .
When they realize you ’re in demand , they ’ll want you more .
3 . In the rare case that they do n’t accept that , accept the exploding offer at the last minute , but go to the other interviews anyway .
Do n’t cash any signing bonus checks , do n’t sign anything , just accept the offer verbally .
If you get a better offer later , call back the slimy company and tell them you changed your mind .
Look , Microsoft hires thousands of college kids every year .
If one of them does n’t show up I think they ’ll survive .
Anyway , since we instituted that 13th amendment thing , they ca n’t force you to work for them .
If you do find yourself forced to renege on an offer , be classy about it .
Do n’t do this unless you are absolutely forced to because they literally refused to give you a chance to hear from your first choice company .
And let them know right away you ’re not going to take the offer , so they have a chance to fill the position with someone else .
Campus recruiters count on student ’s high ethical standards .
Almost all students think , “ gosh , I promised I ’ll go work for them , and I ’m going to keep my promise . ”
And that ’s great , that ’s a commendable attitude .
Definitely .
But unethical recruiters that do n’t care about your future and do n’t want you to compare different companies are going to take advantage of your ethics so they can get their bonus .
And that ’s just not fair .
The World from Berlin ' Sarah Palin Will Cost the Republican Party Dearly '
Sarah Palin is a fresh - faced fishing and hunting wild card in the US presidential race .
She just might be able to lure the media away from Obama .
But can she attract enough voters from the right to make up for those she might lose McCain in the center ?
by Ari Rutenberg
Just now ( about 2110 GMT ) on CNN International Christopher Hitchens questioned McCain 's mental fitness to serve .
Hitchens believes " His connections with everyday reality " seems to be disappearing , and that " McCain no longer seems able to do much more than recite a few catchphrases " , adding " I do n't know if he is fit to be the President , or even an United States Senator . "
Wow , strong words from the disheveled British crackpot .
Wonder if he will repeat them on U.S. TV ?
NASHVILLE 
At halftime Monday night , the Ring of Honor at the Tennessee Titans ' LP Field added three names — Steve McNair , Eddie George and Frank Wycheck .
Now the question is whether this season 's team can get to a Super Bowl , as those three stars did during the 1999 season .
Like this year , that 1999 team was n't considered long on star power .
McNair was still emerging , four years prior to his co-MVP season .
George was the best - known name on the roster , headed for the third of his four Pro Bowls .
And Wycheck , a sure - handed tight end , was on the way to 505 career catches , but hardly a household name .
POWER RANKINGS : Titans hold slim lead on Giants
Similarly , the name - recognition of the 2008 Titans paled in comparison to their Monday night opponent , but after their 31 - 21 victory vs. the Indianapolis Colts the nation knows them a little better .
" So you all can compare us to whoever you want to compare us to , " said coach Jeff Fisher afterward .
" But right now we 're pleased with the way we played . "
Fisher has generally muffled any superlatives that come his team 's way this season , but Monday night 's game pointed out several reasons not to take Tennessee 's 7 - 0 record lightly :
• Tennessee 's " Smash and Dash " tandem of running backs LenDale White and rookie Chris Johnson continued to churn out points .
White managed only 13 yards on 10 totes , but two of them reached the end zone , giving him a league - leading 10 touchdowns for the season .
Johnson had one TD run , and is fifth in the NFL with 626 rushing yards .
" I 'm trying to be the best at something , and I guess that 's the best way to do it , " said White of his ability to get into the end zone .
But he 's not entirely pleased with his growing reputation as a short - yardage specialist .
" Everybody thought I was bam , bam , bam , but I went 80 yards ( against Kansas City ) last week , " reminded White , who already has topped his 2007 total of seven touchdowns .
• Down 14 - 6 in the third quarter , the Titans countered the argument that they 're not a come - from - behind team with two lengthy touchdown drives that erased a total of 14:36 from the game clock .
" I could sense that they were starting to wear down and give up , " said fullback Ahmard Hall , the Army vet who does much of the key blocking for Tennessee 's ground game .
• Tennessee 's defensive secondary has been among the leaders in interceptions , but perhaps got an even bigger credibility boost by holding Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne to a combined four catches for just 41 yards .
" We got out hands on them and pushed them around , " said Titans cornerback Nick Harper , a former Colt .
" We got them off their timing .
That was huge . "
• The Titans have never registered impressive sack totals on Peyton Manning , and they failed to nail him for a loss Monday .
But their defensive line did withstand the loss of Pro Bowler Kyle Vanden Bosch and his backup , Dave Ball , who was sidelined for the night on the opening kickoff .
Manning was hurried several times , finished with only a 73.5 passer rating and had to endure fellow University of Tennessee alumnus Albert Haynesworth standing over him , talking trash .
" I'm always going to be talking trash to him , " the defensive player of the year candidate said .
" Honestly , you have n't seen our best ball yet .
You have n't seen my best ball yet . "
Tennessee is surrendering the fewest points per game ( 12.4 ) , is one off Green Bay 's leading total for interceptions ( with 12 ) and is fourth for total yards allowed ( 275.4 ) .
And , as befits their unheralded status , there 's one other stat the Titans have going :
They 're 7 - 0 against Las Vegas ' betting point spread .
Have you heard of " net pollution " ?
If not , you soon will , because it 's a term being pushed by Arts + Labs , the new group backed by AT&T , Viacom , NBC Universal , Cisco , and Microsoft .
Arts +Labs wants to be a sort of Internet plumber , using its Roto - rooter to clear all that caked - on nastiness from the tubes , allowing nice , clean — and most importantly , " safe " — content to flow .
And , what 's more , the biggest beneficiaries of the group 's effort will be consumers ; the press release even says so .
Everyone hates pollution
So , this idea of scrubbing the tubes .
We 're in favor of it .
You 're in favor of it .
Everyone 's in favor of it , right ?
I mean , no one really wants ISP bandwidth choked up by " viruses , malware , hack attacks , [ and ] spam . "
This is " net pollution " in its truest sense : nasty , clog - inducing gunk that is not requested by Internet users .
But Arts + Labs has one more item to add to the list of pollutants , and if you can't guess what it is , you might consider taking a remedial class in How Corporations
Think .
That 's right — the last item on the list is " illegal file trafficking . "
Illegal file trafficking is bad — and if you 're doing it right now , please stop — but it 's a curious item to lump with spam , viruses , and malware .
These truly do pollute the Internet , taking up valuable bandwidth even though no ' Net user requests the delivery of such material .
But illegal file trafficking is quite a different item ; clearly , this is actual ' Net traffic being requested by users .
It 's only " pollution " in the sense that it 's illegal , not that it 's unwanted or that the files are too large .
Net pollution threatens to " degrade consumers ' Internet experience , " says the group .
One of its key principles is " robust networks " that give operators " the flexibility to manage and expand their networks to defend against net pollution which threatens to congest and delay the network for all consumers . "
So the issue here appears to be congestion .
The Arts + Labs solution ?
Stop all that illegal trafficking and use the legal alternatives we 're pushing on the site : Vuze ( which uses P2P ) , Hulu , Netflix , Fancast , Joost , Veoh , etc .
In other words , stop your congestion - causing ways by streaming or downloading copious amounts of video from other sources .
Not exactly a solution to the congestion issue , is it , except possibly in the sense that streaming services like Hulu only consume downstream bandwidth and keep uplinks relatively clear ( note that Vuze and other legal P2P apps do n't even have this advantage , though , and Arts + Labs promotes them ) .
This is obviously an antipiracy play , not a " congestion relief " plan or a " help the consumer " PR push .
Given the groups involved , especially AT&T and NBC Universal ( both of which have supported ISP filtering plans ) , this is not a surprising focus , but one wishes they were a bit more upfront about it .
Is " content " a king or a serf ?
Most of what the group wants to do — push " consumer choice , " " innovation , " and " fairness " — sounds great , as does publicizing the fact that you can watch episodes of The Office online , legally , with few commercials .
But one curious aspect of the new campaign is its central claim that " quality content drives the Internet . "
Quality content is important , of course , but think about what you use the Internet for .
Does your decision to buy home or business Internet access actually turn on the availability of content from major rightsholders ?
Or is the use of data networks like the Internet actually driven by " communications " ( e- mail , IM , VoIP , texting ) rather than " content " ?
Dr. Andrew Odlyzko , a leading expert on Internet traffic growth , has long been a proponent of the view that " content is king " is little more than dogma .
It 's a point he made when we talked earlier this year , and he has reiterated in a recent paper ( PDF ) .
His comments are worth quoting at length , as content owners really do appear to feel that they drive the Internet and that ISPs , regulators , and legislators must act in defense of their plans .
Although content has traditionally ( almost invariably ) been accorded special care by policy makers , people have always been willing to pay far more for connectivity .
That video already dominates in terms of the volume of traffic on the Internet is not a counterargument .
Almost two centuries ago , newspapers ( the main ' content ' of the day ) also dominated the traffic carried by postal services , accounting for about 95 % of the weight .
But at the same time , newspapers provided only about 15 % of the postal revenues .
What people really cared about , and were willing to pay top dollar for , was connectivity , in the form of ?rst class mail for business and social purposes .
Content ( newspapers in that case ) is what the federal government decided should be subsidized for public policy reasons with the pro?ts from ?rst class mail .
For all the hoopla about Hollywood , all the movie theater ticket sales and all the DVD sales in the U.S. for a full year do not come amount to even one month of the revenues of the telecom industry .
And those telecom revenues are still over 70 % based on voice , de ? nitely a connectivity service .
In wireless , there is very rapid growth in data service revenues , but most of those revenues are from texting , another connectivity service ( and one that the industry did not design , but stumbled into ) .
So while the Arts + Labs antipiracy agenda is worthy of comment , the attitude it represents — content is king on the Internet — may actually be the most provocative assertion that the group is now making .
Instant controversy !
Arts +Labs is headed up by Mike McCurry , a former press secretary for Bill Clinton who has been running the anti-net neutrality campaign " Hands off the Internet " until now .
The group 's apparent interest in ISP filtering , given its membership , has already attracted scathing comment from groups like Public Knowledge .
Gigi Sohn , the president of Public Knowledge , said in a statement late yesterday that Arts + Labs is just the " latest in a string of big - money front groups is nothing more than the most concentrated attack on the free and open Internet we have seen to date .
Combining the power and influence of AT&T and the entertainment industry means only that both are going to wage an all - out war for the right to filter every bit of data anyone sends across the Internet ...
We certainly do not condone online theft of copyrighted materials .
At the same time , we similarly do not favor the unwarranted intrusion into the Internet that this group promises for the future . "

Reykjavik insists Iceland needs $ 6bn to deal with the crisis When Iceland announced it was seeking a $ 6bn ( £ 4bn ) loan from Russia to help rescue its crisis - ravaged economy , some in the NATO alliance , of which Iceland is a member , took fright .
They suspected that Russia was acting to further its geopolitical interests in the region in the guise of a white knight .
Reports of Russia seeking - or even securing - rights to Icelandic fisheries , energy and metal sectors , as well as in tourism , poured fuel on these fears .
Russia has denied any political interest in its dealing with crisis - hit Iceland , but even some Russian media outlets have expressed scepticism , publishing caustic headlines such as " Ready to buy Iceland for good money " .
" If Russia becomes the country which saves the Icelandic economy , Russia could also end up securing an extended level of power in the North Atlantic , " Barents Observer website said in an editorial .
' Disappointment '
For its part , Iceland said Russia was not its first choice for saviour - they had expected significant help from the US and the UK .
" Considering the fact that many of our friends were not willing to help us , we had to discuss [ the loan ] with Russia , " Prime Minister Geir Haarde told Finnish daily Helsingin Sanomat .
Iceland 's currency fell sharply when its banking system collapsed Iceland took particular offence at Britain 's use of anti-terrorism legislation to freeze assets of banks operating in the UK .
As Gauti Kristmannsson , an associate professor of translation studies at the University of Iceland , put it , " We thought we had friends , in Europe and in the United States . "
" The disappointment with our old ' friends ' is great , " he wrote in the New York Times .
' Investment opportunity ' Russia 's deputy finance minister Dmitry Pankin said that Iceland had first asked for a 4 bn - euro loan in August , before the island 's financial troubles became fully known .
All connections to Russia are political
Jon Olafsson , Bifrost University
He said Russia saw it as a good investment opportunity .
Many observers in Russia suggest Moscow decided to try and save Reykjavik to improve its international image .
As Itogi magazine put it , " Most Russian analysts tend to think the offer of credit is nothing other than a branding move , set to demonstrate that despite the financial crisis , Russia will be able both to master it and to grant credits to Western countries if they ask for help . "
Some press reports also suggested that some of Russia 's oligarchs failed to withdraw their money from Iceland 's troubled banks and they had pressured Moscow to help Reykjavik .
But no loan was agreed and , as the global financial crisis intensified , Moscow 's focus turned elsewhere .
" Russia has its own financial difficulties at the moment , its own crisis to fight , " says Jon Danielsson , an Icelandic economist at the London School of Economics .
Convincing others
Other analysts suggest that the Icelandic government never seriously considered taking money from Russia - it was simply a strategy to secure help from Western Europe and the US .
The Kremlin has been forced to help its own economy recently For example , at the end of October , Iceland threatened to resume talks with Russian over a possible loan .
It had only reached a " tentative " agreement on a $ 2bn loan with the IMF and said it still needed an additional $ 4bn .
Shortly after , Poland 's finance ministry said that the IMF and a group of European countries were ready to give Iceland the money it needed .
Warsaw said that " the International Monetary Fund , Scandinavian countries , Britain , the Netherlands and Poland are likely to take part in the consortium " to offer a $ 6bn loan to Iceland .
" It was always clear there would be considerable opposition to Russia getting involved with something like this in a country like Iceland , and with the IMF now being there I 'd be surprised if this was still on the cards , " said Mr Danielsson at the LSE .
However , only Poland , which said it would contribute $ 200 m to the rescue fund , has confirmed the move .
For now , at least , it looks like many of Iceland 's old friends are again willing to help the country , several weeks after its banking system collapsed .
Whatever provoked the change of heart , it 's clear that many in Europe fear that Russian help comes with strings attached .
" It is difficult [ for Iceland ] to be connected to Russia with this loan .
All connections to Russia are political , " says Jon Olafsson , a political analyst at Bifrost University .

A Zimbabwean digs for crickets to eat as the humanitarian crisis worsens South Africa 's cabinet says it will withhold $ 28 m of agricultural aid to neighbouring Zimbabwe until a representative government is in place .
South Africa 's cabinet said the impasse was creating a humanitarian crisis .
The current outbreak of cholera was a clear indication that Zimbabweans were becoming " victims of their leaders ' lack of political will " , it said .
The US ambassador to Zimbabwe has said that 294 people have died from the cholera outbreak .
Ambassador James McGee also said that President Robert Mugabe 's grip on power " may be actually stronger than it was this time last year .
" Mugabe continues to hang on to power through the political patronage system , " he said .
The South African cabinet 's strongly worded statement said : " No amount of political disagreement can ever justify the suffering that ordinary Zimbabweans are being subjected to at the moment . "
Correspondents say this is the first indication that South Africa is taking a tougher stance on Zimbabwe .
Food shortages , a lack of seed and fertiliser for planting and the breakdown in health services are all having a serious effect on the people
Former UN head Kofi Annan
SA cabinet statement on Zimbabwe Harare diary : New abductions Death throes of Harare 's hospitals Former South Africa President Thabo Mbeki , who negotiated September 's power - sharing agreement between the ruling Zanu - PF and opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , was an advocate of quiet diplomacy .
But two months later , several rounds of talks on allocating ministerial posts have failed and aid groups say Zimbabwe is facing a major humanitarian crisis .
They expect that more than five million people , or nearly half the population , will need food aid by early next year .
The economy is in freefall , with inflation last listed in July , at 231,000,000 % .
The health services are in a state of collapse , exacerbating the effects of the cholera outbreak , which the BBC's Peter Biles in Johannesburg says appears to have spread to South Africa .
Three people are reported to have died in the town of Musina close to the border with Zimbabwe and more than 70 people there are receiving treatment , he says .
Elders to visit The South African cabinet statement also said it would send assistance to help Zimbabwe deal with the cholera outbreak .
The agricultural aid will be dispersed in time for the April 2009 planting season , it said .
Meanwhile , Zimbabwe 's state - owned Herald newspaper reports that more talks will be held on forming a power - sharing government next week between Zanu - PF and the MDC in South Africa .
Zimbabwe 's government has denied a report that it was blocking a visit from former UN head Kofi Annan , former US President Jimmy Carter and human rights activist Nelson Mandela 's wife Graca Machel .
The three international figures are part of a group called the Elders , set up to tackle world conflicts .
Robert Mugabe wants Zanu - PF to retain key ministries
In a statement , the Elders said they would visit the region on Friday " to make a first hand assessment of the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe " .
" The purpose of our visit is to meet those working on the ground to better assess the extent of the crisis and how assistance can be improved , " Mr Annan said .
" Food shortages , a lack of seed and fertiliser for planting and the breakdown in health services are all having a serious effect on the people .
" We understand that the situation requires an urgent response and that delays will only prolong the people 's suffering . "
The Herald , seen as a mouthpiece for President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party , had reported a government official as saying the planned mission was biased .
Mr Annan said they had no intention of becoming involved in the ongoing political negotiations .
The power - sharing deadlock follows disputed presidential elections earlier this year .
Mr Tsvangirai won the first round in March , but not by enough to secure outright victory .
He then pulled out of a run-off in June , citing a campaign of violence against his supporters .

McCain Nearly Down to the Felt : $ 12 Million left to Spend
As any good Texas - Holdem poker player ( like Barack Obama ) knows that when your chips get low and you are almost out of the game ( down to the felt in poker terms ) , you wait for the best hand you can get and move all in an attempt to “ double up ” .
Translating that to politics , with McCain constrained by taking public financing , that decision is turning into potentially a fatal one .
And it explains his decision to move his ad spending out of a number of battleground states .
We have news today that McCain is drastically cutting his ad spending in a number of states :
In another sign that John McCain is on the defensive as time runs out , the McCain campaign is shifting its ad money out of blue tossup states and into red tossups and even traditionally red states , according to ad maven Evan Tracey .
McCain has dramatically slashed his ad spending in Wisconsin and New Hampshire and reduced it in Pennsylvania , suggesting that he ’s either losing hope or giving up hope in winning in three states that went for John Kerry in 2004 , or that he does n’t have ample enough resources for them .
He ’s also reduced his spending in Colorado , which went for Bush but is showing a lead for Obama , suggesting he may be losing hope there , too .
“ There ’s definitely a scaling back in those states , ” says Tracey , who tracks national ad spending for the Campaign Media Analysis Group and gave TPM some numbers so we could flesh out and synthesize disparate reports about various spending shifts into a big picture .
It ’s a curious decision to move out of some of these states , especially Colorado where Obama has a solid but not insurmountable lead .
Of course , if Obama wins Colorado along with Iowa and New Mexico and holds the Kerry states , he wins .
But Colorado is not an outrageously expensive state , so throwning some coin there seems like a no - brainer .
Until you get a look at how much money McCain has left to spend :
WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
New campaign spending reports show Republican John McCain had less than $ 24 million to spend on his presidential campaign as of last week .
The Republican National Committee reported having nearly $ 60 million in the bank .
McCain reported that as of Oct. 15 he had $ 25.2 million cash in hand and $ 1.2 million in debts .
At his spending rate of $ 1.5 million a day , McCain likely has $ 12 million left to spend in the next 11 days .
Election Day is Nov. 4 . McCain filed his reports to the Federal Election Commission on Thursday evening .
That is absolutely brutal .
Now , the $ 12 million is an estimate based on McCain ’s previous spending rate ( he had $ 24 million as of the 15th ) , but assuming that ’s remotely accurate , there is simply no way for McCain to stretch his ad dollars to a bunch of states .
Like a poker player low on chips , you ca n’t play every hand ; you pick your best two cards and push .
And with only $ 12 million left to play with , McCain is definitely down to his last hand or two .
The web is the most trusted news medium ( over TV and print combined ) , and Fox News is the most trusted TV news source , according to results from a new Zogby poll commissioned by the Independent Film Channel .
Fox ruled with 39.3 percent of those polled beating out CNN at 16 percent and MSNBC at 15 percent .
These results are good fodder for Fox in defending its claims of being " Fair and Balanced " – it's also interesting to note that more people in the poll described themselves as Democrats than Republicans – but the majority of Americans seem to also have little faith in the media at all .
The online survey of 3,472 adults two days after the election found that three out of four people think that the media influenced the outcome , and about the same number also think that the media in general is biased .
In the other categories , The New York Times was the most trusted newspaper and Rush Limbaugh ( 12.5 percent ) came out on top among news personalities closely followed by Fox ’s Bill O’Reilly ( 10.1 percent ) .
Elizabeth Hasselbeck , Stephen Colbert and Chris Matthews were the least trusted personalities , all scoring under 2 percent .
Since the dawn of time ( or at least since the 1980s ) , tech companies ' marketing departments have concocted a slew of catchphrase - wielding characters whose overriding goal is to create affectionate bonds between consumers and their companies ' products .
But while the average tech company employs advertising whizzes who are significantly smarter than those employed by the local furniture chain , their efforts are still doomed to eventually fail .
Why is this , you ask ?
Well , because the nature of advertising is to repeat things over and over again until people hate hearing them .
Thus any long - running advert campaign , no matter how cleverly executed , is bound to stir up resentment if it 's played often enough .
In this slideshow , we 'll examine the very worst fictional characters that marketing departments have unleashed on the general public over the years , ranging from smarmy wireless salesmen to dotcom - promoting sock puppets to annoying graphics of paperclips that SIMPLY REFUSE TO GO AWAY no matter what you do .

It is clear that the managers at CDRH have stopped caring about the health and safety of the American people who use these health devices .
After the results of numerous studies , that all concluded the same results , the FDA tried to just file those results away .
The medical devices include products like cardiac stents , nerve stimulators to relieve depression , imaging equipment and breast implants .

Russian police are hunting a " werewolf boy " - who snarls and bites - after he escaped from a Moscow clinic just a day after being rescued from the wild .
Doctors expressed shock saying he was found living with a pack of wolves in a remote forest in the Kaluga region of central Russia .
Scroll down for more ...
" He 's clearly dangerous to other people , " said a police spokesman yesterday .
" He 's got typical wolf - like habits and behaviour .
" He has very strong and sharp teeth , which could really endanger someone if he bites . "
The boy looks about ten - but after tests conducted by Moscow medics , they believe he maybe much older .
They are puzzled because he appears intelligent but does not seem to speak Russian or any other language .
It is suspected he has been running wild for many years .
Such cases are not uncommon in Russia where there have been regular reports of ' Mowgli ' children abandoned by their parents who are cared for by animals .
The boy moves around with his legs half bent , said Tvoi Den newspaper .
" He was running with wolves and searching for food with them . "
Villagers found this " wild creature " in a lair made of leaves and sticks in freezing temperatures and told the police who named him Lyokha , though his real identity is not known .
Scroll down for more ...
" He 's dirty , hungry , and looked to have had a hard time , " said the police spokesman .
" We brought him to a clinic in Moscow .
" It was simply unbelievable .
He does n't react when we call to him . "
Medics gave him clothes and said that he sprang down the corridor , bursting into his room and devouring his food like an animal .
His nails on his feet were like claws .
After 24 hours he had evaded security men at the clinic and escaped .
He is now believed to be on the loose in Moscow region .
" We did n't even manage to complete the proper medical checks .
We only succeeded in giving him a shower , cutting his nails and took some blood and other tests , " said a doctor .
" It 's quite possible he is a dangerous with psychological problems but also a source of viruses and infections . "
Seesawing between vicious satire and fawning tribute , A Very Merry Unauthorized Children 's Scientology Pageant offers a disarmingly funny lesson in the finer points of Dianetics .
Directed by Jaime Castañeda and performed by eight cute kid actors at Fort Worth 's Circle Theatre , the show takes a mere 55 minutes and 11 songs to sketch the life of L. Ron Hubbard and to expose the " sacred literature " and questionable practices of Hollywood 's pet New Age religion .
A few snowflakes appear on Mark Evan Walker 's chalkboard set , but this musical by Kyle Jarrow ( from an idea by Alex Timbers ) is basically " Springtime for L. Ron . "
It makes crafty use of children 's wide - eyed innocence as they chirp and giggle through the dark history of a secretive church that some say drives members into debt with financial demands and employs nefarious " black ops " to harass critics .
The show unfolds in the awkward , endearing style of a Sunday school nativity play ( the church basement ambience is enhanced by Circle 's underground acting space ) .
Performances are bright but ragged , with kids jumping in and out of a " let 's play dress - up " mishmash of costume pieces designed by Barbara C. Cox .
The intentional impression is that it 's all been slammed together in a hurry .
That 's also part of the joke as the show playfully dissects a carefully constructed belief system based on " thetans , " " engrams " and a space alien named Xenu who dropped A - bombs into volcanoes a billion years ago and caused all of mankind 's problems .
Info A Very Merry Unauthorized Children 's Scientology Pageant| Madeline 's Christmas A Very Merry Unauthorized Children 's Scientology Pageant continues through December 20 at Circle Theatre , Fort Worth .
Call 817-877-3040 .
Madeline 's Christmas continues through December 21 at Dallas Children 's Theater .

You can't make that stuff up — Hubbard did .
And AVMUCSP is smart to parrot Scientology 's own doctrine word for wacky word .
( To fact - check the Xenu story , just look to YouTube , where dozens of testimonials to the church 's weird mythology have been posted in protest by unhappy former members . )
Told fairy - tale fashion onstage , Scientology 's history and rituals are hilarious when they 're not horrifying .
Hubbard 's " analytical " and " reactive " minds ( the basis of Dianetics ) are illustrated by kids in beige balloon " brains . "
Acting out the bizarre process of emotion - numbing involved in going " clear " ( the Scientology equivalent of being " saved " ) , the cast uses a toy " e- meter " that probably works about as well as a real one .
" Just do n't ask questions , " they sing , " and everything is clear ! "
The kids also play IRS agents who take Hubbard ( played in terrific deadpan by Cayman Mitchell ) to court to challenge his tax - exempt status .
That leads to the funniest bit as Hubbard cross-examines Scientology acolytes John Travolta ( Logan Kirkendoll ) and Kirstie Alley ( McKenna Booth ) .
She credits Scientology for kicking her coke habit and " enabling me to star in the fine television series Fat Actress and to promote the quality products of weight loss expert Jenny Craig . "
Then comes Tom Cruise ( played by George Paddock ) , testifying to the self - empowerment he gained from Scientology .
Wife Katie Holmes and daughter Suri appear at his side , portrayed , appropriately , by expressionless sock puppets .
" She 's real ! " Cruise says of Suri .
" I swear ! "
First presented in 2003 by Off - Off - Broadway company Les Frères Corbusier , AVMUCSP was threatened with legal action by the notoriously litigious church .
But the word " unauthorized " in the title made the script sue - proof .
And it 's not libel or slander if it 's all true .
The cleverest twist in the show is that not a critical word ever is uttered against Hubbard or the church .
These kids love L. Ron !
Clearly !

Scenic designer Randel Wright , in - house set creator at Dallas Children 's Theater , has done some of his best work yet for Madeline 's Christmas , a charming new 90 - minute musical adaptation ( directed by Nancy Schaeffer ) of writer - illustrator Ludwig Bemelmans ' stories about the little French schoolgirl .
Using Bemelmans ' pale blue and yellow palette , Wright has turned the stage of the Baker Theater into a three - dimensional storybook .
The fun is in the extra touches that so richly bring the set to life : plates and cups magically stacking themselves on the sideboard ; the crisp line of dorm beds where Madeline 's schoolmates and a talking mouse named Martin recuperate from flu .
Stuck at school , the girls are sad to be away from home on Christmas .
Until , that is , resourceful Madeline ( played with real pluck by young Colleen Breen at the performance reviewed ) buys a dozen flying carpets from a visitor named Harsha ( David Lugo ) .
Voilà !
Transportation home for everyone .
And here 's where Wright really goes to town — to Paris , actually .
Perched on their rugs , the girls appear to soar into the night sky over the City of Light .
The Eiffel Tower comes into view , and then they fly up and away .
There 's no use trying to explain the spectacular effect Wright achieves in this sequence .
Go see for yourself .
Madeline 's Christmas is a lovely ride .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A top Republican said on Friday that Democratic U.S. President - elect Barack Obama is “ off to a good start ” and indicated he was pleased to see President George W. Bush get ready to leave .

“ Our members , in one way , are kind of relieved by the departure of an administration that became unpopular and made it very difficult for us to compete , ” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill .
In part because of Bush ’s unpopularity , Obama won the White House and Democrats expanded their majorities in the U.S. Congress in the November 4 elections .
Obama , who inherits a global financial crisis and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , has vowed to work with Republicans to try to overcome the bitter partisan divisions that have marked Washington - style politics , including the current standoff over proposals to bail out the failing auto industry .
McConnell expressed appreciation that Obama ’s pick for White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , visited Capitol Hill this week to talk to Republicans ahead of the new Congress convening on January 6 , two weeks before Obama is sworn in as president .
“ I think the new administration is off to a good start , ” the Kentucky senator said .
“ They ’re saying , in my view , all the right things ... that they want to govern in the middle and tackle big things . ”
McConnell added a cautionary note : “ It would not be a good idea for the new administration ... to go down a laundry list of left - wing proposals and try to jam them through . ”
“ I do n’t anticipate they ’re going to do that .
I ’m hoping for the best , ” McConnell said .
The senator said he would like to see Obama take on such issues as the financially troubled Social Security retirement program and Medicare health program for the elderly .
McConnell denounced a top priority of labor that has been embraced by Democrats and opposed by business -- legislation to make it easier for unions to organize at workplaces .
The measure , which was stopped by Republicans in the past , would allow workers to organize if a majority of them simply sign a union card .
This would avoid secret - ballot elections that critics charge are often manipulated by companies .
But supporters of the secret ballot call it a basic tenet of democracy .
“ The notion that in 2008 , we would get rid of the secret ballot is utter nonsense .
It ’s unacceptable , ” McConnell said .
“ It ’s overwhelmingly unpopular . ”
While Democrats will have increased control of the new Congress , McConnell vowed to put up a fight if needed and predicted that on some issues a number of Democrats may side with him .
“ I would n’t assume ... a kind of lock - step unity on the majority side , ” McConnell said .
As well as net gearing , these screens will also let you search stocks by their cash - flow .
Investors simply state that they want to look at all companies with a minimum cash - flow of , say £ 550 m - this is the average figure for companies in the FTSE - 100 .
But , as Leader points out : “ It is quite difficult to define a ‘ good cash - flow ’ , ” as this will be dependent on both the sector and the size of the company . ”
All right , let 's try something new .
If you ’re in the United States , send me a text at 773-365-9687 —
I want to hear how you 're doing , what 's on your mind , and how you 're planning on voting this year .
I 'll be in touch from time to time to share what 's on my mind , too .
An Indian organic farmer and anti-pollution advocate was shot to death on Monday while in the midst of exposing an illegal dumpsite on his property to the media .
Challa Krishnamurthy started a 20 - acre organic farm in Gowribidanur , India with the intention to make it a model for how others should treat the land .
But despite his efforts to keep his property free of toxic chemicals , he discovered that a local distillery and sugarcane factory had been dumping untreated waste onto his property as well as others.[ social_buttons ]
After filing complaints the Pollution Control Board and many other agencies within the Indian government , none came to his aid .
Krishnamurthy then contacted the local media to come document the waste site and mentioned that a truck driver from the factory had threatened him with a revolver that day .
According to one report , he was killed later that same day , mere hours before his scheduled meeting with the press .
Police have arrested a man they suspect was behind the killing , but a clear motive has not been determined .
The Gowribidanur community united for a general strike in protest of the killing the next day .
According to Suresh Heblikar , chairman of the organization Eco - Watch , the city has long been subject to gross amounts of illegal waste dumping .
“ If you take Bangalore , for instance , the environment is destroyed , ” he said .
“ We are not reacting to them hard enough , and the governments made of varied caste - creed - faith combinations cannot be expected to act impartially . ”
Any further information on the case is scarce , but I will update this post as more details become available .

Nov. 25 , 2008  --
For two years , Magi Klages , despite having autism , thrived in the Girl Scouts -- an organization that pledges to " help people at all times " and to be " honest and fair , considerate and caring . "
But when Magi's Brownie troop grew too large and her parents moved her to a smaller one for children with special needs , they never imagined their 8 - year - old would be kicked out .
Michele and Kevin Klages of Oconomowoc , Wis. , were told their daughter was a " danger " to the new group 's four other children who are all physically disabled .
" We do n't get it , " said Michele Klages , who always accompanies Magi to Brownie meetings .
" She 's 30 pounds and we were there .
We were told she was scaring the other girls . "
When the troop sat down for a mat - weaving project , Magi threw a fit , Michele Klages said , biting herself and running out of the circle .
Having an ' Autistic Moment '
" She was having moments as most autistic children do , " the 42 - year - old mother told ABCNews.com .
" We pulled her out of the circle and let her have her moment .
At one point she got up and ran away and her father got her . "
Michele Klages said they felt the Nov. 13 meeting had gone " fairly well " for an autistic child thrust into a new situation .
But four days later she got the call that Magi would not be welcome in the new troop .
" To feel like someone does n't want your child around , it rips your heart out , " said Michele Klages , who is also raising a 10 - year - old son and holds a part - time office job .
" I never expected my child to be discriminated against .
Never in a million years . "
She said they had been up - front with the group leader about Magi , who is mostly nonverbal and relies on sign language to communicate .
They were especially upset to learn the leader has a child with special needs .
" It 's terrible , " said Michelle Tompkins , a spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of the United States of America , who said she had received a " courtesy call " from the local council about the incident .
" We are very inclusive and have a national policy against all forms of discrimination . "
Anita Rodrigues , spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of Wisconsin Southeast , did not return several phone calls from ABCNews.com .
But Michele Klages says the council contacted her about the possibility of finding another troop for Magi to join .
Even the Autism Society of America admits that the Girl Scouts do " wonderful work " with children with disabilities and has often contributed volunteers to help children with this neurological disorder .
It says that children with autism are rarely dangerous to others and that the incident illustrates the need for more support and training in organizations like the Girl Scouts .
" These children are so misunderstood , " said Michele Klages .
" We need to educate ourselves that these kids can be loving and fun .
They should be given a chance like any other child . "
Confrontations Sometimes Happen
But while social confrontations like the ones experienced by the Klageses are not common , they happen .
Earlier this year , 13 - year - old Adam Race , who is also autistic , was banished from his Minnesota Catholic church .
His priest issued a restraining order , saying the teen -- who was 6 feet tall and weighed more than 225 pounds -- hit a child , nearly knocked over an elderly parishioner and spit and urinated in the church .
" My son is not dangerous , " Carol Race told The Associated Press .
" The church 's action is a certain community 's fears of him .
Fears of danger versus actual danger . "
Autism is a complex developmental disability that strikes one in 150 children -- one in 94 boys -- usually before the age of 3 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The disorder takes its greatest toll on a child 's social interaction and communication skills .
The numbers of children with autism have dramatically increased in the last decade , but it is not clear if the disease has become more prevalent or if doctors are just getting better at diagnosing .
" Fortunately , we are seeing increased awareness and a greater willingness to understand autism , " said Marguerite Colston , spokeswoman for the Autism Society of America , who has an autistic son the same age as Magi .
But with few support services outside the schools , " parents and communities have to figure things out for themselves , " Colston told ABCNews.com .
The autism society recently published a booklet -- " Growing Up Together " -- to help children better understand the disorder .
It describes " unusual " behaviors , such as difficulty talking or not talking at all , flapping hands , avoiding eye contact and trouble reading facial expressions .
The sound of a school bell may hurt their ears ; some have trouble eating food because of taste and smell sensitivities .
" On the other hand , " according to the booklet , " things that bother most of us , like a bee sting , may not appear to be as painful to them . "
Integration and modeling typical children is important , according to Colston .
" When children with autism become more and more isolated , the stranger they will be . "
Autistic Children Rarely Hurt Others
Like Magi , other children with autism are much more likely to show self - injury and property destruction than hurt others , according to Wayne Fisher , director for the Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders at the University of Nebraska Medical Center .
" We do n't see a lot of danger when they integrate , " he told ABCNews.com .
" These are unusual cases . "
" They are likely to display strong emotional reactions to new situations and changes in environment , " Fisher said .
Magi might well have adapted to her new Girl Scout troop after several more visits , as routine is important , he said .
" But their behaviors are not well understood by the general public and it makes them uncomfortable . "
And research shows that typical children also benefit from interacting with autistic children , showing improvements in patience , social skills and communication .
Michael Alessandri , executive director of University of Miami's Center for Autism and Related Disorders , called the Klages ' incident " shocking . "
Scouts : Including Autistic Children
" Children with autism are often excluded because of lack of understanding of their needs and because their special needs have not been appropriately accommodated , " he said .
" We hear of this far too often . "
In May , a mother in Port St. Lucie , Fla. , considered legal action after her son's kindergarten teacher led his classmates to vote him out of class .
Alex Barton , 5 , was being evaluated for autism .
" No one is served by this action , " said Alessandri .
" The child with autism misses out on an opportunity that is rightfully theirs .
And others miss out on the joy of learning about people with autism who are always remarkable in so many ways . "
Under law , the Girl Scouts -- if it receives federal funding -- is required to make a " reasonable accommodation " for Magi under the Americans With Disabilities Act , according to Alison Barnes , a law professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee , Wis .
Asking Magi to travel a long distance for another troop would not meet the letter of the law , Barnes said .
" What happened here instead is [ Magi ] got a troop that said , ' OK , we 'll try it . '
Then after one day they said , ' Never mind , we do n't want to do it , ' " Barnes told ABCNews.com .
But in a similar case in 2006 , a California court struck down a suit filed by parents who claimed their teenage son -- who had a form of autism - was not allowed to attend a weeklong Boy Scout camp .
Lawyers for the troop argued that the boy , " spits , kicks and swears at the other children . "
The court dismissed the case , ruling that Boy Scouts -- which also openly discriminates against gays and atheists -- is a private club .
But the Girl Scouts has been historically open to anyone and prides itself on its anti-discrimination policies .
The Klageses say the local council called them this week to help find another troop for Magi .
" They want to work with us and we 'll continue to work with them , " said Michele Klages .
" Magi really wants to be a Girl Scout , but it 's important to find a troop that 's a good fit for her . "
But Magi wo n't go back to the troop that kicked her out .
" These leaders need to be educated and they can't pick which disabilities they want in the troop , " her mother said .
" It 's not their call . "
" Every child needs more than one chance in a new situation , " she said .
" I 'm a mother protecting my child .
I want people to know this is not something to fear . "
The Antro Solo from Hungary is a gas-electric hybrid car with a unique power arrangement that also utilizes solar energy .
While the Antro Solo is obviously in the prototype phase , many of its technologies are fascinating .
To keep weight low , it ’s built entirely out of carbon fiber and composites .
The engine is a gas-electric hybrid with a twist .
A large array of roof - mounted photo - cells can charge the battery to extend the EV range .
The Solo comes with pedals that each passenger can crank in order to charge the battery .
This car combines renewable energy with fitness training .
The Antro Solo is also one of the strangest looking cars on the green horizon .
With its light weight and design the Antro Solo is able to get about 150 mpg and has a top speed of 87 mph .
These are excellent stats for a green car .
The triple seat feature of this car is unique .
Unlike other small hybrids , this car has all three seats lined up in row rather than the two in front , one in the back scenario .
This car wo n’t be difficult to market in countries that drive on the right or left because the driver in this car sits in the middle .
No need to rearrange the interior controls depending on whether the market is England or the U.S .
The interior cockpit has pedals for all of the passengers in the car .
Hence the pedal power part of the hybrid .
The driving controls along with being in the middle , look more appropriate for steering a plane rather than a car .
This configuration does place controls within easy reach of thumbs and fingers without the need to remove a hand from the steering column .
No to the most intriguing part of this hybrid , the different power systems .
Solar panels line the top of the car storing energy in the batteries .
The car can go approximately 9 - 12 miles on solar energy alone .
Not a very impressive distance , but with the pedals and small combustion engine the car will switch to the power source needed to get the car where you are going .
This is definitely one of the more unique cars slated to be out in two to five years .
But not necessarily one of the cheapest .
The car is expected to cost around $ 20.000 .
The multiple systems are blended in way not seen in other hybrids .
Adding pedal power to a solar - electric - gas combo is a way of providing emergency back up power like crank flashlights .
Just like crank flashlights , you can use the pedals to provide power to the engine when the batteries are low due to bad weather .
If the driver is alone or the passengers are n’t up to pedaling , the combustion engine kicks in to continue powering the car .
The pedal portion of the power system allows passengers to workout while riding .
With the seat and pedal configuration , this would be similar to riding a recumbent bicycle .
Should you miss a day at the gym , you can carpool in with someone else driving and exercise on the way .
The Antro Solo takes the term “ hybrid ” in whole new direction providing yet another choice to the line up expected in 2012 .

Sports , given their unrelenting choke - hold on American culture , naturally dominate a good chunk of online news coverage .
Sports companies like ESPN are as much an online presence as they are on TV .
The quality of sports blogs , though , runs the gamut from excellent ( deadspin.com ) to awful ( any amateur blog about the Red Sox . Sorry , Boston readers ) .
But some sports blogs are written by insiders — athletes , managers , etc. Fast Company takes a look at the fantastic blogs of six true sports insiders .
advertisement
advertisement
Mark Cuban — Owner , Dallas Mavericks
The Blog : Billionaire web entrepreneur man-child Mark Cuban is n’t shy .
Since purchasing the Mavericks , Cuban has been fined over $ 1.3 million for 13 separate public statements criticizing NBA officials .
And his blog often seems to be a barely edited transcription of his thoughts .
Why Read It : Though he does n’t blog exclusively about sports–and has been charged by the government for insider trading –Cuban certainly is provocative , stamping his opinion on even the most complex of issues within the first three sentences of each post .
The future of Olympic broadcasting ?
“ ESPN will feel that they have an advantage over NBC . ”
He ’s just as blunt
with his non-sports posts .
On the Wall Street meltdown ?
“ Billions of investment bank share buybacks . ”
He even blogged here and here about his involvement with Mamma.com , the company whose stock , according to SEC charges filed earlier this week , he sold illegally .
Cuban is fun to read because he either really knows what he¹s talking about or he writes smartly enough to hide his ineptitude .
My guess is that it¹s somewhere in the middle , but all of it is golden .
Notable : Cuban is 50 years old , but he looks and acts like Mark Zuckerberg ’s slightly older frat brother .
In June 2008 , he posted a new favorite saying , which reveals almost everything one needs to know about Mark Cuban : “ Today is the youngest you will ever be .
Act like it . ”
Chris Cooley — Washington Redskins TE
The Blog : Chris Cooley , a four - time Pro Bowler , started the blog to help his brother Tanner pay for med school .
Cooley estimates it will generate about $ 250,000 per year in advertising and merchandise sales , more than enough to pay for his sibling ’s education .
Note :
Since he is an incredibly rich young man with an incredibly hot wife , it should n’t surprise that some of the site is NSFW .
Why Read It : Cooley ’s prose is as effortless and hard - hitting as his brain - rattling hits .
His smart , entertaining dispatches on fantasy football ( Vikings RB Adrian Petersen anchors his team ) , his new wife , former Redskins cheerleader Christy Oglevee ( whose saucy photographs reward loyal readers ) and his preparation for each week ’s game ( sweating off excess pounds in the nude and getting pre-game jitters , one of his “ favorite feelings in life ” ) are a riot .
Unlike some shameless self - promoting NFL stars — Chad “ Ocho Cinco ” Johnson , I ’m looking at you — everything Cooley writes is genuine and true to himself .
He never shoves anything down reader ’s throats , and that ’s much of the blog ’s appeal .
Notable Post : Cooley ’s revealed in late April that he celebrated Christy ’s 21st birthday by downing 21 shots of Jim Beam at a bar in West Virginia with her family , taking the sports blog world by storm .
The result : A spread in the Washington Post , interviews on numerous sports shows , and the admiration of football - rabid beer - chugging young men the world over .
advertisement
Curt Schilling — Pitcher , Boston Red Sox The Blog : Curt Schilling is a grizzled 20 - year veteran of pro baseball , probably most famous for the “ Bloody Sock ” that carried the Red Sox to victory in the 2004 ALCS .
He ’s may also be baseball ’s most notorious loudmouth .
He ’s made enemies in front offices , newspapers , and in his own clubhouse over the years .
Once he discovered the Internet ’s potential to more efficiently disseminate his unedited armchair beliefs , he pounced .
Why Read It : Schilling has zero qualms about ranting and raving about everything from the Iraqi War to the Red Sox vs. Yankees War to World of Warcraft ( in another life , he would ’ve been an anime - loving MMORPG addict ) .
A staunch conservative , most of Schilling ’s posts have been about his unabashed preference for the McCain / Palin ticket .
However , the real gold in this blog is found when Schilling waxes philosophical on sports .
It ’s hard to take him seriously when he casually calls Yankees fans “ bitter and miserable , ” but Curt ’s unfiltered writing is what makes this blog so readable .
Notable Post :
The blog often serves as Schilling ’s soapbox for explaining his off - the - cuff and often insensitive remarks about , well , everything .
In May 2007 , he atoned for publicly saying that Barry Bonds had “ admitted to cheating on his wife , cheating on his taxes and cheating on the game . ”
Ouch .
Joe Torre — Manager , Los Angeles Dodgers The Blog : Hosted by MLBlogs , Dodgers manager Joe Torre documents his transition from a steely , jaded , and tough guy New Yorker into a Spago - dining , latte - sipping , shih tzu - owning , resident of sunny Los Angeles .
Torre ’s blog rhapsodizes about life as a West Coaster and genuinely reflects his equally sunny “ new outlook on life . ”
Why Read It : Torre ’s blog is a hybrid between ESPN , Fodor ’s Guide , and Perez Hilton .
That ’s to say : it ’s about sports , travel , and the glamorous life of Los Angeles .
Torre has surprisingly candid and knowledgeable opinions of modern culture for a 63 - year old life - long baseball man ( and grandfather ) .
The blog is possibly ghostwritten , but Torre ’s wry yet sage personality shines through .
Most Revelatory Post : Torre ’s Andy Rooney - esque rant about miniature dogs shows that beneath the Dodger Blue and Hollywood lights , he ’s still just a lovable , curmudgeonly New Yorker at heart : “ I have no idea where you ’d put these little yip - yaps when you go to the restroom , or even why they ’re such a hot accessory ; then again , I just moved from a town where people buy color - coordinated pepper spray cans . ”
advertisement
Gilbert Arenas — Point Guard , Washington Wizards
The Blog : Gilbert Arenas is one of the most colorful and popular players in pro basketball .
His catchphrases and overabundance of charm would make even the writers of “ Full House ” blush .
A self - described “ honest ” blogger who “ really does n’t care what you think , ” Arenas ’ blog was a recipient of the 2007 Weblog Award for “ Best Celebrity Blogger . ”
Why Read It : Arenas was thankfully born without any sort of filter between his brain and his mouth .
As a result , his blog is incredibly candid and entertaining , giving readers a true taste of the man .
Though Arenas is a tad verbose — his most recent entry is 6,000 words long — his entries are as easily digestible as a Dan Brown novel .
Arenas ’ recent knee surgery will keep him sidelined until January , giving him plenty of time to crank out more novella - length blog posts .
Notable Post : Gilbert Arenas takes the cake for foot - in - mouth blog posts .
There are many , but his commentary on this year ’s election gives insight into the man ’s astute political mind .
On party affiliation : “ If you have any type of money , you ’re a Republican , period . ”
On tax reform : “ I know Obama is going to raise taxes on the upper class from 20 - 60 percent . ”
Most telling of all , his views on the very notion of suffrage : “ Obviously , our vote does n’t really mean anything . ”
Anonymous Red Sox Front Office Insider The Blog :
This blog , also on the MLBlogs network , is exactly what it sounds like — an unnamed Red Sox executive anonymously posting their thoughts and feelings about Boston ’s favorite team .
He discusses everything from potential trades to Halloween costumes , but always with a fun and genuine baseball - loving attitude .
Why Read It :
The best part of the Insider ’s blog is reading how the Red Sox higher - ups make decisions , especially since baseball management is notoriously unscientific and unpredictable .
Trades , hirings , and firings can happen on only a few hours ’ notice , and the Insider is a witness to it all .
Plus , it gives die - hard Sawx fans unprecedented access to one of the best - run front offices in baseball .
Notable Post :
What ’s most revealing about the Insider ’s reaction to August ’s Manny Ramirez trade is what he does n’t say .
While General Manager Theo Epstein remarked that without Ramirez the Sox “ feel like a team for the first time in a while , ” the Insider laments that “ we had a great run with Manny , but it ’s time to move on . ”
That ’s an understatement if there ever was one .
Good morning .
My name is Rodney Hulin and I work at a retirement home in Beaumont , Texas .
I am here today because of my son .
He would be here himself if he could , and he would have spoken out against this plan by Congress to house juvenile offenders in adult prisons .
But he can't because he died in one of those prisons .
Rodney Jr. In 1995 , my son , Rodney Jr. , was charged with arson when he was 16 years old .
Luckily , no one was hurt in the fire .
Of course , that does n't excuse the fact that what my son did was foolish .
After admitting his involvement in the offense , my son was sentenced to eight years in an adult prison .
Rodney spent his first year in a prison in Abilene , Texas without any problems .
He had a clean record , and was hopeful he would be recommended for parole in a few years .
Then , without any notice , he was transferred to the Clemens Unit in Brazoria County on November 13 , 1995 .
Almost immediately , the problems began .
Less than a week after the transfer , Rodney wrote to me from his new unit .
It was obvious that his situation had taken a turn for the worse .
Let me read a quick excerpt from that letter .
" Dad , I 'm really scared , scared that I will die in here .
Please pray for me .
Pray that I will get my job changed , sent to a hospital , get out of here alive , and that I will get out on parole ... I want to live with you when I get out , if I get out alive " .
My son was a fighter , so I knew he was n't just letting prison life get to him .
The new prison was different .
The inmates were tougher ; the guards had less control and did n't seem to care what happened to Rodney , who was just 17 years old at the time .
WARDEN : Rodney 's abuses did n't meet the ' emergency grievance criteria . '
Two days after he sent me that letter , my son was raped and sodomized by an inmate .
The doctor found two tears in his rectum and ordered an HIV test , since up to a third of the 2,200 inmates there were HIV positive .
Fearing for his safety , he requested to be placed in protective custody , but his request was denied because , as the warden put it , " Rodney 's abuses did n't meet the ' emergency grievance criteria ' " .
For the next several months , my son was repeatedly beaten by the older inmates , forced to perform oral sex , robbed , and beaten again .
Each time , his requests for protection were denied by the warden .
The abuses , meanwhile , continued .
On the night of January 26 , 1996 - - 75 days after my son entered Clemens -- Rodney attempted suicide by hanging himself in his cell .
He could no longer stand to live in continual terror .
It was too much for him to handle .
He laid in a coma for the next four months until he died .
The night of the suicide , my son had written about being tired of prison life , and tired of living .
That letter had been passed onto a prison guard by a friend of my son , who told the guard that Rodney needed immediate attention .
The guard shrugged off any concern and walked in the opposite direction .
Sometime during those next 15 minutes , before the guard made his rounds to my son's cell , my son decided he had enough and acted on his depression .
Unlike that prison guard , Congress could not have done anything to save my son .
But , Congress does have the power to prevent my son's tragedy from happening to others .
Sending young children to adult prisons will not make our streets any safer .
Sending children to be beaten , raped , and robbed does not deter crime .
I did not give up on my son , then , and I do n't believe Congress should give up on our nation 's children now .
Children who commit crimes need to be rehabilitated , and shown consideration and care .
They do not deserve to be crucified for political gain .
If there is any lesson to be learned by my son's death , it is that children must not be locked up with adult criminals .
インタフェースの大変動
最初の30年は始まりにすぎなかった
InterCommunication No. 60 Spring 2007 特集 「 デザイン／サイエンス 」 に寄稿 渡邊恵 太
本稿は、近年のインターフェイス・デザインの考え方の変化について述べるものである。最初にインターフェイスの視点から現在動きの活発な企業や考え方について紹介する。そして、その企業に共通する点から認知科学的アプローチの限界を示唆する。それを背景に、これからのインターフェイスの考え方について述べる。
はじめに
今日のユーザー・インターフェイス研究の流れは、大きな変化を見せはじめている。たとえば、Macintoshとユーザー・インターフェイスは切っても切れない関係で、常に先端をリードしてきた存在である。そのApple社が先日の「 Macworld Expo 2007 」 にて、
「 最初の30年は始まりにすぎなかった
（The first 30 years were just the beginning ） 」というコピーを掲げた。そして同時
にApple Computer社からComputerの単語が外れApple社となった。つまり、Appleはコンピュータだけの会社ではないことを明確にしたのだ。ユーザー・インターフェイスの研究者は、コンピュータをコンピュータと意識させないようにすることを目指してきた。その意味で、ようやく30年が経過し、ユーザー・インターフェイスの研究の成果が見えはじめたのかもしれない。
さら にApple社以外の新しい企業も動きが活発だ。たとえば、任天堂やIDEO、そしてGoogleといった企業だ。これらの企業も、いまやユーザー・インターフェイスの考え方なしには語れない。改めて考えてみると、30年のユーザー・インターフェイスという産業の歴史は短いものだ。それに、その30年の多くはオフィス環境を中心としたユーザー・インターフェイスの展開だった。それに比べれば、今日のユビキタスやモバイル環境におけるユーザー・インターフェイス研究の歴史はようやく最初の一歩を踏みだしたにすぎない。
さて 、Apple、任天堂、IDEO、Googleなど、今熱い企業はユーザー・インターフェイスを軸にそれぞれが新しいスタートを切った。今後ますますユーザー・インターフェイスを軸にコンピュータ・テクノロジーの利用は拡大するだろう。
Apple、任天堂、IDEO、Google、そしてユビキタス
これらは、いずれも現在活躍している企業、もしくは考え方である。これらの企業に共通しているのは、積極的にコンピュータのテクノロジーを利用し、インターフェイス・デザインに力を注いでいることである。ただしこれらの企業は、従来のインターフェイスの考え方を超越したところに現在到達している。まず、それぞれの企業の特徴をインターフェイスやヒューマン・コンピュータ・インタラクション（HCI）の観点から紹介していこう。
Apple： ユーザー・インターフェイスからユーザー・エクスペリエンスへ
Apple社は元祖パーソナル・コンピュータの会社であり、元祖ユーザー・インターフェイス（UI）を軸にした企業である。今日、iPodやiTunesといったサービスへの展開には目を見張るものがあり、単純にパーソナル・コンピュータをつくる会社というイメージではなくなりつつある。
さて 、Appleが生みだすさまざまな製品、サービスを見ていると、いずれも「ユーザーとの関係」を深く意識したものが多い。その意味で、サービスというレベルも含めたユーザー・インターフェイスを展開しているといえる。具体的には、Appleが提供する新しいかたちの「音楽を聴く」という経験は、iPodだけで成立するものではなく、iTunesも提供しなければ成り立たない。他にも成功の要素はあるが、一言でいえば「ユーザー・エクスペリエンス」という言葉でまとめることができるだろう。
つまり、今日形のない情報が軸である以上、モノのインターフェイスの良し悪しだけを語ることはできず、最終的に「ユーザーがどういった経験をするか」が重要になってきているわけである。Apple社のやり方は、さまざまな先端技術をどうやって人間に提供していくかの手本となるものといえる。
任天堂：インタラクション・デザインの最先端
テレビゲームという玩具の会社といった印象が強い企業である。玩具である以上、子供の世界のものということもあり、Apple社などのパーソナル・コンピュータという道具をつくる会社とは正反対の世界に見える。しかし、任天堂は、目的の違いはあるにせよ、Apple社と同様に先端の情報機器を一般の人々に対して提供している。そして、インターフェイス、インタラクションのデザインという意味では最先端をいく企業であると筆者は認識している。ファミコンとともに育ってきた世代にとってみれば、Windows 95が登場して、それに触れたとしても、実はファミコンの経験のほうが圧倒的な「すごみ」と完成度があり、パソコンのUIやウェブ・ブラウザーが提供する情報は、むしろ貧弱な世界になったという印象を受けざるを得ない。この「すごみ」はどうやって作りだされているのだろうか。
近年、テレビゲームが文化として認識されはじめたり、アカデミックな視点で分析されたりすることも増えてきた。ただ、社会学的にマクロな視点でテレビゲームを捉えることが多く、インターフェイス・デザインという視点から大きく取り上げられることはいまだに少ない。おそらく、任天堂をはじめゲームソフト会社はインタラクティヴなシステムをつくるための考え方やノウハウを蓄積していると考えられるのに、それを一般化したり体系化したりして世に出していないためであろう。しかも、ときにはそれをクリエイター個人のセンスと見なしていることも少なくない。
任天堂がインターフェイスの企業であるという認識がこれまで薄かったのは、インターフェイスという言葉がまず一般的ではなかったことにも原因がある。ゲームは所詮ゲームであるという認識から、任天堂のやり方に注目が集まらなかったこともあるだろう。しかし、近年大ヒットしている、タッチペンを使ったモバイル端末である任天堂DS、そして先日発売されたばかりの、加速度センサーを利用し片手で利用可能なリモコン型コントローラーが特徴のWiiというゲーム機は、いずれも「インターフェイス」を前面に打ちだした製品となっている。さらに、ゲーム人口の拡大のスローガンを掲げ、新しいユーザー層に対するゲームを柱にした新しい事業展開を図っている。これによって、いまや任天堂はインターフェイス、インタラクション「デザイン」の企業であるという認識が広まりつつある。
タッチペン やWiiリモコンばかりが目立つが、グラフィカルな画面デザイン、音の利用の仕方においても、以前から任天堂のゲーム機はPCのGUIのはるか先を進んでいるといっても過言ではない。たとえば、「スーパーマリオ」だけ見ても、とにかく参考になる点は多い。
ソフトを差し込み、電源を入れると「デモモード」があり、何もしないと「どういったゲームであるか」を実際にプレイしている様子の紹介ムーヴィーが流れる。
時間切れが近づくと、BGMのテンポが上がりユーザーを「あせらせる」音の効果的使用法。
スーパーファミコンの「スーパーマリオワールド」は、ファミコンから増えたボタンを積極的に使い、ユーザーにコントローラの学習をさせるように設計。
といった例がある 。
他にも、ゲームの特徴として、数個のボタンだけで、実に多彩なことを可能にする仕組みを導入している。たとえば、車や飛行機の運転、サッカー、野球、格闘技。たくさんの種類のゲームを画面上で実現していること、さらに、身体を使わずにただ指を動かし、画面を見つめているだけで、ある種のリアリティや経験が得られていることもポイントである。この意味を改めて考えてみる価値はあるだろう。言い換えれば、Wiiリモコンのように、実世界で私たちが本当にそうするように体を動かすことでゲームをすることは、わかりやすさという点では優れているが、自分の身体の制約とゲーム画面内の制約の不一致によって、ゲームの世界と実世界が乖離してしまう可能性も考えられる。これら人間の知覚や制御などの観点からも、今後十分議論していく必要がある。
Google：もはやUIとインタラクションの会社
Googleといえば検索エンジンの会社として有名である。ペイジ・ランクというユーザーのリンクによる価値づけによって検索結果がリストアップされるという特徴を持つ検索エンジンである。つい先日までは検索サービスしか提供していなかったが、今日、メールや地図、カレンダー、デスクトップ検索などまで提供する会社となった。そのほとんどがウェブ・ブラウザー上で利用可能な点も大きな特徴といえる。ユーザーがそこにアクセスするだけで、ダウンロードやインストールを意識することなく、ユーザーは常に最新のアプリケーションを利用しつづけることができる。
じつはこういったインターネット上でのメールやカレンダー、地図などのサービスはGoogleが始めるだいぶ前からあった。しかし、Googleは従来のサービスとは異なりAjax（Asynchronous
JavaScript＋XML）と呼ばれる手法を多用し、クリックなしに動的に変化するユーザー・インターフェイスを実現した。たとえば、従来のウェブ上の地図はドラッグして動かすことはできなかったが、Google Mapsでは地図をドラッグして動かすことが可能となり、ウェブ関係の開発者を驚かせた。彼らのあいだでそれ以後Ajaxという手法が流行し、それは今日も続いている。Ajaxは新技術というより、昔からあった各技術の組み合わせであり、同じようなことを実現できる仕組みとしては、他にもAdobe 社のFlashがあり、地図をドラッグするというプログラムを書くのには、むしろAjaxよりもFlashのほうが適している面がある。開発者が驚いたのはその点でもある。つまりわざわざ問題の多いJavaScriptを使って、Flashでやるようなことをしているという点である。
ここからわかるのは 、Googleはユーザー・インターフェイスに対して相当のこだわりを持っていることである。そして、そのことはGoogleの根本にある考え方とも関係してくる。Googleにおけるユーザー・インターフェイスの考え方は、従来のユーザーにとって「使いやすい」システムを提供するためのユーザー・インターフェイスとは異なってくるのである。これについては後述する。
IDEO ：方法論のプロフェッショナル
IDEO はパロアルトにあるインタラクション・デザイン専門の会社で、人類学、工学、デザインなど、さまざまな専門を持つ人材が共に働いている会社である。IDEOの特徴は徹底した「方法論」の確立と、それを忠実に実行する点である。アイディアを出す手法にも徹底した独自の方法を取り入れ、また現場主義の調査・分析、即座にプロトタイプの試作を開始するなど、最終的なアウトプットまでの段取りができあがっている。まさに二一世紀のものづくりと呼べるような、プロセス、仕事場、チームづくりなどあらゆる面でデザイン業界をリードしている会社である。IDEOが成功している理由は、世の中の物事がもはや一人では解決できないほど複雑であり、チームワークで仕事をしなくては解決できないような問題である、ということに直面するその姿勢にある。その際、さまざまな専門家が必要になってくるが、単純に集まっているだけでは専門家どうしの衝突で終わってしまう。しかしIDEOは、そこに「方法論」を確立し、その方法を中心として、それぞれの明確な役割が明示化されたタスクを遂行していける環境となっている。
後に述べるユーザー指向ユビキタスにおいて、民俗学的手法の必要性について触れるが、IDEOは以前からその点を実践しており、実際に多数の成果を出している。これも現在の私たちの生活には、多くのモノをはじめ、その周辺にはたくさんの社会的制約があるからであり、人間工学的、認知・心理的、そして今日、社会的な視点からものづくりを考えなければ、最終的にはユーザーにとって「使いにくい、使えない」モノと見なされてしまうのである。
ユビキタス ： 「 遍在」は本質ではない
ユビキタス・コンピューティングという考え方は、今日の情報機器関連における大きなテーマの一つだろう。ユビキタス・コンピューティングはXerox社のパロアルト研究所（PARC）のマーク・ワイザー（Mark Weiser）によって一九九一年に提唱された概念である。今日、ユビキタスは、「遍在するコンピュータ」という「いつでも、どこでも、だれでも」というスローガンとともに広まった概念だと思われている。しかし、提唱者であるマーク・ワイザーの論文「21世紀のコンピュータ」（『日経サイエンス』一九九一年、一一月号）を読んでみればわかるが、それは少し違う。
有線と無線でつながれた数百台ものコンピュータは、私たちがその存在を意識しないような形で生活の中にとけ込んでいく。
最も完全な技術とは、表面に出てこない技術である。日常生活という織物の中に完全に織り込まれてしまっていて、個々の技術自体が私たちの目に見えなくなっているものだ。確かに五〇〇〇万台以上のパソコンがすでに販売されてはいるが、コンピュータはそれだけで単独の世界を構成しているにすぎない。
こうしたコンピュータの「消滅」は、技術的発展の帰結ではなく、人間の心理的な帰結によるものである。あることを十分に理解すると、人間はそのものを意識しなくなる。たとえば街角の標識を見たとき、情報を読んでいると意識せずに情報を取得するだろう。（……）Herbert A. Simonはこの現象を「熟達」と呼び、また哲学者のMichael Polanyiは 「暗黙の次元」と呼んだ。心理学者のJ. J. Gibson は 「 視覚的不変項」と呼び、哲学者のHans-Georg Gadamerは 「 地平」、ま たMartin Heidegger は「熟練」と称している。PARCのJohn Seely Brownは「周辺」と呼ぶ。これらすべてに共通なのは、それを意識せず使うことができ、当面する目標に集中できることである。
興味深いのはこのあたりの話であるのに、最近のユビキタスではこういったことが引用されてくることはない。「遍在」しか出てこない。さらに興味深いことに、マーク・ワイザー本人は、この「ユビキタス」という言葉は誤用だったことを示唆している。それは、タンジブル・ビットを提唱した石井裕氏の寄稿論文からわかる。石井氏のタンジブル・ビットの考え方に共感したマーク・ワイザーは石井氏とメールをやりとりし、マーク・ワイザーは本当はタンジブル・ビットのようなことをやりたかったとしている。以下は石井氏の寄稿論文からの引用である。
このように、今日の 「ユビキタス」という言葉にはそういった背景の思想がなく、「いつでも、どこでも、だれでも」と、ある意味わかりやすくなったが、同時に簡略化されたかたちで流通してしまっている。遍在ということ自体は、哲学というほどのものはない。コンピュータが小型化し増えていくのは予想に難くないことだ。もちろん、ユビキタスという言葉によって産業が活性化されたことも事実であるので、ユビキタスが悪いということではない。
しかし、ユビキタスの考え方は、「 熟達 」 「 暗黙の次元 」 「 視覚的不変項 」 「地平 」 「熟練 」 「周辺」などの、人間の心理や認知的性質から出発しているところが見逃されているのがもったいない。現在、多くの大手企業がユビキタスという目先の言葉に引っ張られ、技術的にはセンサーやネットワークを使えるものの、「つくったものを何に使うか?」というところで悩んでいる企業が多い。事実そういった相談を研究室で受けることも少なくない。筆者の研究室では以前から、こういったセンサーやネットワークなどを中心とした、いわゆる現代のユビキタスを「技術指向ユビキタス」と呼び、マーク・ワイザーがもともと述べていたようなユビキタスを「ユーザー指向ユビキタス」として区別している。ユーザー指向ユビキタスは、日常生活で人間がどのような生活を送っているかという視点から、必要な技術を持ち込む手法をとる。そこで研究室では、社会学やエスノグラフイー(民俗学的手法)などの手法が不可欠であると認識しており、同時にプロトタイプを製作して実際に体験できるレベルにすることが不可欠であると考えている。なぜなら、試作が新しい対象である以上、まず体験を可能にしなければ、その良し悪しは議論できないためだ。仮に試作なしに議論し言語化や定義をしても、実際に試作し体験してみると、その言葉の定義は揺らいでしまうことさえある。
「 認知科学の枠を超える」という共通点
Appleも任天堂もIDEOもGoogleも、そしてユビキタスの考え方も、それらに共通しているのは認知科学の枠を超えつつある点だ。いずれの企業も人間を再定義しつつある。私たちは何らかのパラダイムのもとに生きており、人々の考え方はそのパラダイムに影響されている。近代のパラダイム形成には認知科学が影響してきた。しかし、今日認知科学が作りだしてきた「人間観」にも限界が見えつつある。
認知科学は総合的な科学で、その中心は分化したさまざまな研究領域から成り立っている。認知科学は一九五〇年代末に誕生し、人工知能と計算機科学とセットで発展してきた。今日もその考え方は私たちのコンピュータへの考え方の暗黙の前提として大きな影響を与えている。
ちなみに認知科学の定義は、たとえばWikipediaによれば、「情報処理の観点から知的システムと知能の性質を理解しようとする研究分野」である。ここでわかる通り、この情報処理という言葉の影響は、今日多大なものである。
認知科学によって今日も続いているのは、「人間も情報処理をするコンピュータみたいなものだ」という考え方である。そして同時にコンピュータも、センサーを人間の感覚に相当するものと見なし、CPUが脳みたいなものだという比喩が自然と立ち現われる。さらにそこに人工知能の世界が生まれる。人工知能の最も典型的な例は、チューリング・テストの合格条件を満たすような、すなわち「人間と同じ知性を持つ仕組みをコンピュータでつくること」である。最近ブームでもあるコンピュータによるロボット研究開発の分野も、その延長といっていいだろう。認知科学と人工知能はほとんど同じような歴史を歩んできており、「コンピュータによる人間の知性の再現」は、コンピュータ・テクノロジーの夢であり、計算機科学の最も高度な領域であったといえる。
そして、この影響は今日も続いており、幅広い。たとえば多くのSF漫画やアニメ、映画が、じつはこの前提のうえに成り立っており、だれもがコンピュータを用いて「人間」のようなシステムができると信じて疑わない。たとえば、『二〇〇一年宇宙の旅』に出てくるHALというシステム、最近の『攻殻機動隊』や『新世紀エヴァンゲリオン』なども、アニメや映画とはいえ、人工知能の概念に強く影響されているものである。おそらく、コンピュータを人間として捉えるという比喩が「きわめてわかりやすい」ということがその影響の原因だろう。しかしながら結果的に、認知科学や人工知能の分野はフレーム問題などの多くの問題を提示しただけで、現在のコンピュータでは人間と同じような知性を持つシステムはいまだにできていない。研究者さえこのわかりやすい比喩の影響は大きいと予測できるが、アニメや映画のヴィジョンと現実とは明確に分けて考えなければならない。
テリー・ウィノグラード
人工知能の世界を先導していたテリー・ウィノグラードは、その研究経歴の途中で、人工知能の限界を示唆し、以後、人工知能の実現に批判的な立場をとるようになった。その後、HCIの分野に転身し、さらにその後、現象学に基づくソフトウェアの設計やソフトウェア・デザインの研究を行なっている。
テリー・ウィノグラード とGoogleの深い関係
さて、興味深いのはここからである。それは、このテリー・ウィノグラードが、Googleの創始者であるラリー・ペイジの指導教授であった点である。Googleのコアのアルゴリズム「ペイジ・ランク」の論文は、ラリー・ペイジとテリー・ウィノグラードの共著となっている。
ペイジ・ランクのアルゴリズムは、簡単にいえば「人間の手によってリンクされたことを価値」としたアルゴリズムである。従来は、ある意味でコンピュータがウェブの内容を解釈して、ユーザーの入力したキーワードから適切なページを取りだそうというのが、ウェブ検索の大きな方向性であった。つまり、コンピュータが解釈するという人工知能的アプローチだった。
しかし、ペイジ・ランク的なアルゴリズムでは、コンピュータが解釈することをせずに、ウェブにおいて〝人間がふだん行なっている行為〟に着目し、それを意味としたのである。それが成功の秘訣だったと考えられる。ウェブ上でも、ペイジ・ランク自体のアルゴリズムをレヴューする人が多いのだが、ペイジ・ランクの本質は、アルゴリズム自体というよりも、そういった〝ウェブにおける暗黙的な人間の活動をアルゴリズムに置き換えた〟ことに価値がある。
ペイジ・ランクとUI
ユーザーのやっていることを見よ
ペイジ・ランクの発想自体は、今日のHCIの考え方にも等しいものがある。つまり、インターフェイスの設計にあたり、「ユーザーのやっていること」を観察し、そこにヒントがあるという捉え方である。UIの設計の際に現場に調査しに行き、「何か使いにくいことはありませんか?」と訊くのはタブーである。なぜなら、ユーザーは自分自身がやっていることはわからないからだ。その場合、ユーザーの述べることは本質ではなく、何らかの原因から派生した勘違いということもある。したがって、調査において重要なのはインターフェイスの専門家が現場に共に入り、ユーザーの「いつもやっていること」を観察することである。観察によって「ユーザーの言っていることではなく、やっていることを信じろ」というのはいまや常識となっている。
Googleが検索エンジンの価値基準に「ユーザーがリンクするという行為」をおいた点はHCI的であり、従来のウェブの内容をコンピュータに解釈させようとしたアプローチとは正反対である。その意味で、ペイジ・ランクは反人工知能的アプローチともいえる。そして、こういった反人工知能的手法がGoogleを成功に導いたとするならば、今後のコンピュータの捉え方は大きく変わっていくだろう。今日のWeb 2.0の世界はそういった潮流の初期段階であるともいえる。
ユーザー・インターフェイスの役割の変化
UI は行為を引きだすためにある
さて、このようなGoogleのやり方や、人工知能によらない手法でシステムを高度化する際に重要になるのは「ユーザーの行為」である。それはユーザーの行為が、意味をつくるためである。したがって、ユーザーの行為を引きだすことが、ユーザー・インターフェイスの役割になりつつある。
人間の知性は何らかのモノや周辺と接触するときに表出する。厳密にいえば、私たち人間は常に具体的な環境の中にいる。それゆえにユーザーの行為は常に意味があり、行為は常にある特定の環境と相補的な関係で露わになる。
その意味をどれだけコンピュータが把握できるようにするかが鍵となる。ここで重要なことは、ユーザーの行為の意味を解釈するのは、設計者でありコンピュータ自体ではない。少なくとも今日、人間を最もよく知っているのは人間自身である。したがって設計者がユーザーの暗黙的な行為の中に意味を発見し、それをコンピュータで汲みとれるように形式化できる仕組みをつくることが求められる。これがユーザー・インターフェイスの役割である。言い換えれば、ユーザー・インターフェイスの役割は〝人間の暗黙知を形式知に変換する〟ことである。
暗黙知を形式知に変えるために
ユーザー・インターフェイスの設計において、「入力」を作りだしてはいけない。わかりやすい例は、アンケートの自由筆記である。前提なしに自由筆記で書かれた内容は、コンピュータが解釈することがきわめて困難となるからだ。コンピュータで計算可能にするためには、パラメータ化が必要である。したがって、ユーザー・インターフェイスは「入力」の手段というよりも、行為によって価値の「調整」をする手段でなければならない。コンピュータへの入力、パラメータ化という点で「マークシート方式」があるが、これはコンピュータの形式そのままであり、このやり方は人間の賢さを露わにするには適切ではない。
では、調整とは何か。下の写真は筆者の散らかった部屋の中であるが、これは暗黙知が形式知に変換された結果である。つまり、これは勝手に散らかったのではなく、筆者がそこに配置したのである。言いわけと聞こえるかもしれないが、これは人間の知性の一つにほかならない。〝移動可能なモノ〟が周囲にたくさん提供されたことで、よく使うものほど近くに配置し、そうでないものほど遠くに配置するという〝動かす〟調整行為が可能になったためである。これは〝近い│遠い〟などでパラメータ化が可能だ。
また別の例では、大量の音楽を聞くことが可能なユーザー・インターフェイスを持つアプリケーションを使ってもらえば、何が好きな曲であるかをパラメータ化することはできる。さらにより暗黙知的な領域では、音楽のサビ抽出の研究があるが、これは信号解析によるものが多い。しかし、店頭の視聴機で早送りや巻き戻しをして、最も聴かれる部分からメロディのサビが抽出できる可能性がある。また、カラオケのマイクに加速度センサーなどを取りつけ、動きが激しくなる部分からサビが抽出可能かもしれない。歌声の音量からもサビの抽出ができるだろう。このあたりは実際にプロトタイプを作成しパラメータを抽出しないと納得してもらえないかもしれない。しかし重要なことは、ユーザーにサビ抽出のために何かをさせているのではなく、あるモノを提供することで、それに対応する独特の人間の行為を引きだし、そこから意味を抽出できるという点が重要なのだ。
このような視点でのユーザー・インターフェイスの役割は、循環し、またより優れたユーザー・インターフェイスを提供することである。形式知として蓄積されたデータがUIとしてフィードバックすることで、インタラクション・ループが発生し、「使う価値」が生まれてくる。Googleも多くの人が使うほどに、優れた検索結果一覧を返す仕組みを提供しつづけることができる。コンピュータが解釈する人工知能ができない以上、このような手法を用いて、今後もシステムの高度化が進んでいくと考えられる。
また、インターフェイスのユーザビリティという点においても、単純に「人間にとっての使いやすさ」ではなくなってくる。それはつまり、間違いやすい行為の発生はパラメータ化にとってノイズとなるためである。したがって、ユーザビリティは「人間にとって」だけではなく、高度なシステムの質を維持するための必然的な要素となるだろう。
まとめ：コンピュータにおいてインターフェイスは最も高度な領域
今日 、Apple、任天堂、IDEOそしてGoogleといった企業が実践している考え方が、インターフェイスやインタラクション・デザインを中核として産業に大きな影響を与えている。いずれも最新のテクノロジーと共にある企業であるが、これらの企業の共通項は従来の認知科学の枠組からやや外れた新しい人間観に基づき活動している点であることを見てきた。認知科学が人間を情報処理という観点から捉えたことは、今日もさまざまな分野で影響している。しかし、かつて最も高度な領域であった、人間が考えるようにコンピュータに仕事をさせてタスクを解決する手法は保留となった。その点で、HCIからのアプローチに期待がかかってくる。つまり、道具や環境とインタラクトする人間という視点から、人間の知性を定義してゆく必要がある。したがって、HCIの分野はコンピュータにおける最も難易度の高い課題になったといえるだろう。人工知能と共にあった認知科学のパラダイムは、インターフェイスやインタラクション・デザインの新しい局面において難しい問題を抱えており、私たちは新しい一歩を踏みだす必要がある。今後は、たとえば現象学や生態心理学、そしてエスノグラフィーなど、より現場に沿った地点から私たち人間の行為を捉える視点、つまり「日常で何をしているのか」を捉えるような視点が必要になるだろう。

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush on Wednesday hailed the election of Barack Obama as " a triumph of the American story . "
" Americans can be proud of the history that was made yesterday , " President Bush said Wednesday .
Obama 's rise to become the nation 's first black president is " a testament to hard work , optimism and a faith in the enduring promise of our nation , " Bush said in the White House Rose Garden .
" No matter how they cast their ballots , all Americans can be proud of the history that was made yesterday , " said Bush , whose second term in the Oval Office will end when Obama is sworn in on January 20 .
Bush said he had called Obama and had also spoken to his opponent , Sen. John McCain .
" I congratulated [ McCain ] on a determined campaign that he and Gov. [ Sarah ] Palin ran , " the president said .
Watch Bush praise presidential candidates »
Bush said turning over the White House to Obama " will be a stirring sight . "
" I know millions of Americans will be overcome with pride at this inspiring moment that so many have waited for for so long , " Bush said .
Moving toward Obama 's January 20 inauguration , Bush promised the president - elect he can count on " complete cooperation " as he makes the transition to the White House .
Speaking later at the State Department , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said her department " will do everything that we can " to ensure a smooth transition .
Watch Rice pledge a smooth turnover at the State Department »
Rice , an African - American like Obama , also called Tuesday 's election " an extraordinary step forward " in the nation 's history .
" I am especially proud because this is a country that 's been through a long journey in terms of overcoming wounds , and making race not the factor in our lives , " Rice said .
Bush warned America 's enemies not to expect any letup in national security during the transition .
" The United States government will stay vigilant in meeting its most important responsibility , protecting the American people , " Bush said .
On Thursday , Obama is expected to receive his first top - secret intelligence briefing , similar to the one Bush gets every day , according to U.S. officials familiar with the process .
In a message to CIA employees obtained by CNN , CIA Director Michael Hayden says Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell will lead Obama 's first briefing .
Bush pledged to fulfill his duties as president until the final day of his presidency .
" I will continue to conduct the people 's business as long as the office remains in my trust , " the nation 's 43rd president said .

Pamela Anderson Posts Open Letter to Obama
has posted a blog entry on her website that is intended as an open letter to President - elect
The blonde bombshell apparently wanted to pass along some good ideas for helping him to improve the economy and the environment at the same time .
Her ideas are varied and rambling and include promoting vegetarianism and castrating molesters .
A particularly interesting snippet by Pamela :
" I think we should Legalize Marijuana , tax and monitor farm Hemp , etc .
This would make our borders less corrupt and then I think eventually this will be a more secure option and save children in the long run .
We should be able to farm Hemp in America - it 's just silly - it would create jobs - and be good for the environment . "
Now that we have that out of the way , check out our photo gallery below .
I faced life in jail ... just for writing about Milton Keynes
Happy memory : Sally and autistic son James at a local charity ball in 2006 .
When her arrest made it impossible for her to look after him , she had to have James placed in a care home
Ironically , it was with a feeling of smug satisfaction , so pitifully rare in my life as a disorganised journalist and busy mum , that I stepped out on that sunny May morning to buy wallpaper for my youngest daughter Kate 's bedroom .
My children were happy : they were reasonably polite and I usually managed to feed them vegetables .
Our cottage , into which we'd moved just six days previously , was finally resembling less of a builders ' yard and more of a dwelling place .
And my career ran pleasantly and reliably on the well - oiled wheels of an entire working life spent in the same busy town .
I was born in Milton Keynes when it was a village .
I completed my journalistic apprenticeship on one local newspaper and I was still there , 32 years later , on another .
I 'd worked part - time for 20 years to fit in with the needs of my autistic son James , but I knew the town inside out .
My dog-eared contacts book bulged with trusted names and numbers .
There were councillors , local dignitaries , gossipy hairdressers , teachers ... and , of course , police officers .
That sun-soaked morning last year , there was no flicker of premonition that my world was about to be torn apart in a frenzy of police officers , criminal investigations and court proceedings that would threaten not just my own family life but the country 's perception of Press freedom .
I had n't a clue , as I shopped in Laura Ashley , that eight plainclothes police officers were poised to arrest me , lock me in a cell , interrogate me , strip - search me and finally put me in the dock for a multi-million - pound Crown Court trial after which I could technically be sent to prison for life .
I had no understanding of what heinous crime they thought I 'd committed .
Officially , I was charged with three counts of the ancient common - law offence of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office - the same charges levelled at Shadow Immigration Minister Damian Green last week when he was arrested over claims he had leaked confidential Government documents .
I recall how , in that heart - stopping moment when the police arrested me , I misunderstood them and , clutching my Toile de Jouy wallpaper to my chest , declared I was far too old to do indecent things in public places .
I 'd never done anything naughty outside , I assured them .
' Well , not since I was about 17 , ' I remember adding stupidly .
They must have thought I was crazy , babbling on about al fresco sex .
In fact , I was being accused of encouraging a police officer to give me information - stories the police authorities do not want in the public domain .
Each of the charges referred to stories I had written or cases I knew about .
None of the stories could be described as being of national importance .
One concerned a local footballer involved in a brawl , another about the death of a former drug offender and a third , which was never published , involved an Islamist released early from prison .
But these officers were n't like the old - style coppers I knew , ones who enjoyed a pint with a journalist , exchanging moans about the spate of local burglaries , a sigh over the criminal justice system or perhaps a tip - off about an interesting court case that was coming up .
Those officers were my friends .
Local newspapers cared about their community , and police officers devoted themselves to keeping that community safe .
We were their conduit to the public .
We helped each other .
It all changed with one phone call .
My mobile rang as I drove home from Laura Ashley .
Before the storm : Sally and her daughters at a friend 's wedding just before she was arrested .
Kate 's face has been obscured at the family 's request
Perhaps it was a problem with James .
My partner , Kate 's father , was working away , so domestic duties that day were my responsibility .
Worried , I risked answering the call while driving .
' This is Inspector Gary Young . '
' Oh hi , Gary . '
Did I know him ?
Did he want me to write a story ?
The answer to both questions was no .
' I want you to drive home immediately , ' he said .
My hands slid on the wheel as I tried to steer into a lay - by .
Something was wrong .
' Tell me , ' I pleaded .
' Are they OK ? '
' Your children are fine . '
He sounded almost embarrassed .
I heard the word ' arrest ' .
He was arresting me - by telephone , while I was driving .
I drove the seven miles to our Bedfordshire cottage .
By now my phone was beeping with messages from my office : ' Police are everywhere .
They 've seized your computer .
They 're taking your notebooks ...'
As I pulled into my driveway , I was surrounded by police .
It was so surreal I could barely register the fact that they were searching my car , my house , even my garden shed , asking about documents , bank accounts , notebooks .
Dumbly , I did the only thing I could think of : I offered them coffee .
' Gosh , ' I remember saying , ' you 're my very first visitors in this house .
Do you take sugar ? '
When one WPC upended a box of builders ' receipts , I was puzzled .
When another rifled through my purse , I was mystified .
But when officers trooped towards my children 's bedrooms , the true horror struck .
' What are you looking for ? '
I demanded .
Slowly , I realised this Sweeney - style nightmare was connected with Mark Kearney , a police officer about to retire after 30 years ' service .
Mark and I had met in 1992 when he was the Milton Keynes police Press officer and I was a single mum .
It was common knowledge that we'd been in a relationship and , when it ended , we were still best friends , speaking daily on the phone .
To my son , Mark had always been a mentor and a hero : he had been an invaluable help in the daily battles generated by autism and learning disability in a lively young man who needed round - the - clock supervision .
Now Mark had been arrested , too .
In my befuddled state I spotted two officers wearing white space - type suits in my garden , more of them under my car .
Was I hallucinating ?
Panic set in when they bagged up my mobile phone and address book containing numbers for childminders and James 's helpers .
Sally was amazed by the parallels between her experiences and those of MP Damian Green , pictured leaving his West London home this week after nine hours in police custody
With a landline still to be fitted in the cottage , these people could no longer call me .
Domestic worries swirled around my head .
I needed to get our computer fixed so my eldest , Lucy , could download her GCSE coursework .
I had to collect ten - year - old Kate from school .
I had to check on James , out with a relative .
And I 'd promised Kate we 'd collect her long - awaited new kitten .
' I 'm so sorry , but I really must go , ' I told one officer .
He blinked twice and said : ' You have to come to the police station with us . '
I was ushered into a car and allowed one phone call - to Kate 's father .
' Help , ' I sobbed .
' The police are taking me . '
Although the local police station was two minutes away , I was taken 40 miles to Banbury because these officers were from Thames Valley Police Professional Standards Department .
Ah . . .
The people who ' police ' the police .
But why me ?
I agonised , as they fingerprinted , photographed and stripped me of every belonging apart from one tear - stained tissue .
The cell door closed .
I sat on the bunk , staring at the concrete walls , the lavatory bowl and the cameras that watched me .
I was desperate for the loo but terrified they would see me .
And there was no loo paper .
My watch had been confiscated but I knew it was night - time .
I remember , in a blur of darkness , begging for the medication I take four times a day to prevent migraine attacks .
I was crippled with worry about my children - and I would have sold my soul for a roll of loo paper and a bar of soap .
The interview , when it finally took place the following afternoon , was a blur of bizarre allegations about paying police officers bribes and selling stories to national newspapers for huge sums .
' Do n't say a word , ' warned my legal adviser .
I ignored him .
I had nothing to hide .
' Yes , journalists sell on the odd story , ' I said .
' No , local papers never pay for stories .
Yes , of course I have local police contacts . '
Name them , they said .
I shook my head .
Under the Press Complaints Commission code of conduct all journalists have a ' moral obligation ' to protect their contacts .
We paused for a Superintendent 's Review : I 'd been detained for so long they now needed higher authority to question me further .
That was when , to employ a cliché I 've probably misused hundreds of times at work , the bombshell dropped .
This man I 'd never met before looked me in the eye and said : ' You are under investigation for an extremely serious offence .
You could go to prison .
For life .'
Vindicated : Sally after the charges against her were dropped this week
The words were still ringing in my ears when I was discharged that evening into the arms of my bewildered family .
' Do n't worry about my coursework , Mum , ' whispered Lucy .
' I can wait a bit longer for my kitten , ' said Kate , bottom lip trembling .
' Hey Ma , where 've you been ? ' grinned James , blissfully unaware .
The months that followed were grim .
The second interview was preceded by a strip search ( naively , remembering the previous battle for my migraine medication , I 'd popped a couple of pills into a pocket ) .
I was played tapes of Mark and I talking on the phone and in the car .
We 'd been bugged for weeks , if not months - this all took place after our relationship had ended .
I listened to our gossip , our harmless chitchat .
One officer told me , disturbingly , that it was still an offence merely to listen to details from a third party .
It was only afterwards that it dawned on me what sinister implication this case could have for journalists all over Britain .
Indeed , it would be highly unusual for a journalist not to have off - the - record contacts .
Technically , thousands of my media colleagues could be arrested just like me .
I had no idea then that ' the Murrer Case ' would spark such outrage about Press freedom and that I , a middle - aged mum of three working 12 hours a week on a local paper , would be at the centre of this controversy .
At the time I simply felt violated .
How dare these people bug my conversations and even download texts from my daughters ?
Mentally I was numb ; too tired to care about anything except my children .
If I was going to prison then I 'd better , for the first time in my life , get organised .
I rushed around a year early to choose a secondary school for Kate .
Clever Lucy , who 'd achieved straight
As at her GCSEs , was steered into sitting for a scholarship for the most caring boarding school I could find .
I could n't nurture her through A - levels and university , but Stowe staff could - and indeed are .
Finally , I made the hardest decision of all : I asked Social Services to place my lovely but needy boy into a residential care home .
Today he 's flourishing and comes home regularly .
But it still hurts .
Sometimes , during those dark days last autumn , I found myself wishing for a terminal illness : anything , I thought , must be better than this hell .
The cure for such self - indulgence was my work at the Milton Keynes Citizen .
One day I interviewed a lung - cancer sufferer who was going to run a marathon .
Another day I wrote about parents who had lost a child .
I knew I had to get a grip - and fight .
Ironically , it was better after I was charged last November .
I knew it was coming - bizarrely , I had a tipoff from a police contact - and the brilliant team of defence lawyers who had come to my aid could finally snap into action .
Earlier this month , the legal arguments began in Kingston upon Thames Crown Court to determine whether there was enough evidence for the case to go to a full trial .
Mark and I were n't the only ones in the dock : Mark 's son Harry and private detective Derek Webb were also charged with aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office .
In preparation for the trial , I 'd packed seven weeks ' worth of clothes , rented a room in Kingston and organised an au pair for Kate .
She was too young to understand what might happen - all she knew was that Mummy was going to London on a job ' to fight for journalists ' .
I 've reported from court many times , but sitting in the dock behind bullet - proof glass designed to detain terrorists was bewildering .
I held a Woolworths notebook in hand and tried taking notes on my own trial .
What I discovered was shattering .
I came to realise that the case was n't about me at all , but the rights of every journalist in the country .
My defence barrister , Gavin Millar QC , told the court that , under Article 10 of the Human Rights Convention , my right to freedom of expression had been breached by the State .
Thames Valley Police had no right to have bugged my conversations with Mark , a confidential source , and my arrest was also unlawful .
Furthermore , the stories I had written were accurate and the information was already in the public domain .
Millar went on to argue that journalistic privilege , unless it posed a genuine threat to national security , must extend to a reporter 's sources , otherwise no confidential source would ever again speak to a reporter .
His argument , which ran for eight - and - a - half hours , was described by Judge Richard Southwell as a masterclass on journalistic human rights and the freedom of the Press .
The charges against me , Mark , Harry and Derek were knocked down as Judge Southwell ruled the evidence inadmissible in court .
The case has now been thrown out and , after 18 months , our ordeal is over .
When I heard about the arrest of Conservative MP Damian Green last week , I was amazed at the parallels between his experience and my own .
I felt sorry for him .
In fact , it 's the first time in my life I 've felt a natural affinity for a Tory MP .
My own victory in court has been hailed as a landmark triumph for Press freedom , and I expected to feel vindicated and victorious .
But I still feel numb - and angry .
First there 's the financial cost .
Had it gone to trial , the case would have cost more than £ 4 million , but it still ended up using more than £ 1 million of public money .
And then , of course , there 's the emotional toll .
After something like this , I wonder how it 's possible to return to a normal life .
I tried to keep working , but I do n't know if I have the strength to continue as a journalist .
I certainly wo n't be doing another police story again .
Most importantly , though , my children are happy and healthy .
And , after 18 months of shifting perceptions and crazily changed values , that is truly all that matters now .

Business Model : Free for up to 30 people , but priced per month as a service after that based on audience size .
Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) are decoding the mysterious mechanisms behind the high - temperature superconductors that industry hopes will find wide use in next - generation systems for storing , distributing and using electricity .
In two new papers on a recently discovered class of high - temperature superconductors , they report that the already complicated relationship between magnetism and superconductivity may be more involved than previously thought , or that a whole new mechanism may drive some types of superconductors .
At temperatures approaching absolute zero , many materials become superconductors , capable of carrying vast amounts of electrical current with no resistance .
In such low - temperature superconductors , magnetism is a villain whose appearance shatters the fragile superconductive state .
But in 1986 , scientists discovered " high temperature " ( HTc ) superconductors capable of operating much warmer than the previous limit of 30 degrees above absolute zero .
In fact , today 's copper - oxide materials are superconductive in liquid nitrogen , a bargain - priced coolant that goes up to a balmy 77 degrees above absolute zero .
Such materials have enabled applications as diverse as high - speed maglev trains , magnetic - resonance imagers and highly sensitive astronomical detectors .
Still , no one really understands how HTc superconductivity works , although scientists have long suspected that in this case , magnetism boosts rather than suppresses the effect .
The beginnings of what could be a breakthrough came in early 2008 when Japanese researchers announced discovery of a new class of iron - based HTc superconductors .
In addition to being easier to shape into wires and otherwise commercialize than today 's copper - oxides , such materials provide scientists fresh new subjects with which to develop and test theories about HTc superconductivity 's origins .
Scientists at NIST 's Center for Neutron Research and a team including researchers from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville , Oak Ridge National Laboratory , the University of Maryland , Ames Laboratory and Iowa State University used beams of neutrons to peek into a superconductor 's atomic structure .
They first found iron - based superconductors to be similar to copper - oxide materials in how " doping " ( adding specific elements to insulators in or around a HTc superconductor ) influences their magnetic properties and superconductivity .
Then the team tested the iron - based material without doping it .
Under moderate pressure , the volume of the material 's crystal structure compressed an unusually high 5 percent .
Intriguingly , it also became superconductive without a hint of magnetism .
The iron - based material 's behavior under pressure may suggest the remarkable possibility of an entirely different mechanism behind superconductivity than with copper oxide materials , NIST Fellow Jeffrey Lynn said .
Or it could be that magnetism is simply an ancillary part of HTc superconductivity in general , he said — and that a similar , deeper mechanism underlies the superconductivity in both .
Understanding the origin of the superconductivity will help engineers tailor materials to specific applications , guide materials scientists in the search for new materials with improved properties and , scientists hope , usher in higher - temperature superconductors .

Trick - or - treating ai n’t no game .
No , it ’s a life lesson in goal - setting , planning , and tactical execution .
Kids who master trick - or - treating go on to become successful world leaders .
Kids who do n’t could possibly also do the same , but with less chocolate to show for it .
The point is that chocolate is delicious , and you should fill your pillowcase with as much of it as possible .
You just have to master the 4 Rules Of Strategic Trick - Or-Treating first :
4. Mo ’ money , mo ’ problems .
In terms of where to go trick - or - treating , there ’s always a lot of chatter about getting a drive over to the rich neighborhood for the big score .
People would have you believe that the rich enjoy lavishing children with unopened boxes of twinkies and full cases of root beer .
But that ’s a lie !
Rich people got rich by being cheap and their massive front yards will just slow you down .
That ’s right , you ’ll be navigating wrought - iron fences , duck - shaped hedges , and koi ponds instead of ringing doorbells .
Instead , aim for the new neighborhood with little kids and the all - important densely packed homes .
3 . Dress for success .
Trick - or - treating is a race against the clock , so set yourself up for success by wearing running shoes and avoiding masks that affect your visibility .
No ballet slippers , high heels , or sandals .
No robes , capes , or togas .
And none of those cheap plastic masks from the dollar store that attach with a thin elastic and a couple of staples .
Basically , keep simplifying your costume and then timing yourself running up and down the basement stairs until you ’ve found a winner .
If in doubt , go as Carl Lewis .
2. Partner up .
It will be tempting to form a trick - or - treating posse and move from door to door as one big , shifty amoeba of fluorescent tape and facepaint .
Resist that temptation .
The amoeba will cause two problems : first , the group will travel at the speed of the slowest member .
That means one kid with flat feet and asthma ruins everyone ’s night .
Secondly , a big group triggers the rationing instinct in the person handing out candy .
They become overwhelmed and default to the “ One for you , one for you ” candy - for - everyone technique .
You do n’t want that .
So instead , you need to pick one partner .
Qualifications for that lucky someone include a low resting heart rate , winning smile , and really cute costume .
The last one is key .
The costume must trigger the “ Are n’t you adorable ! ” reflex , which inspires extra candy .
The gold standard here is a fit toddler in a ladybug costume with new Reeboks .
1. Timing is everything .
The last rule is all about the three key stages of Halloween candy collecting .
Times may vary depending where you ’re from , but they go something like this :
The 4 – 6 pm Start Up :
You must be very active and running around here , before the street gets too busy .
This is your time to hit the houses at the peak of their inventory levels , when they may hand out more because of excess supply or poor foresight .

The 6 – 7 pm Rest Up :
This is when the streets are their busiest .
Do n’t get caught in other people ’s amoebas .
Now ’s the time to go home and dump out the pillowcase and refresh the face paint .
Also , it ’s a good time to hit your local fast - food joints .
McDonald ’s is usually pretty generous .

The 7 – 9 pm Clean Up : Now it ’s all about picking up the scraps .
Some houses will be left with too much candy and they ’ll start giving handfuls instead of fingerfuls .
Others will feel guilty about running out and start handing out creative treats from their kitchen like cups of pudding or boxes of Jello powder .
The Clean Up stage is a real test of your cardio fitness levels , as many houses will have turned out their lights by now , forcing you to zig - zag the street in search of the remaining bounty .
Now that you ’ve got a game plan , just remember to keep it clean out there .
Under cover of night and camouflage facepaint some folks venture into the murky trick - or - treating ethical gray zone .
Stay away from these folks , because while they ’re telling people it ’s their birthday too , collecting a second bag for a ‘ sick sibling at home ’ , or body - checking toddlers into bushes on their way up the walk , you can rest knowing that you came out to play by the rules .
And you won .
AWESOME !

November 8 , 2008 : T - Bone
At the mega port of Singapore on Feb 27,2003 just after midnight the Gas Roman loaded with 44,000 cubic meters of natural gas T - boned the Springbo loaded with 4,000 cubic meters of sawn timber .
The Gas Roman cut fully halfway thru the Springbo .
The two ship were so tightly joined that they were n't in emanate danger of sinking .
If the Gas Roman were to back out , the Springbo would rapidly fill with water and capsize in moments .
What to do ?
The crews were evacuated and salvage was contracted .
The ships were tethered to prevent accidental separation .
Stevedores removed all accessible lumber from the Springbo via a barge .
Steel was brought in and a sea wall was constructed around the gaping wound inside the Springbo .
Internal fuel leaks that were leaking into the hole were repaired by divers .
On the afternoon of March 2nd the two ships were separated successfully with no sea contamination .
Damn !
Marine accidents are always so ... complicated .
and sex is always so messy !
Um , ship on the left is supposed to give way .
Unless the one 's larger than the other , then the smaller one gives way .
Betcha he thought he could make it past in front ... ( or he was sleeping , one of the two )
" Today 's show brought to you by the letters " T " and " S " " O " and " S " .

I guess what I do n't understand is with all that open ocean ... would n't it be pretty tough to actually hit the only other boat out there ?
You 'd almost have to aim for it .
Around ports , especially one as busy as Singapore , ship traffic gets pretty heavy .
Add fog , nighttime , and long stopping / turning distances , it 's even more dangerous .
Then of course there 's always the idiots driving those little sports models , carrying lumber or rubber duckies , or some such , passing on the shoulder , weaving in and out , and running lights , just to show off .
Damn whippersnappers !
THE NOT -SO -INVISIBLE HAND :
HOW THE PLUNGE PROTECTION TEAM
KILLED THE FREE MARKET
� We �re now no different from any of those Western European semi- socialist welfare states that we love to deride .
Italy ?
Sure , it�s had four governments since last Thursday , but none of them would have allowed this to go on ; the Italians know how to rig an economy . �
� Bill Saporito , � How We Became the United States of France , � Time ( September 21 , 2008 )
October 24 marks the 79th anniversary of the October 1929 stock market crash .
Heavy selling started on Thursday , October 24 , 1929 , and accelerated the following week on Black Monday and Black Tuesday , October 28 and 29 .
Many feared a repeat of this disaster on Friday , October 24 , 2008 , after Japan�s Nikkei stock average fell nearly 10 % during the night , Hong Kong�s Hang Seng fell 8 % , and Germany�s and Britain�s fell 5 % .
� In a stunning turn of events , � reported Yahoo !
Finance , � the futures for the major indices were �lock limit� down before the start of trading Friday , meaning they had hit a 5 % threshold that prevented them from trading any lower until the stock market opened Friday . �
Traders prepared for the worst , but remarkably , disaster was averted .
The U.S. market fell only 3.5 % , just another �ordinary � bearish day .
Why the more modest drop in the U.S. , where the financial debacle originated and should have hit hardest ?
Suspicious observers saw the covert hand of the Plunge Protection Team ( PPT ) , the group set up under President Reagan to maintain market �stability � by manipulating markets behind the scenes .
Bill Murphy commented in LeMetropoleCafe.com :
� Today the Muppets on CNBC were remarking how well our market acted , not falling apart as expected .
All day long they spoke of how our market was acting differently today than every other stock market in the world .
Well hello , the other countries don�t have a PPT , which is WHY our market is so different .
� There are those who might think what the PPT is doing is right .
What they don�t realize is their making � Everything is fine � for so long , and not allowing the market to trade freely . . . like allowing the stock market to fall the way it should , has kept the individual in the market . . . when they might have been SCARED out some time ago . �
In response to Bill Saporito�s comment in Time it might be countered that Henry Paulson�s Plunge Protection Team is quite adept at rigging an economy .
The difference between an acknowledged socialist state and the stealth socialism we have in the U.S. today is that in a socialist state , everyone expects the market to be rigged and operates accordingly .
In a rigged pseudo - capitalist economy , investors are easily separated from their money because they expect the market to follow �free market principles � based on �supply and demand . �
They are seduced into �pump and dump� schemes � artificial manipulations that allow insiders to unload stock at a high price or buy it at a low price � because they trust in Adam Smith�s �invisible hand , � which is supposed to automatically set things right in a market left to its own devices .
The market today is indeed controlled by an invisible hand , but it is not necessarily serving the interests of small investors .
Plunge Protection for Some , Plunge Creation for Others
The most egregious examples of market manipulation have been in gold , silver and oil .
The official �spot� ( or cash ) prices of gold and silver were taken down sharply in the last ten days , despite the fact that physical demand has been inexorable .
Gold is available in the �real� market only at huge markups , and popular types of silver are not available at all .
1
We were taught in school that communism does not work because when industry is in the hands of a single owner ( the government ) , competition is eliminated and chronic shortages and black markets develop , since the government does not let prices respond to �supply and demand � but dictates them from the top .
Today this is happening with gold and silver , with the true physical price varying radically from the reported paper price .
Gold is known as the � contra - investment , � the �go to� investment which historically has gone up when other stocks were failing .
Investors see it as something tangible that will hold its value when everything else is falling apart .
For that reason , rigging the market to �maintain stability � means suppressing the price of gold .
The current round of gold manipulations started on Thursday , October 16 , at 10 am , when the price of gold suddenly suffered a freefall plunge of $ 45 within minutes .
It continued to drop until it was down by nearly $ 60 in a little over an hour :
Nothing happened on Thursday between 10 and 11 am to warrant this vertical drop .
If anything , gold should have been shooting up in the same exponential fashion that it was falling .
On Wednesday , the stock market had dropped over 700 points , and Dow futures ( bets on which way the market would go ) were down by 150 points Wednesday night .
During the night , the Japanese stock market fell more than 10 % , and all European markets were down .
2 Thursday morning , among other very bad economic news , U.S. industrial output was reported to have posted its biggest fall in 34 years , and mid-Atlantic factory activity had crashed unexpectedly from September to October .
Yet Dow futures were suddenly 130 points higher ; and gold was slammed down right at 10 am , although physical gold was available only by paying huge premiums , and gold prices around the world were shooting up .
The day continued in the same counterintuitive way , just one more egregious example of an ongoing pattern of manipulation that has become so blatant that either the manipulators have become supremely confident of their invulnerability or they are so terrified of impending doom that all pretense of plausible denial has been abandoned . �
� The Most Massive Intervention Since Roosevelt �
Market manipulation is not generally discussed by the commentators on CNBC , but sense can hardly be made of today�s wildly unpredictable trading patterns unless the plays of powerful men behind the curtain are factored in .
One commentator who does talk about this manipulation is Don Coxe , strategist for the Bank of Montreal .
In a weekly conference call on September 5 , 2008 , he described what has been going on in the markets since July as � the most massive intervention of government into the capital markets or the financial system since Roosevelt closed the banks back in 1933.�3
According to the Toronto Globe and Mail , Coxe is �no paranoid conspiracy theorist .
As the chairman and chief strategist of Harris Investment Management in Chicago , he is one of the most respected investment authorities in North America .
�4
The unprecedented intervention he described went back to when the financial establishment was facing a very banker - unfriendly market in July .
Gold was about to break through the psychologically important $ 1,000 mark , oil was above $ 140 dollars a barrel , the dollar was breaking down , the bank stock index had dropped in six months from 90 to 50 , and the Federal Reserve had a balance sheet to match , after making huge loans to banks on shaky collateral .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were on the verge of collapse , and hundreds of billions of their securities were held abroad .
As if by magic , these trends all suddenly reversed , beginning with a dramatic reversal in the swooning dollar .
How was it done ?
The cat was let out of the bag by the Nikkei English News , which reported in late August that finance officials from the U.S. , Japan and Europe had drawn up plans to strengthen the dollar following the collapse of investment bank Bear Stearns .
The intervention called for the central banks to purchase dollars and sell euros and yen if the dollar�s value dropped significantly , with Japan providing the yen for the currency swap .
5
As the dollar strengthened , gold , silver and oil plunged .
The pundits read the drop in gold and silver as a reaction to the rise in the dollar , since precious metals rise historically when the dollar falls .
But what they failed to explain was why the dollar was rising .
As Bill Murphy observed , � the dollar rallies sharply whenever the US stock market comes under pressure .
It is almost simultaneous .�
He quoted one of his newsletter contributors :
� Since the [ stock market ] low on 22 SEP we have lost 8.3 trillion bucks worth of asset value within the equities markets and what happens ?
The US dollar goes up , and up , and up , and up , and up .
From what ?
72 to 84 now ( up 1.14 just today ??!!?? )?
A non -stop rally that is NEVER adversely affected by news or market events .
It �s almost been a 45 - degree ascent .
THAT is pure unmitigated intervention of a huge degree .�6
To illustrate the point , Murphy posted this chart , showing the dramatic , inexplicable July reversal in the dollar�s slide :
How to explain this stunning about - face ?
In Coxe�s September 5 conference call , he candidly laid out how the Federal Reserve and the Treasury , in conjunction with the CFTC ( Commodity Futures Trading Commission ) and the SEC ( Securities and Exchange Commission ) , colluded to manipulate this �necessary � bounce in the dollar , along with a corresponding boost to financial stocks and sudden collapse in the commodities markets .
Coxe called it �brilliant , � but the play was at a cost of millions of dollars to commodities investors and short sellers who were betting on what a �free� market �should � do .
Oil plunged more than 50 % , from a high of $ 145 a barrel in July to a low of about $ 64 on October 24 .
The same pattern was seen in silver and gold , with gold falling from a high of over $ 1,000 an ounce to a low of $ 700 on October 23 .
It all added up to a massive �pump and dump� scheme , with insiders pocketing the fortunes lost by unsuspecting investors .
It �s a messy business , but somebody has to rake in these obscene profits for the �greater good� of market stability .
� The Most Sordid Scheme in the History of Finance �
Theodore Butler , writing on SilverSeek.com on September 2 , reported that there was more than just central bank collusion going on behind the scenes .
He tracked an unprecedented wall of short selling of gold and silver � massive " borrowing " of stock , selling it into the market and forcing down the price , then " covering " by buying the stock back at the lower price .
Butler wrote :
� In gold , no more than 3 U.S. banks sold short in one month more than 10 % of world annual mine production .
This was the largest short position in gold and silver ever recorded by U.S. banks .
After the massive and concentrated silver and gold short position was established by these U.S. banks , the [ gold and silver ] markets experienced a historic decline in price .
It all took place during the first widespread retail silver shortage in history .
It is completely at odds [ with ] how the law of supply and demand works . �
Butler called it the most sordid scheme in the history of finance .
� It makes a mockery of financial regulation and the rule of law , � he wrote .
� It allows a large financial entity , or entities , to rip off the investing public and gouge them for obscene profits .
It is cronyism , back - room dealing , market fixing and inside information at its worst .�7
While gold and silver were being shorted to oblivion , the SEC imposed a ban on the short selling of 19 select financial stocks , including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
It was blatant favoritism for the privileged few , but Coxe said it was necessary to make financial stock look attractive to potential buyers ( particularly sovereign wealth funds ) , in order to allow the banks to sell their stock and raise the capital necessary to start lending again .
At the same time , Treasury Secretary Paulson sought and was granted an unlimited credit line to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac directly from the U.S.
Treasury , as well as the authority to buy the mortgage giants � stock .
Fannie and Freddie were put into a form of bankruptcy called a conservatorship ; but unlike in the ordinary bankruptcy , in which creditors divide up the debtors � available assets without government help , in this case the claims of the lenders were guaranteed by the Treasury .
Foreign lenders were bailed out while the shareholders were wiped out � including banks , pension funds , and other institutions holding the savings of millions of Americans .
In the long run , the �bailout� created more problems than it solved ; but according to Coxe , it was a necessary sacrifice to keep the mortgage market functional for the near term .
How near ?
The Presidential election is now only weeks away .
Markets have an uncanny way of looking good before elections . �
Rob Kirby , writing in LeMetropoleCafe on September 9 , observed that there are laws and stiff penalties against market collusion .
The U.S. antitrust laws impose fines of up to $ 10 million and jail terms of up to 3 years for unfair practices that inhibit competition or monopolize markets in restraint of trade .
� I admire [ Coxe�s ] candor , � said Kirby , � but my take on this is that all the perpetrators should face a firing squad , or worse , for treason .
�8
That probably won�t happen , however , because the �perpetrators � can claim governmental immunity .
The Plunge Protection Team , officially called the President�s Working Group on Financial Markets , was formed by President Reagan in response to a stock market crash in 1987 for the express purpose of �maintaining investor confidence� by manipulating markets with public funds .
The PPT includes the President , the Secretary of the Treasury , the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) .
9
Calling the shots is no doubt Secretary Paulson , who now has a $ 700 billion fund to use for the purpose , after Congress passed his massive bank rescue plan on October 3 .
� Socialism for the Rich �
Nouriel Roubini , Professor of Economics at New York University , wrote on his popular blog Global EconoMonitor :
� Socialism is indeed alive and well in America ; but this is socialism for the rich , the well connected and Wall Street .
A socialism where profits are privatized and losses are socialized with the US tax - payer being charged the bill . . . .�10
Investment guru Jim Rogers told � Squawk Box Europe� :
� America is more communist than China is right now .
You can see that this is welfare of the rich , it is socialism for the rich .
. . it �s just bailing out financial institutions .
. . .
� This is madness , this is insanity , they have more than doubled the American national debt in one weekend for a bunch of crooks and incompetents .
I�m not quite sure why I or anybody else should be paying for this .
�11
If we are going socialist , we should own up to it and have some transparency in what�s going on .
We the people need to know how to plan and to invest for an uncertain future .
If we �re nationalizing the banks , let �s nationalize them all the way , with the profits going back to the people along with the losses and risks .
Better yet , let �s nationalize the Federal Reserve , so it can issue � the full faith and credit of the United States � directly , without having to back this credit with a multi-trillion dollar federal debt that will never get paid back but just continues to grow .
It would actually be less inflationary for the government to print dollars directly than for it to print bonds that are swapped for dollars created on a printing press by a privately - owned central bank , because in the latter case both the bonds and the dollars remain in circulation .
U.S. bonds not only serve as money around the world , but they count as the �reserves � for banks to create many times their face value in loans .
These bonds never get paid off but just get rolled over from year to year , inflating the money supply just as if dollars were printed directly ; but the bonds carry the added burden of perpetual debt and interest payments .
The costly bank bailouts and blatant market manipulations going on today are justified as being necessary to save a private banking system that we think we need to get the credit that keeps the economy running .
But we don�t actually need private banks to get credit .
Many authorities have attested that , contrary to popular belief , banks don�t lend their own money or their depositors� money .
Every dollar lent by a bank is money created out of thin air on a computer screen .
It �s just �credit . �
The bank �monetizes � the borrower�s own promise to repay .
The government could issue its own credit in the same way .
There are a number of successful historical precedents for this , including the publicly - owned central banks of Australia and New Zealand , which saved those countries from the devastating effects of the Great Depression in the 1930s ; and the publicly - owned bank of the colony of Pennsylvania , which funded the Pennsylvania provincial government without taxes or debt in the first half of the eighteenth century .
( See Ellen Brown , � How Banks Secretly Create Money , � www.webofdebt.com/articles , July 3 , 2007 ; and � It�s the Derivatives , Stupid ! � , ibid . , September 18 , 2008 . )
Today�s bankrupt banks dug their own black hole when they loaded up their books with lucrative but highly risky derivative bets that are now backfiring on them .
Instead of trying to clean up the banks � books by throwing taxpayer money at this impossible - to - fill black hole , we would be better off simply letting the banks go bankrupt , as President Reagan did with the savings and loan industry in the 1980s .
The banks � bad debts could then be discharged in bankruptcy , and their assets could be absorbed into a public credit system with a new , untarnished set of books that would serve the interests of the people and return the profits to the people .
So What Is an Investor to Do ?
That still leaves the question of how to negotiate today�s very unpredictable markets .
The Friday before the white - knuckle October 24 ride , investors were being encouraged to get back into the market .
Commentators cheerily announced the best market week in 5 - 1/ 2 years , after the Dow climbed from a low of 7,774 on October 10 to a high of 9,924 on October 14 .
But the week still ended below 9,000 , and the market was coming off the most historic plunge since the Great Depression , down from a high of 10,845 on October 3 to below 8,000 a week later .
By October 24 , the Dow was again hovering near 8,000 .
� Frankly , I �m sick of this , � said CNBC market watcher Erin Burnett as she tracked the Dow�s wild gyrations on October 23 .
� Up and down , up and down .
It doesn�t seem to mean anything or be linked to anything . �
I�m hanging onto my gold and silver stocks out of sheer doggedness ; but other beleaguered investors might well decide it�s time to pull their money out of a stock market that is looking more and more like a rigged and risky Las Vegas casino and put it somewhere else .
As one talk show commentator quipped recently , � I�m fully diversified .
I�ve got some under the mattress , some under the floor boards , some in the backyard .��� �

All of three of the superstar male vocal groups at Motown had a charismatic , supremely talented lead singer .
So how come Levi Stubbs never gained the notoriety that peers Smokey Robinson of The Miracles and David Ruffin of The Temptations enjoyed ?
Stubbs passed away at the age of 72 last week in Detroit , after a long battle with cancer , robbing the world of another soulful singer , whose gravelly baritone propelled The Four Tops to the top of the charts again and again .
Maybe it was Stubbs ’ humility that prevented him from taking the spotlight .
During the long run of hits he , Lawrence Payton , Renaldo “ Obie ” Benson and Abdul “ Duke ” Fakir churned out for Motown in the 1960s and 70s , they all stood shoulder to shoulder .
Motown founder Berry Gordy wrote in a statement , Stubbs “ could easily have made it as a solo star , but his love and loyalty ” kept the Four Tops “ together longer than any group I know .
His character and integrity were impeccable . ”
The Four Tops were together for 44 years , and Stubbs sang lead on every single one of their 12 chart - topping hits .
But make no mistake ;
The Four Tops were not a Motown invention .
The group was founded in 1953 by Stubbs , a cousin to Jackie Wilson , and his friends as a jazz quartet in a Detroit High School .
Originally The Four Aims , the group became The Four Tops after a year , went from backing up Jazz musicians like Count Basie to singing R&B , and never looked back , recording for Chess , Red Top and Riverside before hooking up with America ’s hottest hit - making machine .
Songs like , “ Reach Out ( I ’ll Be There ) , ” “ Bernadette , ” and “ Standing In The Shadows of Love ” became ubiquitous classics on the strength of Stubbs ’ urgent shouts and anguished cries .
Always tough , but tastefully restrained , Stubbs ’ vocals prompted Temptations singer Otis Williams to tell Levi “ you are our black Frank Sinatra ” for his ability to turn a phrase just as beautifully .
The ace songwriting team of Holland - Dozier - Holland penned all of The Four Tops big hits of the Sixties , but their departure from Motown in 1968 , while a turning point for the label , could n’t keep the Tops off the charts .
With other producers they had hits like “ Still Water ” and “ River Deep , Mountain High . ”
And when Motown left Detroit for Los Angeles in 1972 , the Tops refused to leave their native city behind .
The Tops ’ loyalty would be rewarded with a string of hits for ABC - Dunhill throughout the 70s and 80s , including the hit theme for Shaft in Africa , “ Are You Man Enough . ”
All in all , they had 45 top 100 singles between 1964 and 1988 , and the original members performed up to 200 times a year well into the 90s .
Besides being kings of Detroit , The Four Tops were also Motown ’s most popular act in The UK , where Stubbs is rightfully considered one of America ’s greatest soul singers , alongside other transatlantic stars like James Brown and Sam Cooke .
Revered as a live act as well , the Four Tops constantly stole the show during star - studded Motown Revues with their carefully crafted moves and creamy harmonies really stood out against Stubbs ’ gritty soul shouting .
And though he never released a solo album , Stubbs had his moment in the Hollywood , voicing the man-eating plant Audrey II in Little Shop of Horrors , and singing the memorable “ Mean Green Mother From Outer Space . ”
Unfortunately , all but one of the Four Tops has fallen to cancer in the last 15 years , with Abdul “ Duke ” Fakir the lone survivor .
Stubbs is survived by his wife of 48 years , Clineice , five children , and 11 grandchildren .
With his passing , we ’ve lost another one of the legends that shaped soul music .
Even if he was n’t Detroit ’s biggest star , Stubbs was one of its greatest citizens , and he ’ll be missed .
Scientists Say Olive Stones Can Be Used As Fuel
October 29th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Chalk olive stones up to the list of waste products that can be used as fuel .
Researchers from the Universities of Jaén and Granada in Spain have discovered that olive stones — byproducts of processing olive oil and table olives — can be turned into bioethanol .
The new process works by pre-treating the stones with high - pressure hot water and adding enzymes to break down plant matter and create sugars .
Hydrolysate obtained from the process is then fermented with yeasts to produce ethanol .
The top yield from the process is 5.7 kg of ethanol per 100 kg of olive stones .
While the amount of olive stones produced as a waste byproduct pales in comparison to other agricultural wastes , we ca n’t afford to overlook anything in the race for sustainable fuel .
After all , the more waste byproducts we use , the fewer food crops we waste on fuel .

I ’ve got my asbestos underwear on , so flame away …
So many of us are so thrilled at seeing an official Front Controller / MVC framework for ASP.
NET development that I think we ’ve forgotten to ask ourselves “ Is this thing any good ? ”
In * my * opinion , if you look at the ASP .
NET MVC framework as a complete framework to be used out of the box , the MVC framework is n’t very good at all .
However , as a set of fairly loosely coupled classes that you can use to build a highly productive , specialized MVC stack for your specific application needs , the ASP .
NET MVC framework is perfectly fine .
Basically , my issue with the MVC framework is that I think it falls far short of Ruby on Rails in terms of productivity enhancing features and testability .
Specifically , I think the MVC framework – out of the box – has failed by not embracing the Rails mantras of Opinionated Software , Convention over Configuration , the DRY Principle , and Testability support .
That ’s okay though , because we ’ve found it relatively simple to cherry pick the pieces of the MVC that we wanted ( routing , some of the ActionResult classes , and the WebFormsEngine ) to form the core of the MVC framework that we wanted .
After deciding that we would use the MVC framework ( why we chose the MVC over Rails and MonoRail is a different discussion ) , Chad & I immediately proceeded to develop a set of “ opinions ” on how we wanted our architecture to work and built up some infrastructure around the MVC to make these “ opinions ” become true .
We ’re doing a joint presentation at KaizenConf called Using and Abusing ASP.
NET for Fun and Profit that ’s all about our particular usage of the ASP .
NET MVC framework .
As a preview of that talk , and for those of you who wo n’t be in Austin for KaizenConf , here are the “ opinions ” that we ’ve adopted .
Our guiding principles have been heavily influenced by Rails .
We ’re using Convention over Configuration as much as possible , and we ’re adamant about DRY .
We ’ve deviated from Rails by trying to use the strengths of C# 3.0 rather than trying to make C# act like a half - assed version of Ruby .
To that end , we very heavily use Expression ’s , Lambda ’s , Object Initializers , and Generics .
Opinions
The “ Thunderdome Principle ” – All Controller methods take in one ViewModel object ( or zero objects in some cases ) and return a single ViewModel object ( one object enters , one object leaves ) .
The Controller classes will NEVER be directly exposed to anything related to HttpContext .
Nothing makes me cry like seeing people trying to write tests that mock or stub that new IHttpContextWrapper interface .
Likewise , Controller methods do not return ViewResult objects and are generally decoupled from all MVC infrastructure .
We adopted this strategy very early on as a way to make Controller testing simpler mechanically .
It ’s definitely achieved that goal , but it ’s also made the Controller code very streamlined and easy to read .
We ’ll explain how this works at KaizenConf .
Controllers should have no knowledge of the View .
View ’s should have no knowledge of the Controller .
They only share the Model class , period .
Controllers should be thin .
The only job of a Controller action is to translate the model coming in to the proper service calls and to create the output model object .
All responsibilities for business logic are done by delegating to non-UI service classes .
In other words , business logic does NOT go into a Controller .
No slinging around HashTable ’s , IDictionary ’s , or magic strings .
All of these things are error prone and make development harder than strongly typed parameter objects .
Instead , we …
… say that all navigation is done by an Expression like : < %= this .
LinkToAction<HomeController >( c=>c.Index ( ) , UserMessageKeys.MAIN_HEADER_TEXT ) %>.
The actual implementation is half convention , and half configuration of controller “ aliases . ”
This choice does not lock you into making all url strings an exact representation of the controller name and method name .
lock you into making all url strings an exact representation of the controller name and method name .
… as I said earlier , all Controller actions are invoked by passing in a single parameter object
… allow no direct access to HttpContext collections .
In the very rare case we need to access something in HttpContext , we use a wrapper interface that expresses that need in terms of our application .
Dependency Injection is used to get the HttpContext wrappers to the Controller classes that need them .
See this post from Jimmy Bogard for another example .
All View’s are strongly typed View ’s ( ViewPage < T > , where T is the ViewModel that comes out of a Controller action ) .
This is somewhat necessary because of the Thunderdome principle , and also enables the bullet point below …
All html form elements are built by Expressions with our own html helpers like this : < %= this .
TextBoxFor(m => m. Site. Identifier ) % >.
This has worked out very well because :
It makes screen synchronization simpler by binding the element names to the actual properties of the Model object .
With a little code generation , we ’ve basically made the effort to synchronize data between the view , the Request .
Form , and the internal Domain Model objects a miniscule part of the development effort .
This cuts down on mistakes from misnamed elements or mangled string key values on the server side
It ’s enabled automated testing of the screens .
We can address screen elements in tests by a strong typed Expression as : DropDownFor(x => x. Site . Status ) .HasOptionValues ( Given.StatusList ) ;
We have access to the underlying Property Info while we ’re building textbox ’s and dropdown ’s and the like .
We ’re just starting to take advantage of this to intelligently set restrictions on what type ’s are valid in the html elements .
We ’re also tying into our validation attributes to automatically mark fields that are required and set some client side validation rules on the html elements .
Sooner or later , we ’ll also tie in tooltip values into the html controls .
And all of this comes without adding any more code on the actual View .
Server side markup is never intermingled with client side JavaScript .
It is our opinion that this all too common technique leads to unreadable code and eliminates the ability to TDD the client side JavaScript .
This : callFunction (‘<% =Model.Variable %>’ ) is not allowed .
If server side data needs to be passed to client side JavaScript , we do that by writing “ var something = <% = Model. Variable % >. ”
View ’s should be very simple .
If you ’re using an if / then statement or some sort of looping expression , you ’re doing something wrong .
Conditional logic belongs in the Controller or in JavaScript libraries that can be tested with QUnit .
No , or minimal , logic in the View ’s reduces errors by moving logic out of hard to test code and into easier to test code – and yes , I ’m declaring that JavaScript is easy to unit test .
Tag Soup can be avoided .
We tend to move looping constructs into our own partial implementation like : <%= this .RenderPartialForEachOf( m => m.Solution .
Resolutions ) .
Using < EditResolution >( ) % >.
In that block of code , EditResolution refers to an ASCX control , and m.Solutution .
Resolutions is a property of type IList < Resolution > .
This statement will iterate over the list , and render a partial view for each Resolution object .
All Domain Model classes are identified by a single numeric property called “ Id ” ( enforced with a layer supertype ) .
Nothing uncommon about that opinion , but it does eliminate repetition in the code by allowing us to reuse a lot of code for finding objects and Url routing between different types of Domain Model objects .
Other Stuff We ’re Doing
We use QUnit quite extensively and I ’m thrilled with it as a tool .
We try to treat our JavaScript work as “ real ” coding and apply the same quality requirements to JavaScript as our C# code , and that means TDD .
We ’ve found that many things are easier to unit test and build with jQuery / QUnit rather than server side markup and NUnit .
We do have a way to test View ’s in isolation with WatiN .
We can set up the input Model class in memory , then render that Model with a View and make assertions on how the View was rendered .
Rails has support for this very thing , and I ’ve always wanted this ability .
This has n’t been as useful as I thought it was going to be once we adopted the rules about simplicity in the View ’s and started using the QUnit / jQuery combination .
In order to make this ViewContext work , however , we had to forgo all usage of the built in HtmlHelper ’s because of some unfortunate coupling to HttpContext .
We ’re using Fluent NHibernate for configuration .
We ’re about to remove some of the explicit configuration in favor of the convention based mapping .
At this point , we ’re completely generating the database with NHibernate ’s HBM2DDL tooling .
The database is just flowing out of the Domain Model for the time being ( until we have a need to optimize the default DDL ) .
We have added some conventions to Fluent NHibernate to tie our validation attributes into the DDL generation .
DRY baby .
The lesson we can take out of Rails success is DRY .
It ’s just that the shape of DRY code is a bit different in the .
Net world .
We have a custom BDD style “ Context ” abstract class for our Controller actions .
Because of the “ Thunderdome Principle , ” it ’s simply a matter of defining the input model , running the method , then doing state - based assertions against the output model .
No HttpContext .
Request .
Form setup , and no scraping data out of a weakly typed ViewResult after the fact .
This “ Context ” class also uses the StructureMap AutoMocker behind the scenes to cut down on the overhead of setting up tests .
Here ’s an example of that context in action testing a service class :
[ TestFixture ] public class When_yanking_a_workflow_item : ActionContext < WorkflowService , YankRequest , WorkflowActionResult > { private User the CurrentUser ; private Queue the OriginalQueue ; // Defines the method public When_yanking_a_workflow_item ( ) : base ( ( x , input ) => x. Yank ( input ) ) { UseInMemoryRepository = true ; } //
Set up the context protected override void beforeEach ( ) { the CurrentUser = new User ( ) .
WithId ( 4 ) ; WorkflowItem the Case = new Case ( ) .
WithId ( 1 ) ; the OriginalQueue = new Queue {Name= “ OriginalQ ” }. WithId ( 5 ) ; the Case.Enqueue( the OriginalQueue ) ; // Setup the input model Given = new YankRequest { CurrentUser = this .
the CurrentUser , Item = the Case } ; } [ Test ] public void the_owner_should_be_changed_to_the_current_user ( ) { //
The first access of the “ Output ” property // runs the Controller action and caches the return // value of the Controller action Output .
Item.Owner.ShouldBeTheSameAs( Given.CurrentUser ) ; } [ Test ] public void it_should_no_longer_be_assigned_to_a_queue ( ) { Output .
Item.Queue.ShouldBeNull ( ) ; } [ Test ] public void the_item_and_the_queue_and_the_log_should_be_saved ( ) { TheLastTransactionWasCommitted ( ) . TheSavedObjectsWere( Output .
Item , the OriginalQueue , Output . Item.LastAction ) ; } }
In Closing
Please do n’t think that I ’m saying that the ASP .
NET MVC is bad , because it ’s not .
I just think that the MVC out of the box is too “ bland ” and wishy washy .
If you ’re going to use it for anything bigger than a handful of screens , I ’d highly advise you to add some of your own application specific sauce .
I think we can agree that Microsoft could n’t make the MVC framework opinionated without pissing off 3/4 ’s of its users ( just think , if they were to build in direct support for persistence they ’d have to use Linq to SQL or the messy tool that shall not be named , neither of which I would consider to be acceptable ) .
Making the MVC opinionated , and hence more productive , is going to be left to the community and to each organization .
Bush on His Legacy : I ' Liberated ' Iraqis President talks to his sister about what he'd like to be remembered for .
Nov. 28 , 2008  --
In a personal and wide - ranging interview conducted by his sister about his legacy , his faith and the influence of his father , President George W. Bush said he hopes to be remembered as a liberator of the Iraqi people .
" I 'd like to be a president [ known ] as somebody who liberated 50 million people and helped achieve peace , " Bush told his sister , Dorothy Bush Koch , in a conversation recorded for the oral - history organization StoryCorps for the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress .
An excerpt of the interview was aired on National Public Radio Thursday , and the White House released additional excerpts with both the president and first lady Laura Bush today .
" I would like to be a person remembered as a person who , first and foremost , did not sell his soul in order to accommodate the political process , " Bush said , according to White House excerpts .
" I came to Washington with a set of values , and I 'm leaving with the same set of values .
And I darn sure was n't going to sacrifice those values ; that I was a president that had to make tough choices and was willing to make them , " he said .
Bush is ending his eight - year presidency with historically low public approval ratings , wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a dire economic crisis .
The president told his sister he is proud of the " tough decisions " he made .
" I surrounded myself with good people , " Bush said .
" I carefully considered the advice of smart , capable people and made tough decisions . "
Bush : No Child Left Behind a Significant Achievement
Bush said his No Child Left Behind policy , which has been widely criticized by educators as too focused on test scores , is one of his significant achievements .
" I think the No Child Left Behind Act is one of the significant achievements of my administration because we said loud and clear to educators , parents and children that we expect the best for every child , that we believe every child can learn , and that in return for Federal money we expect there to be an accountability system in place to determine whether every child is learning to read , write , and add and subtract , " he said .
Laura Bush : ' I Worry About Afghanistan '
Bush said because of his administration 's No Child Left Behind policy , the " achievement gap " between white children and African - American and Latinos is " narrowing . "
" The promise of No Child Left Behind has been fulfilled , " Bush said .
Asked how he would like to be remembered , Bush said he wants to be known as a president " that focused on individuals rather than process ; that rallied people to serve their neighbor ; that led an effort to help relieve HIV / AIDS and malaria on places like the continent of Africa ; that helped elderly people get prescription drugs and Medicare as a part of the basic package ; that came to Washington , D.C. , with a set of political statements and worked as hard as I possibly could to do what I told the American people I would do . "
First lady Laura Bush , who seemed to gain more confidence in recent years to speak out on foreign policy issues she cares about , said her most rewarding work was on behalf of women in Afghanistan .
" It 's certainly been very rewarding to look at Afghanistan and both know that the president and the United States military liberated women there ; that women and girls can be in school now ; that women can walk outside their doors without a male escort , " the first lady said , according to White House excerpts .
" I worry about Afghanistan , but I will always have a special place in my heart for the women that I 've met there , " she said .
" I think as we look all around the Middle East , we 'll see that women can be the ones who really lead the freedom movement , and that American women are standing so strongly , I think , with the women in Afghanistan and other places . "
Asked by his sister to describe the influence their parents had on him , Bush said , " I think that the gift our dad gave to all of us is unconditional love .
It is the greatest gift a father can give a child .
And it has made life so much easier in many ways , because if you have the ultimate gift of love , then the difficulties of life can be easier handled .
And to me that is a great gift . "
Bush : I 've Been in the Bible Every Day of My Presidency
Heaping praise on his father , former President George H.W. Bush , the president said , " He also taught me -- and I think you and Jeb and Neil and Marvin -- that you can go into politics with a set of values and you do n't have to sell your soul once you 're in the political system .
And you can come out with the same set of values . "
Bush , who is a born - again Christian , spoke about the role his faith has played in his presidency .
" I 've been in the Bible every day since I 've been the president , and I have been affected by peoples ' prayers a lot .
I have found that faith is comforting , faith is strengthening , faith has been important , " Bush said .
" I would advise politicians , however , to be careful about faith in the public arena , " he said .
" In other words , politicians should not be judgmental people based upon their faith .
They should recognize -- as least I have recognized I am a lowly sinner seeking redemption , and therefore have been very careful about saying [ accept ] my faith or you 're bad .
In other words , if you do n't accept what I believe , you 're a bad person .
And the greatness of America -- it really is -- is that you can worship or not worship and be equally American .
And it does n't matter how you choose to worship ; you 're equally American .
And it 's very important for any President to jealously protect , guard , and strengthen that freedom . "

A History Lesson For Those Advocating Network Neutrality Laws
from the unintended - consequences dept
Over at News.com , Declan McCullagh writes that Barack Obama 's election as the next president of the United States has bolstered the hopes of those hoping to impose network neutrality regulations on the Internet .
While Obama 's key advisors have been cagey about precisely what the new administration 's stance on the issue will be , it 's a safe bet that we 'll be hearing a lot about the issue in the coming months .
This seems like a good time for a long - overdue conclusion to my ongoing series on network neutrality regulation .
One of the things that has been missing from the network neutrality debate has been a sense of how it fits into the broader history of government regulations of network industries .
It 's easy to imagine that the Internet is so new and different that historical comparisons just are n't relevant .
But as we 've seen with copyright and patent debates , we can learn a lot from historical experiences that may not seem immediately relevant .
I think this is equally true in the network neutrality debate .
While the specifics of network neutrality are unlike anything that has come before , the general principles involved — non - discrimination , competition , monopoly power , and so forth — have actually been with us for more than a century .
Indeed , today 's network neutrality debate bears a striking resemblance to the debate that led to the very first American regulatory agency : the Interstate Commerce Commission , which was created to regulate the railroad industry .
The railroad industry was the high - tech industry of its day , and it had many of the same kinds of transformative effects on the 19th Century American economy that the Internet is having today .
As with today 's Internet , some parts of the railroad market were highly competitive , while other markets were served by only one or two firms .
And people had concerns about the behavior of the largest railroad firms that echoed those that people have about large Internet providers today : that they restrict competition , discriminate among customers .
In 1887 , Congress passed legislation ( you can read an abridged version here ) that is strikingly similar to the proposed network neutrality legislation that we 're debating today .
The Interstate Commerce Act declared it illegal to charge different prices to different customers for " the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substantially similar circumstances and conditions . "
It also said that railroads may not " make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person , company , firm , corporation , or locality , or any particular description of traffic . "
Compare that to the leading network neutrality proposal during the last Congress , which would have required network providers to deliver content on a " reasonable and nondiscriminatory " basis without imposing " a charge on the basis of the type of content , applications , or services made available . "
Unfortunately , the story of the Interstate Commerce Commission does not have a happy ending .
Grover Cleveland appointed a railroad ally named Thomas M Cooley as the first chairman of the ICC .
The ICC was widely regarded as toothless for its first couple of decades , largely rubber - stamping railroad industry decisions .
Things got even worse after the turn of the century , when the ICC began actively discouraging competition in the railroad industry .
The ICC had the power to decide when new firms were allowed to enter the railroad industry , and by the 1920s , the FCC was actively working to discourage competition and push up railroad rates .
In the 1930s , the ICC gained authority over the infant trucking industry , and used its authority to slow the growth of the trucking industry to protect the railroads from competition .
By 1970 , things had gotten so bad that a Ralph Nader report described the ICC as " predominantly a forum at which transportation interests divide up the national transportation market . "
What went wrong ?
The story is too long and complicated to fully describe in a blog post , but I think there are two key lessons .
First , the authors of the ICA dramatically underestimated the complexity of the railroad industry and the difficulty of government oversight .
One of the reasons the ICC was relatively toothless in its early years is that it was completely overwhelmed with paperwork , as dozens of railroads sent it information about thousands of routes .
The railroad industry was simply too complex and dynamic for a few Washington bureaucrats to even understand , to say nothing of regulating them effectively .
Second , the ICC 's failure is a classic example of what economists call " regulatory capture " : the ability of special interests to gain control of the regulatory process and use it to their advantage .
Because the railroads cared more about railroad regulation than anyone else , they were adept at getting their allies appointed to key positions at the commission .
Over time , the ICC not only ceased to be an effective watchdog of consumer interests , but actually began actively defending the interests of the railroads at consumers ' expense .
For about six decades — from about 1920 to 1980 — the ICC pursued policies that reduced competition and raised prices in the railroad industry .
And when trucking emerged as a potentially disruptive innovation , the ICC helped to limit its growth and slow the corresponding decline of the railroad industry .
The story of the ICC is not an isolated case .
Similar stories can be told of the Civil Aeronautics board , which limited competition in the airline industry until the 1970s .
And , of course , there 's the example of that the FCC actively promoted AT&T 's monopoly in the telecommunications market until it was broken up in 1984 .
We can certainly hope that Congress has learned from the experiences of the 20th century and will avoid the most egregious mistakes it made in the 20th century .
But it 's worth remembering that many of the conditions that led to the ICC 's problems are still with us .
Today 's FCC , like the ICC of the 20th Century , has a revolving door between the commission and the firms they regulate .
And the Internet , like the railroad industry of the 19th century , is extraordinarily dynamic and complex .
As a result , there 's a real danger that if Congress gives the FCC the power to regulate the Internet , it will make things worse , either because it cannot keep up with the Internet 's rapid evolution , or because industry incumbents will succeed in getting their own allies in key positions within the commission .
Either way , the results could be very different from what network neutrality proponents are hoping for .

CHAPEL HILL - More people suffer from pain than from heart disease , diabetes and cancer combined , but many of the drugs used to relieve suffering are not completely effective or have harmful side effects .
Now researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and the University of Helsinki have discovered a new therapeutic target for pain control , one that appears to be eight times more effective at suppressing pain than morphine .
The scientists pinpointed the identity and role of a particular protein that acts in pain - sensing neurons , or nerve cells , to convert the chemical messengers that cause pain into ones that suppress it .
" This protein has the potential to be a groundbreaking treatment for pain and has previously not been studied in pain - sensing neurons , " said lead study author Mark J. Zylka , Ph.D. , assistant professor of cell and molecular physiology at UNC .
The results of the study will be published online in the journal Neuron , on Wednesday ( Oct. 8 ) and in the print edition the following day .
The biological basis of pain is complex .
To study the transmission of painful signals throughout the body , many researchers use " marker " proteins that label pain - sensing neurons .
One such marker , FRAP ( fluoride - resistant acid phosphatase ) , has been employed for this purpose for nearly 50 years , but the gene that codes for its production was never identified .
That is , until researchers at UNC found that FRAP is identical to PAP ( prostatic acid phosphatase ) , a protein routinely used to diagnose prostate cancer whose levels increase in the blood of patients with metastatic prostate cancer .
Previous research hinted that FRAP and PAP may have a shared identity .
To determine whether or not this was the case , Zylka teamed up with Dr. Pirkko Vihko , a professor from the University of Helsinki who had genetically engineered mice that were missing the gene for PAP .
When Zylka and his colleagues studied tissues from these mutant mice , they were happy to see that FRAP activity was missing .
This revealed that the two proteins were in fact identical .
Further , the mutant mice proved more sensitive than normal mice to inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain , two common forms of chronic pain in humans .
These increased sensitivities diminished when researchers injected excess amounts of PAP into the spinal cords of the mutant mice .
" We were really blown away that a simple injection could have such a potent effect on pain , " Zylka said .
" Not only that , but it appeared to work much better than the commonly used drug morphine . "
The new protein suppressed pain as effectively as morphine but for substantially longer .
One dose of PAP lasted for up to three days , much longer than the five hours gained with a single dose of morphine .
The next question for the researchers was how PAP suppressed pain .
It is already known that when pain - sensing neurons are stimulated , they release chemicals known as nucleotides , specifically adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) .
This in turn sets off the events that invoke a painful sensation .
But if ATP degrades to adenosine , that inhibits the neurons that transmit pain signals , thus relieving pain .
Through a series of experiments , the UNC researchers showed that PAP removes the phosphate group , generating adenosine .
Their study is the first to identify and characterize the role of such a protein in pain - sensing neurons .
Zylka and his colleagues are now searching for additional proteins that degrade nucleotides in these neurons .
They are also working to develop small molecules that interact with PAP to enhance or mimic its activity .
" It is entirely possible that PAP itself could be used as a treatment for pain , through an injection just like morphine , " Zylka said .
" But we would like to modify it to be taken in pill form .
By taking this field in a new direction , we are encouraged and hopeful that we will be able to devise new treatments for pain . "

Lusi has been erupting for two years , leaving 30,000 people homeless
The eruption of the Lusi mud volcano in Indonesia was caused by drilling for oil and gas , a meeting of 74 leading geologists has concluded .
Lusi erupted in May 2006 and continues to spew out boiling mud , displacing around 30,000 people in East Java .
Drilling firm Lapindo Brantas denies a nearby well was the trigger , blaming an earthquake 280 km ( 174 miles ) away .
Around 10,000 families who have lost their homes are awaiting compensation , which could run as high as $ 70 m ( £ 43 m ) .
This is the data we wanted to get out - the data I have never been able to show before .
It clearly shows that the well failed .
It was the driver for the eruption
Professor Richard Davies
Durham University
After debating new evidence at a conference in South Africa , most geologists voted drilling as the cause .
Correspondents describe the result a significant development in the tug - of - war to establish liability for the disaster .
Mud slinging
The debate on the cause of the eruption took place at a meeting of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists , in Cape Town .
It was the first time the two opposing sides had agreed to debate before an international conference of independent experts .
The contest was chaired by a professional football referee - Professor John Underhill , an Edinburgh University geologist , who is also a match official in the Scottish Premier League .
We presented clear and indisputable facts that none of the four required factors for the well to have been responsible for triggering the eruption occurred .
Lapindo Brantas spokesman
The dispute centres on some newly released data - measurements taken from the Banjar - Panji - 1 exploration well during the final 24 hours leading up to the eruption .
Professor Richard Davies , of Durham University in the UK , argued that these readings clearly point to a build up of pressure , causing fractures which propagated from the bore hole to the surface 150 m away , resulting in the eruption .
However , Rocky Sawolo , senior drilling adviser of Lapindo Brantas , used the same primary data to argue the opposite - the pressure within the well was within acceptable limits .
The Lusi mud volcano may be active for decades , some believe

His colleague Dr Adriano Mazzini , of the University of Oslo , testified that the fracture was triggered by a magnitude 6.3 earthquake two days earlier , centred on Yogyakarta , some 280 km away .
But these claims were directly contradicted by Dr Mark Tingay from Curtin University , Australia , a geological pressure and rock mechanics expert .
The earthquake " was at least an order of magnitude too small , " he said , stressing that the force felt at the Lusi site would have been " very small " - comparable to the effect of a heavy truck passing overhead .
Judgment call
When the vote was called , 42 out of the 74 scientists in the audience were convinced that the drilling was the trigger of the eruption .
Only three voted for the earthquake .
A further 16 scientists believed the evidence was inconclusive , and the remaining 13 felt that a combination of earthquake and drilling was to blame .
" The geologists voted overwhelmingly that drilling was the most likely cause , " said Prof Underhill .
" The atmosphere was very tense , so all credit to them for not sitting on their hands .
" Hopefully this will be a catalyst for taking things forward .
To my mind the result demonstrates that at the very least , the drilling company have a case to answer . "
Prof Davies said : " I remain convinced that drilling was the cause of the mud volcano .
" The opinion of the international scientists adds further weight to my conviction . "
Victims scatter flower petals on their former village , now swamped by mud
For two years , the Lusi crater has been oozing mud - enough to fill 50 Olympic size swimming pools every day .
The eruption began at 0500 on 29 May 2006 in the Porong subdistrict of Sidoarjo , Eastern Java , close to Indonesia 's second city of Surabaya .
All efforts to stem the flow have failed - including a network of dams ; channelling into the sea ; and an ambitious plan to plug the crater with concrete balls .
Some geologists believe Lusi could continue to erupt for decades .
The mud flow has razed four villages and 25 factories .
Thirteen people have died , as a result of a rupture in a natural gas pipeline underneath one of the holding dams .
THE AFTERMATH
The victims of the mud volcano A police investigation is underway to identify the trigger and to determine whether the drillers are liable for compensating 10,000 families , amounting to 700 billion Indonesian Rupias ( US$ 77 m ; £ 47 m ) .
If the earthquake is judged responsible , as claimed by Lapindo , then the Indonesian government will have the burden of supporting the victims .
There is no dispute that seismic activity can provoke mud volcanoes , and both are common in East Java .
Nevertheless , in June 2008 Prof Davies published a paper in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters , in which he concluded with " 99 % certainty " that Lapindo 's drilling caused the mudflow .
He argues that the 2,500 m - deep bore hole ruptured limestone rock , containing pressurised water .
As the lower part of the borehole was not protected by casing , this forced water and mud into the rocks surrounding the well .
At the conference , he produced fresh records of the changes in pressure in the 24 hours leading up to Lusi 's eruption .
The pressure plots were introduced by drilling engineer Susila Lusiaga , who works with the Indonesian police investigation team .
" The pressure in the well went way beyond what it could tolerate ... and it triggered the mud volcano , " he said .
The new records " provide a compelling tape recording of the well as it started to leak , " said Prof Davies .
Debate Chairman John Underhill is also a professional football referee " This is the data we wanted to get out - the data I have never been able to show before .
" It clearly shows that the well failed .
And this failure was the driver for a the breakdown of the rocks - it was the trigger for the mud volcano . "
The well took a huge influx of fluid the day before the eruption , he said , resulting in intolerable pressures , and fractures which propagated until the surface was breached .
" We see the pressure building , then suddenly we see a massive drop at 9.30 pm on May 28th - the night before the eruption began .
" This is evidence that a fracture has opened up .
It 's like a tyre bursting - the pressure inside bleeds away .
He added : " This may be evidence that Lusi actually started at 9.30 pm the night before - not 5 am the next morning .
Giant levees have been constructed to contain the mud
" Now the data has been released , I would like to get it out to independent drilling experts , who can then go through it , " said Prof Davies , a geologist .
" We are particularly grateful to Lapindo , who were widely applauded at the meeting for their willingness to take part .
We are now starting to make some headway . "
However , despite the vote , the drilling firm strenuously denies that its activities were in any way responsible for the disaster .
From the same primary data , they calculate that the pressures under the ground did not go beyond critical levels .
" We presented clear and indisputable facts that none of the four required factors for the well to have been responsible for triggering the eruption occurred , " a spokesman for Lapindo Brantas said .
" Specifically : there was no uncontrolled ' kick ' .
The casing shoe was not breached and the well was intact .
" There was no underground blowout .
There was no sustained pressure to propagate a fracture . "

Sometimes an idea so simple , so brilliant , so obvious crosses your path and you think , " D'oh !
Why did n't I come up with this several decades ago ? "
And the answer is , of course , because you ( like me ) are a lunkhead and while we are inspired by that solution , we never really had it in us to think it up ourselves .
This morning , I once again experienced that sense of awe and shame , when fellow staffers Ryan and Clint pointed me to lns after I publicly started complaining about how I could never remember which order to use for my ln arguments .
There 's nothing technologically challenging about lns .
It 's a simple utility that I could have easily written myself ; but I did n't and I never thought of it and I am so pleased that Sean M. Burke not only thought it up but also shared it with the world .
lns lets you use ln in complete ignorance of the order of arguments .
You no longer have to remember , source dest or dest source ( or , as the man page reveals ln [ - Ffhinsv ] source_file [ target_file ] ) .
You just use it however you feel best and the utility figures out the rest .
Paste the source code into a new file , make it executable and throw it into your local bin .
Then be prepared to let go your decades - old resentment of ln .
Because lns just works :
% lns ~/fl foo Made foo -> / Users/ericasadun/fl % lns bar ~/fl Made bar -> / Users/ericasadun/fl % lns glorple fligle
But neither glorple nor fligle exist !
Eidos lost a lot of credibility among gamers with the way it handled reviews of Kayne & Lynch .
But it looks like the publisher is up to its old tricks again and has been trying to temporarily block low reviews scores for the upcoming Tomb Raider : Underworld .
The news was revealed via a Twitter post by GameSpot UK editor Guy Cocker , which said " call from Eidos — if you 're planning on reviewing Tomb Raider Underworld at less than an 8.0 , we need you to hold your review till Monday . "
Public relations company Barrington Harvey — which represent Eidos — then confirmed to videogaming 247 that it was true .
" That 's right .
We 're trying to manage the review scores at the request of Eidos , " a company spokesperson said .
"
We 're trying to get the Metacritic rating to be high , and the brand manager in the US that 's handling all of Tomb Raider has asked that we just manage the scores before the game is out , really , just to ensure that we do n't put people off buying the game , basically . "
It does n't look like the tactic is working though , as the game currently has a Metacritic average of 78 % .
This includes sub - 80 % reviews from publications like IGN , 1up , Eurogamer , and Official Xbox Magazine UK .
But given the negative reaction that the Kayne & Lynch incident inspired , it 's surprising that Eidos would even resort to these kinds of tactics again .
Ben 's thoughts
This is the dumbest thing I 've ever heard ... what is Eidos going to do , stop sending review copies to sites that do n't comply ?
Do they really think reviews of Eidos games bring in enough readers for this to be a valid tactic ?
It most cases being told you can't review the new Eidos game is something of a relief more than it is a punishment .
Here 's a hint at the best way to " manage " review scores : make good games .
It 's just that easy .
People With Severe Osteoarthritis Got Relief From Practicing Tai Chi , Study Shows
WebMD Health News By Kelley Colihan WebMD Health News
Oct. 25 , 2008 — A new study shows the ancient Chinese movement art of tai chi can help ease knee pain in people who have severe osteoarthritis .
Researchers , led by Chenchen Wang , MD , MSc , from Tufts Medical Center in Boston , got together 40 people with severe knee osteoarthritis who reported knee pain on most days of the previous month .
The average age of the study participants was 65 .
All had osteoarthritis for an average of 10 years and were considered overweight , with an average body mass index of 30 .
One group practiced an hour of tai chi ( adapted from the classical yang style ) twice a week for 12 weeks .
The comparison group received the same amount of time stretching and boning up on wellness education .
Researchers wanted to see how scores on pain , physical function , health - related quality of life , and mood changed at the end of 12 weeks .
They found that the tai chi group improved more than the other group in scores of pain , physical function , depression , and physical quality of life .
Researchers repeated the assessments at 24 weeks and 48 weeks and found that the group that continued to practice tai chi had less pain and longer - lasting function benefits .
A recent CDC study found that the lifetime risk of having symptomatic knee osteoarthritis was nearly 45 % , with increased risk for people with history of a knee injury .
Tai chi , sometimes called a “ soft martial art , ” uses flowing , gentle movements and balancing postures .
It also employs a meditative quality , as the mind focuses on the body movements .
The results are being released Oct. 25 at the American College of Rheumatology ’s annual meeting in San Francisco .
The research was partially funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine .

Another thrift store find : a huge coloring book from 1983 filled with disordered images of Mr. T and a bunch of kids doing gymnastics and traveling across the United States ( I guess it was related to a short - lived Saturday - morning cartoon ) .
I took some of the best pages and compiled them into a more manageable coloring book .
The captions were incredibly boring , so I rewrote some of them .
If you like this one , wait till you see the next one I 'm planning to put together .

Terence Tao Mathematician , University of California Los Angeles
Many of the great mathematicians of our era probably scored a perfect 800 on the math section of their SATs .
Terence Tao squeaked by with a 760 — when he was 8 years old .
A quarter century later , Tao , now 33 , is one of the most prolific and esteemed mathematicians in the nation .
In 1999 he became UCLA ’s youngest professor at age 24 and later won the 2006 Fields Medal , considered the Nobel Prize of math .
In a discipline where one can spend a lifetime working on a single problem , Tao has made major contributions in a number of categories ranging from nonlinear equations to number theory — which explains why colleagues continually seek his guidance .
“ In every generation of mathematicians , there are a few at the very top , ” says Charles Fefferman of Princeton University , a mathematical giant in his own right .
“ He belongs in that group . ”
Tao ’s best - known research involves patterns of prime numbers ( numbers divisible only by one and themselves ) .
While he mainly sticks to the theoretical , his breakthrough work in compressed sensing is allowing engineers to develop sharper , more efficient imaging technology for MRIs , astronomical instruments , and digital cameras .
“ Research sometimes feels like an ongoing TV series in which some amazing revelations have already been made , but there are still plenty of cliff - hangers and unresolved plotlines that you want to see resolved , ” Tao says .
“ But unlike TV , we have to do the work ourselves to figure out what happens next . ”
Tao says there are big puzzles he ’d love to solve , but the only way to reach that point is by chipping away at smaller , more manageable problems .
“ If there is something that I should know how to do but do n’t , it bugs me , ” he says .
“ I feel like I have to sit down and work out exactly what the problem is . ” — Andrew Grant
Jeffrey Bode Organic Chemist , University of Pennsylvania
Organic chemists do n’t have many ways to stitch complicated molecules together , says Jeffrey Bode , 34 , who has discovered a new method that could prove a boon for producing expensive peptide - based drugs such as insulin and human growth hormone .
Many organic chemists had thought the established methods for building these proteins — adding individual amino acids like beads on a string — worked pretty well , Bode says .
“ That is true as long as you want to make relatively short ones or you want to make only small amounts of them . ”
As the strands get longer , if an individual bead does n’t make it onto the peptide string , it becomes harder to separate those mistakes from the correct sequence .
To remedy this , Bode discovered a new chemical reaction that creates amide bonds ( a reaction between alpha - keto acid and hydroxylamine ) , which he uses to connect small , easily synthesized peptides — strands of amino acids — into longer peptides .
Bode notes that in organic chemistry , “ it ’s possible to come up with a way of doing something that is perhaps better and more elegant and more efficient than what ’s already out there . ”

Katey Walter Ecologist , University of Alaska
Examining the effect of greenhouse gases on local ecology and global climate keeps Katey Walter , 32 , chasing the methane that bubbles up from seeps in Arctic lakes .
As temperatures warm , the Arctic permafrost thaws and pools into lakes , where bacteria feast on its carbon - rich material — much of it animal remains , food , and feces from before the Ice Age — and churn out methane , a heat trapper 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide .
More methane leads to warmer temperatures and even more thawing permafrost .
“ That means you ’re opening the freezer door and you ’re going to defrost everything that ’s there , ” Walter says .
In Alaska and eastern Siberia , she and her colleagues are cataloging the Arctic freezer ’s carbon contents , trying to understand how much will be converted to methane as the ice melts .
In 2006 she and her team discovered that nearly five times as much of the gas was being released as previously reported .

Amy Wagers Stem Cell Biologist , Harvard Stem Cell institute
Amy Wagers was finishing her doctoral degree in immunology in 1999 when she got a call from the National Bone Marrow Registry .
Having volunteered to donate her bone marrow years earlier , there was now someone who needed it .
Wagers was inspired to research bone marrow stem cells and did her postdoctoral work on adult stem cells .
Today Wagers , 35 , is a leading researcher of adult stem cells — those that generate blood and muscle .
She works to isolate populations of these cells , discover how the body regulates them , and understand how they can be used to treat disease .
Her research is identifying how blood cells migrate between blood and bone marrow and how they multiply .
The work could help make marrow transplants more effective by improving the survival of transplanted cells .
This summer Wagers published research showing that when muscle stem cells were transferred into mice with a type of muscular dystrophy , the rodents ’ muscle function improved .
“ They started immediately to produce new muscle fibers , ” Wagers says .
“ There ’s obviously a long way to go to translate those findings into humans , but it ’s encouraging . ” — Emily Anthes

Imagine knowing , before you go under the knife , not only that your surgeon has performed the procedure hundreds of times before but that he has practiced on a replica of you .
Joseph Teran , 31 , is helping make this scenario a reality , using mathematical modeling to simulate surgeries involving a patients ’ tendons , muscles , fat , and skin .
“ We have governing mathematical equations for how those tissues operate , ” Teran says .
The first step is to turn those equations into a standard digital human that can react , in real time , to a surgeon ’s virtual actions .
Then the idea is to allow doctors to customize this tool .
In the future , medical imaging such as CT and MRI could reveal that one patient , for instance , has tendons that are stiffer than average , allowing the doctor to adjust the “ digital double ” [ pdf ] accordingly .
“ You want it to be as close to the real experience as possible , ” Teran says .

Jack Harris Applied Physicist , Yale University
Quantum mechanics describes a crazy microscopic world where particles whiz around at blistering speeds and routinely violate the classical laws of physics we take for granted .
Jack Harris ’s goal is to take advantage of the “ really strange , even mystical ” laws of the microscopic and apply them to problems in our macroscopic world .
“ The ultimate eureka moment would be to suddenly realize that a [ macroscopic ] object is doing something that is absolutely forbidden by classical physics , ” he says .
Harris , 36 , studies the minuscule pressures exerted by individual photons ( electromagnetic particles ) when they bounce off small , flexible mirrors .
To illustrate the scale of these pressures , consider that on a clear day , the sun ’s rays push against your body with only a millionth of a pound of force .
Harris wants to harness light photon by photon , which could lead to unbreakable cryptography and ultrasensitive astronomical instruments able to detect invisible phenomena created nanoseconds after the Big Bang .

Sarkis Mazmanian Biologist , California Institute of Technology
Of the 100 trillion bacteria living inside the human gut , some are pathogens that can trigger disease and vicious immune responses , while many work with the immune system to protect the host .
Sarkis Mazmanian , 35 , devotes himself to understanding how the good ones promote health .
“ They could n’t care less about us except that we provide them a stable and nutrient - rich habitat , ” says Mazmanian , who sees this symbiotic relationship between the human body and microbes as a gold mine of potential therapies for a number of illnesses .
Mazmanian believes the interaction between the body and intestinal bacteria might hold the key , for example , to how an abnormal immune response to these microbes may be responsible for the development of colon cancer .
“ The potential of beneficial microbes appears to be limitless , ” he says .
Mazmanian says the philosophy that underpins his research is that “ anything is possible in the natural world .
Therefore , I am willing to entertain any possible cause of or outcome to a scientific problem . ”

Michael Elowitz Biologist , Caltech
In 2000 Michael Elowitz , now 38 , designed a genetic circuit that made E. coli blink in a culture dish .
It was a huge moment , he says , recalling the cells ’ behaving like fluorescent green Christmas lights .
But the experiment was also a fortunate failure .
Although the cells blinked , they did so at different rates .
That variability among cells containing the same program kicked off a whole new line of experiments that Elowitz says are focused on “ what it is that is making different cells do different things . ”
Today Elowitz is examining the mechanisms by which genetically identical cells exploit and control random fluctuations in their own biochemical components in order to generate cell - type diversity .
“ Understanding the role of ‘ noisy ’ fluctuations can help us understand how bacteria diversify to survive , ” Elowitz says , “ as well as how cells specialize to build multicellular organisms . ”

Changhuei Yang Electrical and Bioengineer , Caltech
As the performance ability of microscopes has increased , so has their size and cost — and that has had an impact on research .
“ There ’s a mismatch between what those microscope systems can do and what some of the basic needs are , ” says Changhuei Yang , 36 .
By combining chip technology and microfluidics , Yang has created an inexpensive miniature microscope .
About the size of “ a hair on a bumblebee , ” he says , with a circuit the size of a dime , it contains no optical lenses and works by allowing a small volume of fluid to flow across a microchip , which then sends images of the sample to a computer .
The microscopes can be built into a small handheld display — a device about the size of an iPod .
Yang imagines physicians in the developing world using this tool to examine patients ’ blood or the local water supply .
“ It would be a very rugged system that the clinician can just put into his pocket , ” he says .

Adam Riess Astrophysicist , Johns Hopkins University
Adam Riess turned astronomy on its head when he led a team of astronomers ( the High -z Team ) that discovered the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up .
Scientists had accepted cosmic expansion since 1929 , and prior to 1998 they assumed gravitational attraction would gradually bring it to a halt .
But when Riess , 38 , tried to use the data he uncovered from observing distant stellar explosions to reinforce this model , the numbers would n’t jibe .
A few days later , he proved that his data made sense only in an accelerating universe .
The finding showed that an overwhelming repulsive force — fueled by a mysterious dark energy that makes up 72 percent of the universe — overcomes gravity to drive this cosmic acceleration .
“ It ’s like throwing a ball up in the air and it keeps going up , ” he says .
Now armed with a $ 500,000 MacArthur fellowship he won in September , Riess is determined to uncover the secrets of this dark energy and its influence on the universe .

Nicole King Molecular and Cell Biologist , University of California at Berkeley
Nicole King , 38 , is hunting for an answer to how the evolutionary leap occurred from single - celled organisms to plants , fungi , multicelled animals , and other forms of life .
To find clues , she has trained her sights on choanoflagellates — a group of single - celled eukaryotes thought to be the closest living relatives of animals .
Sequencing the genome of one such organism , King and her colleagues found genes that code for pieces of the same proteins used for the binding of cells and communication between cells in animals — functions that would be unexpected in such an organism .
King hypothesizes that proteins that the single - celled ancestors of animals used to interact with the extracellular environment — to capture bacterial prey by binding to their cell surface and to detect chemical signals — were later repurposed to enable cells to stick to and talk to each other .
Interpreting the origins of multicellularity is key to understanding the origins of animals , King says , noting that her research “ reaches back much further on the family tree than our common ancestors with other primates . ” — Y. B .
Luis von Ahn Computer Scientist , Carnegie Mellon University
Luis von
Ahn , 30 , has left his mark all over the Internet .
When you buy tickets online and are asked to decipher an image of distorted words — that ’s the work of von Ahn .
He helped develop this antispamming technology , known as CAPTCHA ( Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart ) , in 2000 .
CAPTCHA works because it is solvable by man but not by machine .
Still , von
Ahn ’s ultimate goal is not to outwit computers ; instead , he wants to exploit man ’s unique intelligence to eliminate the machine ’s shortcomings — while completing some useful tasks along the way .
One vehicle to close such an intelligence gap is reCAPTCHA .
Each day it utilizes about 18 million computer users — perhaps ticket buyers — to key in words from scanned pages of text in order to digitize them , words that a computer is not yet able to recognize .
( By next year researchers expect to finish digitizing The New York Times archive dating back to the 1850s . )

The more you play , the more data you provide toward helping computers recognize images .

Tapio Schneider Environmental Scientist , Caltech
The complex interactions of atmospheric turbulence and heat transport affect global climate .
Tapio Schneider , 36 , has developed computer simulations to better understand how .
“ Ideally , I ’d like to build myself a climate in a laboratory , ” he says , “ but we ca n’t do that with a planet , so computers are the next best thing . ”
In a developing project , he recently used a model planet to show that monsoons can form even in shallow water like a swamp .
Therefore Halley ’s traditional model for monsoons — that the different heat capacities of land and ocean surfaces cause these seasonal deluges — does n’t give a full picture .
The movement of water vapor through climate systems remains poorly understood , Schneider says .
“ That ’s one set of questions that I will be working on for many years . ”
Schneider ’s goal is to build a set of fundamental laws of physics for climate .
“ The laws of thermodynamics give a macro­scopic description of microscopic behavior , ” he says .
“ I would like to have something analogous for climate . ” — S. W .

As questions swirled around the existence of extrasolar planets in the late 1990s , Sara Seager , 36 , gambled that these distant flickers transiting in front of stars would grow into astronomy ’s next frontier .
The bet paid off :
Her theoretical models of the chemistry of extrasolar planets have helped researchers make the first atmospheric measurements of a distant world .
Seager expects that we ’ll find a cousin to Earth in the next couple of years , but her ultimate goals are grander .
“ What I really want to do is figure out which kinds of gases extraterrestrial life might produce , ” she says .
“ These gases would accumulate in the atmosphere and might be detectable from afar . ”
As a step in that direction , she ’s looking for signatures , other than oxygen - based ones , that Earth - like life might leave behind , such as hydrogen sulfide .
During Seager ’s childhood in Canada , her father exposed her to a variety of ideas — including that of a stargazing party .
“ Having that time to daydream , ” she says , “ was so crucial to making me a good scientist . ”

Jon Kleinberg Computer Scientist , Cornell University
In the mid-1990s a Web search for , say , “ DISCOVER magazine ” meant wading through thousands of results presented in a very imperfect order .
Then , in 1996 , 24 - year - old Jon Kleinberg developed an algorithm that revolutionized Web search .
That is why today , that same search lists this magazine ’s home page first .
Kleinberg , now 37 , created the Hyperlink - Induced Topic Search algorithm , which estimates a Web page ’s value in both authority ( quality of content and endorsement by other pages ) and hub ( whether it links to good pages ) .
Kleinberg continues to combine computer science , data analysis , and sociological research to help create better tools that link social networking sites .
He envisions an increase in how we can see information move through space over time , in what he calls geographic hot spots on the Web , based on the interests of a particular region .
Our social network links and friendships depend on these geographic hot spots , Kleinberg says , which makes searching easier by “ taking into account not just who and when , but where . ”
He is now studying how word - of - mouth phenomena like fads and rumors flow through groups of people , hoping to apply this knowledge to processes such as political mobilization .

Edward Boyden Neuroengineer , MIT Media Lab
Certain species of bacteria and algae have genes that allow them to transform light into electrical energy .
Edward Boyden , 29 , has been able to show that inserting one of these genes into a neuron can make it similarly responsive .
“ When we illuminate these cells ... we can cause them to be activated , ” he says .
Having created such genetically modified neurons , Boyden is engineering brain implants that can stimulate them with light pulses .
Boyden ’s implants , he hopes , will be used to help control diseases like Parkinson ’s , which is sometimes treated with implanted stimulators that issue electric current .
“ There are things that light can do that purely electric stimulators can ’t , ” Boyden says .
With this technology , researchers can be selective about which neurons they engineer to be responsive , and an optical implant can emit light in a variety of patterns , allowing more precise control over neural circuits .

Richard Bonneau Systems Biologist , New York University
Chronicling the parts of cell anatomy class - style is all well and good , says Richard Bonneau , 33 , but biologists ’ true holy grail is understanding how each part dictates the function of the others .
“ You might know that A is related to B , but if you do n’t have a dynamic picture of your system , you do n’t know which part is affecting which , ” he says .
“ I want to put the arrows on the lines , so to speak . ”
By tracking activity in almost all the genes of a free - living archaeon — which , like a bacterium , is a prokaryote — Bonneau was recently able to piece together how the genes affected one another ’s expression , enabling him to map the organism ’s “ control circuit ” as if it were a machine .
In the process , he found something surprising : Instead of generating completely different responses to external stimuli like light and toxic chemicals , “ the archaeon takes those environmental stimuli and puts them into the same integrator , ” he says .
“ There ’s not an infinite number of responses . ”
Knowing the limited range of behaviors that microorganisms display , he adds , will prove a big help in engineering them to churn out drugs and biofuels .

Shawn Frayne Inventor , Humdinger Wind Energy
Shawn Frayne , 27 , has a knack for creating simple technological solutions that make a difference for people in developing nations .
He was part of the team that introduced sugarcane - based charcoal as a cheap cooking fuel , and his solar disinfecting plastic bags purify water for drinking .
It is his Windbelt , though , that may have the most impact .
Inspired by the dynamics of the 1940 collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge , Frayne spent four years developing the world ’s first turbineless wind generator .
When the wind blows , it causes a flap of Mylar - coated taffeta fabric to vibrate rapidly , moving magnets fitted on either end past coils to generate electricity .
In the developing world , the 10 watts it produces can light a room at night by electricity rather than expensive and dangerous kerosene .
By selling intellectual property rights for his inventions to big companies , Frayne hopes to fund more innovative projects for developing nations .
“ That is where the biggest challenges are , and it ’s where I think most of the invention and innovation are going to come from in my lifetime , ” he says .

It ’s easy to think of evolution as something that happened millions of years ago , but Jonathan Pritchard , 37 , has proved we ’re actually adapting to our environment in real time .
Using statistical models to home in on genetic mutations that spread quickly throughout populations , Pritchard and his colleagues have identified hundreds of regions of the genome that have recently been transformed by natural selection .
“ If a new mutation arose in a certain population and it was strongly favored , natural selection would drive the frequency of that allele up very quickly , ” he says .
“ Most of the time there are only small frequency differences between human groups , so when there are big frequency differences , they really stand out . ” — E. S .
October 30 , 2008  -- A McCain - Palin campaign official snubbed the president of Penn State University who inquired about attending a campus speech Tuesday by Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin , university officials told ABCNews.com .
" He 's a big Democrat .
Why would he want to meet Palin ? " campaign aide Russell Bermel allegedly asked a school employee who was hoping to make arrangements for president Graham B. Spanier to meet Palin , according to Spanier 's office .
Spokespeople for the McCain - Palin campaign said Wednesday they could not locate Bermel and would not make him available for comment .
On Thursday , a spokesman contacted ABC News and said they had reached Bermel , who flatly denied the account .
The campaign did not make Bermel available for an interview .
The McCain - Palin campaign has been working overtime to become competitive in Pennsylvania , where the Obama - Biden campaign has enjoyed a double - digit lead in the polls .
Some might say that makes it an odd time to snub the president of the state 's largest university .
The school enrolls 40,000 students and counts a quarter - million alumni living in Pennsylvania alone .
" I welcome eminent visitors to our campus everyday , including lots of Republicans , but [ the McCain - Palin campaign ] did n't want me to greet her or even attend the event , " said Spanier .
Gov. Palin spoke Tuesday night before about 7,000 people at a " closed " event at the school 's Rec Hall that was open only to people invited by the campaign .
Under university policy , candidates who open their appearances to all students and members of the public are allowed free use of university halls , other than incidental costs .
Because it was a " closed " event , with tickets controlled by the Republican party and the campaign , the university charged the campaign $ 8,000 for use of the hall , according to Penn State vice - president Bill Mahon .
" It was a decision made by a campaign advance staff member , " said Mahon .
" We were told that president Spanier could not come . "
" My guess is this is just a young campaigner , " added Mahon .
" Certianly Gov. Palin would not be aware of this . "
" We welcome one and all , " said McCain - Palin spokesman Brian Rogers , " especially when we 're going to a university , we'd want the folks in charge to welcome us .
. .
Obviously , if there was some miscommunication , that 's regrettable . "
Nobody " on the political level " made any decision to block Spanier because he was a Democrat , Rogers said , and noted that the school sent two other officials to meet Palin .
According to an account provided by Spanier 's office , campaign aide Bermel called Spanier 's office in response to an inquiry from school security about arranging for Spanier to greet Palin .
Bermel said that Spanier was not on the invitation list and that the campaign had not been previously told of his interest , and he " demanded " to speak with Spanier directly , according to the account .
Bermel indicated that he " had escorted President Bush to meet with kings , and that therefore there should be no barriers to speaking with the president of Penn State , " according to Spanier 's office .
Then Bermel allegedly stated , " He 's a big Democrat .
Why would he want to meet Palin ? " and reiterated his request to speak with Spanier , who was not present .
" He did n't say any of this , " McCain - Palin spokesman Brian Rogers said Thursday .
" [ Bermel ] did not talk about – he never demanded to speak to the president directly .
He never made the statement about escorting President Bush to meet kings .
He did n't say any of that . "
To the contrary , Rogers insisted , Bermel and other campaign staff " were working to make sure we could accomodate the president . "
Rogers said Bermel did n't even know who the president of Penn State was , much less his party affiliation .
He confirmed that Bermel had worked for President Bush .
After the alleged conversation , senior Penn State administrators discussed the matter and decided " to defuse the awkwardness " by backing out of the greeting request with the explanation that Spanier had a schedule conflict .
Spanier , president of Penn State since 1995 , said he has greeted a long list of candidates from both parties to the campus , including Republicans Sen.
Arlen Specter , and former Governor and Homeland Security secretary Tom Ridge .
Former President Bill Clinton appeared Wednesday at Penn State .
Clinton 's speech was open to all who wanted to attend , so there was no charge for the use of the venue .
Spanier says he does not appear on stage or introduce candidates but is always eager " to officially welcome visitors to our campus . "
" At a time when both campaigns are appealing to independents and people of the other party in our state , it seems like a strange decision , " Spanier said .
Spanier is a well - known figure in Pennsylvania , overseeing a university with 40,000 students and an annual budget of $ 3.6 billion .
He often substitutes for the Penn State Nittany Lion mascot at football games and joins the marching band on to the field wearing a drum .
He is chairman of the Association of American Universities and received an award last week from the FBI for his role as chair of the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board .

The Peraves MonoTracer blurs the line between motorcycle and car , providing the excitement of two wheels with the comfort of four in a vehicle that looks like something out of Star Wars .
The super - exclusive MonoTracer – just 100 will be built next year , at about $ 70,000 a pop – is a fully - enclosed motorcycle with training wheels .
The carbon - fiber two - seater combines Porsche - like performance with scooter - like fuel economy , accelerating from zero to 62 mph in a claimed ( . pdf ) 4.8 seconds while still returning 65 mpg .
With the perfect blend of performance and luxury , the MonoTracer just might be the sports car of the future .
And it was just named one of Time magazine 's best inventions of the year .
Former SwissAir pilot Arnold Wagner has been playing with enclosed motorcycles since 1982 , when he built a prototype of the Ecomobile .
It looked a bit like a Tylenol capsule with wheels and used a BMW motorcycle engine for power .
Wagner and his sons built more than 90 Ecos – most were sold in Europe and Japan , although a few made it to America – before a fire destroyed the molds a few years ago .
Rather than give up or simply recreate the Ecomobile , Wagner and his two sons went back to the drawing board .
The MonoTracer sports a carbon fiber and Kevlar body reinforced with aluminum crash and roll bars .
The engine cradle , retractable outriggers – they keep the bike from falling over at stoplights – and steering head are aircraft - quality steel .
Power comes from the same 1200 - cc four - cylinder engine BMW uses in its K - bikes .
The engine produces 113 horsepower , which may not seem like much until you realize the Monotracer weighs just over 1,000 pounds .
Amenities include air conditioning and a full - on stereo .
Driving the MonoTracer is a lot like riding a motorcycle - twist the throttle and go - but it's got a clutch pedal instead of a lever .
The MonoTracer will lean into corners at a superbike - like 52 degrees , while ABS and traction control will keep you from getting in over your head .

Abstract
One measure of the impact of the personal computer is in terms of its time displacement of other activities .
Mass media generally are considered a prime candidate given the on-line profusion of information and entertainment services .
This article compares the daily mass media habits of heavy , light , and nonusers of personal computers and on - line services based on 1994 and 1995 national surveys conducted by the Times - Mirror Center for the People and the Press .
No significant or consistent evidence of time displacement of mass media was found .
Indeed , heavier computer usage was associated with significantly greater use of the print media and movies , even after multivariate adjustment .
It is concluded that at this stage of diffusion , personal computers may have more in common with " time - enhancing " home appliances ( e.g. , automobile , washing machine ) than they do with television .
Nonetheless , more complete time diary studies are needed to identify the full temporal effects of the personal computer , much as they did for television .
Who ’s Bigoted Now ?
Still Tony Perkins .
( Image from The Propaganda Remix Project )
If you wear rose - colored glasses , everything you look at seems rosy .
If you are filled with hate , you see hate in everything you look at .
Which of these scenarios describes Tony Perkins of the Fundie Research Council ?
Hmm .
Well he ’s not wearing glasses .
One of his recent emails is titled “ Who ’s ‘ Bigoted ’ Now ? ” :
The homosexuals ’ vicious reaction to the passing of Proposition 8 shows the movement ’s sheer hypocrisy .
The disgruntled Left calls supporters of traditional marriage “ bigots . ”
But those who understand the meaning of “ bigotry ” and “ civil rights ” — African Americans — overwhelmingly supported the marriage amendments in California and Florida .
This is one of the biggest disappointments of this last election .
I would think that a group that has been discriminated against for centuries would recognize discrimination when they saw it .
I would also think that having had that experience would sensitize them to the unacceptability of discrimination in all its forms .
In response , white homosexual demonstrators have showered African Americans with racist epithets , revealing what one liberal blogger calls “ the not - so - latent racism in our movement . ”
Tony commits two errors in this sentence .
His lesser offense is in not telling us who this alleged liberal blogger is .
Tony calls Barack Obama , a moderate Democrat , a “ radical ” .
I can hardly depend on Tony ’s characterization of that blog .
That makes the entire quote worthless , because we ca n’t know if its writer is qualified to detect the size and intensity of racism within the liberal population .
Tony ’s greater offense is that he ’s painting an entire group of people — liberals — with the claim that there is a large streak of racism within them .
The racist incidents that occurred in the aftermath of Prop. 8 were few , compared with how many people voted against the discriminatory initiative .
Just as Fred Phelps is not a fair representative of fundamentalism , a smattering of racist epithets is not a true representation of people who believe in equal rights .
Another liberal affirmed that marriage supporters …
No , the unnamed liberal that Tony quotes would not have called bigots like Tony “ marriage supporters ” .
The true marriage supporters are the people who were opposed to Prop. 8 , because it arbitrarily took away the right to marry from a group of people .
Returning to that paragraph :
Another liberal affirmed that marriage supporters [ sic ] “ had a far more aggressive and systematic outreach to African American religious leaders and voters , ” and FRC is proud to have played in a major role in that outreach through the voter registration and education efforts of our Church Ministries division .
Tony admits his guilt .
But he is correct .
Opponents of Prop. 8 made a number of mistakes , and insufficient outreach to minority communities seems to be one of them .
But It ’s Really About Christian Persecution !
Now Tony cleverly brings his rant around to what is really bothering him :
Homosexual activists are also revealing their anti-religious bigotry , particularly in their attacks on Mormons , which have included calls to “ tax the Mormon church ” …
For somebody who is as much of a bigot as Tony Perkins , you ’d think he ’d be an expert on the subject .
Apparently not .
All of the anti-Mormon rhetoric of the last couple of weeks is due to the actions of the Mormon church .
The complaints are n’t that they ’re Mormon !
It ’s all about their behavior .
It ’s not bigotry when you express displeasure over somebody ’s actions .
The calls to “ tax the Mormon church ” are because it has proven itself to be a political body , and therefore not deserving of tax exemption .
… validating alarms FRC has raised about threats to religious liberty .
All this validates is Tony ’s homophobia .
If Tony were concerned about religious liberty , then he would n’t have supported a law that deprives churches of their right to marry same - sex couples .
Although a minority , there are many churches that do approve of and conduct gay marriage ceremonies .
This validates alarms that I have raised that the only religious freedom fundies care about is their own .
Those for same - sex “ marriage ” claim it is about same - sex couples having the same benefits as married couples .
“ No ” , Tony , “ it ’s ” about “ your ” right “ to ” use “ scare ” quotes “ anywhere ” you “ feel ” like “ it ” .
I have said for years that it is not about the benefits .
That ’s because Tony is afraid to hear about the benefits of homosexuality .
He might find them appealing .
Perhaps he ’d like to look at a brochure :
Tony ’s rant continues :
That was borne out in an FRC analysis showing that only 28 % of same - sex couples in Connecticut have sought civil unions and the related benefits in the three years they have been offered …
I ’m just guessing , but maybe that ’s because a civil union is n’t the same thing as marriage .
Or maybe there are other factors at play , such as fear of recording their relationship in public records in a conservative state like Connecticut , so fundies like Tony can target them .
And how does
Tony know how many gay couples there are in Connecticut ?
For all we know ,
Tony inflates the number to make it look like the percentage seeking benefits is lower .
There ’s really no way of knowing what is going on here , because any “ analysis ” that FRC does is hardly going to be a paragon of sociological research .
… and less than 20 % of the same - sex couples in California have “ married ” in the months since California ’s Supreme Court allowed them to .
Actually 20 % is a large number , considering that it has only been six months .
It takes time to plan a wedding .
These battles are not about “ rights ” or “ benefits , ” …
They ’re about scare quotes !
… but about the forced affirmation of homosexuality itself …
If by “ affirmation ” , he means the acceptance by society that that ’s just how some people are , and you ca n’t wish something away just because it makes you uncomfortable , then yes .
It is about forced affirmation .
… and the eventual silencing of all who disapprove .
We ’re not taking away Tony ’s right to disapprove .
There are still a few people out there who think emancipation was a bad idea , and they have every right to think that .
They even have the right to speak it .
Nobody is trying to silence anyone .
What we are trying to do is remove the power of people like Tony to use the government to enforce their outdated beliefs upon society .
One day , hopefully soon , people like Tony Perkins will be rare reminders of the hateful bigotries of our past .

Religious freedom , or just plain sick ?
The Mormons have a plan to convert every single one of you to Mormonism on your death .
Did your mom or dad , or child or friend die ?
The Mormons either have already , or will , baptize your dead family member or friend to convert them to Mormonism against your will , against their will .
The Mormons are n’t content forcing people of other faiths to live under their religious rules , they ’re stealing our dead too .
From AP :
Holocaust survivors said Monday they are through trying to negotiate with the Mormon church over posthumous baptisms of Jews killed in Nazi concentration camps , saying the church has repeatedly violated a 13 - year - old agreement barring the practice … .
” Baptism of a Jewish Holocaust victim and then merely removing that name from the database is just not acceptable , ” said Michel , whose parents died at Auschwitz .
He spoke on the 70th anniversary of Kristallnacht , the Nazi- incited riots against Jews .
” We ask you to respect us and our Judaism just as we respect your religion , ” Michel said in a statement released ahead of the news conference .
” We ask you to leave our six million Jews , all victims of the Holocaust , alone , they suffered enough . ”
…. Using genealogy records , the church also baptizes people who have died from all over the world and from different religions .
Mormons stand in as proxies for the person being baptized and immerse themselves in a baptismal pool .
Only the Jews have an agreement with the church limiting who can be baptized , though the agreement covers only Holocaust victims , not all Jewish people .
Jews are particularly offended by baptisms of Holocaust victims because they were murdered specifically because of their religion .

Excessive drinking by children and teenagers is storing up a time bomb of health problems , a charity has warned .
The British Liver Trust says it fears the amount children are drinking is rising , despite a slight dip in the numbers who are actually drinking .
This is putting them at risk of liver disease and liver cancer as they enter their 20s and 30s , the trust says .
The Department of Health said tackling harmful and binge drinking was a priority for the government .
The latest figures show 49 people in their 20s died in 2006 from alcohol - related liver failure - the highest number on record .
Jaundice
The figures , released by the Office of National Statistics , also showed 40 % more young people aged between 25 and 29 died from liver disease in 2006 than in the previous year .
Doctors and health campaigners fear these figures could rise over the coming years as children drink more .
Until recently , cirrhosis of the liver , a condition brought on by long - term alcohol abuse , mainly affected older men .
But now doctors are seeing it in men and women in their 20s brought on by excessive drinking .
The week that she passed away , she had liver disease , kidney failure , a hole in her stomach ... they told us there was nothing else they could do
Louise Rhymes , on her daughter Stacey Professor Ian Gilmore of the Royal College of Physicians said : " We are sadly seeing young people in their 20s coming in with jaundice , with swollen bellies because their liver wo n't process liquids .
" These people did n't make a conscious decision to kill themselves . "
Louise Rhymes , who lost her 24 - year - old daughter to long - term alcohol abuse earlier this year , said Stacey had been drinking heavily since her teens .
" By the time she was 18 , she was drinking every night , probably five litres .
She would drink until she 'd got none left .
" The week that she passed away , she had liver disease , kidney failure , a hole in her stomach where the alcohol had rotted her stomach .
They told us there was nothing else they could do . "
Imogen Shillito , the British Liver Trust 's director of information and education , said she was worried about the amounts children were drinking .
" The burden on their developing bodies is even greater , " she said .
" It means we are storing up a ticking time bomb for the future .
As they grow up in their 20s and 30s they could be putting themselves at risk of really serious liver disease and liver cancer .
" This is the progression of the epidemic we and the medical profession have been predicting for several years .
" We continue to ignore the signs of developing liver disease in younger and younger people and earlier deaths are now reality . "
She said the latest figures reinforced the charity 's call for urgent work to improve early diagnosis and encourage prevention and a national framework to support the NHS .
The Department of Health said it was working to implement a comprehensive strategy to tackle harmful and binge drinking .
" Among other things , the strategy commits £ 10 m for a new public information campaign , tougher enforcement for underage sales and more help for people who want to drink less , " said a spokesman .

A Christian family are concerned dark forces are behind a devilish looking car that has sat in front of their house for a month .
Julian Clarke , from Long Ditton , is concerned about a black Pontiac Trans
Am that has been anonymously parked in his road .
The sinister vehicle has blacked out windows , 666 on the number plate , devils on all four wheels and has been stationary for a month .
“ I go to church and I ’m quaking in my boots , ” said Mr Clarke .
“ The car is like the spawn of the devil , it could n’t look more evil if it tried .
The only way it could look worse would be if it had horns . ”
Mr Clarke said he did not take much notice at first but as Halloween approaches , his fears are growing .
“ I ’m beginning to think there is something dark and unexplained happening here .
We want it moved from outside our house , ” he said .
“ I also find it offensive .
Other people might not raise an eye but I find it offensive .
I do n’t know anything about the owner but I bet he does n’t want it in front of his house for those reasons . ”
Mr Clarke now plans to report the vehicle to the police , so the owner can be traced .
He said : “ The kids will be scared to knock on our doors to trick or treat .
I have a serious concern people will associate us with satanic worshipping .
“ The number plate is 666 , the number of the beast , and I ’m worried that Halloween is coming up and the Satan is at our feet . ”
A golden age of firefighting was upon us in February , 1931 , when Modern Mechanix magazine ran this article on Germany 's bizarre portable shower for firefigters :
IT 'S a far cry from the old bucket brigade to modern fire - fighting efficiency .
Even now the American fireman is known as a " smoke - eater , " but that term would hardly fit the present day fire laddie in Germany , for with the new portable sprinkler system adopted by some of the larger cities of that country a fireman may approach quite close to the flames without becoming singed .
The outfit , which looks like a deep sea diver 's uniform is equipped with a sprinkler helmet which operates off a connection attached to the nozzle of the hose .
The fireman can control the spray by a simple movement of a hand lever .
Britney Spears & Justin Timberlake Perform with Madonna Tonight in L.A .

The big treat for fans will be thatandwill not only make guest appearances on stage but are also going to get into the act .
There is speculation that Timberlake and Madge will do 4 Minutes , the lead song from her Hard Candy album .
Brit and the Material Girl collaborated on Me Against The Music , from Spears 2003 album In The Zone .
We do n't know if there will be any lip action but who can forget their MTV stage kiss during a performance of Like A Virgin .
Spears is actually featured in the background film footage that is played on the Jumbotron during every Sticky & Sweet performance .
Our friends at TMZ shared a little tidbit about tonight 's venue .
It seems they had a film crew on hand and observed the roof structure over the stage area listing to one side .
They were assured that it would be repaired in time for the Thursday night performance .

In 1939 , a group of Hungarian - born physicists  including Leo Szilard , Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner  persuaded Einstein to write President Roosevelt , bringing to his attention the possibility that recent scientific discoveries , by Lise Meitner and others still in Europe , could result in “ extremely powerful bombs of a new type . ”
Roosevelt was interested enough to meet several times with Einstein ’s emissaries ( Einstein , himself , spoke very little English ) who convinced FDR that if we did not develop such bombs before the Nazis did , they would “ blow us up . ”
Six months after FDR imposed a blockade on Japan  similar to the one The Best Congress AIPAC Can Buy wants Bush to impose on Iran  the Japanese attempted to destroy our blockade fleet in the Philippine and Hawaiian islands and elsewhere , and a few days after that , Adolph Hitler obliged FDR by declaring war on America .
Our Manhattan Project  to develop nuclear - fission weapons  was established in the summer of 1942 .
As it happens , the Nazi ’s effort to develop such a bomb ( which never got anything like the priority of the Manhattan Project ) was hampered by Hitler ’s view that it probably could not succeed , certainly not in time for use in his Operation Barbarossa , launched in September of 1941 , which he expected to win in a year or two , at most .
But the Soviet Union effectively won their Great Patriotic War against Hitler at Kursk , in the summer of 1943 .
And , by late1944 , most of the European émigré scientists  as a result of contacts with their former colleagues  had concluded that the German nuclear - fission weapons program had never got off the ground .
So , as soon as it became known within the Manhattan Project that the bomb would be used against the Japanese and not the Nazis , more than a few scientists left the project and some  notably instigator Leo Szilard  even began to oppose it , as a “ terrible mistake . ”
After the war , we conducted extensive tests of rapidly improving designs of fission weapons and documented the blast and thermal radiation effects of such weapons .
A terrible thing , indeed .
You might have thought that Israel , of all countries , would have been in the forefront of international efforts to prevent the proliferation of such weapons .
But , No !
Israel has refused even to become a signatory to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .
None of Israel ’s nuclear programs are subject to the Safeguards and Physical Security System of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Then , on June 7 , 1981 , the Israelis “ took out ” Osiraq , a small French - built research reactor , which was IAEA Safeguarded , apparently because the Israelis had concluded that Osiraq  rather than the Tooth Fairy  would miraculously leave a few nuclear weapons under Saddam Hussein ’s pillow .
According to an official Israeli statement ;
“ The atomic bombs which that reactor was capable of producing  whether from enriched uranium or from plutonium  would be of the Hiroshima size .
Thus a mortal danger to the people of Israel progressively arose . ”
Of course , Osiraq could never have produced , while IAEA - Safeguarded , weapons - grade plutonium and was not even capable of producing enriched uranium at all .
Furthermore , as the Security Council noted in UNSCR 487 , passed in the immediate aftermath of the Israeli attack , it was ;
“ Fully aware of the fact that Iraq has been a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons since it came into force in 1970 , that , in accordance with that treaty , Iraq has accepted IAEA safeguards on all its nuclear activities , and that the agency has testified that these safeguards have been satisfactorily applied to date ; ”
In 1981 we and the rest of the world “ strongly ” condemned the Israeli attack on IAEA Safeguarded facilities .
Then , in 1986 , with the publication in The Sunday Times of the documentation ( including photographs ) provided them by the defector Mordecai Vanunu of Israel ’s underground “ Machon 2 ” facility , which produced plutonium , lithium deuteride and beryllium , we learned that Israel already had a stockpile of very sophisticated nuclear weapons at the time of the Osiraq attack .
And , now , here we are , perhaps on the eve of the Israelis attempting to “ take out ”  with the almost explicit support of Bush - Cheney and The Best Congress AIPAC Can Buy  all the IAEA Safeguarded facilities in Iran .
And no “ options ”  including the use of nuclear weapons  are “ off the table ” !
A “ senior defense official ” told ABC News this summer that there is an “ increasing likelihood ” that Israel , itself , will carry out such an attack before Bush - Cheney leave office and identified two “ red lines , ” which the Israelis will not “ allow ” the Iranians to cross .
The first , when in the estimation of the Israelis , Iran ’s uranium - enrichment facility at Natanz has produced enough weapons - grade uranium to make a nuclear weapon .
The Israelis  notwithstanding the fact that no highly - enriched uranium , much less weapons - grade enriched uranium , could be or would be allowed to be produced at any IAEA - safeguarded facility  believe that is likely to happen sometime in 2009 , and could happen by the end of this year .
The second red line would be Iran achieving operational readiness of the SA - 20 air defense system it is buying from Russia to protect its IAEA - Safeguarded facilities .
Quoth “ senior defense official ” ;
“ The red line is not when they get to that point , but before they get to that point . ”
Everyone , most especially the Israelis , realize they can not “ take out ” all the IAEA Safeguarded facilities in Iran with conventional weapons .
But they could make a start , and then come to us with this threat  “ either you finish the job for us , or we will , with nukes ” .
Well , we know that Bush - Cheney would do .
As far as they ’re concerned , either Iran “ voluntarily ” gives up its alienable rights  affirmed under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to enrich uranium for use in peaceful applications , or Bush - Cheney will force them to .
And “ no option is off the table , ” including our use of nuclear weapons .
But suppose the Israelis do n’t act until after Obama becomes President ?
Obama reportedly told the House Democratic Caucus last week that “ Nobody said this to me , directly , but I get the feeling from my talks [ with Israeli leaders ] that if the sanctions do n’t work , Israel is going to strike Iran ” .
Well , the sanctions are not going “ to work . ”
Just last week 115 members of the Non-Aligned Movement issued a strongly worded declaration , expressing support for Iran ’s insistence upon pursuing “ without discrimination ” its “ inalienable rights ”  affirmed under the NPT  and deploring the misuse [ by Bush - Cheney - Rice - Bolton ] of the IAEA for political purposes and the involvement of the UN Security Council in matters not its concern under the UN Charter .
So , suppose President Obama refuses to “ finish ” the job the Israelis have started .
What then ?
A Persian holocaust ?

Best foot forward Jon Kelly NEW YORK , NEW YORK :
The young members of the Dance Theater of Harlem ( DTH ) were putting me to shame .
I watched bewildered as the largely African - American troupe stretched , spun and contorted with impossible suppleness .
I marvelled at their athleticism , their poise , their strength .
Then I looked down at my paunch , acquired during six weeks sat immobile on the bus eating burgers , and regretted slightly less that my journey would end the next day .
Harlem might be best famous for its basketball , soul food and jazz - and , of course , as one of the focal points of US black culture .
This was where Duke Ellington played and Billie Holliday sang , where Malcolm X preached and W E B DuBois agitated .
Although the area 's reputation nosedived in the 1970s and 1980s amid soaring crime and crippling poverty , recent years have seen the area begin to undergo some measure of gentrification - a development that has n't met with universal approval .
With the DTH on its doorstep , Harlem could also legitimately call itself a ballet capital , too .
The theatre operates a world - renowned touring ensemble as well as its own school , which teaches more than 1,000 pupils each year .
I wondered how such a troupe would fit to an inner-city neighbourhood .
During a break in rehearsals one of the dancers , 25 - year - old Brandon Perry - Russell , quietly explained as he wiped the sweat from his brow .
This was no oasis of gentility in urban New York .
The DTH had roots deep in the community .
The students were far from privileged : some 70 % were here on grants or scholarships .
" We reach out to kids , and they realise pretty quickly that it is n't sissy , " he said .
" You 've got to be physically tough to do this , you 've got to be athletic .
Plus , the little boys get to an age where they want to hang out with the little girls .
" Dancing is valued in Harlem , and we fit into that . "
Like the rest of Harlem , he said , the troupe was changing : he danced alongside white , Hispanic and Asian performers .
In the streets outside , the vibrant cultural scene was drawing people of all races and backgrounds to the area .
All the same , though , I 'd noticed the Obama posters and flags that seemed to adorn every window .
I asked Brendon what it meant in such a strongly African - American area that a man of colour stood , for the first time ever , within reach of the country 's top job .
There was no doubt that people were inspired and energised .
But was n't so much the fact that Obama was black that excited them , Brendon said .
It was because victory for the Democratic candidate would signal that there were no barriers to opportunity .
" If he 's elected , it sends out the message that even if you come from a single parent family , if you 've been raised on food stamps , you can still become president .
Or a teacher .
Or a ballet dancer . "
For Keith Saunders , however , the significance of Obama 's ethnicity could n't be overstated .
As he took a pause from leading a dance class , Keith , 55 , told me that he'd first joined the DTH in 1975 .
Back then , Harlem was a very different place : hardship and racism were ever - present .
" I think if you 'd asked most African - American people even two or three years ago whether they 'd see a black president of the USA , the answer would have been no , " he said .
" It 's wonderful to witness a moment in history like this .
I feel truly privileged . "
Just as Senator Obama 's successes so far have plotted a new template for black leadership , Harlem , too , has become upwardly mobile in recent years .
As the crime rate was brought down , young professionals began to move in , attracted by the handsome brownstone apartments and the relatively cheap property prices .
On my way here I 'd seen the upmarket delis and the renovated buildings that signposted pockets of gentrification .
But another young dancer , Ashley Murphy , 23 , told me that the changes had n't been good for everyone in the community .
" They 're building a lot of condominiums , refurbishing the apartments , but that 's making it more expensive , " she added .
" Although it 's improving , some people have had to leave because they can't afford the rent . "
But a more ominous danger was threatening the area : the credit crunch .
A project like the DTH was dependent on philanthropy ; much of its funding had come from donations provided by the collapsed Washington Mutual and the troubled AIG .
Lavine Niadu , the theater 's executive director , admitted he feared that up to a third of the $ 300,000 it received each year from corporate sponsors was under threat .
There was already a waiting list for places at the school , he said , and it was likely to rocket if funding were cut further .
I looked out at all these talented young people , utterly composed and focused as they moved into first position .
I wondered what each had sacrificed to be here .
This was what America was supposed to be all about , was n't it ?
It seemed a bitter irony that at a time when their political hopes looked close to realisation , the dancers ' own aspirations and ambitions were at risk of being snatched away .

Material girls Jon Kelly NEW YORK , NY : Sarah - Jessica Parker has a lot to answer for .
In the imaginations of most of my female acquaintances , Manhattan is a sort of metropolitan Shangri - La where empowered , glamorous ladies spend eternal lunches discussing footwear and their endless stream of male admirers .
I feared I was n't going to be able to do this place justice .
I 'm not quite conversant with the latest stiletto fashions .
Where I grew up , a romantic dinner a deux meant stopping by the chip shop on the way back from the pub .
Luckily , I had an offer of help from on high - thirty stories high , to be precise , with stunning views across the island .
Jill Zarin , 44 , invited me to the luxurious downtown apartment she shared with her husband Bobby , a home furnishings magnate .
She introduced me to her friend , 37 - year - old Bethenny Frankel - a socialite , businesswoman and writer who was a regular fixture on New York 's dating scene .
The pair had already been the subject of a reality TV show .
Jill spent her days organising glamorous , $ 2,500 - a- head charity fundraising events .
Bethenny , essentially , saw herself as Carrie Bradshaw made flesh .
This all seemed a bit unreal .
On my trip across the US , I 'd met a lot of people on low incomes who were struggling as the economy worsened .
Now , I had a chance to find out how those at the other end of the social hierarchy were faring .
Regular readers will know that I 've been endeavouring to avoid easy archetypes in this blog .
But really , Bethany made it difficult for me .
" My life is Sex and the City , " she purred .
I heard how she made a point of only going out with good - looking men .
Less attractive specimens generally had something to prove from their High School days , she added , when they would n't have been able to snare girls as pretty as her .
For some reason , her friends had suggested that guys might find her intimidating .
The credit crunch had n't affected Bethenny 's natural food business , she said , but the economics of dating had been transformed .
Although she insisted that she was n't an expensive dining companion ( " I only order appetisers , in general " ) , she had noticed a heightened sense of anxiety among suitors who told her they were investment bankers or hedge fund managers .
Bethenny did n't care too much about what these men actually did all day .
" I 'm like , show me the bank statement , " she drawled .
" But they 're saying , ' This is the great depression again . ' "
Against this backdrop , Bethenny felt was only good manners to reign in her shopping .
The other day , she 'd looked on with distaste in one downtown store as her fellow Manhattanites carried on burning up their credit cards as much as ever .
" I find it a bit vulgar to be spending $ 2,000 on a handbag at this time , " she sniffed .
Jill agreed .
" We have n't felt the pain that the country is feeling , " she admitted .
" But we can see it . "
It was time to pass on the same message that I 'd delivered to traders on Wall Street : that many ordinary Americans blamed wealthy New Yorkers for the nation 's economic woes .
Jill disagreed .
The problem , she said , had been a country - wide lack of personal responsibility : borrowers taking on heftier mortgages than they could afford .
" If you spend more than you make , it 's a problem .
I 've always lived that principle .
I 've always saved . "
Both were voting for Barack Obama .
Jill , who was strongly pro-choice , wanted justices who would uphold Roe v Wade appointed to the Supreme Court .
Bethenny believed that " Sarah Palin was the most moronic choice on earth " to be John McCain 's vice - presidential nominee .
I 'm sure that Senator Obama will be glad of their votes .
But there was something incongruous about the fact that the Democrats - supposedly the party of social justice and redistribution - were guaranteed votes here , but met with ambivalence back in West Virginia .

Talked out Jon Kelly LONG ISLAND , NEW YORK : Annoyingly , I could n't find any plumbers called Joe hanging around outside Hofstra University , the setting for 2008 's final presidential debate .
I did , however , talk to voters who felt that the duel had , for once , risen to the occasion .
I 'd been disappointed by the two previous encounters between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama .
In Oxford , I felt they had done little more than restate well - established positions ; Nashville was , for me at least , a bit of a wash - out .
It was n't always easy to gauge from the partisan crowds of Republicans and Democrats ( mostly Democrats , this being New York State ) crowding the bars around the campus .
But in between the whoops and the chants that punctuated each point , it sounded the candidates were , for the first time , being encouraged by the moderator to engage with each other 's positions - on education , health care , abortion - rather that just recite their well - rehearsed scripts .
I also thoroughly enjoyed the mudslinging over who had slung the most mud , a timely riposte to the old adage that Americans do n't do irony .
But who cared what I thought ?
I do n't even get to vote here .
So I kept my opinions to myself and quickly canvassed spectators ' reactions .
Noy Sayouthnasad , at least , was in a cheerful post - debate mood .
A McCain supporter , the 32 - year - old research administrator been left disappointed by the previous encounters ; until tonight , she 'd felt that her man had n't been aggressive enough , had n't hit Obama sufficiently hard over Bill Ayres and Pastor Wright .
But now she sounded buoyant .
Her man had done enough , she hoped , to revive his lagging fortunes in the polls .
" It was just what I was hoping for , " she grinned .
" He was more charismatic , he attacked Obama about his associations and his record .
" Before , I felt he needed to be tougher .
Now , I 'm hoping that he 'll only be maybe two or three points behind in the next polls .
" Oh , I liked Joe the Plumber too , " she added .
" It was a good way of connecting with people , of showing that he 's the guy to connect with their problems . "
Chris Carr , 30 , rolled his eyes when I mentioned McCain 's recurring motif .
The website creative director was biased , he acknowledged , having already made up his mind to vote for Obama .
But all the references by the Republican nominee to this one tradesman had , Chris felt , sounded clichéd and patronising .
" To be honest with you , I expect Obama will increase his lead after tonight , " Chris said .
" McCain sounded angry to me : he kept personalising the arguments .
But Obama came across as presidential , going into detail on his policies . "
With polling day getting closer , and the partisan atmosphere growing increasingly fierce , I wondered if there were any more undecided voters left in America .
I came across one , anyway - Pat Montagano , 48 , from Queens .
In between working as an administrator at the University , she 'd been weighing up how to cast her ballot .
Tonight 's debate had n't helped her much .
" When they were asked about their Vice Presidential nominees , I thought Obama did much better , " she said .
" But I liked what McCain was saying on education .
I do n't know , " she shrugged , " I will vote .
I 'll make up my mind before 4 November . "
She wo n't have any more debates to help her with this , however .
Somehow , I think both she and American democracy will cope .

Wall Street blues Jon Kelly NEW YORK , NY : Here I was at last : Wall Street .
So often in the past few weeks , since the $ 700 bn bail - out , I 'd heard that address spat out rather than spoken .
Now I could see the focus of so many Americans ' fury for myself .
It was narrower than I expected , less prepossessing .
Then I noticed the glittering window displays of Tiffany 's and the ostentatious frontage of Trump Building : conspicuous wealth was n't quite so well - concealed after all .
As brusque , anxious - looking young men in suits bustled past me , I thought back to all the working people I 'd encountered who had referred to America 's financial institutions with fear , contempt and anger .
Well , here was my chance to pass on what they 'd told me .
Sitting outside the Stock Exchange , rubbing the bridge of his nose , was 48 - year - old floor trader Steven Schimble .
He was n't having a good day : shares were dropping and forecasts were grim .
I introduced myself , explained what I was doing here .
I 'd been travelling across the US for the past month , I told him , and the ordinary Americans I 'd spoken to were really angry .
Angry about foreclosures , angry that the economy looked as if it was nosediving , angry that they'd had to bail out the companies they held responsible .
Steven was no Gordon Gekko : affable , pugnacious , speaking with a grainy New York twang .
He threw up his hands - of course everyone thought it was all his fault .
" I just saw a guy in the street throw something at one of the traders , " he said .
" Everyone blames Wall Street because they know the address .
" But down on the floor , we were executing orders to the best of our ability .
It was all down to the big banks : blame Lehmann Brothers , blame JP Morgan , blame Bear Stearns . "
This would n't be enough to placate people , I said .
Those who had seen their investments wiped out , and were then asked to come to the rescue with their tax dollars , surely had a right to be upset .
" Right , " he nodded .
" But investing in stocks is like gambling in a casino .
It 's legalised gambling .
We need to make people aware of that . "
He called over his friend and fellow trader , 45 - year - old Billy McInerney .
Billy needed a break , too : he 'd already seen the exchange fall by 300 points since the morning .
I ran through everything I 'd told Steven : people out there were livid at the whole financial system .
Billy looked skywards .
" It all comes down to mortgages .
Giving people who make $ 50,000 loans for $ 200,000 houses : I would n't sign up for those terms , and I make five times as much . "
He could understand , though , why people felt such a strong sense of injustice .
" Look , I do n't like it either , " he sighed .
" But we need to do this .
If we do n't , then we go into recession and more people lose their jobs . "
I had to give them credit for answering the charges against them .
Faced with an entire nation 's hostility , I might have preferred to keep a low profile .
But essentially their message was : it was someone else 's fault .
Not everyone on Wall Street was a banker or a broker , however .
At the junction with Broadway , 49 - year - old Asif Khan was packing away his fruit stall .
Business was terrible , he told me .
Sales were down by 50 % - even the traders were spending less .
" The only thing I 'm selling more of is bananas , because you can get three for $ 1 , " he grimaced .
The slowdown was hurting Asif , who had moved to New York from Pakistan in 1985 .
He had a wife and a 12 - year - old daughter over in Queens to support .
I wondered if he blamed his customers for the downturn .
He shook his head .
" No , it 's not them I blame .
It was the White House - they should have put proper regulation in place .
" The only people they cared about were the billionaires , not the middle class - that 's what got us into trouble . "
At last , a charitable view of the banks and the Stock Market .
Asif 's opinion that politicians were ultimately responsible will be widely shared .
But I do n't think the rest of the country is ready to forgive Wall Street just yet .

Anger management Jon Kelly LEBANON , PENNSYLVANIA : A quick fuel stop en route to New York .
There were n't any opportunities to chat to anyone , but I grabbed a copy of the local paper to scan on the bus .
Today 's Lebanon Daily
News did n't carry much on the campaigns , save for an item about Joe Biden stumping in his native Scranton with the Clintons in tow .
But the letters page was a different story .
It looked like my hopes in Gettysburg that the election might take a calmer tone were n't being realised .
" I wonder how many American can support for president a man who has listened for 20 years to the sermons of an America - hating preacher , " fumed Kathy Horst of South Annville .
C. Robert Rose of Lebanon , meanwhile , raged against " conservatives who constantly use Jesus and religion " to drum up support , insisting that " such pandering results in greed , fear , criminal transgressions and ethical collapse " .
At least Karl Kohr , of the same parish , had an even - handed message .
The idleness of politicians from both parties was , he said , to blame for the current economic mess .
" Vote them out in November , " he thundered .
There 's a lot of anger out there .
It 's not going away between now and 4 November .

Band of brothers Jon Kelly GETTYSBURG , PENNSYLVANIA :
When Michael Cobb retuned from the Vietnam war in 1968 , he had trouble following orders .
After witnessing carnage all around him and losing his closest comrades , it was near - impossible for Michael to take instructions from civilians who just did n't understand .
Back home in the US , he 'd flitted from job to job .
He recognised that his post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) made him a difficult character with which to live .
" As a veteran , your life has been threatened so many times , " Michael told me .
" To come back and have some guy in an office tell you what to do ... "
He paused .
" You think : how dare they .
How dare they .
But you can't operate like that .
" I take anti-depressants all the time .
I wake up in a cold sweat thinking I 've killed someone .
" The only people who understand are other veterans .
That 's why we 're all like brothers . "
Michael , 61 , had found that sense of fraternity in Rolling Thunder , a pressure group of which he was national chairman .
Dedicated to supporting and lobbying on behalf of veterans and prisoners of war , it has specialised in mobilising mass protests led by motorbike - riding ex-military personnel .
Artie Muller , 63 , another Rolling Thunder officer and Vietnam vet , shot me an inscrutable look from behind his dark glasses .
" We 're not a motorcycle club , " he intoned .
" When 500,000 of us show up for a demonstration in Washington , there are n't any clowns or sideshows . "
Both Michael and Artie had come through from New Jersey to see their friend John Molloy , who headed up the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Coalition .
They felt that veterans had been ignored by Washington .
Michael said he 'd spent 23 years fighting the system to claim the benefits he was due before the authorities relented .
All three were scathing about politicians who , they felt , were only out for themselves .
You might have expected that they'd be enthusiastic backers of John McCain , the Republican presidential candidate and former prisoner of war in the Hanoi Hilton .
They were all voting for him , but reluctantly .
They had disagreed with his efforts to normalise relations with Vietnam while US personnel who had been reported missing in action remained unaccounted for .
" I 've got mixed feelings about Senator McCain , " Michael said .
" But we can't have Obama running the country .
He does n't have the experience . "
I asked them how they felt about the issues surrounding the election .
John , 62 , had studied hard after leaving the military and become an investment banker .
But it angered him , he said , that Wall Street had been given a $ 700 m bail - out while ex-service men and women had to struggle to get their dues .
" If it was n't for the veterans , people would n't be free to make money in the first place , " he said .
I wanted to know how they felt about Afghanistan and Iraq .
John spoke for all of them : he 'd worked in the World Trade Center before 9/11 , and had lost friends in the attacks .
This had convinced him firmly the conflicts were justified .
" You can talk about coming back with PTSD from Vietnam - well , it comes after watching people jump out of those towers , too , " he added .
The others nodded in agreement .
At a time when the outgoing president 's popularity had fallen to an all - time low , they remained staunch supporter of George Bush .
He had been rare among politicians , Michael said : Bush had listened to them on veterans and POW issues , spoken to them after demonstrations .
" We gave him one of these vests we 're wearing , " chuckled Artie , pointing at his leather waistcoat .
" He could n't wait to put it on .
" He does n't care about being popular , he just wants to do the right thing . "
I asked if I could take their photograph .
They instinctively wrapped their arms around each other 's shoulders .
Theirs was a bond forged by a common experience .
A bond that someone like I , never having witnessed the same hardships and traumas , should n't pretend to understand .

Battle hymn Jon Kelly GETTYSBURG , PENNSYLVANIA : " Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation , conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal .
" Now we are engaged in a great civil war , testing whether that nation , or any nation so conceived and so dedicated , can long endure ... " I shivered .
Before me , the early morning mist clung to the ground like ghosts .
Here , in July 1863 , these gently rolling fields witnessed the bloodiest battle in the conflict between the Union and the Confederacy .
There were over 50,000 casualties on this site .
Some five months later , Abraham Lincoln came here to deliver his famous Gettysburg Address - one of the most celebrated speeches in American history .
In it , he vowed in the name of the fallen to forge a nation based on freedom and equality .
As his words echoed around me , I thought about how far this country had come in such a short space of time - first the abolition of slavery , then women 's emancipation in 1919 , followed by the civil rights reforms of the 1960s , and now the landmark of an African - American man competing seriously for the presidency .
But I could n't escape , either , the very modern civil war that was being fought across the US right now .
Over the weekend , the election had grown increasingly bad - tempered .
John McCain had been booed by his own supporters at a rally when he called on them to show respect towards Barack Obama ; members of the crowd had shouted that his rival was a " traitor " and a " terrorist " .
Meanwhile , an Obama supporter drew a parallel between the Republican candidate and segregationist former Alabama Governor George Wallace .
This did n't sound to me like the kind of democracy for which Lincoln struggled .
As the haze started to lift , I met two teenagers on the battlefield site - 19 - year - old Madeleine Birkner , and Paolo Ciocco , 17 .
They recited the address for me .
Growing up in Gettysburg , Madeleine told me , you were taught to learn the speech by heart .
They 'd been raised to value the high - minded ideals of the Republic .
I wondered what they made of the low turn the election had taken .
" I think it 's horrible , " Madeleine said .
" There 's all this underlying tension coming to the fore .
" I think we 're seeing the ugly side coming out in this election . "
Paolo nodded .
" The tone of the campaign really detracts from the way our ideas as a country were conceived , " he agreed .
" When I look at the Gettysburg Address , I think it 's still relevant today . "
Still , I took some comfort from the location in which we were standing .
At least all the political warfare and bloodshed that the rolling news channels had been describing was only metaphorical .
Madeleine 's father , Dr Michael Birkner , was also enjoying the morning air .
He was a historian who understood the context of today 's arguments better than most .
When I asked Michael about the heightened level of animosity , he instructed me to look past the monuments and picture the scene here in 1863 as the battle raged .
" It would have been one long tableau of death and suffering , " he said .
Enough to put today 's inflamed passions in perspective .
" This is just the way a popular democracy operates .
It 's October .
Soon we 'll all be able to move on . "
I hoped he was right .
The mist had cleared .
I turned around and walked away from the battlefield .

Fast food nation Jon Kelly AKRON , OH : Is there a symbol any more American than the hamburger ?
I do n't think cowboys , the Statue of Liberty or even the Stars and Stripes come close .
If you 're looking for an icon of gung - ho enterprise and king - sized consumer demand , stick a disc of beef between two buns and smother it with relish .
I do n't want to sound like I 'm down on burgers .
Quite the opposite ; I 've been enjoying US cuisine all too much during my travels across the country .
It 's easy to pontificate about obesity and diet , but it 's even simpler to succumb to fatty , salty , high - cholesterol temptation .
Whenever foreigners want to vent their displeasure at the American Way , they tend to take it out on burger chains - whether it 's French farmer - activist José Bové wrecking the site of a planned McDonalds , or Morgan Spurlock 's Super Size Me being feted internationally .
But however much it complains about US fast food , it seems the rest of the world can't get enough .
Profits generated in Europe alone are worth $ 1.2bn ( £ 600 m ) to the Golden Arches .
If anything encapsulates the contradictory nature of so much anti-American sentiment , it must be the hamburger , too .
Well , I 've been here long enough now to realise that there 's more to this country than any stereotype could ever suggest .
But what did Americans themselves think of the way they were perceived abroad ?
To find out , I visited Menches Brothers restaurant in Akron .
Owner John Menches has long insisted that his great - grandfather , Charles , co-invented the hamburger in 1885 - though the claim has been disputed .
I 'd arranged to meet a group of five teenagers from the city 's PeaceMakers programme - a community group aimed at keeping young people away from crime .
They were smart , engaged kids who were all interested in the views of people from beyond their borders .
Each one quickly dispelled any suggestion that Americans would n't be interested in the rest of the world .
Ariel Davis , 17 , ordered a chicken burger .
She did n't have a problem with fast food , she said .
But she thought it was a shame that it was used to symbolise her country .
" It makes it seem like we all just want to have fun , " she added .
" But we 're not just about having fun . "
There were , she 'd noticed , three recurring themes the overseas media would employ to characterise America .
" One is the hamburger , the second is that we 're the land of opportunity , and the third is the war , " she said .
" I 'd like it to be not so much about hamburgers , not so much the war .
We 're a bunch of people who want peace . "
Her friend , 16 - year - old Dominique Council , agreed that the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan had distorted many foreigners ' views of the US .
Her family had hosted a Spanish exchange student who , Dominique noted sadly , had written off the nation before she even arrived .
" She was really upset about the war , " Dominique remembered .
" She thought everyone agreed with the president .
" She could n't see that people here might believe the war is wrong , but they still respect the troops . "
Cory Jarvis , 15 , saw the role of the American military differently .
He said he was frustrated that attempts to spread democracy had been misinterpreted as bids to grab power .
" They think we 're a bunch of violent people , " Cory added .
" But we 're over there to help them . "
For Dao Letdara , the view from the outside was closest to home .
The 15 - year - old 's parents had moved here as teenagers from war - torn Laos .
The steady stream of incomers was testament , she said , to the fact that America was seen as a place rich in possibilities .
" The immigrants are coming here because they want a better job , they want a better life - obviously , they believe they can get all that here , " Dao added .
But she worried that the American media was tarnishing this impression .
" I think they 're getting their images from music and movies - all the R - rated movies with killing and violence , " she frowned .
Travis Carlton , 16 , disagreed .
To him , the image that America projected of itself was one of wealth and prosperity - far removed from the reality of life in a place like Akron .
" People do n't see cities for what they are , " he argued .
" They do n't know that there are people living like they would in Africa .
" I 'd like America to be what it 's portrayed as : the land of the free .
I want it to live up to the name . "
I thanked them all .
As an outsider trying to understand this country , it had been instructive - and encouraging , too , given that they all seemed to really care what the world though of them But it was time for me to let them enjoy their lunch .

Finger pickin ' good Jon Kelly
My colleague Steve Evans has just alerted me to a rather amazing story .
Back in Nashville he met Eddie Alcock , one of the pillars of bluegrass music , whose career looked threatened when he developed a tremor in his banjo - plucking hand .
Surgeons at Nashville 's Vanderbilt Medical Center told Eddie they could help him .
But they needed his musical assistance .
The doctors hoped to halt the shaking through a process called deep brain stimulation - sending an electrical charge to his brain via wires pushed through a hole in Eddie 's skull .
But the only way they could tell when they had hit the ' sweet spot ' was to ask Eddie himself .
So before he was put under local anaesthetic , he took his banjo into the operating theatre .
As the surgeons adjusted the electrodes , a fully - conscious Eddie began picking at his banjo strings .
As the current moved closer , his playing improved .
It was , according to Peter Hedera , one of the medical team , ' the ultimate Nashville experience ' .
It was left to Eddie to judge when the stimulation was working .
As Dr Hedera told Steve : " My ear is not that great , so it was his assessment " .

A month later , he illustrated the effect for Steve by playing - clumsily and barely discernibly - with the device turned off .
Then he put a remote control to his chest and turned the current on , and his playing suddenly improved - not quite as fluent as it had been , due to lack of practice , but getting there .
' My life has re-entered my body , " Eddie said .
" I felt like I was dead when I felt like I could n't play any more ' .
Eddie had played with bluegrass legend Bill Monroe before setting up his own bands .
Martha , his wife and musical partner , told Steve what a huge difference the surgeons had made .
' You can imagine that it was just a gift to us , " she said .
" One does what one must do .
If there 's a mountain to climb , one climbs it or goes around the side or tunnels through .
I would do it for him and he does it for me .
We 're partners in life . '

Road rage Jon Kelly AKRON , OH : Rows of shiny , all - American automobiles glimmered in the sun .
I marvelled as their owners diligently polished all these lovingly - preserved Chevys , Fords and Plymouths .
They 'd picked a glorious October morning for this classic car fair .
But I could n't help thinking there was something poignant about celebrating America 's industrial past here , right in the heart of the rust belt .
Now , I 'm no petrolhead .
It took me three attempts to pass my driving test .
I could n't tell you the difference between a crankshaft and a fender .
But even I could appreciate that these were beautiful vehicles - all gleaming chrome and rolling contours .
Back when most of them were built , Akron was known as the rubber capital of the world .
The bulk America 's tyres were manufactured here by firms like Goodyear and Firestone , and the city 's blue - collar workers enjoyed a boomtime of high wages and steady employment .
But by the 1980s , production had started shifting elsewhere .
The city experienced the same hardships of post - industrial decline as other Midwest cities like Detroit and Cleveland - soaring unemployment , rising crime , urban decay .
Akron 's chamber of commerce can boast , with some justification , that the city has since bounced back by diversifying its economy .
But the empty warehouses I passed on the outskirts were testament to the hardships local people have experienced .
It would be easy to feel forgotten in a place like this , but winning the support of Akron will be absolutely crucial to America 's presidential candidates .
Ohio is , of course , a vital state , credited with securing George Bush 's presidency in 2004 .
And although Akron itself has traditionally been a Democratic stronghold , Barack Obama may have to work harder than usual to win over its voters .
Hillary Clinton trounced him in the state primary back in March , and questions have been raised about whether he can keep her white , working - class supporters onside .
Hence my decision to visit the car show .
I knew I 'd find some Hillary fans here , and I wanted to ask whether they would stay loyal to the Democrats come November .
Sure enough , I got talking to Pam Mazzola , 54 , as she waxed her 1970 Plymouth Hemi Barracuda .
Pam and her husband Joe had bought the automobile 35 years ago before driving off to get married .
Now , however , she was nervous ; on the verge of retirement , she wondered what the chaos on Wall Street would mean for a place like Akron .
Pam had enthusiastically backed Hillary in the primaries - both out of admiraton for the New York senator 's common touch , and respect for her husband 's achievements as president .
She had no hesitation , however , in backing Obama for president .
" I like Hillary a lot , " Pam said .
" She understands what things are like for people round here .
" But we need change .
I think McCain is too close to Bush .
I do n't agree with his policies .
I 'm going for Obama . "
Sitting in front of a 1920s Ford Roadster , however , was 72 - year - old retired engineer Ed Bogovich .
He 'd come through from Pennsylvania - another blue - collar swing state - to attend the show .
Ed had backed Hillary , too .
But there was no way he would support Obama ; no way he would support any black man for the presidency .
" I do n't want him to be my leader , " Ed barked .
" I am a staunch Democrat , but I will not vote for a negro .
" If his grandfather is a Muslim , would n't be one too ? "
It was shocking to listen to all this .
But it was no use correcting Ed that Senator Obama was , in fact , a Christian .
" Come on , do n't tell me that , " he replied .
" It 's in his heritage . " I shook my head as I walked away .
I 've met enough Americans these past few weeks to know that views like his are in the minority .
I 'm sure most former Democrats who 've gone over to McCain reject them , too .
But it was depressing , all the same .
I remembered what I 'd been told earlier by Akron 's mayor , Don Plusquellic .
He had also backed Hillary in March , but was now voting for Obama .
Jennifer spoke to him too :

He told me that race was no longer an issue for the majority of his compatriots , Republican and Democrat alike .
" There are always going to be people who have a problem , " he frowned .
" But most of us - we 've got over that . "
Mayor Plusquellic said he was confident that most Democrats in Ohio would vote the same way as him .
There was genuine anger here at the Republican White House , he added .
November will tell us if he was right .
But whoever wins , I 'm sure most Americans will hope attitudes like Ed's belong to a dying era .

Surface tension Jon Kelly MADISON , WV : Driving along West Virginia 's roads , you would n't have noticed anything was out of place .
Bright woodland and foliage rose up on either side of the traffic ; the ramshackle trailer homes notwithstanding , it looked as close to a rural idyll as anywhere I 'd seen in America .
Once I climbed up into the hills , however , it was a very different story .
From up here , out of view from the freeway , it was all too clear that thousands of acres of Appalachia 's most spectacular mountain ranges had been reduced to rubble .
Blame King Coal for decapitating the landscape .
Mining has always been a major industry here , but traditionally it took place out of sight , below ground .
Now , however , a modern technique known as mountaintop removal has dramatically reshaped West Virginia .
It is , literally , a scorched - earth process .
First the hill is stripped of all its trees .
Then explosives are brought in to blast through the rocks .
The rubble is taken away and dumped in nearby valleys .
Diggers can then gouge coal from the exposed surface .
I stood on ground that had already been emptied of its black gold .
Grass was growing where the excavation had taken place , but the surface 's harsh , angular contours made it clear what had occurred .
According to some estimates , mountaintop removal has been responsible for the destruction of as much as 150,000 hectares of forest , and 2,000 km of valley streams have been affected by waste .
All this posed a dilemma for West Virginians .
All around them their heritage was being despoiled .
But here , in the second - poorest state in the union , any prospect of skilled employment was desperately needed .
I stopped in Madison , a decaying town which had seen better days .
There I met Carolyn Kuhn , 58 , at the Coal Heritage Mining Museum , where she was working as a volunteer .
The industry had been crucial to every aspect of Carolyn's life ; her husband , Rodney , had worked underground for 35 years , and the pit had been the focal point of the community .
She showed me round artefacts of coalfield life : pith helmets and shovels , pick - axes and union banners .
At the back of the building was a darkened corridor designed to resemble a tunnel .
I fumbled way through , conscious that this sanitised visitor attraction could n't do justice to the hard reality of working at the coalface .
To someone like Carolyn , mining had always been something that went on deep below the surface of the earth .
I asked her what she thought about this new wave of excavations going on in the mountains above her .
" I know it 's a shame what they 're doing to the landscape , " she said .
" But I 'm selfish .
I want my grandkids to stay here .
" Several years ago , I thought our town was folding .
It was all second hand shops and thrift stores . "
But not everyone who was steeped in these traditions wanted to preserve coal jobs at all costs .
Julian Martin , 72 , was an eight - generation West Virginian .
His father had lost an eye working underground ; his grandfather had taken part in the Battle of Blair Mountain in 1921 , when striking miners took part in America 's largest insurrection since the civil war .
He wanted to keep the pits open .
But Julian was passionately opposed to mountaintop excavations , horrified at the prospect of this landscape being permanently disfigured .
He also disputed the idea any economic benefits would trickle down to miners and their families .
" In my father 's day , there were 125,000 mining jobs in West Virginia , " he said .
" Now there are only 17,000 .
" There 's no way they 'll ever repair the damage they 've done to the environment .
This habitat took thousands of years to grow . "
I did n't envy Julian and Carolyn for the dilemma they confronted .
As the economic climate worsens , however , I suspect that those who love West Virginia 's scenery will face tougher choices yet .

Take me home , country roads Jon Kelly CHARLESTON , WV : I picked the right time to come to West Virginia .
With autumn well underway , the leafy hillsides were exploding with reds , browns and yellows .
It reminded me so much of Scotland - my parents ' native Perthshire in particular - that I felt a sudden , oddly reassuring , lurch of homesickness .
The Mountain State might have looked beautiful , but I 'd heard what a tough place it could be in which to live .
Poverty here has long been well above the national average , and median incomes well below .
The scarred landscape bore testament to the legacy of coal mining which has provided hard and dangerous employment to generations .
You'd think blue - collar terrain like this would be happy hunting ground for a Democratic candidate in November , but you 'd be wrong .
West Virginia voted for George W Bush at the last two presidential elections , and Barack Obama was utterly crushed by Hillary Clinton in the primary here .
But this state was once reliably blue .
Some commentators have even suggested that Senator Obama has an Appalachian problem on his hands - a worrying inability to connect with white , working - class , rural voters .
These were exactly the people with whom I wanted to spend some time .
So I hooked up with Bob and Debbie Schultz - a couple who seemed to encapsulate the political dilemmas faced by West Virginians .
On the one hand , both were on the left when it came to the pocketbook issues .
Bob , 55 , had been a miner and loyal member of the United Mine Workers of America until he retired with black lung disease earlier this year .
Debbie , 52 , spoke proudly of West Virginia 's mine wars , when workers battled with employers and the authorities for the right to organise .
Like her husband , she was deeply unhappy with the Bush administration 's handling of the economy .
But on the other hand , they were firmly conservative when it came to social matters .
Bob had served as a pastor until his retirement , while Debbie was an accomplished gospel singer who performed in churches across the country .
Both described themselves as pro-life and patriotic .
Neither of the main parties quite represented them .
Despite the similarity of their views , Bob was registered as a Democrat , Debbie as a Republican .
They 'd both voted for George Bush in 2004 , but were unhappy with the choices before them this time .
I asked Bob which way he intended to cast his ballot .
For Obama , he replied , but reluctantly so .
He was quite clear , though , that West Virginia 's scepticism about the Illinois senator had nothing to do with racial prejudice , despite what some commentators had written .
" In a mine , we 're all black after the first hour , " he insisted .
" People are preoccupied with colour .
But it seems to be working for Obama , and not against him . "
However , he had been deeply unsettled by the " God Damn America " speech by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Obama 's former church minister .
" He went to that church all those years , but he says he did n't know the pastor was saying those things ? "
Bob shook his head .
Debbie was equally disillusioned with her party .
She would have voted for Hillary Clinton in the primaries , she told me , had she not been a registered Republican ; instead she went for Mike Huckabee .
She was n't sure how she would vote in November .
Distrustful of Obama for the same reason as her husband , Debbie identified with Sarah Palin .
But she had also grown cynical about Republican rhetoric .
" At every election , they talk about abortion .
But nothing ever changes , " she complained .
" It 's just a way to win votes . "
It looked to me as though the GOP were losing their grip on people like Bob and Debbie .
Whether the Democrats will win back what was once the bedrock of their support was a lot less clear , however .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - YouTube , the popular online video sharing site owned by Google , said on Wednesday it will roll out a new sponsored videos format , the latest step in its drive to grow revenues through advertising .
The sponsored videos program is designed to enable video creators , from everyday users to major advertisers , to reach the broadest range of consumers with relevant videos .
The new program works by allowing an advertiser to decide which video they want to promote then choose keywords or search terms to target .
Then the advertiser can use automated tools to set daily spending budgets and place bids in an automated online auction , similar to Google ’s search programs .
When YouTube users search for videos it will display relevant videos alongside the search results which are labeled as ‘ sponsored videos ’ .
Similar to Google ’s search marketing programs advertisers pay on a cost - per - click basis .
YouTube hopes to replicate the success of Google ’s AdWords text ad format by offering relevant but unobtrusive advertising .
Analysts have said it will take YouTube at least two years to start making a meaningful contribution to Google ’s revenue even as the popular video site rolls out numerous advertising initiatives .
YouTube has launched several ad formats in the last month as well as e-commerce initiatives , full length television and movie pacts and debut live event Web casting next week .
Although Google does not break out YouTube ’s revenue numbers , analysts estimate it will bring in $ 200 million to $ 250 million this year , compared with the parent ’s approximately $ 20 billion annual revenue .
Investors have voiced concerns about when YouTube , which Google paid $ 1.65 billion for in 2006 , will start to deliver revenue and profits in line with the potential of its huge visitor numbers -- more than 330 million worldwide users in August alone , according to comScore .
McCain advisor Donald Luskin is frustrated , not at Wall Street or the Bush administration , but at you middle class whiners and exaggerators .
And he 's not gonna take it any more !
But that does n't make any of it true .
Things today just are n't that bad .
Sure , there are trouble spots in the economy , as the government takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and jitters about Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers , amply demonstrate .
And unemployment figures are up a bit , too .
None of this , however , is cause for depression -- or exaggerated Depression comparisons .
That 's what Bushonomics are reduced to ?
After eight years of being told the next tax cut for billionaires would unleash the long promised economic Mecca , after two straight Presidential terms where critics of Bush 's trickle - down mythology were soundly ridiculed as ignorant socialists , after being told We the People do n't understand complicated money stuff and we should just shut up , work harder , shop our brains out , and trust conservative economic philosophy , the best case scenario our millionaire conservative cheerleaders can make in the end is ' it 's not as bad ' as the Great Depression ?
" Vote Republican and it wo n't be as bad as the Great Depression ! "
I remember a time when the nation was at peace , its economy driven by technical innovation and stable markets allowing the accumulation of investment capital .
Interest rates and unemployment were near historical lows , wages and productivity rose almost as steeply the stock market .
Talk of investment banks going broke or market meltdowns was rare to non existent .
And no one had to write columns begging people not to compare the economy to the Great Depression .
It sounds like a conservative wet dream , but it was actually called the Clinton Years .
Abraham Lincoln said , " You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time , but you can't fool all the people all the time . "
Unfortunately , the future of this country , as well as the fate of the Western world , depends on how many people can be fooled on election day , just a few weeks from now .
Right now , the polls indicate that a whole lot of the people are being fooled a whole lot of the time .
The current financial bailout crisis has propelled Barack Obama back into a substantial lead over John McCain -- which is astonishing in view of which man and which party has had the most to do with bringing on this crisis .
It raises the question : Do facts matter ?
Or is Obama 's rhetoric and the media 's spin enough to make facts irrelevant ?
Fact Number One :
It was liberal Democrats , led by Senator Christopher Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank , who for years -- including the present year -- denied that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taking big risks that could lead to a financial crisis .
It was Senator Dodd , Congressman Frank and other liberal Democrats who for years refused requests from the Bush administration to set up an agency to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
It was liberal Democrats , again led by Dodd and Frank , who for years pushed for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to go even further in promoting subprime mortgage loans , which are at the heart of today 's financial crisis .
Alan Greenspan warned them four years ago .
So did the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to the President .
So did Bush 's Secretary of the Treasury , five years ago .
Yet , today , what are we hearing ?
That it was the Bush administration " right - wing ideology " of " de- regulation " that set the stage for the financial crisis .
Do facts matter ?
We also hear that it is the free market that is to blame .
But the facts show that it was the government that pressured financial institutions in general to lend to subprime borrowers , with such things as the Community Reinvestment Act and , later , threats of legal action by then Attorney General Janet Reno if the feds did not like the statistics on who was getting loans and who was n't .
Is that the free market ?
Or do facts not matter ?
Then there is the question of being against the " greed " of CEOs and for " the people . "
Franklin Raines made $ 90 million while he was head of Fannie Mae and mismanaging that institution into crisis .
Who in Congress defended Franklin Raines ?
Liberal Democrats , including Maxine Waters and the Congressional Black Caucus , at least one of whom referred to the " lynching " of Raines , as if it was racist to hold him to the same standard as white CEOs .
Even after he was deposed as head of Fannie Mae , Franklin Raines was consulted this year by the Obama campaign for his advice on housing !
The Washington Post criticized the McCain campaign for calling Raines an adviser to Obama , even though that fact was reported in the Washington Post itself on July 16th .
The technicality and the spin here is that Raines is not officially listed as an adviser .
But someone who advises is an adviser , whether or not his name appears on a letterhead .
The tie between Barack Obama and Franklin Raines is not all one - way .
Obama has been the second - largest recipient of Fannie Mae 's financial contributions , right after Senator Christopher Dodd .
But ties between Obama and Raines ?
Not if you read the mainstream media .
Facts do n't matter much politically if they are not reported .
The media alone are not alone in keeping the facts from the public .
Republicans , for reasons unknown , do n't seem to know what it is to counter - attack .
They deserve to lose .
But the country does not deserve to be put in the hands of a glib and cocky know - it - all , who has accomplished absolutely nothing beyond the advancement of his own career with rhetoric , and who has for years allied himself with a succession of people who have openly expressed their hatred of America .
By Steve Chapman - November 30 , 2008
On Nov. 4 , Arkansas voters approved a ban on adoption by unmarried couples .
The purpose of the ballot measure , according to the Family Council Action Committee , was " to blunt a homosexual agenda that 's at work in other states and that will be at work in Arkansas unless we are proactive about doing something about it . "
On Nov. 25 , a court in Florida pointed out something that the FCAC and other anti-gay groups somehow manage to overlook :
Allowing gay couples to adopt is much less about protecting gays than protecting children .
With that in mind , Miami - Dade Circuit Judge Cindy Lederman struck down a 1977 Florida law -- the only one of its kind -- that forbids gays from adopting .
( Arkansas , Mississippi and Utah exclude unmarried couples , which has the completely intentional result of excluding gays . )
In a case involving two young boys taken in by two gay men , she found the law was unconstitutional largely because it violated the rights of foster children to equal treatment under the law .
You could hardly find better proof than this that efforts to combat the " homosexual agenda " mainly serve to harm children in dire need of stable , loving families .
Four years ago , Martin Gill and his longtime partner agreed to provide a foster home for two boys , one 4 years old and the other an infant , who showed the physical and emotional effects of neglect , including scalp ringworm .
Now a legal guardian who regularly observes the boys attests that they are , in the judge 's words , " in excellent health , well - behaved , performing well in school and bonded to " their foster family .
They have a dog , a cat and a rabbit .
They attend a church .
But they have also spent four years in limbo .
The adults whom they have come to regard as parents were only foster caregivers .
Because of his sexual orientation , the state would not allow Gill to become their permanent , adoptive father .
No one else has asked to adopt the boys .
Yet the Center for Family and Child Enrichment , which handles these matters , concluded that if the brothers could not be adopted by Gill , it would have to look for other adoptive parents .
Consider the implications of the policy in this case .
It would mean removing the children from the home in which they have been raised -- " one of the most caring and nurturing placements " the guardian has ever seen .
It would mean putting them through the trauma , once again , of being uprooted and placed with complete strangers .
And because of the difficulty of placing kids their age , the CFCE said , it could mean the brothers would be permanently separated from each other .
And for what ?
Solely to shield them from the supposed perils of gay parents .
Gays are treated as more dangerous than felons , drug offenders and known child abusers -- none of whom is categorically barred from adopting .
As it happens , those dangers are mostly imaginary .
According to evidence cited by the judge , gays are slightly more likely than heterosexuals to suffer psychiatric problems , engage in substance abuse and smoke , but so are lots of other groups that are allowed to adopt .
The American Psychological Association says it finds no difference between the parenting of homosexuals and heterosexuals .
Would orphaned and abandoned children be better off if every one of them could be raised by stable , loving , heterosexual couples ?
Possibly .
But that 's not an option .
For many children , the alternative to having gay adoptive parents is having no parents at all .
There are hundreds of kids in Florida who need adoptive families -- nearly 1,000 at any given moment .
The average child spends 2.5 years in foster care before being adopted , and some wait forever .
Noted Judge Lederman , " 165 children in Florida aged out of the system in 2006 without ever being adopted . "
The Florida ban is simple and stark .
It says , in effect , that a child may not be adopted by gay even when the adoption is in the best interest of the child .
That 's the main reason the court overturned it :
It violates the rights of children and " causes harm to the children it is meant to protect . "
Those who want to keep gays from adopting think that 's a small price to pay for blocking the " homosexual agenda . "
But then , they 're not the ones who will be paying it .
[ UPDATE BELOW ]
Is a recently installed bike lane on South 4th Street in Brooklyn — yards from the northern pedestrian / bike entrance to the Williamsburg Bridge — misguiding cyclists onto the sidewalk and into the waiting arms of ticket - writing cops ?
A reader writes :
" As I reach the corner of South 4th Street and South 5th Place , just one short block away from one of the Brooklyn entrances to the Williamsburg bridge , I see that the bike lane arrows turn and point to the sidewalk .
I thought it odd but I followed it knowing that it was just a short bit away from the entrance .
3/ 4 ways down the sidewalk I get stopped by 2 cops telling me that I can't ride on the sidewalk ....
And then they proceed to give me a ticket !
Is this some kind of entrapment ?
The bike lane arrows clearly point toward the sidewalk and there is no sign telling you to get off and walk your bike .
While they were in the middle of giving me a ticket , a girl on a bike comes up behind me and they stop her and give her a ticket for the very same reason .
And she had the same complaint I did ; she was just following the bike lane arrows that pointed to the sidewalk . "
UPDATE :DOT spokesman Scott Gastell tells us : " We are in the process of designating the sidewalk along South 5th Street as a shared bike / pedestrian path .
We will soon add appropriate signs and directional bike stamps along the sidewalk ( see example ) , and we are reaching out to the local precinct with additional details about the project , which is not yet complete . "
It 's interesting to note that South 5th Place is only a half - block long and runs north , away from the pedestrian entrance to the bridge .
So it 's understandable that cyclists might assume the city was making an exception to the sidewalk rule here for the 50 yards or so leading up to the bridge ; if one were to follow the letter of the law and not pedal against traffic on South 5th Place , it would be necessary to continue west to Driggs , then loop around the block and back up South 5th Street .
Wiley Norvell of Transportation Alternatives adds , " The sidewalk borders Continental Army Plaza , which most pedestrians prefer to use ( if for no other reason that you can walk diagonally across it and save time ) .
Overall , this is a good , necessary set of markings ...
A cyclist was killed at this location back on 2007 ( I think , or possibly 06 ) , and I regard it as one of the more dangerous parts of the north Brooklyn bike commute .
All the paint puts everyone in their own lane and makes it a lot safer .
And once again , shame on the NYPD for ticketing this cyclist . "
And technically , it 's also necessary to ride onto the sidewalk , albeit briefly , in order to access the bridge pedestrian ramp .
Which begs the question :
Where does the sidewalk end ?
Is Fractional Reserve Banking Fraudulent ?
DIGG THIS
I. Prof. Eric Posner comments on the Block - Caplan debate on fractional reserve banking , which can be found here .
I ran across this odd debate between Bryan Caplan and Walter Block .
Here is Block ’s argument ( " frb " means fractional reserve banking ) :
Consider this : A deposits 10 ounces of gold in B ’s bank ; B gives A a demand deposit for these 10 ounces .
B turns around and lends C 9 of these ounces , giving C a demand deposit for these 9 ounces .
Thus , A and C both own full rights to these 9 ounces .
There is now a problem of over - determination or conflict in rights .
A and C both have a FULL right to these selfsame 9 ounces of gold .
They are both FULL owners of these 9 ounces .
But , one of the essences of the libertarian philosophy we share is that there CANNOT be a conflict in rights .
Any seeming conflict is due to a misspecification of one or the other right .
Yet , here , with frb , we have a GENUINE conflict in rights .
Thus , frb is incompatible with libertarianism .
Note , I am NOT talking about practicality .
It might well be ( given no bank run ) that A and C will not ACT incompatibly with one another ; that is , both will not demand that B pay them these 9 ounces , an utter impossibility .
No , I am talking about RIGHTS .
Right now , before any bank run , there is STILL a rights contradiction .
Caplan just sputters .
Here is the problem with Block ’s argument , as I think any lawyer would immediately recognize .
Block confuses property rights and contract rights .
If I give the bank some cash and pay it to put this cash in a safety deposit box , then the bank ca n’t use that cash .
It ca n’t lend it out to someone else ; it ca n’t list it as an asset on its balance sheet ; it ca n’t touch it without my permission .
If the bank were to do so , then it would have engaged in theft , and the relevant employees would go to jail .
Lawyers call this transaction a bailment .
But if I deposit some cash with the bank , I do n’t retain my property interest .
Instead , I ’m making a loan to the bank and I obtain a contractual right to repayment on demand .
If I demand my cash ( plus interest , if any ) and the bank fails to pay me , then I can sue it for breach of contract and demand expectation damages .
If the bank were not a bank but just an ordinary borrower , and it was insolvent , then I have to race other creditors for its assets ; otherwise , my contract right is converted into a claim in bankruptcy , and I have to share with other creditors .
( Since it is a bank , I may well obtain full compensation from the government , but that is not relevant to the debate . )
If you asked the bank whether it might lend out your money , it would most certainly tell you that it would .
So it is not lying to you , and there ca n’t be fraud .
Nor is there any other contradiction , incompatibility , or problem with the arrangement .
Depositors take a risk that the bank will breach the contract but anyone who enters a contract takes the same risk .
Block does n’t seem to have any problem with contract rights per se , but he does have a problem with a person entering a contract that gives another person the right to demand assets that the first person might not have .
But all contracts are like this .
People enter contracts expecting that they will be able to transfer money , goods , or services when they are due , but everyone understands that intervening events might make the transfer impossible , impractical , or unwise .
The other party obtains a right to obtain damages for breach of contract , but if every contract where the probability of nonperformance is greater than zero were considered fraudulent , we would have no economy .
The above material constitutes a statement of Professor Eric Posner ’s , and can be found here .
II .
Walter Block replies to Eric Posner
There is so much about which I disagree with Prof. Posner .
Perhaps it would be best to consider
Posner ’s views one bit at a time , and subject them to scrutiny .
He offers four different paragraphs of criticism of my anti-frb argument , and I will consider them each , in order .
1. ” Block confuses property rights and contract rights .
If I give the bank some cash and pay it to put this cash in a safety deposit box , then the bank ca n’t use that cash .
It ca n’t lend it out to someone else ; it ca n’t list it as an asset on its balance sheet ; it ca n’t touch it without my permission .
If the bank were to do so , then it would have engaged in theft , and the relevant employees would go to jail .
Lawyers call this transaction a bailment . ”
I agree with this statement entirely , and enthusiastically .
This is precisely the claim of those of us who would legally ban fractional reserve banking .
However , as can be seen below , we apply this not only to cash in a safety deposit box , but to ALL deposits with a bank .
2 . “ But if I deposit some cash with the bank , I do n’t retain my property interest .
Instead , I ’m making a loan to the bank and I obtain a contractual right to repayment on demand .
If I demand my cash ( plus interest , if any ) and the bank fails to pay me , then I can sue it for breach of contract and demand expectation damages .
If the bank were not a bank but just an ordinary borrower , and it was insolvent , then I have to race other creditors for its assets ; otherwise , my contract right is converted into a claim in bankruptcy , and I have to share with other creditors .
( Since it is a bank , I may well obtain full compensation from the government , but that is not relevant to the debate . ) ”
Here , I sharply disagree .
A major matter of contention between the defenders and opponents of the legality of frb revolves , precisely , around the issue of whether or not a depositor , call him A , with some cash with the bank ( in the form of a demand deposit ) , retains his property interest in those funds .
I say No , and offer some reasons .
One , if this is true , then , when the bank lends out money to a borrower , C , and gives him a demand deposit for ( a fraction of ) the amount deposited , there are not one but TWO people each of whom has a FULL ownership right in the SAME amount of money .
This is a logical impossibility .
Two , another way of putting the matter is that there are now more titles to property than there is property .
In the numerical example mentioned above , there are now only 10 gold ounces , and there are two people , A ( 10 ) and C ( 9 ) with rights to 19 gold ounces .
A manifest impossibility .
Posner , in contrast , says Yes .
That is , he claims that A no longer has a right to the money he has deposited .
But he offers no REASON in support of this contention .
Reading in between the lines , it is easy to see what is going on here : Posner is relying on PRESENT LAW , according to which he is entirely correct .
This , indeed , is the exact manner that the courts have interpreted demand deposits .
However , Posner , sadly , is missing out on the context of the debate between me and Caplan .
We were debating , not , what the law IS , but , rather , in sharp contrast , what the law SHOULD BE .
Posner mistakenly interprets the Block - Caplan debate as over a POSITIVE statement of law , when it really involves NORMATIVE claims about the law .
Yes , yes , Professor Posner ’s views of bankruptcy law are entirely correct as regards which creditors are first in line , but they are equally IRRELEVANT to the debate between me and Caplan .
3 . “ If you asked the bank whether it might lend out your money , it would most certainly tell you that it would .
So it is not lying to you , and there ca n’t be fraud .
Nor is there any other contradiction , incompatibility , or problem with the arrangement .
Depositors take a risk that the bank will breach the contract but anyone who enters a contract takes the same risk . ”
True , again , true ; all too true .
The bank would indeed NOT lie to a depositor about any such thing .
But , lying is only sufficient for fraud , not necessary .
There are other ways to commit fraud besides an outright lie .
For example , it is fraudulent for a bank or anyone else to try to sell you a square circle , even if they do not lie about it .
Why ?
Because there is no such thing as a square circle , and , in order for a contract to be a valid one , not only must both parties agree to it ( neither lies to the other ) , but , also , the contract must be in accordance with LOGIC ( e.g. , the law of non contradiction ) , and “ sales ” of square circles clearly are not compatible with that consideration .
But , neither are frb contracts !
They , too , are incompatible with the reality of property rights , according to which there cannot be more titles to property than there is property ; there cannot be an A and a C , with rights that are incompatible with those of each other .
For our friends on the left , there are numerous and myriad contradictions of rights .
For example , X ’s right to “ public ” accommodation in Y’s home conflicts with the latter ’s right to privacy .
E.g. , X is a homosexual would - be renter , and Y is a Christian landlord , looking for a roommate .
For the interventionists , the courts must “ balance ” these rights .
But such rights conflicts are anathema to the libertarian .
For us , if there is a seeming rights conflict , one or the other ( or both ) of the putative rights are not rights at all .
Yet , in the case of frb , there are two people , A and C , each with rights to money of 19 units , and the bank , B , cannot possibly satisfy both .
So , A and C have incompatible or conflicting rights .
4. ” Block does n’t seem to have any problem with contract rights per se , but he does have a problem with a person entering a contract that gives another person the right to demand assets that the first person might not have .
But all contracts are like this .
People enter contracts expecting that they will be able to transfer money , goods , or services when they are due , but everyone understands that intervening events might make the transfer impossible , impractical , or unwise .
The other party obtains a right to obtain damages for breach of contract , but if every contract where the probability of nonperformance is greater than zero were considered fraudulent , we would have no economy . ”
No , not at all .
I have no “ problem ” with contract rights .
I am a warm supporter of them .
Provided , that is , that they do not constitute a logical contradiction , and are compatible with reality , e.g. , underlying property rights .
However , ALL contracts are certainly NOT “ like this . ”
Under frb , it is a logical impossibility for B to make good his obligations to both A and C , on demand .
Now , it is entirely possible that A and C will not call upon B to do so .
But , IF they do , that is , constitute a “ bank run ” B will then be exposed as being unable to meet his financial obligations .
In very sharp contrast , there are NO OTHER contracts quite like this in the economy .
Yes , I buy 10 widgets from you for delivery today , in consideration for my promise to pay you $ 10 , tomorrow .
A day passes , and I am unable to carry out my part of the bargain .
But , it is not a LOGICAL CONTRADICTION to suppose I am unable to do so , as in the case of frb .
There is all the difference in the world between being unable to fulfill a contract due to contingent circumstances , as in the widget example , and it being IMPOSSIBLE to do so , as in the case of frb .
It is not merely “ intervening events ” that make it a violation of the laws of logic for B , the Bank , to uphold contracts with lender A and borrower C .
It is IMPOSSIBLE for B to do so , given frb .
Posner is to be congratulated for this little gem : “ if every contract where the probability of nonperformance is greater than zero were considered fraudulent , we would have no economy . ”
Beautiful .
I wish I had said this .
The man , truly , has a way with a word .
But it is not merely , that in the case of frb , “ the probability of nonperformance is greater than zero , ” as in the case of pretty much ALL commercial agreements .
Rather it is that even before performance or non-performance becomes an issue ( this issue only arises if a bank run occurs ) , the bank engaged in frb is legally dead in the water .
Its instantaneous debts are greater than its instantaneous assets .
That is , it is bankrupt from the get - go .
Under libertarian law ( not , I hasten to add , present statist law ) , it would immediately be declared bankrupt , and forced to disgorge its property .
It would not be allowed to operate for one second .
The distinction between frb failure and ordinary business failure rests on the difference between a logical impossibility and a contingent failure , which need not have happened .
All if this is spelled out , clearly , in my part of the debate with Caplan .
It is elaborated upon , in great detail , in the bibliography appended to that debate .
Yet , more than passing curious , Posner chooses to pretty much ignore all of it in his criticisms of my anti-frb position .
A strange way to come to grips with the arguments of an intellectual opponent .
Hopefully , if there is to be any future round in this correspondence between me and Posner , he will attempt to come to grips with what I actually say .

The Best of Walter E. Block
In 1527 , R.O. Ferdinando Rodericus described how on " 9 November last as he was coming from a goldsmith 's he was lured by a maid into the house of Francis Borowe , a milliner in Abchurch Lane next door to the said goldsmith 's , where he was assaulted , wounded and covered with tar and filth by the said Francis and others and robbed of his cap and money .
Lay at the point of death for 30 days after . "
Interesting , and odd , turn of events .
From Ambinder at TIME – well , Pete Williams apparently first reported this :
Article One , Section Six of the U.S. Constitution says :
No Senator or Representative shall , during the Time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States which shall have been created , or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time ; and no Person holding any Office under the United States , shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office .
Essentially , you cannot take a job if the salary was increased during your current congressional term .
And the salary for cabinet officials has gone up in the past year .
Even if it is lowered back down , constitutional scholars say that may not be enough to fix the problem .
Panasonic announces electronics recycling program
It seems everyone is getting a little bit greener these days .
And that ’s a good thing , especially when it comes to electronics , which are known to produce harmful toxins and are made from plastics that do n’t biodegrade .
But now , Panasonic has come up with a new recycling program to put a stop to the waste .
Currently , when you have an electronic device break or you decide to buy something new , you have to wait for one of those electronics round - ups , or drop them off at an electronics recycling facility .
This is time - consuming and often a real burden to busy people .
That ’s why as of November 1 , Panasonic will be rolling out a new electronics recycling program .
It will span the entire U.S. and will make it easier for people to get rid of their tech toys in a responsible manner .
All you ’ll have to do is drop off Panasonic - branded electronics at one of the 160 drop off spots .
It is only going to be used in 10 states at first , but is expected to roll out in all 50 states over the next 3 years .

The collapse of the deal is a blow for Yahoo Google has decided to abandon its advertising partnership with Yahoo to avoid having a " protracted legal battle " with regulators .
The deal involved Google providing some of the advertising around Yahoo's search results and would have been worth $ 800 m ( £ 494 m ) a year to Yahoo .
It was originally announced in June but has faced anti-trust objections .
Yahoo said in a statement it was disappointed that Google had decided not to fight for the deal in court .
Yahoo was relying on the deal with Google to help to placate shareholders angry about Yahoo rejecting Microsoft 's takeover offer .
Google said it would not allow the prospect of a legal battle to distract it from its core mission .
" That would be like trying to drive down the road of innovation with the parking brake on , " Google said in a blog .
Microsoft offer
If somebody is building a coffin for Yahoo , they can go to Google to pick up some nails
Tim Weber , Business editor , BBC news website
Another nail in Yahoo's coffin See Yahoo share price See Google share price Yahoo's management has been under pressure since rejecting the $ 33 a share offer from Microsoft , which valued the company at $ 47.5 bn ( £ 29.4bn ) .
Yahoo shares were trading at $ 14 each on Wednesday .
Now that the Google deal has fallen through , Yahoo may find itself having to try to do another deal with Microsoft , although Microsoft has publicly said it is no longer interested .
Carl Icahn , a Yahoo investor who now sits on its board , went as far as to try to sack the entire Yahoo board to try to resurrect the Microsoft deal .
Rising prices Google and Yahoo are the top two search engines , so regulators at the US Department of Justice were concerned about a tie - up between them .
YAHOO'S BUSY YEAR January : Microsoft makes an offer for Yahoo February : Yahoo rejects the offer May : Microsoft says it is no longer interested in buying Yahoo June : Google and Yahoo announce advertising partnership July : Yahoo rejects joint offer from Microsoft and investor Carl Icahn August : Yahoo survives revolt at its shareholders ' meeting November : Google pulls out of advertising deal
The two companies had delayed implementing their deal while it was considered by the regulators .
Microsoft and the Association of National Advertisers were among those objecting to the deal on the grounds that Yahoo and Google controlled 80 % of the search market between them .
They suggested that the partnership would drive up online advertising rates , although Google rejected this on the grounds that its rates are set by an auction system .
The Justice Department said it had told Google that it planned to file a lawsuit to block the deal .
" Had the companies implemented their arrangement , Yahoo's competition likely would have been blunted immediately with respect to the search pages that Yahoo chose to fill with ads sold by Google rather than its own ads , " it said in a statement .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
It was n’t quite a Halloween nightmare on Obama street , but journalists on Friday drew a rare flash of anger from the normally unflappable Democratic presidential nominee .
Democratic presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) goes trick - or - treating with his 7 - year - old daughter Sasha in his Chicago neighbourhood on Halloween , October 31 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
Barack Obama had taken a break from the campaign trail for a few hours of Halloween fun at home with his family four days before the election , but ended up visibly annoyed when news crews dogged their footsteps in their Chicago neighborhood .
“ That ’s enough .
You ’ve got a shot .
Leave us alone , ” Obama told reporters as he walked down the block with his 7 - year - old daughter Sasha in her costume on the way to a party at a neighbor ’s home .
Obama , usually cool in public during a campaign that has turned him into the frontrunner for the White House , did not disguise his irritation when his surprise walk caused news photographers and camera crews to scramble for position on the sidewalk .
He grew especially testy when a Polish television cameraman tried to approach them .
“ Come on guys , get back on the bus , ” he pleaded with journalists , many of whom had accompanied him from the airport to Chicago ’s Hyde Park neighborhood .
Obama , wearing sunglasses but no costume , and his daughter , dressed up as what campaign aides said was a “ corpse ’s bride , ” then broke into a sprint , leaving the journalists behind .
Secret Service agents and vans followed closely behind , and stunned trick - or - treaters broke into shouts of “ Obama , Obama ” as he rushed past .
There was no neighborhood trick - or - treating for the Obama family , a nod to the potential security problems .
Instead the family attended a Halloween party behind closed doors at a friend ’s home .
Obama ’s 10 - year - old daughter Malia had planned to dress up as an “ evil fairy , ” the campaign said .
The fact that Obama took time out for Halloween showed a candidate feeling confident about his chances on Tuesday , with polls showing him leading Republican nominee John McCain .
Obama flew straight from a rally in Iowa to Chicago , where he stepped onto the airport tarmac with a pumpkin -- brought on a campaign swing through Florida -- under one arm .
After the brief stop at home , he planned to be back campaigning on Friday night at a rally in Gary , Indiana .
SPRINGFIELD , Mass .
As Election Night made way for a new day , a pastor named Bryant Robinson Jr. clicked off his television to accept a sleep of sweet promise .
His mostly black congregation now had two blessings awaiting it in 2009 : the inauguration of the first African - American president and the finished construction of a new church .
Give praise .
He could not have been asleep two hours before his telephone rang .
It was his brother Andrew , whose home abuts the blessed construction site .
“ They ’re burning our church , ” shouted Andrew Robinson , who still does n’t know why he said “ they . ”
Soon Bishop Bryant Robinson , pastor of the Macedonia Church of God in Christ , was standing at the grassy edge , as firefighters sprayed arcs of water meant not to save the building but to contain a fire clearly set .
Black embers the size of fists shot skyward , only to float down like broken pieces of the cold New England night .
Someone eased him into a chair  he is 71 , with bad knees and high blood pressure  and placed a blanket around his weary shoulders .
He stayed there past dawn , when this new day ’s light revealed a smoldering test of faith : a skeleton of scorched steel and a cracked foundation upon which a church could no longer be built .
Michigan voters said yes to medical marijuana by a ratio of nearly 2 - 1 .
And while the law takes effect Dec. 4 , details of how it will play out remain hazy among doctors , law enforcement officials and state residents who want to use the drug for medicinal purposes .
The state 's Department of Community Health , through its county - level health departments , have been designated to maintain a registry and issue registration cards to patients and " caregivers " who will then be legally allowed to have up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana .
The law also allows for patients and their caregivers to grow up to 12 plants , as long as they grown them in an " enclosed , locked facility . "
The department has until April 4 to have the registry up and running .
But local officials , doctors and patients remain unsure exactly how the new law will play out .
WHAT THE LAW MEANS
Voters have made medical marijuana legal in Michigan , but details about how the law will effect patients and their caregivers remain cloudy .
The Michigan Department of Community Health answers some questions :
What does Proposal 1 allow ?
Proposal 1 allows patients with a debilitating medical condition to use marijuana after obtaining a registry identification card from Michigan Department of Community Health .
To obtain a registry card , patients must have a written certification from a physician verifying that they have a debilitating medical condition the symptoms of which can be alleviated by marijuana use .
Patients in need of medical assistance in using the medical marijuana may designate a primary caregiver who will also be allowed to grow and possess marijuana .
How much marijuana can patients and their caregivers have at one time ?
A registered patient shall not be arrested or prosecuted for the possession of 2.5 ounces or less of marijuana and 12 additional plants in an enclosed , locked facility .
A registered caregiver shall not be arrested or prosecuted for assisting a patient to whom he or she is connected through the department 's registry .
Each caregiver may have up to 2.5 ounces of " usable " marijuana and 12 plants per patient .
Who can become a primary caregiver ?
A primary caregiver is a person who is at least 21 years old and who has agreed to assist with a patient 's medical use of marijuana and who has never been convicted of a felony involving illegal drugs .
The caregiver can assist no more than five patients .
Compensation from patients to the caregivers will be legal .
Who will operate the program ?
The Bureau of Health Professions , within the Michigan Department of Community Health , with county health departments serving as registration sites .
When can patients and caregivers apply for the program ?
The law takes effect Dec. 4 , but the department has until April 4 to come up with the rules and operation of the registry .
Can I get a prescription for marijuana and fill it at my pharmacy ?
No .
The new law does not provide a legal means of acquiring marijuana or seeds nor will state officials offer advice on how to do so .
" All I know is what I read in the paper , " said Dr. Howard Hurt , medical director of the Bay County Health Department .
And while state law now makes marijuana legal for medicinal purposes , federal law does not , leading to additional uncertainty in law enforcement .
" If the law provides for people to do this , we 're going to have to allow people to do this , " said Bay County Sheriff John E. Miller .
" But I can see how this would be open for abuse . "
Miller said that although federal law makes no exception to marijuana for medical use , his deputies enforce state law .
And " the federal prosecutor is busy enough that he 's not going to charge somebody with possession of marijuana . "
Bay City Police Chief Michael Cecchini was a member of the Phoenix Police Department when Arizona voters made medical marijuana legal in 1996 .
He said he did n't notice a spike in problems associated with its use .
Cecchini is " not in favor " of any form of legalized marijuana , however , because he feels it will " compound societal problems . "
" Alcohol is a legal substance and we still have to deal with people committing crimes while drunk on alcohol , " he said .
" When we start legalizing other drugs , I think that we 're giving the government stamp of approval , and more people will use it . "
Budding demand , hazy research
As chief medical director for the McLaren Visiting Nurse and hospice services , Dr. Michael Parmer oversees Brian 's House locations in Bay City and Davison and similar facilities dedicated to making patients comfortable in the last six months of their lives .
Parmer said he would be willing to write a letter for a terminally ill patient , if asked , so that a person who turns to marijuana to alleviate his symptoms can continue doing so without engaging in criminal activity .
" I would not have a problem with writing that in the end stages of life , " Parmer said .
" But am I endorsing it ?
No . "
Parmer said patients are " lining up for prescriptions " for medical marijuana , but that he can't provide them .
While the new law makes possession and use of marijuana legal for patients with debilitating conditions , it does n't allow doctors to write prescriptions or patients to purchase packages of pot from their local pharmacies .
Parmer said he does n't support the legalization of marijuana , for patients or anyone else .
" I do n't have a bias about people 's own beliefs , " Parmer said .
" People can do whatever they want .
But this law has opened up an incredible can of worms .
We have a law ... that makes it legal to grow , possess and use it for medical indications , but there are no medical indications actually approved by the FDA or any of the medical boards , because there 's no research that shows marijuana to be medically beneficial . "
Parmer acknowledges there is anecdotal evidence that the drug helps with chronic pain , nausea and appetite .
But he debates whether it controls pain , or just masks it .
" It 's a mind - altering substance , " Parmer said .
" When people get high , they may be more comfortable .
It 's kind of an escape rather than true pain relief .
It 's altering their perception of pain . "
If patients at Brian 's House choose to use marijuana , he wo n't oppose it .
" That would be their option , " Parmer said .
" We would treat it the same way we do tobacco - there 's a designated smoking area outside the building . "
Kurt Miller , director of public relations for Bay Regional Medical Center , said the hospital 's only policy on the new law is that the no-smoking policy for buildings and grounds will apply to marijuana as well as cigarettes .
" We talked about this yesterday with our directors , " Miller said on Tuesday .
" Essentially it comes down to the physicians to make choices with each of their patients . "
Advocates see growth industry
Michigan is the 13th state to allow medical use of marijuana .
Three cities in Michigan - Flint , Traverse City and Ann Arbor - have already adopted laws making possession of small amounts of marijuana a civil infraction .
Massachusetts voters on Nov. 4 approved the first statewide measure to decriminalize marijuana , making the possession of an ounce or less a civil infraction punishable by a $ 100 fine .
And on Monday , U.S. Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Massachusetts ) proposed a bill that would decriminalize possession of as much of 3.5 ounces of marijuana across the country .
Rob Kampia , executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project with offices in Las Vegas and Washington D.C. , said the efforts in Michigan and in Massachusetts demonstrate a " sea change " in public attitudes about use of the drug for medical and recreational purposes .
" Last year an American was arrested on marijuana charges once every 36 seconds , which is more arrests for marijuana possession alone than for all violent crimes combined . "
Kampia said in a press release .
" Voters have loudly said , ' Enough ! '
" Marijuana prohibition is about to take its place next to alcohol Prohibition on the ash heap of history . "
Medical use may just be the beginning , if marijuana advocates have their way .
Everett Swift , a Hillman resident who helped put Proposal 1 on the Michigan ballot , is also executive director of an organization called MIHEMP .
That group is dedicated to educating the public - and lawmakers - about industrial uses of hemp in " manufacturing , agriculture , biofuels and the positive effect it could have on the Michigan economy . "
" We want Michigan to join the 15 other states that have told the federal government to allow hemp production in the United States , " Swift told The Times .
" We are the only industrialized nation in the world that is not taking advantage of this resource . "
Swift notes that the proposal passed in every county in Michigan , with 63 percent of the electorate approving .
" The large margin of victory only goes to show how out of touch the Michigan Legislature and governor are with the people of Michigan , " Swift said .
Victoria 's Secret model Karolina Kurkova and the riddle of her missing belly button
Navel gazing : Karolina Kurkova in Miami over the weekend
Victoria 's Secret model Karolina Kurkova put her bombshell curves on show during a photo shoot in Miami over the weekend , but it was her peculiar belly button that was attracting all the attention .
The Czech blonde 's unusual navel had onlookers perplexed as she frolicked on the beach over the weekend in a tiny white bikini .
It 's not the first time her almost non-existent belly button has drawn attention .
A source has revealed magazine and catalogue art directors routinely airbrush one in for in post - production .
' Karolina ’s body is amazing , but her belly button is unusual , ' a fashion insider told Page Six magazine .
' It disappears in photos , so we keep a collection of belly button shots in different positions , and Photoshop them on to her whenever she ’s doing a bikini picture . '
Still , if she was at all self - conscious , she did n't let it show as she posed up on the foreshore .
The following day she was once again strutting her stuff at the lingerie company 's catwalk extravaganza .
Riddle : The Victoria 's Secret model put her peculiar belly button on show
She was among the 35 Victoria 's Secret models to hit the runway , including Heidi Klum and Orlando Bloom 's current flame , Australian Miranda Kerr .
R&B singer Usher opened the show at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel where the front row was filled with stars including Paris Hilton , John Stamos , Kim Kardashian , Martha Stewart and Klum 's husband , Seal .
Karolina , who has appeared in campaigns for Yves Saint Laurent , Ralph Lauren , Oscar de la Renta , Chanel and Balenciaga , remains one of the most in - demand models .
White hot : Karolina posed up alongside Doutzen Kroes , Miranda Kerr and Alessandra Ambrosio
Her advocates include photographer Mario Testino , designer Marc Jacobs and Vogue editor Anna Wintour , who dubbed once dubbed her ' the next supermodel . '
While her popularity shows no sign of slowing down , she hopes to cross over into acting .
She recently filmed a small part in Sienna Miller 's upcoming action move G.I. Joe , which is scheduled for release next year .
Palm Beach County , Florida , is in the news again for another election mishap .
This time the culprit is n't the county 's infamous butterfly ballot that made headlines in the 2000 presidential race .
Instead , the problem is ballots used with the county 's new $ 5.5 million optical - scan machines made by Sequoia Voting Systems .
More than 3,000 optical - scan ballots have mysteriously disappeared since the county held an election last Tuesday .
According to tallies a week ago , a total of 102,523 ballots were cast in the election .
But according to a recount of one of the races , which was completed this last Sunday , the total number of cast ballots was only 99,045 – a difference of 3,478 .
Election officials say they can't explain the discrepancy , though critics are concerned that this is a precursor to problems that could arise in the November presidential election .
The problem was discovered only because the county was conducting a recount of a close judicial race between an incumbent , 15th Circuit Judge Richard Wennet , and his challenger William Abramson .
Prior to the recount , Abramson had won the election by 17 votes ; but the recount flipped the race and resulted in him losing the election to Wennet by 60 votes .
The total number of votes cast in that specific race dropped by 2,900 between the time ballots were counted last Tuesday and the recount .
Palm Beach County Election Supervisor Arthur Anderson said the discrepancy in the number of votes cast in the judicial race was likely due to the extra sensitivity of optical - scan machines used in the recount , which are different from optical - scan machines that counted the ballots on Election Day .
The seven high - speed tabulating machines used in the recount are much more " unforgiving " than those that processed the votes on election day , he told the Palm Beach Post .
Although none of the articles about this issue explain what Anderson meant by this , presumably the machines used to count the votes on Election Day were precinct - based scanners , which are used on site at polling locations , while the recount was done on central - count scanners , which are used to count ballots at a county headquarters .
If optical - scan machines are calibrated poorly or inconsistently , they will sometimes read some votes on ballots while ignoring others .
This could explain the issue if the problem were simply that some votes cast in the race were read by machines on Tuesday and not read by different machines during the recount .
But this can't explain why the total number of ballots cast in the election changed by more than 3,000 .
Nonetheless , the county plans to certify the recount results this week , despite the discrepancy in the ballot numbers .
County officials say it is n't their place to question the results , although they say they are trying to determine what happened to those missing ballots .
Abramson , the losing candidate in the judicial race , told reporters that he is exploring the possibility of a lawsuit .
This is n't the first time the Sequoia machines and Anderson have been criticized over uncounted votes .
About 700 votes went uncounted in a special commissioners election in West Palm Beach last June .
In that election , Sequoia optical - scan machines had failed to count votes on memory cartridges from three precincts .
Sequoia maintained that the problem was Anderson 's staff and not its machines .
The staff had mistakenly fed the three cartridges into the tabulating equipment twice , causing the machine to " suspend " the votes and not include them in the tally .
Election staff caught the problem days after the election , but before the official election results had been certified .
Arthur Anderson has only been the county election supervisor a short time but has been beset by criticism for most of it .
He became election supervisor in 2005 when he replaced Theresa LePore , who created the infamous " butterfly ballot , " and who is apparently writing a book about the 2000 election .
Anderson was elected election supervisor even though he apparently had no prior experience in election administration .
Ironically , he lost his own bid for re-election in last Tuesday 's race , although he will still oversee this November 's election , since his replacement will not assume office until January .
A runoff race in November will decide the winner of his job , since neither of the two candidates vying for his position obtained enough votes last week to forestall a runoff .
Like Anderson , neither of the two candidates hoping to replace him has experience running elections .

Valve ported their Source Engine under Mac OS without telling anyone and especially not me .
Now I do n't have the time , motivation and knowledge to port the game to Mac myself , but I can provide you with a zipped version and instructions on how to make it work .
It 's a bit tricky but so far it worked when we tested it on a Macbook .

Microsoft announced today that it has delivered on a number of promises it made earlier this year regarding the interoperability and openness of its products .
Among them are 1.0 releases of technical documentation on the protocols built into Microsoft Office 2007 , Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 , and Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 .
Microsoft also released 5,000 pages of new documentation today on the binary file formats in Office , putting the company well down the path of its new interoperability initiative .
" Microsoft 's cumulative posting of approximately 50,000 pages of technical documentation on MSDN provides consistent , open access for all developers , which enhances the ease and opportunities for working with Microsoft 's high - volume products , " said Microsoft 's general manager of Interoperability Craig Shank in a statement .
" Moreover , our work with partners , competitors and customers to engage in the technical nuts - and - bolts of real - world interoperability provides great ongoing opportunities for collaboration to address the challenges of today 's diverse IT environment . "
The 1.0 releases of technical docs for Office , SharePoint Server , and Exchange Server follow Microsoft 's preliminary releases earlier this year .
The company says that it took feedback from the community on how to improve the documentation between then and now , resulting in a comprehensive resource for developers working on technology that communicates with Microsoft's .
Of course , Microsoft also made note of which protocols are covered by existing patents or patent applications , in addition to its " reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing terms " for those who will be developing for commercial distribution .
The 5,000 pages of new documentation published today cover data portability in Office , Word , Excel , and PowerPoint .
Microsoft says that this , in addition to documentation that it has already provided , will " make it easier for developers to enable applications to read and write files in these binary file formats , thus enhancing the ease of moving data from one application to another . "
The move should help to quell the concerns of the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency , which has complained loudly about Office 's lack of interoperability with other products since late last year .
The European Commission also announced a new antitrust probe into Microsoft over interoperability in January which , among other things , alleged that the new Office Open XML does not play nice with competing products .
Because of Microsoft 's long and checkered history in the areas of openness and interoperability , critics will keep scrutinizing the company in the years ahead .
The company appears to be working to make good on its promises , however , so all eyes will be on Microsoft 's continued progress in the coming months and years .

Not sure if this is just in Canada
Or what 's going on exactly ,
But every time I try to open an embedded link to Comedy Central , nothing happens ... every browser , every OS
What are they afraid of ?
Canadians will throw off their wintery slumber and rise up , inspired by Colbert 's rapier - like wit ?
Or are you all just jealous ?
Sans reason .
After all ... we use paper ballots , and * &^%* ^& % like Harper still manage to get themselves ' elected ' .

Hey Brad ,
Watched the show yesterday and thought you wrote the bit : )
He covered all of your reporting so well but of course stopped short of evidencing the ACORN DIVERSION AS AN UN - CLEVER ATTEMPT BY THE NEW WORLD ORDER SELLOUT PUPPETS TO COVER UP THE COMPUTER ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINE ELECTION SHAM THAT WILL PUT FORTH THEIR CHOSEN ILLUMINI CANDIDATE INTO THE WHITE HOUSE .

My Canadian relatives were here recently .
They gave me a blank look when I said Harper 's a bush clone .
The faux Christian Regressives are making a global grab for power .
I hope the world wakes up soon .
That 's weird you can't watch the videos from Comedy Central - can you watch other videos ?
No more Second City for you Hosers .

I would love to see Rick Mercer and Colbert on a show together .
That would be a hoot !

Kira on Huffpo , I think , they showed a picture of her new wardrobe and she was carrying a bag that says " Real Women Hunt Moose " .
Most of you may already know this but there is a blogger in Alaska who has a lot of the inside stuff on Palin .

If you can't link to Comedy Central , try hulu.com , or surfthechannel.com .
Hulu always posts
The Daily Show , and The Colbert Report by the day after it airs .
They have movies and lots of other shows and clips also .
I am not sure you will be able to view these from Canada , but it is worth a try .
FYI

@ Kira Jon Newton of p2pnet ( http://www.p2pnet.net/), which he runs from Vancouver Island , BC , refers to Harper as George W. Harper .
He also refers to the MSM as the lamescream media .
I find both to be very appropriate .
Progressives in Canada and the UK are seeing the same negative trends that we observe .
Tories everywhere seem to be suffering from cranial - rectal insertion syndrome .
NuLabour in the UK behave more like the neocons than anything else .
Gordon Brown is a Bush lap dog exactly like Tony Blair .
Has anyone else noticed that neocons are not conservatives ?
The borrow and spend NuRepublicans are destroying this country .
What happens when China stops lending us money ?
How will we bring the troops home ?
I really do n't like fascists .
Particularly Christofascists .

You could try hiding your ip if you want to see these videos .
Worked for me .
Why Canadian IP 's are being blocked is anyone 's guess .
Anyway , there are a number of sites that allow you to do this .
Try this :

Thanks Adam I will try that .
Kira
I am with you , I need to laugh .
I remember first coming to Bradblog in early 05 .
Everytime something positive happened I was sure you had the Repugs and they would be put in jail .
But after 4 + years of this roller coaster ride , you lose hope unfortunately .
But ... there are so many good people out there that eventually you will win .
A good description was given to me when I lost a loved one .
Think of the waves in the ocean .
Just when you think all is fine another will come in and knock you out , it will go out again and you find a little peace .
Another ; it is like trying to crawl out of a bowl in which the sides are oiled , BUT YOU will get there ... eventually .
I do n't know how Brad does it but I am glad you have him .
and now for a funny site I found last night after reading bradblog and getting totally depressed ...

Nostredummass I did some poking around the Internet (s ) and found out why we can't open embedded Comedy Central videos .
Apparently there is an agreement between Viacom and CTVGlobeMedia .
( The CON - servative channel ) " As of June 27 , 2007 , CTV and The Comedy Network have exclusive Canadian rights to the entire Comedy Central library of past and current programs on all electronic platforms , under a multi- year agreement with Viacom , expanding on past programming agreements between the two channels .
Canadian users attempting to visit Comedy Central websites will also be redirected to TCN's website and vise versa for American users . "

( Fm , cheat , teen , size ) copyright ( c ) 2000 thursday@sdf.lonestar.org
--
The normal disclaimers apply :
If you are underage or do n't like sex stories , do n't read this .
--
I was nearly nude on the bed , sort of sitting with several pillows propping my back up .
Jenny Carston was on her knees next to me , hunched over , giving her best attempt at a blowjob .
I was 17 , and Jenny was 15 , I think , and despite my young age , I was pretty bored for a guy with a nubile 15 year old girl servicing his dick .
I 'd gotten around quite a bit in my two years of being sexually active -- the reason for this was probably a combination of my large and ever - growing organ , and my reputation for always eating pussy .
I 'd spent my early adolescence reading my parents ' copies of Penthouse Forum , and that seemed to inculcate into me the key value of : Always Satisfy Your Woman .
So I learned to love eating pussy , and would happily do it on whatever girl I happened to be with .
Girls talk , and by the time I was sixteen , I 'd had more partners than some people have their whole lives .
At any rate , I 'd learned to differentiate good head from bad , and although Jenny certainly had potential , she needed lots more practice .
I 'd just finished giving her not two but three orgasms under my now dog - tired tongue , and I was about to call a halt to her attempts at fellatio when the door to the bedroom we were using flew open -- we were at a party at a classmate 's house -- and Veronica stopped in her tracks in the doorway .
Jenny , bless her heart , shrieked and scampered off the bed to scoop up her clothes before I had time to catch myself staring at Veronica 's nipples protruding through the silk shirt she wore .
I was so taken by her , that I actually forgot that I was n't wearing anything , my cock , with its ever - growing 8 3/ 4 inches , standing up straight and tall .
" Party 's over , you guys , " Veronica told us , as Jenny squeezed by her in the doorway , still buttoning her blouse .
Veronica was Jimmy 's -- the classmate who threw the party -- mother .
" Nice dick , Martin , " she smiled .
" Now put your clothes on and get out . "
Veronica lived with her two sons -- Jimmy & Aaron -- and her husband Jim two doors down from me .
Jimmy was a year ahead of me in school , but we became friends when we moved into their neighborhood three years before .
Veronica was a Puerto Rican beauty , standing 5 ' 4 " , with light brown -- I guess the modern term is mocha -- skin and a petite yet curvy figure .
Her chest measured 34DD - - I know this because she was fairly obnoxious & goofy in many ways , and early in our acquaintance , she 'd divined somehow my affection for voluptuous women , and had offered up her own bra size in order to give me , I suppose , a point of reference when judging other women 's sizes .
She mentioned this at dinner one night , grabbing one of her delectable breasts in full view of her husband and family .
The most remarkable thing about Veronica were not the fabulous breasts she sported , but the fact that her nipples were always erect .
She must have had some kind of condition or something , because I 'd never seen her without erect nipples , even in the middle of summer .
By the time I was fifteen , I 'd seen her nude twice .
The first time had been one evening when I 'd gone over to do homework with Jimmy .
I was climbing the stairs to Jimmy 's room , and heard Veronica screaming -- not an uncommon occurrence in their household , with her Puerto Rican blood , which seemed always near the boiling point -- at Aaron to do some such thing .
As I reached the top of the stairs , I could see down to the end of the hall , where Veronica stood in the open doorway to the upstairs bathroom , stark naked and dripping wet , shouting at the top of her lungs for Jim to do something with young Aaron .
Seeing me , she covered her breasts with one arm and stooped over to deny me the vision of her hairy mound .
In all , I briefly saw both breasts for about half a second before she covered up .
The next time was over a year later .
I 'd come over on a Friday night to watch Friday Night Videos with Jimmy on their big screen TV .
Veronica was in the hottub in the back yard , and I waved to her as I came in and got a soda .
She waved back , only her head evident above the water .
Jimmy and I sat on the couch watching TV for about 20 minutes .
Veronica came into view , walking toward the glass doors .
As she did , I could see her -- she was doing this basically about 5 feet from the door -- stuffing her breasts back into the top of her one - piece bathing suit .
As soon as I saw her right nipple , I immediately covered my eyes .
I was embarrassed that lately I 'd been aroused around Jimmy 's mother , and it sort of made me feel uncomfortable .
Entering the house , she saw me covering my eyes , and said :
" Oh , you do n't have to cover your eyes , Martin .
You 're too young to get horny . "
Jimmy and I both laughed uncomfortably , and she went on her way .
Little did she know how horny I could be .
Fast forward to two weeks after Veronica caught me and Jenny in their guest room .
I 'm at dinner with them , following Jimmy 's grounding for throwing the party .
Veronica & Jim have given me a little ribbing about fooling around ( " More than a mouthfull 's too much , " Jim tells me ) , and everything is forgiven .
There was also a bit of fatherly pride in Jim 's ribbing , I think , since both of us secretly had some questions in our minds about Jimmy 's orientation .
But Veronica had been looking at me a little differently since then , and although she 'd always been a bit inappropriate , there was a lot more sexual innuendo in the things she would say to me .
A few weeks later , Jimmy and I were in their hottub one afternoon .
Why is a mystery , since it was about 90 degrees out .
Veronica came into the yard wearing a thin white tank top and shorts and said , " Jimmy , you need to go and pick up Aaron from karate now . "
One of the terms of Veronica and Jim 's paying for Jimmy 's auto insurance was that he run errands like that for them .
" OK , " Jimmy agreed .
" I 'll be right back .
Let 's play Pitfall when I get back , " he said to me .
Did I mention that it was 1985 ?
We got out of the hottub and toweled off .
Jimmy threw on a shirt and went out to pick up Aaron .
I stood in the backyard , contemplating whether to reverse the toweling off I 'd just had by running through the sprinkler , when Veronica startled me by saying , " Jesus Christ , you 've gotten hairy . "
In the past year or so , my chest went from being covered with peach fuzz to being completely covered with brown curly hair .
" You look like Tom Selleck , " she opined , which was a bit of an exaggeration , but not entirely off - base .
Embarrassed , I did n't know what to say .
" No I do n't , " I nearly pleaded .
Despite having bedded a dozen of my classmates and half again as many recent graduates , I was still a fairly shy boy .
" I 'm just giving you a hard time , " she smiled .
I took a long pull on my Coke , and began romping through the sprinkler , cooling off .
" That looks like a good idea , " Veronica said , and joined me in the path of the sprinkler head .
As I mentioned , she was wearing a white tank top , apparently with no bra , because in about 10 seconds her shirt was soaked completely through , and her hard brown nipples could be clearly seen through the thin material of her shirt .
Time seemed to stand still , and I basically stared at her chest for I do n't know how long .
As I stared , my cock began to grow , until it was tenting out in front of my bathing trunks .
By the time I caught myself staring at Veronica 's chest , it was too late .
I woke from my reverie to find her staring at my crotch .
My cock was sticking so far out that it had actually pulled the elastic waistband of my trunks away from my body , exposing the top of my pubic mound .
We stood there , motionless , standing under the pouring sprinkler head , until she said , " How big is it , " making no pretense about staring at my crotch .
My shyness quickly began to subside , due either to my arousal or the fact that an attractive woman was verily interested in my meat .
" You 'll have to find out for yourself , " I smiled lewdly , and rocked back on one leg , pushing my pelvis slightly closer to her .
She started to say something -- I could see her cheeks turning red -- when we heard the front door open .
I made a dash back to the hottub to give myself some time to cool off , as it were , and Veronica busied herself with moving the sprinkler .
" Mom , your shirt 's completely see - through , " Jimmy complained .
" That 's gross . "
" Shutup , Jimmy ! " Veronica yelled at him .
" You guys go play video games . "
My cock had deflated about halfway , so I got out of the hottub and toweled off while Jimmy setup the Atari .
As I toweled off , I could feel Veronica watching me , but I did n't want to look at her again for fear of getting too hard .
I could feel her eyes boring into my back as I walked inside , waving goodbye .
I just did n't feel up to playing Pitfall anymore .
I went home and masturbated to the thought of Veronica 's breasts in that see - through shirt .
I must have lasted all of 15 seconds before I shot my load in my hand .
One day the next weekend , I rode my bike past Jimmy 's house on my way home from my job at our small town 's liquor store .
Veronica was out front pulling weeds , wearing a yellow bikini top and denim cutoffs .
I stopped .
" How come you 're not at the flea market with the Jims ? " I asked .
Every Sunday for the past few weeks , they 'd been going to the flea market in the next town over , selling stuff that Jim had bought at a police auction .
I was n't sure he'd bought it at all , since Jim was the lieutenant of the town 's police department .
" It 's too boring , " she said .
" Besides , it 's good for Jim & Jimmy to have father and son time . "
The two Jims and a sometimes uneasy relationship , due in large part , I think , to Jimmy 's complete and utter disinterest in the opposite sex .
I started to pedal away , and she stopped me to ask if a ) I 'd come over for dinner that night when the Jims & Aaron got back , and b ) if she could borrow our ice cream maker .
I went home and changed into a pair of shorts and a polo shirt .
I went back with the ice - cream maker , and she let me into the back yard with it .
We stood out there talking as she hosed the machine off and generally prepared it for use .
As she bent over at the waist to thoroughly clean the machine , I had a perfect view of the valley between her breasts .
I stood there mesmerized , until I felt my cock beginning to grow .
I was wearing briefs under my shorts , and I had to adjust them to ease my growing discomfort .
I also did n't really want to embarrass myself , so I stopped looking at those amazing breasts , and I turned away slightly to adjust myself .
She saw me , naturally .
Has there ever been a woman who does n't notice everything ?
" I still want to know how big it is , " she said .
She was standing up now , looking me alternately in the eye & in the crotch .
The bulge in my pants , and my boldness were both growing .
" Well , I told you , you 'll have to find out for yourself . "
" Hmm . " she said , nipples pointing at me like daggers .
" I do n't know about that .
Why do n't you just tell me . "
" There 's no fun in that , " I said , completely hard and completely emboldened .
I walked behind her to get into the house .
" Do you have a ruler , " I asked , dragging my hard cock across her ass as I moved past her .
" I 'm not so sure about this , " she said .
I could see the confusion and indecision on her face .
I moved back in front of her .
I stared her in the eyes as I unbuttoned the top button of my shorts and slid my zipper down , letting my shorts fall to the ground .
" I 'll be upstairs in the guest room . "
Like the week before , my cock was pulling the elastic of my waistband out from my body , exposing the top of my pubic hair , as well as the base of my cock .
" If you want to know how big it is , bring a measuring tape .
Otherwise , just bring me my shorts , " I told her .
And I walked upstairs , leaving her there on the back porch .
I lay on the bed for a full 10 minutes .
After five minutes , my cock began to soften slowly until it dawned on me that Veronica had had a change of heart , and that I would be in big trouble .
I was considering the possibility of a graceful , or at least non-humiliating , exit , when the door opened and Veronica appeared .
She held my shorts in one hand , and her other hand was empty .
Crestfallen , I started to get up .
But rather than throw my shorts at me and order me out , she dropped them to the floor , revealing a seamstress 's measuring tape clutched in her hand .
" I see you 've gone soft on me , " she said .
Somewhat shaken , I said lamely , " Yeah . "
" Maybe this will help , " she said , reaching behind her neck and untying her bikini top .
She tossed the measuring tape onto the bed next to me and slowly let the strings fall to her sides .
Her breasts were still covered by the bikini's cups .
She walked the few steps toward the king size bed I was lying in the middle of and climbed next to me .
The movement caused the patch of fabric covering her right breast to slowly peel down , giving me a glimpse of her glorious brown nipple .
" Aaaahhh , " she yawned , stretching her arms above her head , and arching her back , allowing both cups to fall completely free .
She reached behind her back , arching her chest forward , and released the final strings , and tossed her bikini top the floor .
Her breasts were pure perfection , large and round with not a hint of sag .
They were lighter than the rest of her skin , a dreamy , milky mocha .
Her areolae were brown , and about the size of a fifty cent piece .
This show was more than enough to raise my cock back to its full height .
It was enough , in fact , to moisten its head with pre-cum , which seeped through the thin fabric of my briefs .
" Now it 's your turn , " she said , resting on her heels , " for show and tell . "
I was still mesmerized by the glory of her breasts , and it took me a moment to respond .
" I told you that you have to find out for yourself , " I still stared at her breasts .
" You 're welcome to pull my underwear off . "
She paused for a moment , thinking .
She then leaned forward , and grasped the elastic waistband of my briefs by either side , and pulled .
I raised my ass off the bed to help ease their removal .
The whole time , she stared me in the face , not looking at my crotch .
When she had pulled the underwear over the top of my cock , she dropped them on the floor on top of her bikini top .
I lay there , and she continued to stare me in the eye for a long moment .
Her gaze then traveled down the length of my body , to my penis .
" Is it as big as your husband 's " I asked .
She moved higher on the bed and turned around so see it from my perspective .
" It 's twice as big as his , " she told me , staring at my meat .
She continued to just stare at it for what seemed like several minutes , her reverie broken only by my hand creeping up her side to touch her breast .
" Hey , no touching , " she said .
" I 'm just going to measure you is all . "
" Your breasts are so soft , " I said , kneading her right breast .
" You really do n't mind this , do you ? " I continued to fondle her .
" Where 's the measuring tape , " she said .
It was on the bed on my other side .
As she leaned across me to get it , her nipple dragged through my pubic hair as her breast flattened briefly against me .
She retrieved the measuring tape and straightened .
She angled toward me , so that her knees were against my side .
My cock was pointing about 40 degrees from the vertical , and she was having trouble measuring its length with one hand .
" Will you hold it still for me ? " she asked .
" No , " I told her , " you have to find out for YOURSELF . "
With her left hand , she took one end of the measuring tape and held it in the crook of her hand , where her thumb meets her hand , and tried to wrap her thumb and forefinger around the base of my cock .
The measuring tape unfurled as her right hand pulled it up the length of my cock .
As she did this , I had resumed squeezing her tit and was now rolling her nipple between my moistened thumb and forefinger .
Her breathing quickened as the measuring tape unfurled ; whether due to my ministrations on her breast , or otherwise , I do n't know .
" Jesus Christ , " she whispered , " it 's nine inches . "
Wow , I 'd grown !
She dropped the measuring tape and made a fist around the base of my cock , and slid her hand up its length .
She picked up the measuring tape and repeated her measurement , and this time measured its circumference , both at the base and closer to the circumcised head .
" Six inches around ! ? " she cried .
While she was taking the second set of measurements , I had abandoned her breast to stroke that fabulous Puerto Rican ass , and my hand was now between her legs .
I had been stroking her inner thighs , but now I was rubbing her slit through her cutoffs .
She sat there on her heels staring at my cock while I could feel the wet patch between her legs growing .
I 'm not at all sure she was even aware of my hand between her legs when I got up and stood my knees next to her , my cock pointing lewdly at her navel .
I leaned in to kiss her , but she turned away .
I then reached for her cutoffs and unbuttoned the first three buttons and started to pull them off her hips .
" What are you doing , " she asked , indecision and maybe a little fear in her eyes .
" This is getting out of hand .
I only came up here to measure you . "
" No problem , " I said .
" I just thought you 'd be more comfortable . "
" Sure you did , " she paused , her shorts half - on , half off , with her pubic hair grasping out the top of her shorts .
" Now lay back down while I take another set of measurements .
I want to measure it a third time to make sure I was accurate . "
" OK , " I said .
As I lay back , she surprised me by wiggling out of her cutoffs .
" That is much more comfortable , " she purred .
She proceeded to measure my dick 's length and girth again while I fingered her wet pussy .
I began to alternate between rubbing her clit and sticking a finger inside when she made a fist around my cock again and started sliding it very slowly up and down its length .
" Is this the way you jerk off , " she asked .
" No , " I told her , taking her hand in mine , I showed her how I usually pleasure myself .
She alternated between my way , her way , and running her finger tips up and down the underside of my cock .
Meanwhile , I had two fingers buried in her hole , and was working on slipping a third in .
I sat up and leaned forward and my mouth found her nipple , and I sucked it into my mouth , past my teeth and ran my tongue around it slowly .
All the while , I had the fingers of my left hand between her lips , and her other breast in my right hand .
Her breath quickened , along with the motion of her hand up and down my cock .
She was working my cock at about a mile a minute .
I moved from her right nipple to her left , savoring the heavy feel of her 34DD breasts in my hand and the salty taste of her nipples on my tongue .
At this point , I lifted my mouth to hers , and she kissed me , shoving her tongue past my teeth and into my mouth .
We kissed , her hand pumping my cock , mine working her pussy , and alternately massaging her amazing breasts , for a while until I pushed her onto her back .
She was breathing heavily , her breasts having with each breath , and she opened her legs .
I knelt between them , letting my cock rest on her hairy patch as I sucked her nipples and kissed my way down her torso to her cunt .
With her legs spread wide , I lowered my face to her pussy , drinking in its strong scent .
I traced her outer lips with my tongue , sucking them between my teeth , savoring the tangy juices .
Hearing her moans as encouragement , I then began working on her inner lips , and soon I moved up to her clit , flicking it with my tongue .
She immediately began to convulse , and held my face to her cunt as she came .
I continued eating her cunt , licking and sucking her clit , and pulling my fingers in and out of her hole until she was on the verge of another orgasm .
I stopped and straddled her waist , feeling my balls slide down across her pussy .
I moved up the length of her body until my cock lay in the valley between her breasts .
She squeezed both her breasts together , and I slid my cock back and forth a few times until I could feel my balls begin to tighten .
I stopped thrusting and reached behind me to roll her clit with my fingers as I waited for my impending orgasm to pass .
I did n't want this to end too soon .
I climbed off of her and lay down beside her .
" Will you suck it , " I asked .
She slid down the bed and knelt next to my midsection .
She grasped the base of my cock and held it , staring at it .
She licked her lips , and leaned in toward it , tentatively placing a brief kiss on its head .
" I have n't done this to another man since I 've been married , " she said .
" You 've never done this to a REAL man before , have you ? "
" No , " she said .
To encourage her , I lightly dragged my fingertips up the back of her thigh , between her legs .
She started slowly rocking back and forth as my fingers slid across her labia and up to her clit .
My cock jerked , and she leaned toward it , extending her tongue and encircling my swollen cockhead .
She then slid her tongue up and down the backside of my shaft , from the base to the head several times , coating it with her glistening saliva .
When she reached the tip again , her lips parted slowly as wide as they would go , and I felt the head of my penis slide past her lips , her teeth , and into the warm and wet confines of her mouth .
She could only take about 3 inches in , but she did an amazing job of sucking me off , swirling her tongue about my head as she pistoned my cock in her mouth .
She pulled it out and was pumping my cock for a moment before she started licking the head again .
My stomach tightened , and I started to shout as my furious dick started shooting hot white sperm into her mouth .
She continued pumping my cock and licking excess sperm off of it for a full minute .
I lay there , gasping for a moment , while she lazily pumped my still hard cock .
I propped myself up on my elbows , and she looked at me quizzically , as if to say , " what 's next ? "
" I want your cock inside me " she said .
" You want a real man 's cock inside you , " I corrected her .
" Yes , " she said .
" But you can't come inside me .
I do n't have any condoms . "
I raised myself onto my knees , and she lay down in the center of the bed , legs spread wide , still holding onto my cock .
I pulled away from her , and , grasping her calves , pulled her to the edge of the bed .
I positioned my cockhead at the entrance to her hole and slid it across her lips in a circular motion , and then up and down her slit .
When I reached the top , I could feel her hard clit slip into the slit on my cock .
I slid it back down and put it between her outer lips , just gently touching them .
" You want my nine inch cock , do n't you , " I demanded .
" Yes , " she panted .
I slowly pushed in past her outer lips , and I could feel her stretching to accommodate me .
I was about halfway in , when she cried , " it 's never been this deep before . "
I continued pushing in for another two inches , and slowly pulled out just until my head was at the beginning of her hole .
I pushed back in about seven inches and began slowly pumping back and forth for several minutes , my pace increasing slightly with each stroke until I was going so fast and hard that the bed was starting to slide toward the wall .
With each stroke , she met me with one of her own , and we were both grunting and moaning loudly .
On one of my inward thrusts , she reached behind me , grasping me under my ass with her legs , and pulled me on top of her .
She then pushed me off of her and onto my back .
My cock glistened with the slippery juice covering it .
She straddled my lap , and held my cock with one hand as she lowered herself onto it in one fast , long , fluid motion her pelvis met mine and our pubic hair intermingled , my cock completely filling her .
I could feel my cockhead rubbing against her cervix as she slowly started to rock back and forth , her hands resting on my abdomen .
I leaned forward , and she met me , aiming her beautiful breast at my open mouth .
I sucked on her nipples as she continued to rock back and forth .
I lay back down onto my back , and she came with me , keeping her nipple between my lips .
As she leaned forward , my cock slid out of her stretched cunt hole , and we began to thrust against each other , sliding my dick into and out of her pussy .
Completely covered in sweat , we continued to fuck each other madly , and she sat back up straight and rocked back and forth faster and faster .
I was holding her delicious ass with both hands while she continued to ride my cock .
Her breasts were squeezed together from her hands resting on my pubic hair , and they shook and jiggled with each movement .
I had reached my limit , and could feel my body tensing again with my impending orgasm .
I reached between us , and slid my fingers between our bodies to rub her clit .
Finding it , I massaged for all I was worth , and , remembering her admonition not to come inside her , I said , " you have to get off .
I 'm going to come . "
She just stared me in the eye and continued to rock back and forth furiously as I worked on her clit .
It was n't but a few seconds before I started to come , my cock convulsing and pumping sperm into her body .
She get grinding onto my cock and started to moan louder and louder until she issued an ear shattering scream to the heavens as her pussy clamped down even tighter on my still hard but spend cock .
Her rocking back and forth continued , slowing for a good five minutes , my cum oozing out of her and pooling on my pubis .
She slid off of me and lay next to me , staring and occasionally stroking my slowly deflating cock .
We lay there , silent , for a moment , until she got up and got dressed .
I got up , too , and put on my shorts .
I went to kiss her , but she turned away .
Walking down the hall , she stopped at the top of the stairs and said , " are you still coming to dinner ? "
" Yeah , " I replied .
And I did .
We had dinner and ice cream , the Jims counting their money and talking about the flea market .
Veronica was perfectly normal , behaving just as she always had .
As I was leaving , she stopped me in the doorway .
" I do n't remember how big it is , " she whispered .
" I 'll have to measure it again next week . "

* Quadrangle 's hedge fund blows up , closes .
" Hedge fund Quadrangle Equity Investors is planning to wind down amid weak performance and investor redemptions , in a setback for Steven Rattner 's private investment firm .
The fund is operated by Quadrangle Group LLC , the New York - based firm run by Mr. Rattner , the former deputy chairman of Lazard .
Quadrangle launched the hedge fund in 2006 , managing about $ 500 million at its peak .
Run by Robert Donahue , it invests in publicly traded media and communications stocks and has lost about 25 % year to date . "
* Demolished Citi may boot chairman Win Bisschof , replace with Dick Parsons .
Do n't mean to be rude , but is the chairman really responsible for the $ 546 billion consumer debt bomb in Citi 's hold ?
* CALPERS real - estate holdings smashed .
Leverage seemed like such a good idea at the time :
The nation 's largest public pension fund , known as Calpers , is paying dearly for its ill - fated decision to become one of the most aggressive real - estate investors among public pensions .
The value of Calpers 's investments in land and housing projects across the country had fallen 35 % , to about $ 6 billion , as of June 30 ...
The losses are likely to be larger now because the values were based on appraisals completed at the end of March ...
Calpers says it expects a loss even greater than 100 % for its once high - yielding land and housing investments , thanks to its use of borrowed money on deals .

Politicians searching for historical precedents for the current financial turmoil should start looking a bit further back after an Oxford University historian discovered what he believes is the world 's first credit crunch in 88BC .
The good news is that Philip Kay knows how the Romans got themselves into financial bother .
The bad news is no one knows how they got themselves out of it .
" The essential similarity between what happened 21 centuries ago and what is happening in today 's UK economy is that a massive increase in monetary liquidity culminated with problems in another country causing a credit crisis at home .
In both cases distance and over - optimism obscured the risk , " said Kay , a supernumerary fellow at Wolfson College .
The monetary historian is giving a lecture today in which he will reveal how Cicero , the Roman orator , gave a speech in 66BC in which he alluded to the credit crunch .
Cicero was arguing that Pompey the Great should be given military command against Mithridates VI , king of Pontus on the Black sea coast of what is now Turkey .
He reminded his audience of events in 88BC , when the same Mithridates invaded the Roman province of Asia , on the western coast of Turkey .
Cicero claimed the invasion caused the loss of so much Roman money that credit was destroyed in Rome itself .
The orator told his audience : " Defend the republic from this danger and believe me when I tell you - what you see for yourselves - that this system of monies , which operates at Rome in the Forum , is bound up in , and is linked with , those Asian monies ; the loss of one inevitably undermines the other and causes its collapse . "
Kay said the words were " remarkable " for their contemporary tone .
" Substitute US sub - prime for ' the Asian monies ' and the UK banking system for ' the system of monies which operates in the Roman Forum ' and it could have been written about the current credit crisis , " said Kay .
" In second - century and early first - century BC Rome , increased inflows of bullion combined with an expansion in the availability of credit to produce a massive growth in Rome 's money supply .
This increase in the supply and availability of money in turn resulted both in a major increase in Roman economic activity and , eventually , in the credit crisis which Cicero describes . "
So how did they get themselves out of such a pickle ?
" There 's very little information about what happened over the next 20 years I 'm afraid , " said Kay .
" We just do n't know . "
Certainly historians know that Sulla became dictator of the Roman republic after the credit crunch , but Kay said the two events were unrelated .
Kay , who has a background in investment banking and fund management , will deliver his lecture in Oxford .
The lecture is organised by the Oxford Roman Economy Project .

FAYETTEVILLE , North Carolina ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama won the support of former Republican Secretary of State Colin Powell on Sunday and announced he raised a record $ 150 million last month , dealing a double blow to rival John McCain ’s U.S. presidential campaign .
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell speaks during a taping of " Meet the Press " at NBC in Washington October 19 , 2008 .
Republican John McCain's U.S. presidential campaign suffered a double blow on Sunday when Democratic rival Barack Obama won the support of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and announced he raised a record $ 150 million in September .
REUTERS / Brendan Smialowski/Meet The Press / Handout
McCain , despite trailing in opinion polls and fundraising , said he still expects to win the November 4 election and could sense “ things are heading our way . ”
Powell , who served several Republican presidents including George W. Bush as his first secretary of state , said either candidate would make a good president but he was critical of McCain ’s uncertainty on how to deal with the economic crisis .
Powell , who in the past was mentioned as possibly the first black U.S. president , told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” he backed Obama “ because of his ability to inspire , because of the inclusive nature of his campaign , because he ’s reaching out all across America , because of who he is . ”
“ I think he is a transformational figure , ” Powell said of the man who could become the first black president .
“ His is a new generation coming ... onto the world stage , American stage . ”
Powell ’s backing of Obama , 47 , could give a boost to the foreign policy and national security credentials of the first - term Illinois senator and appeal to moderates and independents .
But the impact of endorsements on voters is questionable and Powell ’s reputation was somewhat tarnished by making the case for invading Iraq to the United Nations on the false claims that it possessed weapons of mass destruction .
In the midst of economic turmoil and with just over two weeks to go until the election , Obama leads in national polls and in many battleground states but McCain said he sees some movement in his direction .
Obama ’s lead over McCain has dropped to 3 points , according to a Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll released on Sunday .
Obama leads McCain 48 to 45 percent among likely U.S. voters , down 1 percentage point from Saturday .
“ We ’re very happy with the way the campaign is going , ” McCain said on the “ Fox News Sunday ” program .
“ I ’ve been on enough campaigns , my friend , to sense enthusiasm and momentum , and we ’ve got it . ”
LOVES THE UNDERDOG ROLE
McCain , 72 , said he did not mind being behind in polls .
“ And I love being the underdog .
You know every time that I ’ve gotten ahead , somehow I ’ve messed it up , ” he said , referring to the times he has been written off as a candidate .
Obama ’s fundraising announcement highlighted his disproportionate ability to spend money and blanket the air waves with advertisements , sometimes by a margin of 4 - to - 1 over McCain .
By bringing in at least $ 150 million in September , Obama more than doubled the $ 66 million he raised in August , which had been a record .
McCain has accepted public financing and is limited to spending $ 84 million for the entire campaign .
Unlike McCain , Obama chose not to accept public funding for his campaign , freeing him to raise millions privately .
The Obama campaign said it had 632,000 new donors in September to bring its total to 3.1 million .
It said the average donation for the month was less than $ 100 .

McCain again chided Obama for not living up to his pledge to accept public funds and warned of the damages of unlimited spending .
“ I ’m saying that history shows us where unlimited amounts of money are in political campaigns , it leads to scandal , ” he said .
When asked whether Obama was buying the election as his campaign spokesman claimed , McCain said , “ I think you could make that argument . ”
McCain was spending the day in Ohio , a state he must win if he is to be president .
No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio and it was the state that put Bush over the top in 2004 .
Obama was also in a battleground state with a heavy military presence , North Carolina , which had been expected to be an easy Republican win but is now in play for Democrats .
At Fayetteville , near Fort Bragg , the home of the 82nd Airborne Division , Obama called Powell “ a great soldier , a great statesman and a great American ” and thanked him for his advice over the years .
“ He reminded us that at this defining moment , we do n’t have the luxury of relying on the same political games , the same political tactics that have been used in so many elections to divide us from one another and make us afraid of one another , ” Obama told the cheering crowd of about 10,000 people .
Powell said he has no plans to campaign for Obama and was not looking for a job in his administration but he left the door open to the possibility .
The drug is the chemical cousin of an extract in red wine French scientists say they have found a drug that tricks the body into burning off fat even when on a high - fat diet .
The University of Louis Pasteur team found the drug protected mice against weight gain and insulin resistance .
The drug SRT1720 - a chemical cousin of red wine extract resveratrol - targets the protein SIRT1 , which is thought to combat ageing , Cell Metabolism reports .
UK obesity experts said new drug treatments were needed but should be used alongside lifestyle changes .
About a quarter of men and a third of women in the UK are overweight , according to government statistics .
A change in diet and an increase in physical exercise can shift excess weight , but can be hard for many to maintain .
With the removal of the anti-obesity pill rimonabant , also known as Acomplia , from the market amid safety concerns , fewer drug options exist .
Potent drug
The French team from the University Louis Pasteur became interested in the SIRT1 protein after earlier studies showing resveratrol countered some effects of a high - calorie diet via SIRT1 .
We do need new treatments for obesity , particularly as there are 1,000 deaths a week in the UK from obesity
Professor Stephen Bloom of Imperial College London
But tests in mice suggested gallons of wine would be necessary for humans to stand a chance of getting the same benefits .
The scientists turned their attention to creating a more potent drug that would specifically target SIRT1 .
They found that a low dose of SRT1720 partially protected mice from gaining weight on a high - fat diet after 10 weeks of treatment .
The drug worked by shifting the metabolism to a fat - burning mode that normally takes over only when energy levels are low .
At higher doses , the drug completely prevented weight gain .
It also improved the rodents ' blood sugar tolerance and insulin sensitivity , which are important for warding off diabetes .
The mice showed no sign of side effects .
However , the scientists say further studies are needed to test the drug 's safety and efficacy before it could be used in humans .
Other scientists are investigating SIRT1 activators similar to SRT1720 developed by Sirtris Pharmaceuticals .
Professor Stephen Bloom , who has been researching obesity at Imperial College London , said : " This sounds interesting but is terribly early .
" We do need new treatments for obesity , particularly as there are 1,000 deaths a week in the UK from obesity . "
Prof Ian Broom , of the Centre for Obesity Research and Epidemiology at The Robert Gordon University , said : " Research in this area is to be welcomed as an additional route of combating the obesity epidemic and associated comorbid disease . "
He added that any such drug should be used alongside dietary and lifestyle changes to tackle obesity .

MIT students will take to the operating table next Monday , Nov. 24 , to show off their robotic engineering skills in the final presentations for Course 2.12 ( Introduction to Robotics ) .
Four teams of students have spent the past seven weeks building robotic arms and writing software that will allow them to remotely make an incision in a silicone " organ " and remove a jelly bean masquerading as a tumor .
The final presentation will be held at 3 p.m. Monday in Room 1-005 and is open to the public .
Surgery is a rapidly growing sector of robotics business , says Professor of Mechanical Engineering Harry Asada , who teaches the course .
" Augmenting a surgeon 's skills and expertise with superb precision and dexterity of robotic devices , we can expect highly reliable , minimally invasive surgical operations , " he says .
" However , there are many technical challenges to make the system truly useful . "
The course emphasis is on learning to design a robot that can perform a specific task and operate within a confined space , says Harrison Chin , laboratory instructor for the class .
Past years ' course assignments include building search and rescue robots , and building robots for automated inspection of Big Dig tunnels .
" We try to motivate it with a real world problem , " says Lael Odhner , one of the laboratory TAs for the class and a graduate student in mechanical engineering .

The Latter - day Saints , also known as Mormons , believe that America was first peopled by a lost tribe of Israelites and then visited by Jesus .
Now they have shrugged off their polygamous past and represent the country 's fastest growing religion with more than 4 million members .
Their church is bigger than some of the " mainstream " Protestant denominations including the Presbyterians and Episcopalians .
In President Bush 's America , the Mormons are the mainstream and nearly 90 % of them voted to re-elect him .
When Frank Pignanelli , a Salt Lake City Democrat , wrote a newspaper column before the election endorsing the Massachusetts Democrat senator John Kerry , his email intray filled with fire and brimstone .
" You Democrats are the tools of Satan and are corrupting our families and children , " he was told in one email .
When Mr Bush delivers his second inaugural address tomorrow , it could have no more receptive audience than Utahns .
And yet even here , in the very heart of the heartland , there is unease mingled with the excitement at the thought of another four years of Mr Bush 's administration .
Asked about their decision to re-elect the president , a lot of Utah Mormons , like Christian conservatives in general , will say they knew in their gut he was a man of God , on whom they could rely .
But when it comes to policies many of them are queasy .
" I voted for Bush .
I thought Kerry was dishonest .
He was evil almost , " said Julie Smith , out shopping in the prosperous and devout suburb of Bountiful , just outside Salt Lake City .
" I like Bush because he 's a good man and I think he 's got wonderful ideas , but I do n't think it 's worked out the way he thought it would . "
Ms Smith , a retired teacher , has particular distaste for the president 's flagship education policy , but she is also unnerved by the downward spiral of events in Iraq particularly as it affects the local boys from the Utah national guard .
" I like the idealism but I do n't like what 's happening .
But at least he 'll try , " she said hopefully of the president 's second term .
As he takes the lectern on the steps of the Capitol , Mr Bush will be facing a sceptical nation .
His popularity has not enjoyed the victor 's customary post- election bounce ; his ratings have stagnated at around 50 % .
No two - term president since the second war has approached his second inauguration with less backing .
And history is not on his side .
No president since Lincoln has delivered a memorable second inaugural address .
Such speeches tend towards the overlong and dull , resembling policy shopping lists with little of the euphoric energy seen first time round .
Mr Bush is expected to tell Americans how he plans to extricate the US from Iraq while continuing to cut taxes at home and reform the country 's huge pension system .
But , more than any second - term president before him , he is expected to inspire an unsettled nation .
" America needs to hear that it 's going to be OK .
George Bush needs to portray a certain sense of confidence in our country 's future , both economic and with respect to security , " said Beck Mayberry , a 40 - year - old energy trader who lives in the district of Centerville , at the foot of the Wasatch mountains .
Mr Mayberry is a lifelong Mormon and calls himself a " libertarian " .
He moved to Utah from Arizona five years ago and found the best of both worlds - a good income from his job selling options on oil and gas , and a peaceful place to raise five children amid the breathtaking beauty of the American west .
He spends much of his free time riding his horse , Ninja , " into the mountains and as far as the eye can see " .
He attributes at least some of his outlook on life to the fact that he was born on the old frontier .
" There 's a certain free spirit to the people in the west , " he said brushing Ninja 's sweat - matted coat .
" The less government the better .
I just need a government that will defend my freedom and my rights .
The mandate for President Bush is more of the same - constant vigilance against the people who attacked us .
He stood up and fought them . "
Like Ms Smith , Mr Mayberry likes the fact that " he professes his faith openly " .
He says he appreciates the Bush tax cuts , which he says give the people rather than the government the final say on how individuals ' hard - earned money is spent .
He is enthusiastic about the partial privatisation of the US federal pension scheme , which is likely to be a centrepiece in the inaugural address and in the second term agenda .
But as Mr Mayberry talks about the future , it is clear that his enthusiasm is tinged with worry .
The tax cuts and pension reform will cost trillions of dollars and the Bush administration has already run up a record deficit .
For Mr Mayberry , and for a majority of Americans , fixing the deficit should come first .
" I understand international economics just enough for it to scare the hell out of me , " he said .
" My priority right now is eliminate the deficit before eliminate tax .
Before the compounding effect gets us all . "
He also admits that he was unnerved by the US failure to find any of the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , despite the confident assurances of the administration .
" That was disturbing .
I expect integrity on that level .
Either our administration lied to us , or someone lied to them , " he said .
He is prepared to give Mr Bush the benefit of the doubt , but it bothers him that the president has shown so little concern over the deficit and the shaky justification for going to war .
Mr Bush told the Washington Post this week that he thought the election represented a national endorsement of his Iraq policy and felt there was no need for anyone in the administration who promoted the invasion to be held accountable .
Tomorrow Mr Mayberry would like to hear a little less certainty and a little more readiness to listen .
" It 's both a blessing and a curse that Bush has such conviction and willpower .
He 's almost arrogant with this position of his - ' I 've made a decision and I 'm going to stick with it ' .
George Bush needs to be a little bit more humble and a little bit more aware . "
For those of you who worry that comments are n’t worth the trouble and that meaningful dialogues are a spectre of wishful thinking , I entreat you to take note of this blog post .
This one ’s not about the whole “ To shut off comments or not to ” discussions – rather , it ’s an example of how two bloggers keep conversations going .
All that said , Andre and I have had several comments and posts back and forth over the last few months regarding some of the tenets of GTD and why some of us tweak or abandon the system .
In his post Using Context to Simplify List Management that ’s partially motivated by a comment I left on his post When to Do Low - Priority Tasks , Andre brilliantly canvasses some possible problems people have with understanding and applying GTD principles and how to amend these problems .
Here ’s the salient part of his intro :
Context lists are popular within GTD , but some users are like Charlie : having multiple lists like @ Computer , @ Home , @Errands , @Calls and @ Office seems to create more work than it saves .
I ’ve always found that position curious , since context lists were one of the first things I latched onto when reading Getting Things Done .
It made logical and intuitive sense that looking at a list of 13 next actions is easier than looking at a list of 130 .
Now ’s probably not the best time for me to respond , as I ’ve been having trouble writing this afternoon .
But I ’m so interested in the dialogue that I ’ll put concerns of incoherence aside .
Caveat Emptor !
Have I Really Abandoned GTD ?
I need to articulate and think about my position a bit better , as it may turn out that I ’ve ingrained GTD - ish principles that make @context lists redundant .
For example , I basically have five different domains in which I live : my Guard job , my University job , finishing my dissertation , blogging at Productive Flourishing , and consulting via Productive Flourishing .
Let ’s set aside any discussion of how ridiculous it is to be attempting so many discrete activities .
Sidebar : I ’ve been working on quick words that capture what level I ’m thinking about .
Domains are above metaprojects , which are above projects , which are above tasks .
This roughly corresponds with the altitude metaphor in GTD .
My university responsibilities all happen in the context of my office at work , and actions / projects / etc. are all recorded in a notebook that remains at work .
I ’ve kept vestiges of my Notebook Based Productivity system despite becoming more digital via my home server and iPhone .
Given that I ’ve internalized writing good ToDo lists and that I keep them pretty short , I do n’t have monolothic ToDo lists in the context of my office .
Likewise , my Guard actions normally happen in particular contexts and are contained in their own notebook .
Again , given that I keep things moving along pretty well , the daunting ToDo list never appears .
The last three domains are more energy - dependent than location - dependent , and my versatile way of tracking them while keeping them compartmentalized makes it such that ( again ) I can see the items I need to do without worrying about large ToDo lists .
That ’s a quick summary of my current productivity system .
I ’ll save what little bit of the finite amount of detail that most of us can stand for the next section .
Getting Things Done , or Getting Metaproductivity Done ?
What I learned from trying to use a GTD system in its native form was that I would get overwhelmed by either how much I was trying to do or how much managing I was doing to get it drilled down to what I actually felt like doing .
For instance , my more pure GTD system looked like this :
Domain : Guard
Projects : Project 1 , Project 2 , Project 3…etc .
Project 1 Tasks : NA , Task 1 , Task 2 , Task 3
Task Context : @calls , @email , @milnet , @armory , @computer
Domain : Dissertation
Projects : Project 1 , Project 2 , Project 3…etc .
Project 1 Tasks : NA , Task 1 , Task 2 , Task 3 …
Task Context : @computer , @library , @ Mark , @department , @email
It goes on like this , but with the three other domains .
The problem occurred when I looked at my context lists – let ’s take the @email context , for example .
That list may have :
Email Mark about problem with Chapter 1 , Section 4 .
Email Readiness NCO about Project X
Email Scott with Birthday wishes
Email Andre about ideas for Tools For Thought
Email Rebecca to follow - up re : Project Y
The rub is that the mindframe I need to be in to do these different tasks is substantially different .
A good bit of this is the different lingos and memes that are at play : explaining the same problem to Mark ( my dissertation advisor ) and my battalion commander requires completely different techniques .
It made more sense for me to then recategorize my clean @email list to be sorted by what domain it fell within .
Alternatively , I could have had another context as @email - mil , @email - diss , @email - blog , but then the sheer number of context lists became unwieldy .
In the end , it made more sense for me to think about what domain I felt like dealing with , then sorting through the projects associated with that domain .
It should be relatively clear that the pure - GTD “ context ” was n’t driving the train for me – something closer to “ energy ” was .
To remain productive under the GTD - model , I found myself spending so much time categorizing tasks by the domain that I spent a lot of time monkeying around with lists .
It felt good to get everything in the right place , but getting them in the right place was not getting them done .
It was metaproductivity .
I accidentally fell into using multiple notebooks simply because the Guard started me with their issued notebooks and I wanted to keep my personal stuff somewhere else but in a similar form .
It worked for me because I spent less time on metaproductivity and more time getting things done .
Keeping the Good Parts , Getting Rid of the Rest
GTD is dead - on about keeping similar things together .
It so happens that the primary sorting categories for me are not based on pure - GTD “ context , ” but rather on the type of domain ( and thus , energy ) the stuff falls into .
The way I think about and sort my stuff into different notebooks naturally sorts things in the right way for me , and the “ OMG ! ” that comes from having huge lists faded away because the lists are n’t huge .
They ’re scattered and compartmentalized – true – but they ’re kept in a way that actually keeps me on the doing task rather than the meta - doing task .
What I ’m thinking but am having a hard time articulating into thoughts that other sentient beings would find coherent is that the execution of GTD - principles is different for creative types than it is for the more corporate - types for which it was developed .
Once one substantially modifies the execution bit of GTD , it looks less like the system as popularized .
It may not warrant being called GTD anymore , but I ’m not sure how much hinges on it being called “ GTD . ”
For the many domains I ’m trying to manage , it ’s easier for me to manage compartmentalized lists based on the type of mindframe I need to be in or energy I have to do them .
So rather than asking the question of whether it ’s easier to look at a list of 13 next actions rather than 130 , I ask whether it ’s easier to look at lists presorted by how ( mentally )
I need to get them done rather than a combined list specified by the location or technique I need to do to get them done .
Furthermore , let ’s not just ask about the list itself – let ’s also ask about the maintenance and presentation of the list , as well .
I should note that this is n’t a bulletproof system .
Things fall through the cracks and get put in the wrong place .
But given that I usually remember where I put the item since I only have a few dumping grounds , it really has n’t been any more onerous than things not making it to the pure - GTD inbox .
Hopefully , this explains my aversion to ( GTD ) context - type thinking .
As always , I really appreciate Andre providing such thoughtful content and pressing such great questions .
His insights , questions , and participation here and in the blogosphere weigh heavily into why I keep at the blogging thing .
( Andre : if you have any posts you ’d like me to add to the list below from T4T , just let me know . )

Self - reference factors into some paradoxes , such as the widely known liar paradox and Russell 's paradox .
The set theoretical understanding of functions also discourages the idea of self - application .
Thus it is remarkable that pure untyped CL does not exclude the self - application of functions .
Moreover , its mathematical models showed that a theory in which functions can become their own arguments is completely sensible , in addition to being consistent ( what was established earlier using proof theoretic methods ) .
CL is connected to nonclassical logics via typing .
First , a correspondence between formulas that are provable in the implicational fragment of intuitionistic logic and the typable combinatory terms was discovered .
Then the isomorphism was generalized to other combinatory bases and implicational logics ( such as the logic of relevant implication , exponential - free linear logic , affine logic , etc. ) .
CL is an archetypical term rewriting system ( TRS ) .
These systems comprise a wide range of formal calculi from syntactic specifications of programming languages and context - free grammars to Markov algorithms ; even some number theoretic problems may be viewed as special instances of questions about TRSs .
Several notions and proof techniques that were originally invented for CL , later turned out to be useful in applications to less well - understood TRSs .
Substitution is a crucial operation not only in first - order logics , but also in higher - order logics , as well as in other formal systems that contain a variable binding operator , such as the \( \lambda\ ) - calculi and the \( \varepsilon\ ) - calculus .
Indeed , carrying out substitution correctly is particularly pressing in \ ( \lambda\ ) - calculi and in the closely related functional programming languages .
CL can emulate \( \lambda\ ) - abstraction despite the fact that CL has no variable binding operators .
This makes CL a suitable target language for functional programming languages to be compiled into .
CL was originally invented as a continuation of the reduction of the set of logical constants to a singleton set in classical first - order logic ( FOL ) .
CL untangles the problem of substitution , because formulas can be prepared for the elimination of bound variables by inserting combinators .
Philosophically speaking , an expression that has no bound variables represents the logical form of the original formula .
Sometimes , bound variables are thought to signify “ ontological commitments . ”
Another philosophical rôle of CL is to show the variability of the ontological assumptions a theory has .
Combinatory logic ( henceforth : CL ) is an elegant and powerful logical theory that is connected to many areas of logic , and has found applications in other disciplines , especially , in computer science and mathematics .
1. Schönfinkel 's elimination of bound variables
1.1 The problem of substitution
Classical first - order logic includes quantifiers that are denoted by \( \forall\ ) ( “ for all ” ) and \( \exists \ ) ( “ there is a ” ) .
A simple sentence such as “ All birds are animals ” may be formalized as \( \forall x( Bx\supset Ax ) \ ) , where \( x\ ) is a variable , \ ( B\ ) and \ ( A\ ) are one - place predicates , and \( \supset\ ) is a symbol for ( material ) implication .
The occurrences of the variables in the closed formula \( \forall x( Bx\supset Ax ) \ ) are bound , whereas those in the open formula \( Bx\supset Ax\ ) are free .
If we assume that \( t\ ) ( for “ Tweety ” ) is a name constant , then an instance of the above sentence is \( Bt\supset At\ ) , that may be read as “ Tweety is an animal , provided Tweety is a bird . ”
This illustrates that the instantiation of a ( universal ) quantifier involves substitution .
Due to the simplicity of the example , the substitution of \ ( t\ ) for \ ( x\ ) in \ ( Bx\ ) and in \ ( Ax\ ) seems to be easy to understand and to perform .
However , a definition of substitution for FOL ( and in general , for an abstract syntax , that is , for a language with a variable binding operator ) has to guarantee that no free occurrence of a variable in the substituted expression becomes bound in the resulting expression .
To see what can go wrong , let us consider the ( open ) formula \( \forall x( Rxy\land Rxr ) \ ) , where \ ( R\ ) is a two - place predicate , \ ( r\ ) is a name constant abbreviating “ Russell ” and \( \land\ ) is conjunction .
\( \forall x( Rxy\land Rxr ) \ ) contains a free occurrence of \ ( y\ ) ( that is , \( y\ ) is a free variable of the formula ) , however , \ ( y\ ) is not free for a substitution of a term that contains a free occurrence of \ ( x\ ) , for instance , \ ( x\ ) itself .
More formally , the occurrence of \ ( y\ ) in the second argument place of \ ( R\ ) in \( \forall x( Rxy\land Rxr ) \ ) is not bound by a quantifier ( the only quantifier ) of the formula , whereas \( \forall x( Rxx\land Rxr ) \ ) is a closed formula , that is , it contains no free occurrences of variables .
Informally , the following natural language sentences could be thought of as interpretations of the previous formulas .
“ Everybody reads him and Russell , ” ( where ‘ him ’ is deictic , or perhaps , anaphoric ) and “ Everybody reads himself and Russell . ”
Obviously , the meanings of the two sentences are vastly different , even if we assume that everybody pens something .
As a contrast , \( \forall x( Rxw\land Rxr ) \ ) exhibits an unproblematic substitution of the name constant \ ( w\ ) for the free occurrence of \ ( y\ ) .
( The latter formula , perhaps , formalizes the sentence “ Everybody reads Ludwig Wittgenstein and Russell . ” )
These examples are meant to demonstrate the more complex part of the problem Moses Schönfinkel set out to solve , and for what he invented CL . [ 1 ]
1.2
The operators “ nextand ” and “ \( U\ ) ”
A well - known result about classical sentential logic ( SL ) is that all truth - functions can be expressed in terms of \ ( \lnot\ ) and \( \land\ ) ( or of \( \lnot\ ) and \ ( \lor\ ) , etc. ) .
A minimal sufficient set of connectives , however , can contain just one connective such as \ ( \mid\ ) ( “ nand , ” which is often called , Sheffer 's stroke ) , or \( \downarrow\ ) ( “ nor , ” which is Peirce 's joint denial ) .
“ Nand ” is “ not - and , ” in other words , \( A\mid B\ ) is defined as \ ( \lnot ( A\land B ) \ ) , where \ ( A\ ) , \ ( B\ ) range over formulas and \ ( \lnot\ ) is negation .
Going into the other direction , if \( \mid\ ) is a primitive , then \( \lnot A\ ) is definable as \ ( A\mid A\ ) , and \( A\land B\ ) is \ (( A\mid B ) \mid( A\mid B ) \ ) .
Although formulas with numerous vertical lines may quickly become visually confusing and hard to parse , it is straightforward to prove that \ ( \mid\ ) alone is sufficiently expressive to define all the truth - functions .
Schönfinkel 's aim was to minimize the number of logical constants that are required for a formalization of FOL , just as Henry M. Sheffer ( indeed , already Charles S. Peirce ) did for classical propositional logic .
One of the two quantifiers mentioned above suffices and the other may be assumed to be defined .
Let us say , \( \exists x A\ ) is an abbreviation for \( \lnot \forall x\lnot A\ ) .
Even if \( \lnot\ ) and the rest of the connectives are traded in for \( \mid\ ) , two logical constants remain : \ ( \forall\ ) and \( \mid\ ) .
A further pressing issue is that quantifiers may be nested ( i.e. , the scope of a quantifier may fully contain the scope of another quantifier ) , and the variable bindings ( that could be visualized by drawing lines between quantifiers and the variables they bind ) may get quite intertwined .
Keeping for a moment the familiar logical constants , we may look at the following formula that hints at the emerging difficulties — when the question to be tackled is considered in its full generality . [ 2 ]
\ [ \forall x( \exists y( Py\land Bxy ) \supset\exists y( Py\land Bxy\land \ forall z(( Rz\land Ozy ) \supset \ lnot Cz ) ) ) \]
\ ( \forall x\ ) binds all occurrences of \ ( x\ ) ; the variables in the second argument place of the two \ ( B\ ) s are bound by one of the two \( \exists y\ )s , the latter of which interacts with \ ( \forall z\ ) via \ ( Ozy\ ) .
Predicates have a fixed finite arity in FOL , and nothing precludes binding at once a variable in the first argument of one predicate and in the second argument of another predicate .
( Indeed , FOL would lose some of its expressiveness , if bindings of this sort would be excluded without some means to compensate for them . )
These difficulties persist when a formula is transformed into a (n equivalent ) formula in prenex normal form .
As long as the variable bindings can interweave and braid into arbitrarily complex patterns , there seems to be no way to eliminate bound variables .
( Note that free variables in open formulas — in a sense — behave like local name constants , and their elimination is neither intended , nor achieved in the procedures described here . )
Schönfinkel 's ingenuity was that he introduced combinators to untangle variable bindings .
The combinators \( \textsf { S}\ ) , \( \textsf { K}\ ) , \( \textsf { I}\ ) , \( \textsf { B}\ ) and \( \textsf {C}\ ) ( in contemporary notation ) are his , and he established that \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) suffice to define all the other combinators .
In effect , he also defined an algorithm to carry out the elimination of bound variables , which is essentially one of the algorithms used nowadays to define bracket abstraction in CL . [ 3 ]
Schönfinkel introduced a new logical constant \ ( U\ ) , that expresses the disjointness of two classes .
For instance , \( UPQ\ ) may be written in usual FOL notation as \( \lnot\exists x( Px\land Qx ) \ ) , when \ ( P\ ) and \ ( Q\ ) are one - place predicates .
( The formula may be thought to formalize , for instance , the natural language sentence “ No parrots are quiet . ” )
In the process of the elimination of the bound variables , \( UXY \ ) is obtained from an expression that contains ‘ \ ( Xx\ ) ’ and ‘ \ ( Yx\ ) ’ , where \( x\ ) does not occur in \ ( X\ ) or \( Y\ ) .
For example , if \ ( X\ ) and \ ( Y\ ) happen to be \( n\ ) - ary predicates with \ ( n\ge2 \ ) , then \( x\ ) occurs only in their last argument places .
“ Nobody reads Aristotle and Plato ” can be formalized as \( \lnot\exists x( Rxa\land Rxp ) \ ) , where \( a\ ) and \ ( p\ ) are name constants that stand for “ Aristotle ” and “ Plato , ” respectively .
This formula can not be written as \ ( U( Ra ) ( Rp ) \ ) .
On the other hand , “ There is nobody whom both Russell and Wittgenstein read , ” that is , \( \lnot\exists x( Rrx\land Rwx ) \ ) turns into \ ( U( Rr ) ( Rw ) \ ) , where the parentheses delineate the arguments of \ ( U\ ) .
Often , the expressions \ ( X\ ) and \( Y\ ) ( in \( UXY \ ) ) consist of predicates ( and name constants ) together with combinators and other \ ( U\ ) s .
It is useful to have a notation for “ nextand ” ( i.e. , “ not-exists - and ” ) without assuming either that \ ( x\ ) has a free occurrence in the expressions joined , or that if it has one , then it is the last component of the expressions .
Following Schönfinkel , we use \( \mid^x\ ) for the “ nextand ” operator that binds \ ( x\ ) .
( The notation \( \mid^ - \ ) , where \( ^ - \ ) is the place for a variable , closely resembles the Sheffer stroke . )
Schönfinkel achieved his goal of the reduction of the set of logical constants for FOL to a singleton set \( \{\mid^ - \}\ ) , because every formula of FOL is equivalent to a formula that contains only “ nextand . ”
A formula \( \forall x A\ ) is usually defined to be well - formed in FOL even if \ ( A\ ) has no free occurrences of \ ( x\ ) .
Then , of course , \( \forall x A\ ) is equivalent to \ ( A\ ) as well as to \( \exists x A\ ) , and such quantifiers are called vacuous .
In order to show that any formula can be rewritten into an equivalent formula that contains only “ nextand , ” it is sufficient to inspect the following definitions for \ ( \lnot\ ) , \( \lor\ ) and \( \forall\ ) ( with suitable variables ) — that are due to Schönfinkel .
\ [ \begin{align * } \lnot A & \ Leftrightarrow_\textrm{df} A\mid^x A \\ A\lor B & \ Leftrightarrow_\textrm{df} ( A\mid^yA ) \mid^x ( B\mid^yB ) \\ \ forall xAx & \Leftrightarrow_\textrm{df} ( Ax\mid^y Ax ) \mid^x ( Ax\mid^yAx ) \end{align *}\ ]
The definition for \ ( \lnot\ ) , for instance , may be justified by the following equivalences .
\( A\Leftrightarrow A\land A\ ) , \( A\land A\Leftrightarrow \exists x( A\land A ) \ ) ( assuming that \( x\ ) is not free in \ ( A\ ) ) , hence by replacement , \( \lnot A\Leftrightarrow \lnot\exists x( A\land A ) \ ) .
Now we give a concrete example to illustrate how to turn a formula of FOL into one that contains only \ ( \mid^ - \ ) , and then how to eliminate the bound variables using \ ( U\ ) and combinators .
To put some excitement into the process , we start with the sentence in ( # 1 ) .
( #1 ) For every natural number there is a greater prime .
A straightforward formalization of this sentence — on the foreground of the domain of numbers — is the formula in ( # 2 ) , ( where ‘ \ ( Nx\ ) ’ stands for “ \( x\ ) is a natural number , ” ‘ \( Px\ ) ’ stands for “ \( x\ ) is a prime ” and ‘ \ ( Gxy\ ) ’ is to be read as “ \( x\ ) is greater that \( y \ ) ” ) .
( #2 ) \( \forall y\exists x( Ny\supset ( Px\land Gxy ) ) \ )
This formula is equivalent to \( \forall y( Ny\supset\exists x( Px\land Gxy ) ) \ ) and further to \( \lnot\exists y\lnot ( Ny\supset\exists x( Px\land Gxy ) ) \ ) .
In one or two more steps , we get \( Ny\mid^y ( Px\mid^xGxy ) \ ) .
( Expressions are considered to be grouped to the left unless parentheses indicate otherwise .
E.g. , \ ( Gxy\ ) is \ ( ( ( Gx ) y ) \ ) not \ ( G( xy ) \ ) as could have been , perhaps , expected based on the most common way of arranging parentheses in FOL formulas . )
Unfortunately , neither \( \mid^x\ ) nor \( \mid^y\ ) can be replaced by \ ( U\ ) in the last expression .
However , if the arguments of \ ( G\ ) were permuted then the former reduction could be carried out .
One of the combinators , \( \textsf { C}\ ) does exactly what is needed : \ ( Gxy\ ) can be changed to \( \textsf{ C}Gyx\ ) ( see the definition of combinators in section 2.1 ) .
That is , we have \( Ny\mid^y ( Px\mid^x\textsf{ C}Gyx ) \ ) , and then \( Ny\mid^yUP ( \textsf{C}Gy ) \ ) . [ 4 ]
The expression may give the impression that \ ( y\ ) is the last component of \( UP ( \textsf{C}Gy ) \ ) , which is the second argument of \( \mid^y \ ) , but it is not so .
The grouping within expressions cannot be disregarded , and another combinator , \( \textsf { B}\ ) is needed to turn \( UP ( \textsf{ C}Gy ) \ ) into the desired form \( \textsf { B}( UP ) ( \textsf{C}G ) y\ ) .
From \( Ny\mid^y\textsf{B}(UP ) ( \textsf{C}G ) y\ ) , we get \( UN ( \textsf { B} ( UP ) ( \textsf {C}G ) ) \ ) in one more step .
This expression is completely free of variables , and it also makes the renaming of bound variables in FOL easily comprehensible : given two sequences of ( distinct ) variables that are different in their first two elements , the reversal of the above process yields formulas that are ( logically equivalent ) alphabetic variants of the formula in ( # 2 ) .
The expression \( UN ( \textsf { B}(UP ) ( \textsf{C}G ) ) \ ) may look “ unfamiliar ” when compared to formulas of FOL , but notation — to a large extent — is a matter of convention .
It may be interesting to note that the first \ ( U\ ) is simply followed by its two arguments , however , the second \ ( U\ ) is not .
\( \textsf { B} ( UP ) \ ) is a subexpression , but \( UP ( \textsf{C}G ) \ ) is not a subexpressions of \( UN ( \textsf { B}(UP ) ( \textsf{C}G ) ) \ ) .
Furthermore , the whole expression can be transformed into \ ( XNPG\ ) using combinators , where \ ( X\ ) is composed of \ ( U\ ) s and combinators only .
Such an \ ( X\ ) concisely encodes the logical form or logical content of the formula with the predicates being arguments . [ 5 ]
The expressions obtained via the transformations outlined above quickly become lengthy — as trying to rewrite a simple FOL sentence such as \( \exists x( Px\land Qx ) \ ) can show . [ 6 ]
However , this does not diminish the importance of Schönfinkel 's theoretical results .
A slight increase ( if any ) in the length of the expressions is not even an inconvenience , let alone an impediment in the era of computers with petabytes ( or even exa - and zettabytes ) of memory .
It seems unfortunate that Schönfinkel 's reduction procedure for FOL is not widely known .
As a measure of how widely Sheffer 's and Schönfinkel 's reductions are known , we appeal to the fact that the first is part of standard intro courses in logic , whereas the second is not .
Undoubtedly , one of the reasons for this is that Schönfinkel 's process to eliminate bound variables is conceptually more opulent than defining a few truth functions from \ ( \mid\ ) ( or \( \downarrow\ ) ) .
Another reason may be that Schönfinkel , perhaps , did not place a sufficiently strong emphasis on the intermediate step that allows the elimination of all other logical connectives and quantifiers via “ nextand . ”
The importance of this step was also overlooked in the introduction to the English translation of Schönfinkel 's paper , which was written more than 30 years after the original publication .
We may also note that although “ nextand ” is an operator in the standard logical sense , it is binary — unlike \( \forall\ ) and \( \exists \ ) , which are unary .
If \( A\mid B \ Leftrightarrow_\textrm{df} \lnot( A\land B ) \ ) is added as a definition to SL , then the result is a conservative extension , and it becomes provable that for any formula \ ( A ( p_0 , \ldots , p_n ) \ ) ( i.e. , for a formula containing the displayed propositional variables and some connectives ) there is a formula \ ( B ( p_0 , \ldots , p_n ) \ ) containing only the connective \( \mid\ ) , and \( B ( p_0 , \ldots , p_n ) \Leftrightarrow A ( p_0 , \ldots , p_n ) \ ) itself is provable .
\ ( \mid\ ) is , of course , interpreted as the “ nand ” truth function .
“ Nand ” as a binary connective or as a binary truth function is of the same sort of object as conjunction , disjunction , etc .
The first stage in Schönfinkel 's extension of FOL is analogous .
The addition of \ ( \mid^ -\ ) is ( also ) a conservative extension of FOL , and every occurrence of \ ( \mid^ - \ ) can be eliminated .
( We noted that \( \mid^ - \ ) is a binary operator , and so it may be thought to combine a quantifier ( \( \exists \ ) ) with connectives ( \( \lnot\ ) , \( \land\ ) ) , but \( \mid^ - \ ) of course , does not introduce any objects that are not definable in FOL . )
The second stage in Schönfinkel 's extension of FOL is slightly different .
\( UXY\ ) is definable in FOL only for one - place predicates \ ( P\ ) and \ ( Q\ ) ( or for predicates of higher arity when the variable in their last argument is bound ) .
Thus , in general , neither \ ( U\ ) nor the combinators are definable in FOL .
The elimination of bound variables goes beyond the resources of FOL .
The combinators are not only undefinable , but they are new kinds of objects — which are absent from FOL itself .
Also , the intermediate steps of the bound variable elimination procedure presuppose that functions of several arguments can be viewed as functions in one variable , and the other way around . [ 7 ]
Enriching a presentation of FOL with predicate letters that have sufficiently many arguments in the right order would be more or less unproblematic , and it would add objects to the language that would have the same sort of interpretation as other predicates .
A potential problem though is that for each predicate , infinitely many ( \( \aleph_0\ ) many ) new predicates would be needed — together with axioms stipulating the intended equivalences between the meanings of the variants of the predicates .
Notationally , these steps amount to padding predicate symbols with extra arguments , omitting some arguments , as well as permuting and regrouping the arguments .
Although some of these additions may look superfluous or too fussy , for the understanding of Schönfinkel 's procedure to eliminate bound variables , it is crucial to note that formulas are viewed as structured strings of symbols . [ 8 ]
In conclusion to this section , it is important to emphasize that there are no questions of consistency with respect to the above reduction process , because it can be viewed — or described in contemporary terms — as a well - defined algorithm .
It is a completely different issue that if we consider the language of FOL expanded with combinators , then the resulting system is inconsistent , because CL is powerful enough to define the fixed point of any function .
The effect of having fixed points for all functions — including truth functions — may be thought to amount to adding certain biconditionals ( which may or may not be valid ) as axioms .
( For instance , Russell 's paradox emerges from the fixed point of the negation connective . )
Notably , both FOL and ( pure ) CL are consistent .
1.3 Alternative approaches : basic logic and predicate functors
In this section we briefly outline two ideas that are related to Schönfinkel 's work or are motivated by his use of combinators in the elimination of bound variables .
Fitch 's metalogic
From the late 1930s , Frederic Fitch worked on a logic that he called basic logic .
The label is motivated by his aim to provide a framework in which any logic could be formalized .
Fitch 's approach is utterly syntactic ( much like Schönfinkel's ) , and “ formalization ” is to be understood as encoding a formally described system in another — not unlike the arithmetization of the syntax in Gödel 's incompleteness theorem .
In 1942 , Fitch introduced a logic that he labeled \ ( K\ ) .
The expressions in \ ( K\ ) are formed like combinatory terms by a binary application operation , which is not assumed to be associative .
( See the definition of combinatory terms in the next section . )
However , the constants of \ ( K\ ) do not coincide with the constants of pure CL .
Fitch uses 10 constants : \( \varepsilon\ ) , \( o\ ) , \( \acute{\varepsilon}\ ) , \( \acute{o}\ ) , \( W\ ) , \( =\ ) , \( \land\ ) , \( \lor\ ) , \( E\ ) and \(*\ ) .
The first five constants are combinators , though the notation may suggest a different ( informal ) meaning .
‘\ ( =\ ) ’ is the syntactical identity of expressions .
‘\ ( \land\ ) ’ and ‘ \( \lor\ ) ’ are intended to stand for “ and ” and “ or . ” ‘ \ ( E\ ) ’ is the analogue of Schönfinkel 's \ ( U\ ) , but it corresponds to a non-vacuous existential quantifier .
Finally , ‘\ ( *\ ) ’ is similar to the transitive closure operator for binary relations or the Kleene star .
Notably , there is no negation or universal quantifier in the system .
The uses of the constants are characterized as follows — somewhat like axioms characterize combinators .
\( =ab\ ) if and only if \ ( a\ ) and \ ( b\ ) are ( syntactically ) the same expression \( \varepsilon ab\ ) if and only if \ ( ba\ ) \ ( oabc\ ) if and only if \ ( a( bc ) \ ) \( \acute{\varepsilon} abc\ ) if and only if \ ( bac\ ) \( \acute{o} abcd\ ) if and only if \ ( a( bc ) d\ ) \ ( Wab\ ) if and only if \ ( abb\ ) \( \land ab\ ) if and only if \ ( a\ ) and \ ( b\ ) \ ( \lor ab\ ) if and only if \ ( a\ ) or \ ( b\ ) \ ( Eb\ ) if and only if \( \exists a.\ , ba\ ) \ ( * abc\ ) if and only if \ ( abc\ ) and \( \exists d.\, abd\&adc\ )
In CL , the axioms are followed up with notions such as one - step and weak reduction , the latter of which can be viewed as a computation or inference step .
( See the next section for some of these notions . )
Similarly , an axiomatic calculus for FOL , for instance , would contain rules of inference in addition to the axioms .
One of the obstacles to penetrate the various presentations of basic logic is the lack of a similar formulation .
During the next two decades or so after his first paper on basic logic , Fitch published a series of papers on basic logic devoted to ( 1 ) the representation of recursive functions ( i.e. , a demonstration of the possibility of the arithmetization of syntax ) , ( 2 ) \( K^\prime\ ) , an extension of \ ( K\ ) with negation , universal quantifier and # ( the dual of the \( *\ ) operator ) , ( 3 ) the consistency of \ ( K\ ) and \( K^\prime\ ) , ( 4 ) \ ( L\ ) , an extension of \( K^\prime\ ) with implication and necessity operators , ( 5 ) the definability of some of the constants such as \(*\ ) and # , as well as \ ( E\ ) .
The combinators that are included in \ ( K\ ) ( hence , in all its extensions ) are \( \textsf { T}\ ) , \( \textsf { B}\ ) and \( \textsf { W}\ ) .
\( \acute \varepsilon\ ) and \ ( \acute o\ ) are the ternary version of \( \textsf { T}\ ) and the quaternary version of \( \textsf { B}\ ) , respectively .
Russell 's paradox involves negation , but ( either variant of ) Curry 's paradox is positive , in the sense that it relies on one or two theorems of the positive implicational logic of David Hilbert .
This means that if the various systems of basic logic , especially \( K^\prime\ ) and \ ( L\ ) are consistent , then they either cannot contain full abstraction , or the notions of implication , entailment and identity should differ from their usual counterparts .
Indeed , \ ( K\ ) , \( K^\prime\ ) and \ ( L\ ) are not extensional systems .
That is , even if two expressions applied to the same expression are always equal , the equality of the applied expressions does not follow .
Turning basic logic into an extensional system proved less than straightforward .
Fitch 's system \ ( JE^\prime\ ) was shown to be inconsistent by Myhill , which led to a more complicated formulation of the conditions for extensional identity .
Basic logic has not ( yet ) become a widely used general framework for the description of formal systems ; however , renewed interest in this approach is signaled by Updike ( 2010 ) , which attempts to situate basic logic in the broader context of foundational work at the middle of the 20th century .
Quine 's elimination strategy
From the late 1930s , W. V. O. Quine worked on an alternative way to eliminate bound variables from first - order logic .
It is plausible to assume that Schönfinkel 's goal was to find a single operator in classical logic and then to eliminate the bound variables — as he claims in Schönfinkel ( 1924 ) — rather than defining an overarching symbolic system to describe all mathematics .
Nonetheless , CL was soon fused with classical logic in a more free - wheeling fashion , which resulted in an inconsistent system .
Quine saw the way out of a situation where inconsistency may arise via implicit typing of constants that are to some extent similar to combinators .
He called such constants predicate functors , and introduced several groups of them , the last one in Quine ( 1981 ) .
The most common presentations of FOL stipulate that an \ ( n\ ) - place predicate followed by a sequence of \ ( n\ ) terms ( possibly , punctuated by commas and surrounded by parentheses ) is a formula .
( This is in contrast with Schönfinkel 's view of formulas and in accordance with the informal and formal interpretations of predicates as \ ( n\ ) - ary relations .
In other words , FOL does not permit “ currying ” of predicates or of their interpretations . )
Quine subscribes to the view that sequences of terms follow predicates .
Predicate functors are not applicable to each other — unlike the combinators are .
This is a point that Quine repeatedly emphasizes .
Atomic predicates are the predicates of a first - order language , whereas complex predicates are obtained by applying a predicate functor ( of appropriate arity ) to predicates ( which may be atomic or complex ) .
The prohibition of self - application together with the use of “ flat ” sequences of arguments means that infinitely many predicate functors are needed to ensure the elimination of bound variables from all formulas of FOL .
To explain the problem quickly : a permutation of a pair of elements that are arbitrarily far apart cannot be ensured otherwise .
Just as combinators may be divided into groups based on their effect , Quine was able to select predicate functors that can be grouped together naturally based on their effects .
Indeed , the groups of predicate functors are similar to classes of combinators , though Quine 's labels are often sublime .
In order to give a concrete example of this alternative approach , we outline a slightly modified version of a set of predicate functors from Quine ( 1981 ) .
A first - order language with \ ( \mid^ - \ ) as the only operator is assumed .
( \ ( F\ ) and \ ( G\ ) are metavariables for predicates in the predicate functor language . ) \( \wr^n\ ) \( \textit{Inv}^n\ ) , \( \textit{inv}^n\ ) , \( \textit {Pad}^{n+1}\ ) and \( \textit{Ref}^n\ ) are predicate functors , for every \ ( n\in\omega\ ) .
A formula of FOL is rewritten into a formula in a predicate functor language by applications of the following clauses .
A variable \ ( x\ ) and a predicate \ ( P\ ) of FOL is \ ( x\ ) and \ ( P\ ) , respectively , in the predicate functor language .
\( Fx_1x_2\ldots x_n\mid^{x_1}Gx_1x_2\ldots x_n \mathbin{ {:}{=}{:}} ( F\wr G ) x_2\ldots x_n\ ) , where \( x_2 , \ldots , x_n\ ) are distinct from \ ( x_1\ ) , and \( F\ ) and \ ( G\ ) are followed by the same sequence of variables .
\( Fx_1x_2\ldots x_n \mathbin{{:}{=}{:}} ( \textit{Inv }F ) x_2\ldots x_nx_1\ ) \( Fx_1x_2\ldots x_n \mathbin{{:}{=}{:}} ( \textit{inv }F) x_2x_1\ldots x_n\ ) \( Fx_2\ldots x_n \mathbin{{:}{=}{:}} ( \textit { Pad } F) x_1x_2\ldots x_n\ ) \( Fx_1x_1x_2\ldots x_n \mathbin{{:}{=}{:}} ( \textit {Ref }F ) x_1x_2\ldots x_n\ )
There is an obvious similarity between \( \textit {Ref}\ ) and \( \textsf { W}\ ) , \( \textit {Pad}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) , as well as \( \textit {Inv}\ ) and \( \textit{inv}\ ) and various combinators with permutative effects ( e.g. , \( \textsf { C}\ ) and \( \textsf { T}\ ) ) .
If \( \mid^ -\ ) is the only operator in the first - order language , then all formulas , which are not atomic , are almost of the form of the left - hand side expression in 2 .
What has to be assured is that the side condition is satisfied , and that is where clauses 3 – 6 enter .
Although the various \ ( n\ ) - ary versions of \ ( \wr\ ) , \( \textit{inv}\ ) , \( \textit {Pad}\ ) and \( \textit{Ref}\ ) could be conflated ( by ignoring unaffected arguments ) , \( \textit {Inv}\ ) clearly stands for infinitely many predicate functors , because \ ( x_1 , \ldots , x_n\ ) cannot be ignored or omitted .
It may be interesting to note that there is a difference between \ ( \wr\ ) and Schönfinkel 's \ ( U\ ) .
Not only the place of the bound variable is different , but \( \wr\ ) builds in contraction for \ ( n - 1 \ ) variables ( which are separated by \( \mid^ -\ ) and other symbols in the left - hand expression ) .
Quine intended the predicate functor language to lead to a novel algebraization of first - order logic .
While bound variables can be eliminated using predicate functors , Quine never defined an algebra in the usual sense — something similar , for instance , to cylindric algebras .
Predicate functors , by design , have a very limited applicability , which has the unfortunate side effect that they seem to be of little interest and not much of use outside their intended context .
2. Combinatory terms and their main properties
2.1 Reduction , equality and their formalizations
The paradoxes that were discovered by Georg Cantor and Bertrand Russell in the late 19th–early 20th century both involve self - membership of a set .
The ramified theory of types due to Alfred N. Whitehead and Bertrand Russell , and ZF ( the formalization of set theory named after Ernst Zermelo and Abraham A. Fraenkel ) exclude self - membership .
However , there seems to have been always a desire to create a theory that allows self - membership or self - application .
Indeed , one of Curry 's motivations for the development of CL was the goal to construct a formal language that includes a wide range of well - formed expressions , some of which — under certain interpretations — may turn out to be meaningless .
( This idea may be compared to the von Neumann– Bernays – Gödel formalization of set theory , in which — without the axiom of foundation — the Russell class can be proved not to be a set , hence , to be a proper class . )
A few natural language examples provide a convenient illustration to clarify the difference between ( 1 ) , that is a well - formed ( but meaningless ) expression and ( 2 ) , which is a meaningful ( but ill - formed ) sentence .
( The meaningfulness of ( 2 ) , of course , should be taken with a grain of salt .
In reality , Kurt Gödel proved the system of PM to be incomplete in 1930 .
Thus ( 2 ) may be guessed — using syntactic and semantics clues — to be a distorted version of ( 2 ′ ) Peano arithmetic was proved to be incomplete by Gödel in 1930 . )
(1) The derivative of \( \lambda x\ , ( x ^ 2+4 x - 6 ) \ ) wishes to declare that functions are smart .
(2) Peano arithmetics prove incomplete with Gödel at 1930 .
After these informal motivations , we turn to CL proper and introduce some of its notions a bit more formally .
The objects in CL are called terms . [ 9 ]
Terms may be thought to be interpreted as functions ( as further explained in section 4.1 ) .
Primitive terms comprise variables and constants , whereas compound terms are formed by combining terms .
Usually , a denumerable set ( i.e. , a set with cardinality \( \aleph_0\ ) ) of variables is included , and the constants include some ( undefined ) combinators .
( We use \( x , y , z , v , w , u, x_0 , \ldots \ ) as variables in the object language , and \( M, N , P , Q, \ldots \ ) as metavariables that range over terms . )
Terms are inductively defined as follows .
( t1 ) If \( x\ ) is a variable , then \ ( x\ ) is a term ;
( t2 ) if \( c\ ) is a constant , then \ ( c\ ) is a term ;
( t3 ) if \ ( M\ ) and \ ( N\ ) are terms , then ( \( MN\ ) ) is a term .
In the above definition , ( t3 ) conceals the binary operation that conjoins the two terms \ ( M\ ) and \ ( N\ ) .
This operation is called application , and it is often denoted by juxtaposition , that is , by placing its two arguments next to each other as in ( \( MN\ ) ) .
Application is not assumed to possess additional properties ( such as commutativity ) , because its intended interpretation is function application .
For instance , \(( ( vw ) u ) \ ) and \ ( ( v( wu ) ) \ ) are distinct terms — just as the derivative of \( \lambda x.\ , x ^2+4x - 6\ ) applied to 8 ( that is , ( \( \lambda x.\ , 2x+4 ) 8=20 \ ) ) is different from the derivative of 90 ( that is , \(( 8^2+32-6 ) '=0 \ ) ) .
Using \( \lambda\ ) notation , the two terms in the example may be expressed as
\ [ ( ( \lambda y.\ , y ' ) ( \lambda x.\ , x ^2+4 x - 6 ) ) 8 \]
vs
\[ ( \lambda y.\ , y ' ) ( ( \lambda x.\ , x ^2+4 x - 6 ) 8 ) . \]
If terms are viewed as structured strings ( where parentheses show grouping ) , then the number of distinct terms associated to a string of length \ ( n\ ) is the Catalan number \ ( C_{n - 1} \ ) .
For a non-negative integer \( n\ ) ( i.e. , for \( n\in\mathbb {N}\ ) ) ,
\[ C_n = \ frac { 1} {n+1} { 2n \choose n}. \]
The first seven Catalan numbers are \ ( C_0=1\ ) , \( C_1=1\ ) , \( C_2=2\ ) , \( C_3=5\ ) , \( C_4=14\ ) , \( C_5=42\ ) and \ ( C_6=132\ ) .
As an illustration we may take — for simplicity — strings consisting of \ ( x\ ) s , because the terms are to differ only in their grouping .
Clearly , if the term is \ ( x\ ) or \ ( xx\ ) , that is of length 1 or 2 , then there is only one way to form a term , that is , there exists just one possible term in each case .
If we start with three \( x\ ) s , then we may form \ ( ( xx ) x \ ) or \ ( x ( xx ) \ ) .
If the length of the term is 4 , then the five terms are : \ ( xxxx\ ) , \ ( x ( xx ) x\ ) , \ ( xx ( xx ) \ ) , \ ( x ( xxx ) \ ) and \ ( x ( x ( xx ) ) \ ) .
( It is a useful exercise to try to list the 14 distinct terms that can be formed from 5 \ ( x\ ) s . )
The usual notational convention in CL is to drop parentheses from left - associated terms together with the outmost pair .
For instance , \ ( xyz\ ) would be fully written as \((( xy ) z ) \ ) , whereas \ ( xy ( xz ) \ ) and \(( xy ) ( xz ) \ ) are both “ shorthand versions ” of the term \( ( ( xy ) ( xz ) ) \ ) ( unlike \( xyxz\ ) ) .
Grouping in terms delineates subterms .
For instance , \ ( xy\ ) is a subterm of each of the terms mentioned in this paragraph , whereas \ ( yz\ ) and \ ( yx\ ) are subterms of none of those terms .
Subterms of a term are recursively defined as follows .
( s1 ) \ ( M\ ) is a subterm of \ ( M\ ) ;
( s2 ) if \ ( M\ ) is a subterm of \ ( N\ ) or of \ ( P\ ) , then \( M\ ) is a subterm of \ ( NP\ ) .
Incidentally , the notion of free variables is straightforwardly definable now : \ ( x\ ) is a free variable of \ ( M\ ) iff \ ( x\ ) is a subterm of \ ( M\ ) .
The set of free variables of \ ( M\ ) is sometimes denoted by \( \textrm{fv} ( M ) \ ) .
All terms are interpreted as functions , and combinators are functions too .
Similarly , to some numerical and geometrical functions , that can be described and grasped easily , the combinators that are frequently encountered can be characterized as perspicuous transformations on terms .
( Sans serif letters denote combinators and > denotes one - step reduction . )
Definition .
( Axioms of some well - known combinators ) \( \textsf { S}xyz \ mathbin{\triangleright_1} xz( yz ) \ ) \( \textsf { K}xy \ mathbin{\triangleright_1} x\ ) \( \textsf { I}x \ mathbin{\triangleright_1} x\ ) \( \textsf { B}xyz \ mathbin{\triangleright_1} x ( yz ) \ ) \( \textsf{ T}xy \ mathbin{\triangleright_1} yx\ ) \( \textsf { C}xyz \ mathbin{\triangleright_1} xzy\ ) \( \textsf { W}xy \ mathbin{\triangleright_1} xyy\ ) \( \textsf{M}x \ mathbin{\triangleright_1} xx\ ) \( \textsf {Y}x \mathbin{\triangleright_1} x(\textsf{Y}x ) \ ) \( \textsf{J}xyzv \ mathbin{\triangleright_1} xy ( xvz ) \ ) \( \textsf { B}^\prime xyz \ mathbin{\triangleright_1} y( xz ) \ ) \( \textsf { V}xyz \ mathbin{\triangleright_1} zxy \)
These axioms tacitly specify the arity of a combinator as well as their reduction ( or contraction ) pattern .
Perhaps , the simplest combinaetor is the identity combinator \( \textsf { I}\ ) , that applied to an argument \ ( x\ ) returns the same \ ( x\ ) . \( \textsf { K}\ ) applied to \ ( x\ ) is a constant function , because when it is further applied to \ ( y\ ) , it yields \ ( x\ ) as a result , that is , \( \textsf { K}\ ) is a cancellator with respect to its second argument .
\( \textsf {W}\ ) and \( \textsf { M}\ ) are duplicators , because in the result of their application one of the arguments ( always ) appears twice . [ 10 ] \( \textsf { C}\ ) , \( \textsf { T}\ ) and \( \textsf { V}\ ) are permutators , because they change the order of some of their arguments .
\( \textsf { B}\ ) is an associator , because \( \textsf { B}xyz\ ) turns into a term in which \ ( y\ ) is applied to \ ( z\ ) before \ ( x\ ) is applied to the result .
\( \textsf { Y}\ ) is the fixed point combinator , because for any function \ ( x\ ) , \( \textsf { Y}x\ ) is the fixed point of that function ( see section 2.3 ) .
The combinator \( \textsf { B}^\prime\ ) is an associator and a permutator , whereas \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { J}\ ) are also duplicators .
\( \textsf {S}\ ) is very special and it is called the strong composition combinator , because when applied to two functions , let us say , \ ( f\ ) and \ ( g\ ) , as well as \ ( x\ ) , then the resulting term \ ( gx ( fx ) \ ) expresses the composition of \ ( g\ ) and \ ( f\ ) both applied to the same argument \ ( x\ ) .
These informal explications did not mention any restrictions on the sort of functions \( x , y , z , f , g , \ldots \ ) may be .
However , the axioms above limit the applicability of the combinators to variables .
Intuitively , we would like to say that given any terms , that is , any functions \ ( M\ ) and \ ( N\ ) , \( \textsf { W}MN\ ) one - step reduces to \( MNN\ ) ( possibly , as a subterm of another term ) .
For example , \ ( M\ ) may be \( \textsf { K}\ ) and \ ( N\ ) may be \ ( yy\ ) , and then \( \textsf { WK}(yy) \triangleright_1\textsf{K}(yy ) ( yy ) \ ) .
The latter term suggests a further one - step reduction , and indeed we might be interested in successive one - step reductions — such as those leading from \( \textsf { WK} ( yy ) \ ) to \( yy\ ) .
A way to achieve these goals is to formalize ( a theory of ) CL starting with the standard inequational logic but to omit the anti-symmetry rule and to add certain other axioms and rules .
Inequational Calculus for CL ( \( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) ) .
\( M\triangleright M\ ) \( \textsf{S}MNP\triangleright MP ( NP ) \) \( \quad\textsf{K}MN\triangleright M\ ) \( \dfrac{M\triangleright N \quad N\triangleright P}{M\triangleright P}\ ) \( \dfrac{M\triangleright N}{MP\triangleright NP}\ ) \( \dfrac{M\triangleright N}{PM\triangleright PN}\ ) ( \( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) ) .
The use of metavariables encompasses substitution ( that we illustrated above on the term \( \textsf { W}MN ) \ ) .
The identity axiom and the rule of transitivity imply that \( \triangleright\ ) is a transitive and reflexive relation .
The last two rules characterize application as an operation that is monotone in both of its argument places .
\( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) includes only \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) , because the other combinators are definable from them — as we already mentioned in section 1.2 , and as we explain more precisely toward the end of this section .
The set of combinators \( \{\textsf { S} , \textsf {K}\}\ ) is called a combinatory base , that is , these two combinators are the undefined constants of \( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) .
To give an idea of a proof in this calculus , the following steps may be pieced together to prove \( \textsf {SKK} ( \textsf{KSK} ) \triangleright \ textsf{S}\ ) . \( \textsf{KSK}\triangleright \ textsf{S}\ ) is an instance of an axiom .
Then \( \textsf{SKK}(\textsf{KSK} ) \ triangleright\textsf{SKKS}\ ) is obtained by right monotonicity , and further , \( \textsf{SKK}(\textsf{KSK})\triangleright\textsf{S}\ ) results by instances of the \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) axioms together with applications of the transitivity rule .
The relation \( \triangleright\ ) is called weak reduction , and it may be defined alternatively as follows .
( ‘ Weak reduction ’ is a technical term used in CL to distinguish this relation on the set of terms from some other relations , one of which is called ‘ strong reduction ’ . )
A term that is either of the form \( \textsf{ S}MNP\ ) or of the form \( \textsf{ K}MN\ ) is a redex , and the leading combinators ( \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) , respectively ) are the heads of the redexes .
If a term \ ( Q\ ) contains a subterm of the form \( \textsf{ S}MNP\ ) , then \( Q^\prime\ ) ; which is obtained by replacing that subterm by \ ( MP ( NP ) \ ) is a one - step reduct of \ ( Q\ ) .
( Similarly , for the redex \( \textsf{K} MN\ ) and \ ( M\ ) . )
That is , \( Q\triangleright Q^\prime\ ) in both cases .
Reduction then may be defined as the reflexive transitive closure of one - step reduction .
This notion is completely captured by \( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) .
The calculus \( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) is complete in the sense that if \( M\triangleright N\ ) in the sense we have just described , then \( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) proves \( M\triangleright N\ ) .
( It is easy to see that the converse implication is true too . )
The notion of reduction is a weaker relation than one - step reduction , and so it is useful to distinguish a subclass of terms using the stronger relation .
A term is in normal form ( nf ) when it contains no redexes .
Note that one - step reduction does not need to decrease the total number of redexes that a term contains , hence , it does not follow that every term can be turned into a term in nf via finitely many one - step reductions .
Indeed , some terms do not reduce to a term in nf .
Reduction is arguably an important relation between terms that denote functions .
The typical steps in a program execution and in other concrete calculations are function applications rather than moves in the other direction , what is called expansion .
However , the notion of the equality of functions is familiar to everybody from mathematics , and the analogous notion has been introduced in CL too .
The transitive , reflexive , symmetric closure of the one - step reduction relation is called ( weak ) equality .
A formalization of equational CL may be obtained by extending the standard equational logic with combinatory axioms and rules characterizing the combinatory constants and the application operation .
Equational Calculus for CL ( \( \text {CL}_=\ ) ) .
\( M=M\ ) \( \textsf{K}MN=M\ ) \( \textsf{S}MNP=MP( NP ) \ ) \( \dfrac{M=N \quad N=P}{M=P}\ ) \( \dfrac{M=N}{N=M}\ ) \( \dfrac{M=N}{MP=NP}\ ) \( \dfrac{M=N}{PM=PN}\ ) ( \( \text {CL}_=\ ) ) .
The first axiom and the first two rules constitute equational logic .
The constants are again the combinators \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) .
Note that \( \text {CL}_=\ ) could have been defined as an extension of \ ( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) by adding the rule of symmetry , that would have paralleled the description of the definition of equality from reduction as its transitive , symmetric closure .
We chose instead to repeat the inequational axioms and rules with the new notation ( and add the rule of symmetry ) to make the two definitions self - contained and easy to grasp .
The two characterizations of \( =\ ) coincide — as those of \( \triangleright\ ) did .
\( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) and \( \text {CL}_=\ ) share a feature that may or may not be desirable — depending on what sort of understanding of functions is to be captured .
To illustrate the issue , let us consider the one - place combinators \( \textsf{ SKK}\ ) and \( \textsf{SK}(\textsf{KK} ) \ ) .
It is easy to verify that \( \textsf{SKK}M\triangleright M\ ) and \( \textsf{SK}(\textsf{KK} ) M \triangleright M\ ) .
However , neither \( \textsf{SKK}\triangleright \ textsf{SK}(\textsf{KK} ) \ ) nor \( \textsf{SK}(\textsf{KK} ) \triangleright \ textsf{SKK}\ ) is provable in \ ( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) ; a fortiori , the equality of the two terms in not provable in \( \text {CL}_=\ ) .
This means that \( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) and \( \text {CL}_=\ ) formalize intensional notions of functions , where “ intensionality ” implies that functions that give the same output on the same input may remain distinguishable .
The archetypical intensional functions that one is likely to encounter are algorithms .
As examples , we might think of various specifications to calculate the decimal expansion of \ ( \pi\ ) , or various computer programs that behave in the same way .
For instance , compilers ( for one and the same language ) may differ from each other by using or not using some optimizations , and thereby , producing programs from a given piece of code that have identical input–output behavior but different run times .
If functions that are indistinguishable from the point of view of their input–output behavior are to be identified , that is , an extensional understanding of functions is sought , then \( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) and \( \text {CL}_=\ ) have to be extended by the following rule , ( where the symbol \( \ddagger\ ) is to be replaced by \( \triangleright\ ) or \( =\ ) , respectively ) .
2.2 Church–Rosser theorems and consistency theorems
\[ \frac {Mx\ddagger Nx}{M\ddagger
N} \text { where } x \text{ is not free in } MN . \]
The calculi \( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) and \( \text {CL}_=\ ) of the previous section formalize reduction and equality .
However , \( \triangleright\ ) and \( =\ ) have some further properties that are important when the terms are thought to stand for functions .
The next theorem is one of the earliest and best - known results about CL .
Church–Rosser theorem ( I ) .
If \ ( M\ ) reduces to \ ( N\ ) and \ ( P\ ) , then there is a term \ ( Q\ ) to which both \ ( N\ ) and \ ( P\ ) reduce .
Figure 1 . Illustration for the Church–Rosser theorem ( I )
If we think that reduction is like computing the value of a function , then the Church–Rosser theorem — in a first approximation — can be thought to state that the final result of a series of calculations with a term is unique — independently of the order of the steps .
This is a slight overstatement though , because uniqueness implies that each series of calculations ends ( or “ loops ” on a term ) .
That is , if there is a unique final term , then only finitely many distinct consecutive calculation steps are possible .
A coarse analogy with elementary arithmetic operations , perhaps , can shed some light on the situation .
The addition and multiplication of natural numbers always yield a natural number .
However , if division is included then it is no longer true that all numerical expressions evaluate to a natural number , since \ ( 7/5\ ) is a rational number that is not a natural one , and \( n /0 \ ) is undefined ( even if \( n\ ) were real ) .
That is , some numerical expressions do not evaluate to a ( natural ) number .
Although the analogy with combinatory terms is not very tight , it is useful .
For instance , \( n/0\ ) ( assuming that the codomain of the function \( \lambda n.\, n/0\ ) is extended to permit \ ( r\ ) to be rational ) could be implemented on a computer by a loop ( that would never terminate when executed if \(n
e0 \ ) ) which would go through an enumeration of the rational numbers trying to find an \ ( r\ ) such that \( r\cdot0=n\ ) .
The combinatory terms \( \textsf{ WWW}\ ) and \( \textsf { WI}( \textsf{WI} ) \ ) are , perhaps , the simplest examples of terms that do not have a normal form .
Both terms induce an infinite reduction sequence , that is , an infinite chain of successive one - step reductions .
To make the example more transparent , let us assume for a moment that \( \textsf { W}\ ) , \( \textsf { I}\ ) , \( \textsf { C}\ ) , etc. are not defined from \( \textsf { K}\ ) and \( \textsf { S}\ ) , but are primitive constants .
The contraction of the only redex in \( \textsf { WWW}\ ) returns the same term , which shows that uniqueness does not imply that the term is in nf .
The contraction of the only redex in \( \textsf { WI}( \textsf{ WI} ) \ ) gives \( \textsf{I}(\textsf{WI} ) ( \textsf{ WI} ) \ ) that further reduces to the term we started with .
A slightly more complicated example of a term that has only infinite reduction sequences is \( \textsf{Y}(\textsf{CKI} ) \ ) .
This term has a reduction sequence ( in which each contracted redex is headed by \( \textsf { Y}\ ) ) that contains infinitely many distinct terms .
It is also possible to create infinite reduction sequences that start with \( \textsf{Y} ( \textsf{ CKI} ) \ ) and have various loops too .
To sum up , the Church–Rosser theorem , in general , does not guarantee the uniqueness of the term \ ( Q\ ) .
However , if \ ( M\ ) has a normal form then that is unique .
The Church–Rosser theorem is often stated as follows .
Church–Rosser theorem ( II ) .
If \ ( N\ ) and \ ( P\ ) are equal , then there is a term \ ( Q\ ) to which both \ ( N\ ) and \ ( P\ ) reduces .
Figure 2 . Illustration for the Church–Rosser theorem ( II )
The second form of the Church–Rosser theorem differs from the first in its assumption .
From the definition of equality as a superset of reduction , it is obvious that the first form of the theorem is implied by the second .
However , despite the weaker assumption in the second formulation of the Church–Rosser theorem , the two theorems are equivalent .
Equality is the transitive , symmetric closure of reduction , which means that if two terms are equal then there is a finite path comprising reduction and expansion steps ( which decompose into one - step reductions and one - step expansions , respectively ) .
Then by finitely many applications of the first Church–Rosser theorem ( i.e. , by induction on the length of the path connecting \ ( N\ ) and \ ( P\ ) ) , the first Church–Rosser theorem implies the second formulation .
Modern proofs of the Church–Rosser theorem for CL proceed indirectly because one - step reduction fails to have the diamond property .
A binary relation \ ( R\ ) ( e.g. , reduction ) is said to have the diamond property when \ ( xRy\ ) and \ ( xRz\ ) imply that \ ( yRv\ ) and \ ( zRv\ ) for some \( v\ ) .
If a binary relation \ ( R\ ) has the diamond property , so does its transitive closure .
To exploit this insight in the proof of the Church–Rosser theorem , a suitable subrelation of reduction has to be found .
The sought after subrelation should possess the diamond property , and its reflexive transitive closure should coincide with reduction .
The following counterexample illustrates that one - step reductions of a term may yield terms that further do not reduce to a common term in one step .
\( \textsf{SKK}(\textsf{KKS})\triangleright_1\textsf{SKKK}\ ) and \( \textsf{SKK}(\textsf{KKS})\triangleright_1\textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} ) ( \textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} ) ) \ ) , and then the potential reduction sequences are as follows .
\( \textsf{SKKK}\triangleright_1\textsf{KK}(\textsf{KK})\triangleright_1 \textsf{K}\ ) \( \textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} )( \textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} ) ) \triangleright_1 \textsf{KKS}\triangleright_1\textsf{K}\ ) \( \textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} )( \textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} ) ) \triangleright_1 \textsf{KK}(\textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} ) ) \triangleright_1 \textsf{KK}(\textsf{KK})\triangleright_1\textsf{K}\ ) \( \textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} )( \textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} ) ) \triangleright_1 \textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS})(\textsf{KK})\triangleright_1\textsf{KKS} \triangleright_1\textsf{K}\ ) \( \textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} )( \textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} ) ) \triangleright_1 \textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS})( \textsf{KK})\triangleright_1\textsf{KK} ( \textsf{KK}) \triangleright_1\textsf{K}\ )
The failure of the diamond property is obvious once we note that \( \textsf{SKKK}\triangleright_1\textsf{KK}(\textsf{KK} ) \ ) ( only ) , but \( \textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} )(\textsf{K}(\textsf{KKS} ) ) \) does not reduce in one step to \( \textsf{KK}(\textsf{KK} ) \ ) .
An appropriate subrelation of reduction is the simultaneous reduction of a set of nonoverlapping redexes , which is denoted by \( \triangleright _\textrm{sr}\ ) .
‘ Nonoverlapping ’ means that there are no shared subterm occurrences between two redexes .
\( \triangleright_\textrm{sr}\ ) includes \ ( \triangleright_1\ ) because a one - step reduction of a redex may be viewed instead as \ ( \triangleright_\textrm{sr}\ ) of a singleton set of redexes .
\( \triangleright_\textrm{sr}\ ) is , obviously , included in \( \triangleright\ ) ( i.e. , in reduction ) .
These two facts imply that the reflexive transitive closure of \ ( \triangleright_\textrm{sr}\ ) is reduction — when the tonicity of the reflexive transitive closure operation ( denoted by \( ^*\ ) ) is taken into account .
( 1) –( 3 ) summarize the key inclusions between the relations mentioned .
(1) \( \triangleright_1\subseteq\triangleright_\textrm{sr}\ ; \ Rightarrow\;\triangleright_1^*\subseteq\triangleright_\textrm{sr}^*\ )
(2) \( \triangleright_\textrm{sr}\subseteq\triangleright \; \Rightarrow\;\triangleright_\textrm{sr}^*\subseteq\triangleright^*\)
(3) \(\triangleright_1^*\subseteq\triangleright^*\quad \ textrm{ and }\quad\triangleright^*=\triangleright\ ) .
The central property of \ ( \triangleright_\textrm{sr}\ ) that we need is the content of the following theorem .
Theorem .
( Diamond property for \( \triangleright_\textrm{sr}\ ) )
If \( M\triangleright_\textrm{sr}N\ ) and \( M\triangleright_\textrm{sr}P\ ) then there is a term \ ( Q\ ) such that both \( N\triangleright_\textrm{sr}Q\ ) and \ ( P\triangleright_\textrm{sr}Q\ ) .
The proof of this theorem is an easy induction on the term \ ( M\ ) .
The properties of \ ( \triangleright_\textrm{sr}\ ) guarantee that one or more one - step reductions can be performed at once , but the reductions cannot interfere ( or overlap ) with each other .
The consistency of CL follows from the Church–Rosser theorem together with the existence of ( at least two ) distinct normal forms .
Theorem .
( Consistency ) CL is consistent , that is , there are terms that do not reduce to each other , hence they are not equal .
Not all terms have an nf , however , many do .
Examples , first of all , include \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) .
( The variables , if included , of which there are \( \aleph_0\ ) many , are all in nf . )
None of these terms contains a redex , hence each reduces only to itself .
By the Church–Rosser theorem , it is excluded that some term \ ( M\ ) could reduce to both \ ( x\ ) and \( \textsf { S}\ ) ( making \( \textsf { S}\ ) equal to \ ( x \ ) ) .
The interaction between infinite reduction sequences and nfs deserves a more careful inspection though .
The terms \( \textsf{ WWW}\ ) , \( \textsf{Y} ( \textsf{ CKI} ) \ ) and \( \textsf{ WI}( \textsf{WI} ) \ ) have only infinite reduction sequences .
However , the existence of an infinite reduction sequence for a term does not imply that the term has no normal form ( when the combinatory base is complete or contains a cancellator ) .
\( \textsf{Y} ( \textsf{KI} ) \ ) reduces to \( \textsf{KI}(\textsf{Y}(\textsf{KI} ) ) \ ) , \( \textsf{KI}(\textsf{KI}(\textsf{Y}(\textsf{KI} ) ) ) \ ) , \( \textsf {KI} ( \textsf{KI}(\textsf{KI}(\textsf{Y}(\textsf{KI} ) ) ) ) , \ldots\ ) as well as to \( \textsf { I}\ ) .
A term weakly normalizes when it has an nf , whereas a term strongly normalizes when all its reduction sequences lead to an nf ( hence , to the nf ) of the term .
A computational analogue of a strongly normalizing term is a ( nondeterministic ) program that terminates on every branch of computation , whereas termination on at least one branch is akin to weak normalization .
The importance of normalization led to a whole range of questions ( and an extensive literature of answers ) .
How does the order of the reduction steps ( i.e. , a reduction strategy ) affect finding the nf ( if there is one ) ?
Are there combinatory bases that guarantee the existence of normal forms for every combinator over that base ?
To quickly illustrate possible answers to our sample questions , we start with noting that if there is no combinator with a duplicative effect in a base , then all combinators over that base strongly normalize .
This is a very easy answer , and as a concrete base , we could have , for example , \( \{\textsf { B} , \textsf{C} , \textsf{K}\}\ ) or \( \{\textsf { B} , \ textsf{C} , \textsf{I}\}\ ) , which have some independent interest in view of their connection to simply typed calculi .
However , these bases are far from being combinatorially complete and even a fixed point combinator is undefinable in them .
We could ask a slightly different question :
If we start with the base \( \{\textsf { S} , \textsf {K}\}\ ) and we omit \( \textsf { S}\ ) , then we get the base \( \{\textsf { K}\}\ ) and all the combinators strongly normalize , but what if we omit \( \textsf { K}\ ) ?
Do the combinators over \( \{\textsf { S}\}\ ) strongly normalize or at least normalize ?
The answer is “ no . ” A term ( discovered by Henk Barendregt in the early 1970s ) that shows the lack of strong normalization is \( \textsf { SSS}( \textsf{SSS} )(\textsf{SSS} ) \ ) .
The first \( \textsf {S}\ ) is the head of a ( indeed , the only ) redex , and the head reduction sequence of this term is infinite .
Since \( \{\textsf {S}\}\ ) does not contain any combinator with a cancellative effect , the existence of an infinite reduction sequence for a term means that the term has no nf .
There are shorter combinators over the base \( \{\textsf { S}\}\ ) without an nf , for example , \( \textsf{S}(\textsf{SS} ) \textsf{SSSSS}\ ) comprises only eight occurrences of \( \textsf { S}\ ) .
The sorts of questions we illustrated here ( or rather , the answers to them ) can become a bit technical , because they often involve concepts and techniques from graph theory , automata theory and the theory of term - rewriting .
2.3
The existence of fixed points and combinatorial completeness
Schönfinkel proved that \( \textsf {S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) suffice to define the other combinators he introduced , and we mentioned in the definition of \( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) that the set of constants is limited to \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) , because other combinators could be defined from those .
To demonstrate the sense in which definability is understood here we consider the example of \( \textsf { B}\ ) .
The axiom for \( \textsf { B}\ ) is \( \textsf{ B} xyz\triangleright_1 x ( yz ) \ ) , and if we take \( \textsf{S}(\textsf{KS} ) \ textsf{K}\ ) instead of \( \textsf { B}\ ) , then the following reduction sequence results .
\[ \textsf{S}(\textsf{KS}) \textsf{K}xyz\triangleright_1\textsf{KS}x ( \textsf{K}x)yz\triangleright_1\textsf{S}(\textsf{K}x)yz\triangleright_1 \textsf{K}xz(yz)\triangleright_1x( yz ) \]
The term \( \textsf{S}(\textsf{KS} ) \textsf{K}\ ) is in nf , however , to be in nf is not a requirement for definability .
It is more convenient to work with defining terms that are in nf , because an application of a combinator that is not in nf could be started with reducing the combinator to its normal form .
( Also , there are always infinitely many combinators that reduce to a combinator . )
However , note that the preference for choosing combinators in nf is not meant to imply that a combinator cannot be defined by two or more terms in nf ; below we give two definitions ( involving only \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) ) for \( \textsf { I}\ ) .
If the constants are \( \textsf {S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) , then the combinators are all those terms that are formed from \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) ( without variables ) .
Once we have defined \( \textsf { B}\ ) as \( \textsf{S}(\textsf{KS} ) \textsf{K}\ ) , we may use \( \textsf { B}\ ) in further definitions as an abbreviation , and we do that primarily to reduce the size of the resulting terms as well as to preserve the transparency of the definitions .
The following list gives definitions for the other well - known combinators that we mentioned earlier .
( Here ‘\ ( =\ ) ’ is placed between a definiendum and a definiens . )
\( \textsf{I}=\textsf{SK}(\textsf{KK} ) \ ) \( \textsf{T}=\textsf{B}(\textsf{SI})\textsf{K}\ ) \( \textsf{C}=\textsf{B}(\textsf{T}(\textsf{BBT} ) ) ( \textsf { BBT} ) \ ) \( \textsf{W}=\textsf{CSI}\ ) \( \textsf{M}=\textsf{SII}\ ) \( \textsf{Y}=\textsf{BW}(\textsf{BB}^\prime\textsf{M})(\textsf{BW}(\textsf{BB}^\prime\textsf{M} ) ) \ ) \( \textsf{V}=\textsf{BCT}\ ) \( \textsf{B}^\prime=\textsf{CB}\ ) \( \textsf{J}=\textsf{W}(\textsf{BC}(\textsf{B}(\textsf{B}(\textsf{BC} ) ) ( \textsf{B}(\textsf{BB} ) ( \textsf{BB} ) ) ) ) \)
The definitions are easily seen to imply that all these combinators depend on both \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) , but it is not obvious from the definitions that the defined combinators are mutually independent , that is , that none of the listed combinators is definable from another one .
( Clearly , some subsets suffice to define some of the combinators . )
We do not intend to give an exhaustive list of interdefinability between various subsets of these combinators , but to hint at the multiplicity and intricacy of such definitions , we list a handful of them .
We also introduce two further combinators \( \textsf { S}^\prime\ ) and \( \textsf { R}\ ) .
\( \textsf{I}=\textsf{SKK}\ ) \( \textsf{I}=\textsf{WK}\ ) \( \textsf{I}=\textsf{CK}(\textsf{KK} ) \ ) \( \textsf{B}=\textsf{CB}^\prime\ ) \( \textsf{S}^\prime=\textsf{CS}\ ) \( \textsf{S}=\textsf{CS}^\prime\ ) \( \textsf{W}=\textsf{S}^\prime\textsf{I}\ ) \( \textsf{W}=\textsf{B}(\textsf{T}(\textsf{BM}(\textsf{BBT} ) ) ) ( \textsf { BBT} ) \ ) \( \textsf{W}=\textsf{C}(\textsf{S}(\textsf{CC} )(\textsf{CC} ) ) \) \( \textsf{R}=\textsf{BBT}\ ) \( \textsf{Y}=\textsf{BM}(\textsf{CBM} ) \ ) \( \textsf{Y}=\textsf{B}^\prime(\textsf{B}^\prime\textsf{M})\textsf{M}\)
If the fixed point combinator \( \textsf { Y}\ ) is not taken to be a primitive , then there are various ways to define it — so far , we have listed three .
Fixed point theorem .
For any function \ ( M\ ) , there is a term \ ( N\ ) such that \( MN = N\ ) .
The proof of this theorem is easy using a fixed point combinator , because a term that can play the rôle of \ ( N\ ) is \( \textsf{Y}M\ ) .
Some of the definitions of \ ( \textsf { Y}\ ) have slightly different properties with respect to reduction .
But the importance of the fixed point combinator is that it ensures that all functions have a fixed point and all recursive equations can be solved .
Both Haskell B. Curry and Alan Turing defined fixed point combinators ( in CL or in the \( \lambda\ ) - calculus ) .
If we consider the definitions
\[ \textsf{Y}_1=\textsf{BM}(\textsf{BWB} ) \quad \textsf{Y}_2=\textsf{W}(\textsf{B}(\textsf{BW}(\textsf{BT} ) ) ) ( \textsf{W}(\textsf{B}(\textsf{BW}(\textsf{BT} ) ) ) ) \]
( where the subscripts are added so as to distinguish the two definitions ) , then we can see that \( \textsf { Y}_1 M=M(\textsf{Y}_1M ) \ ) , but for \( \textsf{ Y}_2\ ) , \( \textsf{Y}_2M\triangleright M(\textsf{Y}_2M ) \) holds too .
In this respect , \( \textsf{ Y}_1\ ) is similar to Curry 's fixed point combinator ( and really , to any fixed point combinator ) , whereas \( \textsf { Y}_2\ ) is like Turing 's fixed point combinator .
The fixed point theorem demonstrates — to some extent — the expressive power of CL .
However , fixed point combinators may be defined from bases without a cancellator ( as \( \textsf { Y}_1 \ ) and \( \textsf { Y}_2\ ) show ) .
The full power of CL ( with the base \( \{\textsf { S} , \textsf { K}\}\ ) ) is enunciated by the following theorem .
Theorem .
( Combinatorial completeness )
If \( f( x_1 , \ldots , x_n ) = M\ ) ( where \( M\ ) is a term containing no other variables than those explicitly listed ) , then there is a combinator \( \textsf { X}\ ) such that \( \textsf{ X} x_1\ldots x_n\ ) reduces to \ ( M\ ) .
The theorem 's assumption may be strengthened to exclude the possibility that some \ ( x\ ) 's do not occur in \ ( M\ ) .
Then the consequent may be strengthened by adding the qualification that \ ( \textsf { X}\ ) is a relevant combinator , more specifically , \( \textsf{X}\ ) is a combinator over \( \{\textsf { B} , \textsf{W} , \ textsf{C} , \textsf{I}\}\ ) ( a base that does not contain a combinator with cancellative effect ) , or equivalently , \( \textsf{X}\ ) is a combinator over \( \{\textsf { I} , \textsf { J}\}\ ) .
( These bases correspond to Church 's preferred \( \lambda\textsf { I}\ ) - calculus . )
Combinatorial completeness is usually proved via defining a “ pseudo ” \( \lambda\ ) - abstraction ( or bracket abstraction ) in CL .
There are various algorithms to define a bracket abstraction operator in CL , that behaves as the \ ( \lambda\ ) operator does in a \ ( \lambda\ ) - calculus .
This operator is usually denoted by \ ( [ \ , ] \ ) or by \( \lambda ^ *\ ) .
The algorithms differ from each other in various aspects : ( i ) the set of combinators they presuppose , ( ii ) the length of the resulting terms , ( iii ) whether they compose into ( syntactic ) identity with the algorithm that translates a combinatory term into a \ ( \lambda\ ) - term , and ( iv ) whether they commute with either of the reductions or equalities .
The first algorithm , the elements of which may already be found in Schönfinkel ( 1924 ) , consists of the following clauses that are applied in the order of their listing .
\ [ \begin{align} \tag{k} &[ x ].\ , M=\textsf{K}M , \text { where } x
otin\textrm{fv} ( M ) \\ \tag{i} &[x ].\,x=\textsf{I} \\ \tag{ \( \eta\ ) } &[ x ] .\ , Mx=M , \text { where } x
otin\textrm{fv} ( M ) \\ \tag{b} &[ x ].\, MN=\textsf{B}M ([x ] .\ , N ) , \text { where } x
otin\textrm{fv} ( M ) \\ \tag{c} &[ x ].\, MN=\textsf{C} ([x ] .\ , M ) N , \text { where } x
otin\textrm{fv}( N ) \\ \tag{s} &[ x ].\, MN=\textsf{S} ([x ] .\ , M ) ( [ x ] .\,N ) \end{align} \ ]
For example , if this algorithm is applied to the term \ ( \lambda xyz . x ( yz ) \ ) ( that is , to the \( \lambda\ ) - translation of \( \textsf { B}\ ) ) , then the resulting term is \( \textsf { B}\ ) .
However , if \( \eta\ ) is omitted then a much longer term results , namely , \( \textsf{C}(\textsf{BB}(\textsf{BBI} ) ) ( \textsf{C} ( \textsf{ BBI} ) \textsf {
I} ) \ ) .
Another algorithm , for example , consists of clauses ( i ) , ( k ) and ( s ) .
3. Nonclassical logics and typed CL
3.1 Simple types
Combinatory terms are thought of as functions , and functions are thought to have a domain ( a set of possible inputs ) and a codomain ( a set of possible outputs ) .
For example , if a unary function is considered as a set of ordered pairs , then the domain and codomain are given by the first and second projections , respectively .
If partial and non -onto functions are permitted , then supersets of the sets resulting from the first and second projections can also be domains and codomains .
Category theory , where functions are components of categories ( without a set theoretic reduction assumed ) , retains the notions of a domain and a codomain ; moreover , every function has a unique domain and codomain .
Functions that have the same domain and codomain may be quite different , however , by abstraction , they are of the same sort or type .
As a simple illustration , let \ ( f_1 \ ) and \ ( f_2 \ ) be two functions defined as \( f_1 = \lambda x.\,8\cdot x\ ) and \( f_2=\lambda x.\,x/3\ ) .
If \( x\ ) is a variable ranging over reals , then \( f_1 \ ) and \ ( f_2 \ ) have the same domain and codomain ( i.e. , they have the same type \( \mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\ ) ) , although \( f_1
e f_2\ ) , because \ ( f_1 ( x )
e f_2 ( x ) \ ) whenever \(x
e0 \ ) .
The usual notation to indicate that a function \ ( f\ ) has \ ( A\ ) as its domain and \ ( B\ ) as its codomain is \ ( f\colon A\rightarrow B\ ) .
It is a happy coincidence that nowadays ‘ \( \rightarrow\ ) ’ is often used in logics as a symbol for entailment or ( nonclassical ) implication .
Given a set of basic types ( that we denote by \ ( P\ ) ) , types are defined as follows .
If \( p\in P\ ) then \ ( p\ ) is a type ; if \ ( A , B\ ) are types then \(( A\rightarrow B ) \ ) is a type .
To distinguish these types from other types — some of which are introduced in the next section — they are called simple types .
The connection between combinators and types may be explained on the example of the identity combinator .
Compound combinatory terms are formed by the application operation .
Premises of modus ponens can be joined by fusion ( denoted by \( \circ\ ) ) , which is like the application operation in the strongest relevance logic \ ( B\ ) . \( \textsf { I}x \triangleright x\ ) and so if \ ( x\ ) 's type is \ ( A\ ) , then \( \textsf { I}x\ ) 's type should imply \ ( A\ ) .
Furthermore , \( \textsf { I}x\ ) 's type should be of the form \ ( X\circ A\ ) , for some type \ ( X\ ) ; then \( \textsf { I}\ ) can be of type \( A\rightarrow A\ ) .
In the example , we fixed \ ( x\ ) 's type , however , \( \textsf { I}\ ) can be applied to any term , hence , it is more accurate to say that \( A\rightarrow A\ ) is the type schema of \( \textsf { I}\ ) , or that \( \textsf { I}\ ) 's type can be any formula of the form of self - implication .
The type - assignment system TA \ ( _\textrm {CL}\ ) is formally defined as the following deduction system .
( When implicational formulas are considered as types , the usual convention is to omit parentheses by association to the right . )
\[ \ Delta\vdash\textsf{S}\colon( A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C) \rightarrow ( A\rightarrow B ) \rightarrow A\rightarrow C \] \[ \ Delta\vdash\textsf{K}\colon A \rightarrow B\rightarrow A \] \[ \frac{ \Delta\vdash M\colon A\rightarrow B \quad \Theta\vdash N\colon A} { \Delta , \Theta\vdash MN\colon B} \]
Expressions of the form \( M\colon A\ ) above are called type assignments .
A characteristic feature of type - assignment systems is that if \( M\colon A\ ) is provable then \ ( A\ ) is considered to be one of the types that can be assigned to \ ( M\ ) .
However , a provable assignment does not preclude other types from becoming associated to the same term \ ( M\ ) , that is a type assignment does not fix the type of a term rigidly .
\( \Delta\ ) and \( \Theta\ ) on the left - hand side of \( \vdash\ ) are sets of type assignments to variables , and they are assumed to be consistent — meaning that no variable may be assigned two or more types .
Type assignment systems are often called Curry - style typing systems .
Another way to type terms is by fixing a type for each term , in which case each term has exactly one type .
Such calculi are called Church - style typing systems .
Then , for example , the identity combinator \( \textsf { I}\ ) of type
\[ ( A\rightarrow A\rightarrow A ) \rightarrow A\rightarrow A\rightarrow A \]
is not the same as the identity combinator \( \textsf { I}\ ) of type
\[ ( ( B \rightarrow B ) \rightarrow B ) \rightarrow ( B\rightarrow B ) \rightarrow B. \]
The two styles of typing have quite a lot in common , but there are certain differences between them .
In particular , no self - application is typable in a Church - style typing system , whereas some of those terms can be assigned a type in a Curry - style typing system .
Curry - style typing systems proved very useful in establishing various properties of CL and \( \lambda\ ) - calculi .
The Church - style typing , on the other hand , emulates more closely the typing in certain functional programming languages ( without objects ) .
There is no one - one correspondence between types and combinators in either style of typing : not all combinators can be assigned a type , and some implicational formulas cannot be assigned to any combinatory term .
A combinator that can be assigned a type is said to be typable , and a type that can be assigned to a combinator is said to be inhabited .
For instance , \( \textsf { M}\ ) has no ( simple ) type , because an implicational formula is never identical to its own antecedent .
On the other hand , Peirce 's law , \( (( A\rightarrow B ) \rightarrow A ) \rightarrow A\ ) is not the type of any combinator in the type assignment system TA \ ( _\textrm {CL}\ ) .
Despite ( or , indeed , due to ) the discrepancy between implicational formulas and combinatory terms , classes of implicational formulas that can be assigned to certain sets of combinatory terms coincide with sets of theorems of some important logics .
Theorem . \( A\rightarrow B\ ) is a theorem of the intuitionistic implicational logic , denoted by \ ( IPC_\rightarrow\ ) or \ ( J_\rightarrow\ ) , iff for some \ ( M\ ) , \( M\colon A\rightarrow B\ ) is a provable type assignment in TA \ ( _\textrm {CL}\ ) , where the term \ ( M\ ) is built from \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) , that is , \( M\ ) is a combinator over the base \( \{\textsf { S} , \textsf { K}\}\ ) .
A combinator that inhabits an implicational theorem encodes a proof of that theorem in the deduction system TA \ ( _\textrm {CL}\ ) .
There is an algorithm to recover the formulas that constitute a proof of the type of the combinator , moreover , the algorithm produces a proof that is minimal and well - structured .
The correspondence between implicational theorems of intuitionistic logic ( and their proofs ) and typable closed \( \lambda\ ) - terms ( or combinators ) is called the Curry –Howard isomorphism .
The usual notion of a proof in a Hilbert - style axiomatic system is quite lax , but it can be tidied up to obtain the notion of traversing proofs .
In a traversing proof there is a one - one correspondence between subterms of a combinator and the formulas in the traversing proof as well as between applications and detachments therein ( cf. Bimbó 2007 ) .
The above correspondence can be modified for other implicational logics and combinatory bases .
The next theorem lists correspondences that obtain between the implicational fragments of the relevance logics \ ( R\ ) and \ ( T\ ) and some combinatory bases that are of interest in themselves .
Theorem . \( A\rightarrow B\ ) is a theorem of \( R_{\rightarrow}\ ) ( or \( T_{\rightarrow} \ ) ) iff for some \ ( M\ ) , \( M\colon A\rightarrow B\ ) is a provable type assignment where \ ( M\ ) is a combinator over \( \{\textsf { B} , \ textsf{ I} , \textsf{W} , \textsf{C}\}\ ) ( or over \( \{\textsf { B} , \textsf { B}^\prime , \ textsf{ I} , \textsf{S} , \textsf{S}^\prime\}\ ) ) .
The calculus \( \textrm{TA}_\textrm{CL}\ ) may be amended by adding axiom schemas for the combinators in the two bases .
( The axiom schemas of the combinators that are not in these bases may be omitted from the calculus or simply may be neglected in proofs . )
The new axioms are as follows .
\ [ \begin{align*} \textsf{ B} &\colon ( A\rightarrow B ) \rightarrow ( C\rightarrow A ) \rightarrow C\rightarrow B \\ \textsf {
B}^\prime &\colon ( A\rightarrow B ) \rightarrow ( B\rightarrow C ) \rightarrow A\rightarrow C \\ \textsf {C} &\colon ( A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C ) \rightarrow B\rightarrow A\rightarrow C \\ \textsf {
W} &\colon ( A\rightarrow A\rightarrow B ) \rightarrow A\rightarrow B \\ \textsf {S}^\prime &\colon ( A\rightarrow B ) \rightarrow ( A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C ) \rightarrow A\rightarrow C \\ \textsf{
I} &\colon A\rightarrow A \end{align *}\ ]
The combinatory base \( \{\textsf { B} , \textsf{C} , \textsf{W} , \textsf{I}\}\ ) is especially interesting , because these combinators suffice for a definition of a bracket abstraction that is equivalent to the \( \lambda\ ) - abstraction of the \( \lambda\textsf {
I}\ ) - calculus .
To put it differently , all functions that depend on all of their arguments can be defined by this base .
The other base allows the definition of functions that can be described by terms in the class of the so - called hereditary right maximal terms ( cf. Bimbó 2005 ) .
Informally , the idea behind these terms is that functions can be enumerated , and then their successive applications should form a sequence in which the indexes are “ globally increasing . ”
A type assignment has two parts : a term and a formula .
The questions whether some term can be assigned a type and whether some type can be assigned to a term are the problems of typability and of inhabitation , respectively .
Although these questions may be posed about one and the same set of type assignments , the computational properties of these problems may differ widely .
Theorem .
It is decidable if a term \ ( M\ ) can be assigned a type , that is , if \ ( M\ ) is typable .
The theorem is stated in a rather general way without specifying exactly which combinatory base or which modification of TA \ ( _\textrm {CL}\ ) is assumed , because the theorem holds for any combinatory base .
Indeed , there is an algorithm that given a combinator decides if the combinator is typable , and for a typable combinator produces a type too .
Of course , in the combinatorially complete base \( \{\textsf { S} , \textsf {K}\}\ ) all the combinators are expressible as terms consisting of these two combinators only .
However , this assumption is not needed for a solution of typability , though it might provide an explanation for the existence of a general algorithm .
The problem of inhabitation does not have a similar general solution , because the problem of the equality of combinatory terms is undecidable .
Given a set of axiom schemas that are types of combinators with detachment as the rule of inference , the problem of the decidability of a logic can be viewed as the problem of inhabitation .
Indeed , if \ ( A\ ) is an implicational formula , then to decide whether \ ( A\ ) is a theorem amounts to determining if there is a term ( over the base that corresponds to the axiom schemas ) that can be assigned \ ( A\ ) as its type .
( Of course , a more sophisticated algorithm may actually produce such a term , in which case it is easy to verify the correctness of the claim by reconstructing the proof of the theorem . )
To see from where complications can emerge in the case of decidability , we compare the rule of the formation of terms and the rule of detachment .
Given a combinatory base and a denumerable set of variables , it is decidable by inspection whether a term is or is not in the set of the generated terms .
That is , all the inputs of the rule are retained in the output as subterms of the resulting term .
In contrast , an application of detachment results in a formula that is a proper subformula of the major premise ( and in the exceptional case when the major premise is an instance of self - identity it is identical to the minor premise ) .
The lack of the retention of all subformulas of premises through applications of modus ponens is the culprit behind the difficulty of some of the decision problems of implicational logics .
It is then somewhat unsurprising that for many decidable logics there is a decision procedure utilizing sequent calculi in which the cut theorem and the subformula property hold .
A solution to the problem of inhabitation may run into difficulties similar to those that arise in decidability problems in general .
For example , the combinator \( \textsf { K}\ ) can be assigned the following type .
\ [ p\rightarrow ( q\rightarrow ( q\rightarrow q\rightarrow q ) \rightarrow ( q \rightarrow q ) \rightarrow q\rightarrow q ) \rightarrow p \]
\( \textsf{SKK}\ ) can be assigned the type \( p\rightarrow p\ ) .
There is a proof in TA \ ( _\textrm {CL}\ ) ending in \( \textsf{SKK}\colon p\rightarrow p\ ) that does not contain the long formula above .
However , there is a proof of \( \textsf{SKK}\colon p\rightarrow p\ ) that contains the above formula the second antecedent of which is not a subformula of \ ( p\rightarrow p\ ) , indeed , the sets of the subformulas of the two formulas are disjoint .
( We picked two different propositional variables , \ ( p\ ) and \ ( q\ ) to emphasize this point . )
Some important cases of the problem of inhabitation , however , are decidable .
Theorem .
It is decidable if a type has an inhabitant over the base \( \{\textsf { S} , \textsf { K}\}\ ) .
This theorem amounts to the typed version of the decidability of the implicational fragment of intuitionistic logic that is part of Gentzen 's decidability result ( dating from 1935 ) .
Theorem .
It is decidable if a type has an inhabitant over the base \( \{\textsf { I} , \textsf{C} , \textsf{ B}^\prime , \textsf{ W}\}\ ) .
The theorem is the typed equivalent of the decidability of the implicational fragment of the logic of relevant implication .
The decidability of \( R_{\rightarrow}\ ) was proved by Saul A. Kripke in 1959 together with the decidability of the closely related \( E_{\rightarrow}\ ) ( the implicational fragment of the logic of entailment ) .
Theorem .
It is decidable if a type has an inhabitant over the base \( \{\textsf { B} , \textsf { B}^\prime , \textsf{ I} , \textsf{ W}\}\ ) .
the theorem is the typed version of the decidability of the implicational fragment of the logic of ticket entailment \( T_\rightarrow\ ) , that was proved — together with the decidability of \( R_\rightarrow\ ) ( \( R_\rightarrow\ ) with the truth constant \ ( t\ ) ) and \( T_\rightarrow^\textbf{t} \ ) ( \( T_\rightarrow\ ) with the truth constant \ ( t\ ) ) — in Bimbó and Dunn ( 2012 ) and Bimbó and Dunn ( 2013 ) .
An independent result ( for \( T_\rightarrow\ ) only ) is in Padovani ( 2013 ) , which extends Broda et al. ( 2004 ) .
The decision procedures for \ ( T_\rightarrow^\textbf{t}\ ) and \ ( R_\rightarrow^\textbf{t}\ ) do not use \( \textrm {TA}_\textrm{CL}\ ) or axiomatic calculi , instead , they build upon consecution calculi ( i.e. , sequent calculi in which the structural connective is not assumed to be associative ) .
The idea that there is an affinity between structural rules and combinators goes back at least to Curry ( 1963 ) .
To tighten the connection , Dunn and Meyer ( 1997 ) introduced structurally free logics in which introduction rules for combinators replace structural rules — hence the label for these logics .
Bimbó and Dunn ( 2014 ) introduced a technique to generate a combinatory inhabitant for theorems of \( T_\rightarrow\ ) from their standard proofs in the sequent calculus , which is used in the decision procedure for \ ( T_\rightarrow^\textbf{t}\ ) .
Sequent calculi provide better control over proofs than natural deduction or axiomatic systems do .
The combinatory extraction procedure of Bimbó and Dunn ( 2014 ) yields an effective link between combinators and types grounded in sequent calculus proofs , which obviates the apparent advantage of \( \textrm { TA}_\textrm{CL}\ ) and axiomatic systems .
The rule of substitution is built - in into the formulation of \( \textrm { TA}_\textrm{CL}\ ) via the rule schema called detachment and the axiom schemas for the basic combinators .
It is obvious that there are formulas of least complexity that are types of \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf { K}\ ) , such that all the other types of \( \textsf { S}\ ) and \( \textsf {K}\ ) are their substitution instances .
A formula that has this property is called a principal type of a combinator .
Obviously , a combinator that has a principal type , has denumerably many principal types , which are all substitution instances of each other ; hence , it is justified to talk about the principal type schema of a combinator .
The existence of principal types for complex combinators is not obvious , nevertheless , obtains .
Theorem .
If the term \ ( M\ ) is typable , then \ ( M\ ) has a principal type and a principal type schema .
Principal types and principal type schemas may seem now to be interchangeable everywhere .
Thus we could take a slightly different approach and define \( \textrm { TA}_\textrm{CL}\ ) to include axioms and the rule schema of detachment together with the rule of substitution .
This version of \( \textrm{TA}_\textrm{CL}\ ) would assume the following form .
\[ \ Delta\vdash\textsf {S}\colon ( p \rightarrow q\rightarrow s) \rightarrow(p\rightarrow q)\rightarrow p\rightarrow s \] \[ \ Delta\vdash\textsf{K}\colon q\rightarrow s\rightarrow q \ ] \[ \frac{ \Delta\vdash M\colon A\rightarrow B\qquad \ Theta\vdash N\colon A} { \Delta , \Theta\vdash MN\colon B} \ ] \[ \frac{ \Delta\vdash M\colon A} { \Delta [ P / B] \vdash M\colon A[ P / B ]} \]
where \( P\ ) ranges over propositional variables .
( The substitution notation is extended — in the obvious way — to sets of type assignments . )
Clearly , the two deduction systems are equivalent .
If substitution were dropped altogether , then the applicability of detachment would become extremely limited , for instance , \( \textsf { SK}\ ) no longer would be typable .
A compromise between having substitution everywhere and having no substitution at all is to modify the detachment rule so that that includes as much substitution as necessary to ensure the applicability of the detachment rule .
Such a rule ( without combinatory terms or type assignments ) was invented in the 1950s by Carew A. Meredith , and it is usually called condensed detachment .
The key to the applicability of detachment is to find a common substitution instance of the minor premise and of the antecedent of the major premise .
This step is called unification .
( A bit more formally , let \ ( s ( A ) \ ) denote the application of the substitution \ ( s\ ) to \ ( A\ ) .
Then , the result of the condensed detachment of \ ( A\ ) from \ ( B\rightarrow C\ ) is \ ( s ( C ) \ ) , when there is an \ ( s\ ) such that \ ( s ( A ) = s( B ) \ ) , and for any \ ( s_1 \ ) with this property , there is an \ ( s_2 \ ) such that \( s_1\ ) is the composition of \ ( s\ ) and \( s_2 \ ) . )
Notice that it is always possible to choose substitution instances of a pair of formulas so that the sets of their propositional variables are disjoint , because formulas are finite objects .
The most general common instance of two formulas \ ( A\ ) and \ ( B\ ) ( that do not share a propositional variable ) is \ ( C\ ) , where \( C\ ) is a substitution instance of both \ ( A\ ) and \ ( B\ ) , and propositional variables are identified by the substitutions only if the identification is necessary to obtain a formula that is a substitution instance of both \ ( A\ ) and \ ( B\ ) .
The unification theorem ( specialized to simple types ) implies that if two formulas \ ( A\ ) and \ ( B\ ) have a common instance then there is a formula \ ( C\ ) such that all the common instances of \ ( A\ ) and \ ( B\ ) are substitution instances of \ ( C\ ) .
Obviously , a pair of formulas either has no common instance at all , or it has \( \aleph_0\ ) many most general common instances .
A famous example of a pair of formulas that have no common instance is \ ( A\rightarrow A\ ) and \( A\rightarrow A\rightarrow B\ ) .
The instances \( p \rightarrow p\ ) and \ ( q\rightarrow q\rightarrow r\ ) share no propositional variables , however , neither \( q\rightarrow q\ ) nor \(( q\rightarrow r) \rightarrow q\rightarrow r\ ) matches the shape of the second formula .
To put the problem differently , \ ( q\ ) and \ ( q\rightarrow r\ ) would have to be unified , but they can not be unified no matter what formula is substituted for \ ( q\ ) .
An immediate consequence of this is that \( \textsf {WI}\ ) is not typable .
On the other hand ,
\ [ ( r\rightarrow r) \rightarrow r\rightarrow r \ ]
and
\ [ ( ( s\rightarrow s) \rightarrow s\rightarrow s) \rightarrow ( s \rightarrow s ) \rightarrow s\rightarrow s \ ]
are substitution instances of \ ( p\rightarrow p\ ) and of \( q\rightarrow q\ ) .
Furthermore , all simple types are substitution instances of a propositional variable , hence \( \textsf { II}\ ) can be assigned both the type \ ( r\rightarrow r\ ) and the type ( \( s\rightarrow s ) \rightarrow s\rightarrow s\ ) — and , of course , the latter happens to be an instance of the former because \ ( A\rightarrow A\ ) is the principal type schema of \( \textsf{ II}\ ) .
If we apply condensed detachment to \ ( p\rightarrow p\ ) and \( q\rightarrow q\ ) , then we get \( q\rightarrow q\ ) ( via the substitutions \ ( [ p/ q\rightarrow q ] \ ) and \ ( [ q / q ] ) \ ) , and so condensed detachment yields the principal type of \( \textsf{ II}\ ) .
Incidentally , \( \textsf{II}\ ) and \( \textsf { I}\ ) provide an excellent example to illustrate that distinct terms may have the same principal type schema .
Condensed detachment has been used extensively to refine axiomatizations of various implicational logics , especially , in search for shorter and fewer axioms .
Some logics may be formulated using axioms ( rather than axiom schemas ) together with the rule of condensed detachment — without loss of theorems .
All the logics that we mentioned so far ( \( J_{\rightarrow}\ ) , \( R_{\rightarrow}\ ) , \( T_{\rightarrow}\ ) and \ ( E_{\rightarrow}\ ) ) are \( \mathbf { D}\ ) - complete , that is , they all may be axiomatized by axioms and the rule of condensed detachment .
That is , the implicational fragments of classical and intuitionistic logics , and the implicational fragments of the relevance logics \ ( R\ ) , \ ( E\ ) and \ ( T\ ) are all \( \mathbf { D}\ ) - complete .
( See Bimbó ( 2007 ) for some further technical details . )
Simply typed systems has been extended in various directions .
Logics often contain connectives beyond implication .
It is a natural modification of a type assignment system to expand the set of types via including further type constructors .
Conjunction and fusion are the easiest to explain or motivate as type constructors , however , disjunction and backward implication have been introduced into types too .
Types are useful , because they allow us to get a grip on classes of terms from the point of view of their behavior with respect to reduction .
Tait 's theorem .
If a combinatory term \ ( M\ ) is typable ( with simple types ) then \ ( M\ ) strongly normalizes , that is , all reduction sequences of \ ( M\ ) are finite ( i.e. , terminate ) .
The converse of this claim is , obviously , not true .
For example , \( \textsf{WI}\ ) strongly normalizes but untypable , because the antecedent of contraction cannot be unified with any instance of self - implication .
The aim to extend the set of typable terms led to the introduction of \ ( \land\ ) into types .
3.2 Intersection types
A different way to look at the problem of typing \( \textsf { WI}\ ) is to say that \( \textsf { W}\ ) should have a type similar to the formula \(( A\rightarrow ( A\rightarrow B ) ) \rightarrow A\rightarrow B\ ) , but in which the formulas in place of the two formulas \ ( A\ ) and \( A\rightarrow B\ ) in the antecedent can be unified .
This is the motivation for the inclusion of conjunction ( \( \land\ ) ) and top ( \( \top\ ) ) as new type constructors .
An extended type system , that is often called the intersection type discipline , is due to Mario Coppo and Mariangiola Dezani -Ciancaglini .
The set of intersection types ( denoted by wff ) is defined as follows .
\( p\in\textrm{wff}\ ) if \ ( p\ ) is a propositional variable ; \( \top\in\textrm{wff}\ ) , where \( \top\ ) is a constant proposition ; \( A , B\in\textrm{wff}\ ) implies \(( A\rightarrow B ) , ( A\land B ) \in \ textrm{wff}\ ) .
Of course , if TA \ ( _\textrm {CL}\ ) is augmented with an expanded set of types , then new instances of the previously assigned types become available .
However , the gist of having types with the new type constructors \( \land\ ) and \ ( \top\ ) is that the set of types has a richer structure than the relationships between types determined by the rules of substitution and modus ponens .
The structure of intersection types is described by the conjunction–implication fragment of \ ( B\ ) , the basic relevance logic .
In the following presentation of this logic , \ ( \le\ ) is the main connective ( an implication ) of a formula and \( \Rightarrow\ ) separates the premises and the conclusion of an inference rule .
\[ \begin{align*} A\le A\qquad A\le\ , &\ , \top\qquad\top\le\top\to\top\\
A\le A\land A\qquad A\land B&\;\le A\qquad A\land B\le B\\ A\le B , \, B\le C&\ ; \Rightarrow A\le C \\ A\le B , \, C\le D\Rightarrow&\ ; A\land C\le B\land D \\ ( A\rightarrow B ) \land ( A\rightarrow C ) \le&\ ;( A\rightarrow ( B\land C ) ) \\ A\le B , \, C\le D\Rightarrow&\ ; B\rightarrow C\le A \rightarrow D \end{align *}\ ]
The axiom schemas for the combinators \( \textsf { S}\ ) , \( \textsf {K}\ ) and \( \textsf { I}\ ) are as follows .
Note that the axiom for \( \textsf { S}\ ) is not simply a substitution instance ( with new connectives included ) of the previous axiom for \( \textsf { S}\ ) .
\[ \ Delta\vdash\textsf{S}\colon( A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C) \rightarrow ( D\rightarrow B ) \rightarrow ( A\land D) \rightarrow C \] \[ \ Delta\vdash \textsf {K}\colon A\rightarrow B\rightarrow A \qquad \ Delta\vdash \textsf {I}\colon A\rightarrow A \]
There are four new rules added , and there is an axiom for \( \top\ ) .
\[ \frac{ \Delta\vdash M\colon A\quad \Delta\vdash M\colon B} { \Delta\vdash M\colon A\land B} \quad \frac{ \Delta\vdash M\colon A\land B} { \Delta\vdash M\colon
A} \quad \frac{ \Delta\vdash M\colon A\land B} { \ Delta\vdash M\colon B} \ ] \[ \frac{ \Delta\vdash M\colon A\qquad A\le B B} { \Delta\vdash M\colon B} \quad \ Delta\vdash M\colon\top \]
This type assignment system is equivalent to the intersection type assignment system for the \ ( \lambda\ ) - calculus , and it allows a more precise characterization of classes of terms with respect to the termination of reduction sequences .
Theorem .
(1) A term \ ( M\ ) normalizes whenever \ ( M\ ) is typable .
(2) A term \ ( M\ ) strongly normalizes whenever \ ( M\ ) is typable and the proof does not contain \( \top\ ) .
4. Models
CL has various kinds of models , three of which are exemplified in some detail in this section .
Algebraic models ( often called “ term models ” ) may be constructed without difficulty for both the inequational and the equational systems of CL that were introduced in section 2.1 .
The set of terms forms an algebra , and given a suitable equivalence relation ( that is also a congruence ) , the application operation can be lifted to the equivalence classes of terms in the standard way .
The quasi-inequational characterization of the so obtained algebra provides the basis for an algebraic semantics for these logics .
Isolating the Lindenbaum algebra and verifying that it is not a trivial algebra constitutes a consistency proof for \( \text {CL}_\triangleright\ ) and \( \text {CL}_=\ ) .
4.1 Scott 's models
Dana Scott defined \( P\omega\ ) and \( D_\infty\ ) for the \( \lambda\ ) - calculus .
We first outline \( P\omega\ ) — the so - called graph model , which is easier to understand .
The natural numbers have a very rich structure .
\( P\omega\ ) is the power set of the set of natural numbers and it is at the core of the model bearing the same label .
Every natural number has a unique representation in base \ ( 2\ ) .
( E.g. , \ ( 7_ {10}\ ) is \( 111\ ) , that is , \( 7=1\cdot2^2+1\cdot2^1+1\cdot 2^0=4+2+1\ ) .)
Each binary representation is of the form
\ [ b_m\cdot2^m+b_{m-1} \cdot2^{m-1}+\cdots+b_1\cdot 2^1+b_0\cdot2^0 , \]
where each \ ( b\ ) is \ ( 0 \ ) or \ ( 1\ ) .
Then each binary number may be viewed as the characteristic function of a finite subset of natural numbers .
( On the left , there are infinitely many zeros , as in \ ( \ldots000111\ ) , which are omitted . )
For a natural number \ ( n\ ) , \( e_n\ ) denotes the corresponding finite set of natural numbers .
( E.g. , \( e_7=\{0,1,2\}\ ) . )
The positive topology on \ ( P\omega\ ) comprises finitely generated open sets .
Let \( E\ ) denote the finite subsets of \ ( \omega\ ) .
\( X\subseteq P\omega\ ) is open iff \ ( X\ ) is a cone ( with respect to \( \subseteq\ ) ) generated by a subset of \ ( E\ ) .
Given the positive topology , a function \ ( f\colon P\omega\rightarrow P\omega\ ) turns out to be continuous ( in the usual topological sense ) iff \ ( f( x ) =\cup\{f ( e_n ) \colon e_n\subseteq x\}\ ) , where \( e_n\in E\ ) .
This means that \( m\in f( x ) \ ) iff \( \exists e_n\subseteq x.\ , m\in f( e_n ) \ ) , which leads to a characterization of a continuous function \ ( f\ ) by the pairs of natural numbers \ ( ( n , m ) \ ) .
A one - one correspondence between ( ordered ) pairs of natural numbers and natural numbers is defined by
\ [ ( n , m ) = \ frac{ [ ( n+m ) \cdot(n+m+1 ) ] + 2 \cdot m} { 2} \]
The set of pairs that constitute a ( unary ) function is sometimes called the graph of the function .
The graph of a continuous function \ ( f\colon P\omega\rightarrow P\omega\ ) is defined by \( \textrm{graph} ( f ) =\{ ( n , m ) \colon m\in f( e_n ) \}\ ) .
In order to be able to model type - free application — including self - application — subsets of \ ( \omega\ ) should be viewed as functions too .
For \( x , y\subseteq\omega\ ) , the function determined by \ ( y\ ) is defined as \( \textrm{fun} (y ) ( x ) =\{m\colon \exists e_n\subseteq x.\ , ( n , m ) \in y\}\ ) .
For a continuous function \ ( f\ ) , \( \textrm{fun} ( \textrm{graph} ( f ) ) =f\ ) holds .
The graph model of CL maps terms into subsets of \ ( \omega\ ) .
To start with , the combinators have concrete sets as their interpretations .
As a simple example , \( \textsf { I}= \{( n , m ) \colon m\in e_n\}\ ) .
Of course , each pair corresponds to an element of \ ( \omega\ ) , hence , we get a set of natural numbers .
In particular , some of the elements are \( \{1,6,7,11,15,23,29,30 , \ldots\}\ ) .
If the combinators ( as well as the variables ) are interpreted as subsets of \ ( \omega\ ) , then function application should take the first set ( viewed as a function of type \( P\omega\rightarrow P\omega ) \ ) and apply that to the second set .
\( \textrm{fun} (y ) \ ) is a suitable function that is determined by \(y \ subseteq\omega\ ) .
In general , if \ ( M\ ) and \ ( N\ ) are CL - terms , and \ ( I\ ) is the interpretation of atomic terms into \ ( P\omega\ ) , then \( I\ ) is extended to compound terms by \ ( I ( MN ) =\textrm{fun} ( I ( M ) ) ( I ( N ) ) \ ) .
( E.g. , let \ ( I ( x ) \ ) be \( e_9=\ { 0,3\}\ ) .
\( I ( \textsf{ I}x ) =\textrm{fun}( I( \textsf{I} ) ) ( I( x ) ) =\{m\colon \exists e_n\subseteq I ( x ) .\ , ( n , m ) \in I ( \textsf {
I} ) \}\ ) .
We know what \( I ( \textsf { I} ) \ ) and \ ( I ( x ) \ ) are ; hence , we get further that \( I ( \textsf { I}x ) = \{m\colon\exists e_n\subseteq e_9.\ , m\in e_n\}\ ) .
Of course , \( \{ 0,3\} \subseteq \ {0,3\}\ ) , and so we have that \( I ( \textsf { I}x ) =\{0,3\}\ ) . )
This model supports an intensional notion of functions .
The earliest model for a typefree applicative system as a function space was also given by Scott , a couple of years before the graph model , in the late 60s .
The following is an outline of some of the key elements of the construction .
In pure typefree CL , an expression of the form \( MM\ ) is a well - formed term .
Moreover , terms of this form can enter into provable equations and inequations in multiple ways .
For example , \( xx=xx\ ) is an axiom , and by one of the rules , \ ( y ( xx ) =y ( xx ) \ ) is provable too .
A more interesting occurrence of a term of the form \ ( MM\ ) can be seen in the provable inequation \( \textsf {S} ( \textsf{ SKK} ) ( \textsf{SKK}) x\triangleright xx\ ) .
The set - theoretic reduction of a function yields a set of pairs ( in general , a set of tuples ) .
In set theory ( assuming well - foundedness , of course ) a pair ( e.g. , \( \{\{ a\} , \{ a , b\}\}\ ) ) is never identical to either of its two elements .
Therefore , the main question concerning a mathematical model of CL is how to deal with self - application .
Scott 's original model is built starting with a complete lattice \ ( ( D , \le ) \ ) .
That is , \ ( ( D , \le ) \ ) is a partially ordered set in which greatest lower bounds ( infima ) and least upper bounds ( suprema ) exist for arbitrary sets of elements .
A function \ ( f\ ) from \ ( ( D , \le ) \ ) into a complete lattice \ ( ( E , \le ) \ ) is said to be continuous when it preserves the supremum of each ideal on \ ( D\ ) , where an ideal is an upward directed downward closed subset .
A topology may be defined on \ ( D\ ) by selecting certain increasing sets as the opens .
More precisely , if \ ( I\ ) is an ideal and \ ( C\ ) is a cone , then \ ( C\ ) is open iff \( C\cap I
e\emptyset\ ) provided that \( \bigvee I\in C\ ) , that is , provided that the supremum of \ ( I\ ) is an element of \ ( C\ ) .
( For example , complements of principal ideals are open . ) \ ( f\ ) turns out to be continuous in the usual topological sense , that is , the inverse image of an open set is open , when \ ( D\ ) and \ ( E\ ) are taken together with their topologies .
This motivates the earlier labeling of these functions as continuous .
Notably , all continuous functions are monotone .
For the purposes of modeling functions in CL , the interesting functions are those that are continuous on \ ( D\ ) .
However , these functions by themselves are not sufficient to obtain a modeling of self - application , because none of them has as its domain a set of functions — as \ ( D\ ) is not assumed to be a function space .
The solution starts with defining a hierarchy of function spaces \ ( D_0\ ) , \( D_1\ ) , \( D_2 , \ldots \ ) so that each function space \ ( D_n\ ) , is a complete lattice on which continuous functions may be defined ( creating the function space \ ( D_{n + 1} \ ) ) .
The importance of selecting continuous functions is that the emerging function space has the same cardinality as the underlying set , which allows us to define embeddings between function spaces adjacent within the hierarchy .
The hierarchy of all the function spaces \ ( D_n\ ) may be accumulated together .
A standard construction in model theory is to form the disjoint union of structures .
( Disjointness can always be guaranteed by indexing the carrier sets of the structures . )
Scott defined \( D_\infty\ ) to be the disjoint union of the function spaces \ ( D_n\ ) , for all \( n\ ) , except that the extremal elements are “ glued together . ”
( More formally , the top elements and the bottom elements of the function spaces , respectively , are identified with each other . ) \( D_\infty\ ) is a complete lattice , and by Tarski's fixed point theorem , a continuous function that maps \( D_\infty \ ) into \( D_\infty \ ) has a fixed point , which implies that \( D _\infty\ ) is isomorphic to \( D_\infty\rightarrow D_\infty \ ) .
The above construction may also be conceptualized in terms of strings and Cartesian products .
The back - and - forth moves between functions of one and more than one variable — the “ uncurrying ” and “ currying ” of functions — algebraically corresponds to the two directions of residuation .
For example , a function \( f\colon A\times B\rightarrow C\ ) may be represented by a function \( f^\prime \colon A \rightarrow B\rightarrow C\ ) , and vice versa .
Thus , without loss of generality , it is sufficient to consider unary functions .
If \( a\ ) is a fixed element of the function space \ ( D_\infty\ ) , then \(x = ( a , x ) \ ) holds when \ ( x\ ) is the fixed point of \ ( a\ ) .
In terms of tuples , the solution may be viewed as the infinite tuple \(( a , ( a , ( a
Over 90 % of email is spam
The closure of a web hosting firm that is believed to have had spam gangs as clients has led to a drastic reduction in junk mail .
Two US internet service providers have pulled the plug on the firm McColo following an investigation by the Washington Post newspaper .
Anti-spam firm Ironport has seen junk mail levels drop by 70 % since McColo was taken offline on 11 November .
But , it warned , it will be a temporary respite from the menace of spam .
Plug pulled " It is an unprecedented drop but will be a temporary outage as the networks move from North America to places where there is less scrutiny , " said Jason Steer , a spokesman for Ironport .
The Washington Post has been gathering data on McColo for the past four months and passed the information to its internet service providers , Global Crossing and Hurricane Electric .
Both decided to pull the plug on the firm on Tuesday .
It is believed that it hosted gangs running botnets - networks of computers that have been taken over by criminals to send malicious software and spam .
According to MessageLabs , botnets are responsible for over 90 % of spam .
Increasingly the tech industry is fighting back .
" All the US internet peering companies are under much more scrutiny .
The authorities and the internet community have woken up to the problem , " said Mr Steer .
But while it might make criminals think more carefully about what they do , it will not stop them , he thinks .
" Spam levels will come back to normal as we build up to Thanksgiving and Christmas , " he said .
A recent study by computer scientists from the University of California , Berkeley and UC , San Diego ( UCSD ) found that spammers manage to turn a profit despite only getting one response to every 12.5 m emails they send .

Officials doubted someone could have walked away from the crash
The wreckage of a plane found near the town of Mammoth Lakes in California does belong to missing US adventurer Steve Fossett , officials say .
A number plate confirmed the plane as the Bellanca Super Decathlon piloted by the 63 - year - old millionaire .
Body parts are reported to have been found inside .
The search began after a hiker found items thought to belong to Mr Fossett .
He vanished in September last year on a solo flight that took off 90 miles ( 145 km ) away in neighbouring Nevada .

A wide - ranging search operation conducted since then had failed to find any trace of Mr Fossett or his plane and he was officially declared dead in February .
Fuselage shattered Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said the wreckage had been spotted late on Wednesday during an aerial search of a stretch of the Sierra Nevada mountains near Mammoth Lakes .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .

" The crash looked so severe I doubt if someone would have walked away from it , " he said .
Most of the fuselage had disintegrated , with engine parts scattered several hundred feet away .
Mr Anderson initially said no human remains had been found at the crash site .
" It 's quite often if you do n't find remains within a few days , because of animals , you 'll find nothing at all , " he said .

But reports later said that some remains had been found in the aircraft and would be sent for DNA analysis .
Fifty people and five dog teams would carry out an extensive search of the site for Mr Fossett 's remains , he added .
On Thursday British entrepreneur Richard Branson paid tribute to his friend and fellow adventurer .
" The most important thing is that the family know what 's happened , " he said .
" He led an extraordinary , absolutely remarkable life , and now we can remember him for what he was and move on . "
The National Transportation Safety Board will be responsible for examining the wreckage .
But a local official said snow was expected over the weekend , potentially hampering the investigation .
The wreckage was located two days after identity documents bearing Mr Fossett 's name - including a pilot 's licence - as well as cash and a sweatshirt were found by hiker Preston Morrow .
Mr Morrow had been returning from a mountain walk when he spotted the items in dirt and pine needles west of Mammoth Lakes .
An employee at a sporting goods store , Mr Morrow said he handed them over to police after unsuccessful attempts to contact the Fossett family .
The BBC's Rajesh Mirchandani , in Los Angeles , says the items were found outside the vast area searched after Mr Fossett went missing - and also in a different direction to that in which he was thought to have flown .
Mr Fossett took off from the ranch of hotel magnate Barron Hilton , south of Yerington , Nevada , on 3 September 2007 on a flight that was expected to last three hours .
In 2002 , he became the first person to circle the globe solo in a balloon and had about 100 other world records to his name .

There are 800 fewer armed police now than five years ago
Despite rocketing gun crime , the number of police officers wanting to be routinely armed has risen just 1 % in eight years , a survey has suggested .
Police Federation figures show 78 % of police officers do not want to carry guns , compared to 79 % in 1995 .
The survey also revealed that 47 % of frontline officers in England and Wales backed mandatory wearing of body armour and eight out of 10 said more officers should be trained to use firearms .
Federation chairman Jan Berry said : " Once again this result proves that , in spite of huge risks and dangers police officers face , they acknowledge the vital importance of policing by consent , in partnership with the communities they serve .
Gun crime
" They recognise that openly carrying guns would fundamentally change their relationship with the public . "
The news comes after a police union raised concerns over a drop in the number of officers trained to use firearms .
The Police Federation said there were currently only 5,700 officers trained to use guns , compared with 6,500 five years ago .
This has led to fears that officers face an increased risk from armed criminals .
" When gun crime and violence are going up alarmingly , to see that huge reduction is extremely worrying , " said the federation chairman .
Police Federation survey 22 % in favour of being routinely armed 80 % want more officers trained and issued with firearms 47 % favour the mandatory wearing of body armour 40 % injured at least once in two years after an assault by a member of the public
" We need to try to establish why there has been this reduction and ensure that officers on the street have the right levels of safety and security . "
Some believed the survey would show a large rise in the number of officers wanting to carry guns as a matter of routine following a dramatic increase in gun crime .
In 2002 there were nearly 10,000 gun offences - an increase of a third on the previous year .
But the results , announced at the Police Federation conference in Blackpool on Monday , showed the vast majority of 13,000 officers who responded to the survey opposed routinely carrying guns .
' Less back - up '
The Police Superintendents ' Association , which represents senior policing staff , has said it does not want to see all officers armed .
Spokesman Kevin Morris said : " We have a pretty firm position that we do n't feel that we should be armed on a routine basis .
" It is disturbing that the number of officers trained to carry weapons has fallen , which of course means our officers on the beat have got less back - up , and that really needs to be addressed .
" We train to a very high standard in the UK but we do n't routinely arm .
" That would mean something like 125,000 more officers would need to be trained , and some would fail . "
Gun crime facts
Gun crime up 35 % in 2002 Firearms used in 9,974 recorded crimes
Gun crime up 600 % since 1978 Handgun crimes have doubled since Dunblane
Tony Banks , Labour MP in Newham , east London , said arming all police officers could deter criminals .
He told BBC Radio 5 Live : " Guns are almost a fashion accessory among certain sections of the community .
" You would n't have an open gunfight in the street or wander around letting people see you had a gun , if you thought you might find yourself confronting an armed police officer . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Simon Hughes said : " Unless we reduce the numbers of guns and knives on the streets it will be increasingly difficult to resist calls for more and more armed police .
" [ But ] armed police on our streets must remain the exception and not the rule . "
Fascinating question !
It comes down to the classic conflict between youth and age .
" Tokio Hotel " are young , so that could be an advantage , since the current lineup of Iron Maiden are basically really old .
Dave Murray is about 52 and has pretty skinny arms , but I think he could easily take out Bill and Tom Kaulitz , probably with little effort , since they are basically built like a couple of 12 year old girls .
Nicko McBrain is even older , 56 , but the guy is a total badass and could make the members of Tokio Hotel cry , just by making a scary face at them .
If he actually shouted , they 'd pee themselves .
The thing is , McBrain became a Christian in 1999 and would n't do such a thing to a group so weak and helpless as T.H .
Bruce Dickinson ( now 50 ) used to be pretty messed up , but he got disgusted with himself after drunkenly eating leftovers from random trays in , get this , a Tokyo hotel ( no lie ) that he cleaned up his act , became a jet pilot and recently rescued 200 people stranded in Egypt , not to be confused with the time he flew a 747 full of soldiers out of Afghanistan .
Believe me : You Do Not Want To Mess With This Guy .
So , I think it would be no contest .
To win any battle , you need to take out the leaders and that 's definitely Tokio Hotel 's weakest point .
The Kaulitz twins wear wigs , makeup and nail polish and exist only to tap into the lucrative demographic of gender - confused young people .
If you eliminated the Kaulitz Twins , there 'd be no band .
( Nobody cares about the other two guys or even knows their names . )
Iron Maiden , on the other hand , has shown their ability to survive any change .
They 've had at least ten members , including five different lead singers .
They had hits that were already oldies when the members of Tokio Hotel were in diapers .
You just can't kill Iron Maiden .
Tokio Hotel , on the other hand are one bad hair day away from falling apart as a band .
Even though I just watched a video of theirs on YouTube moments ago , I can't remember anything about it , except thinking that they must be idiots to leap * up * when jumping from a helicopter .
In five years , nobody will admit to ever having been into Tokio Hotel , while Iron Maiden is still as amazing as ever after 32 years .
So , if it came down to it and they actually did get together to fight , Iron Maiden would crush Tokio Hotel into the worthless little heap of weeping little boys that they are .
By the way , your question has nothing to do with this section of Yahoo !
Answers .
I wish I had never heard of this band , but since people keep talking about them here , unfortunately I do .
It certainly had the look of a revolution .
Across the country , Republican stalwarts were kicked out of office .
States that had not voted Democrat in a generation turned blue .
In city after city , tens of thousands of people took to the streets .
At the gates of the White House , a crowd gathered and shouted : ' Obama ! Obama !'
Now , as America faces up to the fact that Barack Obama will be its next president , many are wondering at the scale of the political changes that his remarkable campaign has wrought .
Some are talking of a second New Deal .
They see an opportunity for the Democrats to transform America .
They plot a Democratic dominance of US politics for at least a decade .
It truly is out with the old and in with the new .
The cold numbers seem to back that argument .
Obama has become the first Democrat since 1976 to win with more than 50 per cent of the vote .
He returned the Democrats to power in the Deep South , the Midwest and the Rocky Mountains .
The Democrats are a party of the whole country again .
The Republicans look like a rump .
During the campaign , the Republican attack machine called him a Marxist and a socialist .
He was a tax - and - spend Democrat ; he was the most liberal politician in the Senate ; he was a dangerous radical .
And yet Americans voted for him .
Not only that , they turned out in huge numbers and queued for hours to elect the first black President .
' This is a fundamental change .
It was totally unpredictable , even just a year ago , ' said David Peritz , a political scientist at Sarah Lawrence College in New York .
That has liberal America licking its lips .
Obama ran on a one - word slogan - change - and it is change his supporters want .
Some activists see a chance to transform America in the way Franklin Roosevelt did .
By controlling all the levers of government , Obama can reshape a nation and the Republicans can do little to stop to it .
It seems a beguiling vision .
But is it real ?
The history of the left in America has not been a happy one .
The country often seems to have an innate conservatism that the desires of left - wing politicians have too often come to grief on .
Yet Obama has already begun the task of preparing to govern .
He is assembling his team and setting out his goals .
The hype and dreams of the campaign trail are over .
America wants to know if the Obama revolution is the genuine article .
Soon it will find out .
Sometimes the most telling moments of a campaign come in the forgotten details .
Back in January Obama met editors from a Nevada newspaper , the Reno Gazette - Journal .
Obama surprised them by praising former President Ronald Reagan , not for his policies but for his ability to change America .
' He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it , ' Obama said .
The comments caused a brief kerfuffle .
Hillary Clinton attacked Obama as praising Reagan 's right - wing legacy .
Then it faded from view .
Until now .
In the wake of his election win last week , those remarks can be seen in a new light .
Many Democrats are hoping that Obama can be a left - wing version of Reagan .
He can change America for a generation .
Reaganism , after all , dominated American political life from 1980 to last week .
Every politician after him , including Bill Clinton , had to run on the pro-business , tax - cutting , hawkish , anti-government playing field that Reagan created .
Now many liberals say Obama has the mandate to do the same thing .
But in reverse .
' There is a lot of talk in Washington about the end of the Reagan era , ' said John Fortier , a research fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute .
Obama has built a huge and viable coalition of support .
It is made up of college - educated whites , blacks and Hispanics and of young voters .
It has propelled the party to pick up swing states such as Ohio , Iowa and Florida .
It has turned once red states such as Indiana , Colorado , New Mexico , Nevada , Virginia and North Carolina into blue states .
It has seen big gains in both houses of Congress , giving Obama control over government .
' Clearly he has a mandate .
The power is there .
The question now is when he talks about bringing change , what does he mean ? ' said David Frum , a leading Republican and former aide to President George W Bush .
That is the question on everyone 's mind .
On the campaign trail the agenda was ambitious , even potentially transformative .
On Iraq , Obama has promised to bring US troops home , perhaps within 16 months .
He will talk to leaders of countries such as Iran , Cuba and North Korea .
He has promised a massive extension of healthcare .
He wants to cut taxes for the middle classes and raise them for the wealthy , reversing the trend of the Bush years .
He wants a massive expansion of green industry and alternative energy .
He wants to allow service in the army , schools or overseas to be exchanged into credits to pay for college .
And all of the above add up to the most fundamental shift of all : bringing government back into people 's lives .
But Obama has something else beside political clout and left - wing ideas .
His campaign was no ordinary one .
It was a mass movement for the age of technology .
Obama 's organisation attracted more than 3.1 million internet donors and volunteers .
They exist as potential activists in every congressional district in the country , ready to agitate , lobby and campaign for Obama 's agenda .
It is a force that no other American politician has ever commanded before ; an online grassroots army .
In an email sent moments before he delivered his victory speech last Tuesday night , Obama told them to prepare .
' We have a lot to do to get our country back on track and I 'll be in touch soon about what comes next , ' he wrote .
That prospect scares some Americans .
Literally .
In Madison 's Bar in a suburb of Beaumont , Texas , the local Republican party last week watched the Obama victory unfold .
Supporters gathered upstairs around televisions carrying live cable coverage .
There was widespread dismay .
Though Texas remained solidly red , it was clear much of the rest of the country was suddenly on a different course .
' I think he is a socialist .
I do n't think the people who voted for him know what his real plans are , ' said Marilyn Martindale .
It was a common view .
As the mood in Madison 's became more depressed , the talk was of a change for the worse under Obama .
' How could he get hold of the country ?
I am afraid our way of life is about to change drastically , ' said Sue Harris as Fox News blared out details of the latest Republican loss .
But there are strong signs that the worst Republican fears - and the most ambitious Democratic dreams - are built on shaky foundations .
Obama not only faces a potentially toxic economic environment , he himself seems far more of a moderate than a radical .
Contrary to the concerns of the Republicans in Texas , many people think Obama is no revolutionary .
Nor did the election give him licence to pursue one .
Much of Obama 's campaign was based on a solid middle ground .
His appeal , from his 2004 convention speech to his 2008 campaign , has always been about unity .
He fought the election by defending the constitutional rights of gun owners .
He supported the death penalty .
He ran on promises of tax cuts .
His plans for healthcare were less radical than those of either of his main Democratic rivals , Hillary Clinton or John Edwards .
He preached to black men about the importance of taking responsibility for family life .
His stump speech was often enthused with religious values .
Indeed Obama wore his Christian faith more openly on the campaign trail than John McCain did .
' I think he is going to proceed aggressively , but not radically , ' said Larry Haas , a political commentator and former aide in the Clinton White House .
A look beneath the headline figures of the election also reveals that America has not become a liberal nation over - night .
McCain faced an almost impossible environment for a Republican to run in .
Yet he still won 46 per cent of the vote .
Obama 's victories in North Carolina , Indiana , Ohio and Florida were by only a few percentage points .
A recent survey showed that only 22 per cent of Americans identify themselves as liberals .
It should not be forgotten that McCain ended the conventions ahead in the polls .
It was only after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression that Obama managed to get a solid lead .
His win was no landslide like Roosevelt 's when he took 48 states in 1936 , or Reagan 's 1984 win when he took 49 .
Indeed , Obama still lost the white vote by 12 points and whites still make up 74 per cent of voters .
' It is not really a tidal wave .
It is sort of a mini-earthquake .
Though of course , when you are on top of it , a mini- earthquake can still seem quite large , ' said Darrell West , a director at the left - of - centre Brookings Institution think - tank .
It is perhaps no surprise that top Democrats - unlike activists on the party 's left - are not preaching revolution .
' This government must be from the middle , ' said House speaker Nancy Pelosi last week .
' I do n't think it 's a mandate for the New Deal , ' echoed Howard Dean , chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
In fact , Obama 's ambitions appear limited and will be deeply hamstrung by the brutal economic conditions he will inherit .
The long - cherished dream of a healthcare policy is likely to proceed in stages , not one swoop .
' I do n't see healthcare happening right away .
He 's more likely to make incremental changes , ' said West .
Large government programmes will face tight budgets or spending cuts .
American popular opinion also remains largely unmoved .
There has been no wholesale embrace of liberal values .
Much of the country remains essentially centre - right .
Just look at the rejection last week of gay marriage in California .
Nowhere will this be more on display than in foreign policy , despite the worldwide euphoria of last week .
' There is nearly always great continuity in American foreign policy , ' said Haas .
Last week Obama started getting the same daily intelligence briefings that Bush gets .
He will get one every day for the rest of his presidency .
It is those that are likely to shape his foreign policy far more than liberal ideals .
Obama may be more open to talk to nations such as Iran , Cuba , Venezuela or North Korea .
But America 's armed forces will remain stationed around the world .
Indeed , when it comes to issues such as Pakistan and Israel , Obama has been at times more hawkish than McCain or Bush .
He has spoken of his willingness to use force .
Countries which have welcomed Obama 's rise are likely to realise quickly that power relations in the world will remain the same .
Realpolitik is a game that all American presidents play .
But if Obama 's election does not quite represent an American embrace of the left , it does show one thing : a clear rejection of Bush - style Republicanism .
In that respect a new era has dawned .
The election has in effect cast the Republican party into a political wilderness .
Many believe the conservative movement popularised by Reagan has to change or die .
' There has clearly been a massive rejection of Bush 's conservatism .
It has been the failure of that philosophy , ' said John Halpin , a senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress , a liberal think - tank dedicated to improving the lives of Americans through ideas and action .
Last week the Republican party began coping with that rejection .
At the weekend retreat in rural Virginia of conservative icon Brent Bozell , founder of the watchdog group Media Research Centre , about 20 leading figures met to discuss their party 's future .
Guests included anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist and Al Regnery , publisher of the American Spectator .
After the talks Bozell gave a conference call where he revealed the meeting 's conclusion .
' The moderate wing of the Republican party is dead , ' he said .
That echoed conservative attacks on party moderates , such as columnists David Brooks and Peggy Noonan , who had criticised the right during the campaign .
Some have called for them to leave the party .
That is almost certainly music to Democrat ears .
The Democrats , far from launching a left - wing revolution , have captured much of the centre .
The Republicans have been reduced to their heartlands .
As a result , the Republican party is more right - wing and conservative than the country itself and could move even further to the right .
It also faces a bitter battle that will most probably last beyond 2012 .
' They will factionalise severely , ' said Halpin .
The civil war will pit the party 's conservative base , likely to be in the shape of Sarah Palin , against reformers who want to appeal to moderates .
It is the same process that the Conservatives in Britain went through after Tony Blair 's win in 1997 .
Or Labour after Margaret Thatcher 's 1983 triumph .
Republicans are out of touch now with American concerns .
Their touchstone issues of abortion and fighting gay marriage arouse passions but no longer win elections .
Obama 's capture of the Hispanic vote is also crucial .
Bush and his policy guru , Karl Rove , fought hard for that fast - growing demographic .
But the collapse of immigration reform at the hand of Republican conservatives ended that .
It has left the party distinctly white at a time when minority voters are becoming more numerous and more powerful .
It is hard to plot a quick way back for the Republicans , short of a spectacular mishandling of his presidency by Obama .
Frum offered a grim assessment of his party 's chances in the next few years .
If history serves as any example the conservative base will now seize the party , forcing its 2012 candidates to run on a right - wing platform .
Only another presidential defeat will convince the party that its future lies back towards the centre .
' It is possible we can come back for the next presidential election .
But to be honest it often takes longer than that , ' Frum , the former aide to Bush , said .
But though the politics of it are complex , there was little doubt that genuine change was in the air last week .
It could even be felt in the red heartland of Texas .
Standing outside a polling booth at a union hall in Beaumont , Claudia Deshotel was clear why she had voted for Obama .
' I just want something different .
We need change .
Anything has to be better than what we got now , ' she said .
She got change .
The right has been rejected , even though the left has not been fully embraced .
Obama will pick a careful path through the desirable and the possible to take the country on a different road .
But there is one area of American politics which has been truly transformed .
The campaign of 2008 has put a black man in the White House .
The symbolic power of that can not be reversed .
It has broken down a barrier that was seen as insurmountable just a generation ago .
At the same time , Hillary Clinton and then Palin overcame obstacles to women running for the highest office .
That too has set America on a fresh path from which there is no turning back .
A future flow of minorities and women into both parties is inevitable .
In that sense , the campaign of 2008 has created a brave new world .
When the Count saw my face , his eyes blazed with a sort of demonic fury , and he suddenly made a grab at my throat .
I drew away , and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix .
It made an instant change in him , for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there .
- Bram Stoker 's Dracula
Niklaus Manuel Deutsch painting , 1517 .
Credit : Death In Art .
' These vampires were corpses , who went out of their graves at night to suck the blood of the living , either at their throats or stomachs , after which they returned to their cemeteries .
The persons so sucked waned , grew pale , and fell into consumption ; while the sucking corpses grew
fat , got rosy , and enjoyed an excellent appetite .
It was in Poland , Hungary , Silesia , Moravia , Austria , and Lorraine , that the dead made this good cheer . '
When I was an undergraduate , I had to read Bram Stoker 's Dracula for a class called , " Myths of the World . "
The novel is composed of first hand accounts , diary entries , letters and newspaper clippings to add validity to the story , so as you 're reading it , you begin to think -- it 's real .
There I was one night , in my San Francisco apartment , huddled in my bedroom with all the lights on reading : I read page after page getting with growing fear until -- I shut it .
I buried Dracula behind a stack of other books on my shelf , with the spine facing in and the cover hidden .
I spent the rest of the night huddled under blankets awaiting the return of my roommate .
I have n't opened the book since .
He 's still at the back of my bookshelf , breathing , waiting .
Maybe I 'll never know the fates of Jonathan Harker , Lucy or Mina .
Logic and science tells me that vampires do n't exist , but still - - I 'm not sure I can ever face him .
Throughout history , society has created monsters to explain the mysteries of the world -- mysteries that science had not yet made clear to them .
Ghosts , sea monsters , aliens , zombies , and of course , no monster has experienced as much fame as the vampire .
Precursors to modern vampires can be seen in Mesopotamian , Hebrew , and Ancient Greek cultures , to name a few .
Early belief in vampires has been blamed on ignorance of the body 's process of decomposition after death and how people rationalized it .
When a community was plagued by a mysterious illness or unexplained livestock deaths , a vampire explained the mystery without the necessity of science .
During the 18th Century , vampire hysterics was a huge problem in Europe .
Rural epidemics and unexplained livestock death fostered vampire superstition .
So scared were people that they would dig up interred bodies to stake them .
In 1764 , Age of Enlightenment philosopher , Voltaire , wrote in his Philosophical Dictionary : Many scholars of the period reported that vampires did not exist , attributing reports to premature burial or rabies .
Tuberculosis and the pneumonic form of bubonic plague could have explained bloody mouths because both are associated with breakdown of lung tissue .
Despite scholarly assertions , vampiric belief increased .
Such was the hysteria that Empress Maria Theresa of Austria sent her physician , Gerhard van Swieten , to investigate vampire claims .
When Swieten concluded that vampires did not exist , she prohibited the desecration of graves .
Although this ended vampire epidemics , the creature lives on in superstition and artistic works .
The hypnotizing , sophisticated and sexy vampire of today was first born in 1819 , when John Polidori wrote , The Vampyre .
But it was Bram Stoker 's novel , Dracula , in 1897 , which really provided the basis of the modern vampire legend .
Vlad III ( Prince of Wallachia 1431 - 1476 ) is known for inspiring the name of the vampire in Bram Stoker 's novel .
He went by several names , including Vlad Dracula , Dracula and ' Vlad the Impaler , ' due to sadistic punishments imposed during his reign .
Impalement was his preferred method of torture and execution .
The number of his victims ranges from 40,000 to 100,000 , although many stories about him have been fictional or exaggerated .
( Woodblock print of Vlad III ' Dracula ' attending a mass impalement )
Bram Stoker 's Dracula spawned a new vampire genre , still popular today .
Although pre-Stoker folkloric vampires were described as being bloated and rosy from sucking blood , the Stoker - inspired vampire is typically pale , thin and seductive .
' The fair girl went on her knees and bent over me , fairly gloating .
There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive , and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal ...
I could feel the soft , shivering touch of the lips on the supersensitive skin of my throat , and the hard dents of two sharp teeth , just touching and pausing there . '
– Bram Stoker ’s Dracula
Evidence of a vampire in a given locality included death of cattle , sheep and members of the community .
Angel tries to feed on animals , not people .
I can't account for the neighbors though .
9. Wesley Snipes as ‘ Blade ’ in Blade ( 1998 )
Blade is loosely based on the published stories of the fictional Marvel Comics character Blade .
Like Angel , Blade is a half - man , half - vampire who hunts vampires as the protector of humans .
Blade ’s sexy sunglasses and pre-Matrix trench coat signify vampire butt - kicking abilities and the penchant for partying .
8. Kate Beckinsale as ' Selene ' in Underworld ( 2003 )
Selene is the leader of a vampire group attempting to fend off the Lycans .
Like Blade , the Underworld films are filled with action packed vampire butt - kicking by Kate in skin - tight black that leaves just enough to the imagination .
Also , there 's just something about her icy blue eyes that say , " Take me , take me ! "
witches , suicide victims , or people who had rebelled against the Church
while they were alive .
Kate sure looks like she 's been a bad girl to me .
7. Jason Patric as ' Michael Emerson ' in The Lost Boys ( 1987 )
Jason Patric almost becomes a vampire in The Lost Boys when he is tricked into drinking human blood .
Thankfully , he 's saved by his brother Sam and his group of amateur vampire - hunter friends .
In the movie , the town of Santa Carla , California is plagued with gangs and disappearances .
Honorable mention : Kiefer Sutherland as David .
Kiefer 's hairstyle in this movie reminds me of when he played the also creepy ' Ace ' in Stand By Me .
I can't be helped but be impressed by his ability to be pathologically creepy and yet sexy at the same time .
This movie 's soundtrack is extra creepy with choirs of singing children , so for those faint of heart , who just want to drool over Patric , I suggest the mute button .
plays a naive high school student seduced by a vampire .
6. Aaliyah as ' Akasha ' in Queen of the Damned ( 2002 )
Despite the sad confession that this movie was so awful that I actually walked out of it , even I can not deny Akasha ’s sexy dance movies .
The slow gyrations of her hips are hypnotic and heartstopping — literally .
The Queen of the Damned film is based on the third novel of Anne Rice 's The Vampire Chronicles series .
It was released six months after Aaliyah 's death in a plane crash and is dedicated to her memory .
starring Sarah Michelle Gellar .
It had a run of seven seasons , for a
total of 144 episodes .
5. Antonio Banderas as ' Armand ' in Interview with the Vampire ( 1994 )
I enjoy Antonio's accent every day of the week , but there 's something about the fangs and the cape that make him go up , up , up on the hot - meter !
Tom Cruise is not on this list because of that one really disturbing scene when Kirsten Dunst tricks Tom Cruise into drinking blood from a dead body .
He looks totally disgusting .
described as having a healthier appearance than expected , plump and
showing little or no signs of decomposition .
Antonio looks pretty healthy to me !
4. Salma Hayek as ‘ Santanico Pandemonium ’ in From Dusk Till Dawn ( 1996 )
Santanico Pandemonium is a vampire queen who is introduced as “ the mistress of the macabre . ”
She performs a sultry dance with a snake coiled around her neck and drops it like she ’s on fire .
Note : Selma Hayek beats Aaliyah on this list because Hayek refrains from eating someone ’s heart .
Gross .
3. Brad Pitt as ' Louis ' in Interview with the Vampire ( 1994 )
Brad Pitt ’s lengthy locks , reminiscent of his A River Runs Through
It days , are sure to stir every girl ’s heart .
His unwillingness to feed on Christian Slater , his interviewer , while he tells his life story is indicative of his thoughtful and self - sacrificing nature .
As a side note : Brad Pitt is now with Angelina Jolie , who used to wear a vial of her ex Billy Bob Thornton ’s blood around her neck .
2. Robert Pattinson as ' Edward Cullen ' in Twilight ( 2008 )
Twilight follows the story of a seventeen - year - old girl who falls in love with the vampire , Edward Cullen .
I am certain that having Robert Pattinson on this list breaks all sorts of rules because I have n't seen the movie yet , and really , Twilight is n't in theatres until November 21 , 2008 .
Stephanie Meyer 's
Twilight series is taking the world by storm , and Pattinson is the same heartthrob who played " Cedric Diggory " in the film adaptation of JK Rowling 's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire .
For that , he wins my vote completely .
In a bizarre coincidence , in an issue of Time , Stephanie Meyer , was recently called the “ new J.K. Rowling . ”
was based on Richard Matheson 's 1954 sci- fi vampire novel .
The film
grossed over $ 584 million at the box office .
1 . The top spot is up for grabs .
Who do you think deserves to be number one ?
Evidence of a vampire in a given locality included death of cattle , sheep and members of the community .
Angel tries to feed on animals , not people .
I can't account for the neighbors though .
Blade is loosely based on the published stories of the fictional Marvel Comics character Blade .
Like Angel , Blade is a half - man , half - vampire who hunts vampires as the protector of humans .
Blade ’s sexy sunglasses and pre-Matrix trench coat signify vampire butt - kicking abilities and the penchant for partying .
For more blooding , watch the 1922 silent film ' Nosferatu , ' an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker 's ' Dracula .
'
Selene is the leader of a vampire group attempting to fend off the Lycans .
Like Blade , the Underworld films are filled with action packed vampire butt - kicking by Kate in skin - tight black that leaves just enough to the imagination .
Also , there 's just something about her icy blue eyes that say , " Take me , take me !
" In Russian folklore , vampires were thought to bewitches , suicide victims , or people who had rebelled against the Churchwhile they were alive .
Kate sure looks like she 's been a bad girl to me .
Jason Patric almost becomes a vampire in The Lost Boys when he is tricked into drinking human blood .
Thankfully , he 's saved by his brother Sam and his group of amateur vampire - hunter friends .
In the movie , the town of Santa Carla , California is plagued with gangs and disappearances .
Honorable mention : Kiefer Sutherland as David .
Kiefer 's hairstyle in this movie reminds me of when he played the also creepy ' Ace ' in Stand By Me .
I can't be helped but be impressed by his ability to be pathologically creepy and yet sexy at the same time .
This movie 's soundtrack is extra creepy with choirs of singing children , so for those faint of heart , who just want to drool over Patric , I suggest the mute button .
For more blooding , watch ' Once Bitten , ' a comedy starring Jim Carrey , whoplays a naive high school student seduced by a vampire .
Despite the sad confession that this movie was so awful that I actually walked out of it , even I can not deny Akasha ’s sexy dance movies .
The slow gyrations of her hips are hypnotic and heartstopping — literally .
The Queen of the Damned film is based on the third novel of Anne Rice 's The Vampire Chronicles series .
It was released six months after Aaliyah 's death in a plane crash and is dedicated to her memory .
For more blooding , watch ' Buffy the Vampire Slayer , ' the series , starring Sarah Michelle Gellar .
It had a run of seven seasons , for atotal of 144 episodes .
I enjoy Antonio's accent every day of the week , but there 's something about the fangs and the cape that make him go up , up , up on the hot - meter !
Tom Cruise is not on this list because of that one really disturbing scene when Kirsten Dunst tricks Tom Cruise into drinking blood from a dead body .
He looks totally disgusting .
Corpses thought to be vampires were generallydescribed as having a healthier appearance than expected , plump andshowing little or no signs of decomposition .
Antonio looks pretty healthy to me !
Santanico Pandemonium is a vampire queen who is introduced as “ the mistress of the macabre . ”
She performs a sultry dance with a snake coiled around her neck and drops it like she ’s on fire .
Note : Selma Hayek beats Aaliyah on this list because Hayek refrains from eating someone ’s heart .
Gross .
In vampire folklore , any corpse with a wound which had not been cleaned with boiling water was at risk for becoming a vampire .
Will anyone volunteer to give Selma a bath ?
Brad Pitt ’s lengthy locks , reminiscent of his A River Runs Through
It days , are sure to stir every girl ’s heart .
His unwillingness to feed on Christian Slater , his interviewer , while he tells his life story is indicative of his thoughtful and self - sacrificing nature .
As a side note : Brad Pitt is now with Angelina Jolie , who used to wear a vial of her ex Billy Bob Thornton ’s blood around her neck .
Families trying to protect their deceased loved ones from becoming vampires would bury the corpse upside - down .
Is it wrong to wish something like that on Angelina ?
Twilight follows the story of a seventeen - year - old girl who falls in love with the vampire , Edward Cullen .
I am certain that having Robert Pattinson on this list breaks all sorts of rules because I have n't seen the movie yet , and really , Twilight is n't in theatres until November 21 , 2008 .
Stephanie Meyer 's
Twilight series is taking the world by storm , and Pattinson is the same heartthrob who played " Cedric Diggory " in the film adaptation of JK Rowling 's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire .
For that , he wins my vote completely .
In a bizarre coincidence , in an issue of Time , Stephanie Meyer , was recently called the “ new J.K. Rowling .
” For more blooding , watch ' I am Legend , ' starring Will Smith , whichwas based on Richard Matheson 's 1954 sci - fi vampire novel .
The filmgrossed over $ 584 million at the box office .
Although vampire ’s are generally viewed to be fictitious , vampire - like creatures still persist all over the world .
Supernatural beings drinking blood or flesh can be found in nearly every culture .
In India , vetalas are ghoul - like beings that inhabit corpses .
In Philippine mythology , there is a vampire - like creature called an aswang who walks amongst everyday people , typically in a position that requires bloody work , like that of a butcher or surgeon .
During certain times of the month , the aswang sheds his lower torso , grows wings and unfurls a long tongue used to suck the unborn fetus from a pregnant woman via the belly button .
The chupacabra is a mythological vampire - like creature known in the Americas , particularly Latin America , and drinks the blood of livestock .
Nowadays , vampires look more ‘ emo ’ than scary .
They wear trench coats , sport sexy smiles and have a long lock of hair partially obscuring a hypnotizing eye .
Today ’s Hollywood vampires are the perfect embodiment of our modern day antihero — they are outcast from society , sexually appealing and equipped with superhero qualities such as immortality , the ability to transform into animals , to fly , etc .
Today , many of our vampires are embodied with human likenesses : kind hearts , consciences and the ability to love .
Vampire believers of old might laugh at our modern representations of the vampire , but I gotta say , they make for some sexy story lines !-- And so , because I just can't resist , here is my list of ( Be forewarned , some of these images are quite suggestive . )
Angel , a hybrid of man and vampire , battles evil demons while his vampire urges and human conscience are constantly at odds .
His sexy hairstyle and heart melted the heart of Sarah Michelle Gellar as ' Buffy 'in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer television series , where his character was first seen .
Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck is the world 's youngest monarch
The new king of Bhutan has been crowned in a lavish coronation ceremony in the isolated Himalayan kingdom .
King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck , 28 , an Oxford - educated bachelor , becomes the world 's youngest monarch .
He has become head of state of the world 's newest democracy after his father abdicated in 2006 as Bhutan changed to a constitutional monarchy .
Bhutan held its first democratic elections for a new parliament and prime minister in March .
The coronation of the Buddhist nation 's fifth hereditary king fell in what is known in Bhutan as the month of the male earth rat .
Prime Minister Lyonchhen Jigmi Y
Thinley said three enlightened astrologers had jointly proposed 6 November as the most auspicious date for the " historic occasion " .
' Gross National Happiness '
The ceremony comprised an ancient and colourful ritual in a white - walled royal palace in the capital , Thimphu .

Profile : King Wangchuck Coronation in pictures
Thousands of foreign dignitaries , including India 's President , Pratibha Patil , governing Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi and Bollywood stars were present .
The guests were surrounded by lines of local people dressed in their national costumes .
The crown was bestowed on the new king by his father , Jigme Singye Wangchuck , 52 , who stepped down in 2006 as part of his five - year plan to gradually introduce democracy to Bhutan 's 600,000 citizens .
" I am happy , my friends are happy and in general as a nation we are happy , " Sonam Phuntsho , a civil servant , told the AFP news agency .
" He [ the new king ] is reaching out to the people .
He is very smart and decent man , " he said .
Prime Minister Lyonchhen said earlier the coronation would further consolidate the country 's " sovereign independence and security and promote further unity , harmony , and peace in the kingdom " .
But correspondents say that while 2008 will be remembered as the year democracy was introduced to Bhutan , revolutionary change is not on the agenda .
The transition to democracy has been deliberately designed to be slow and steady and the monarchy will continue to play a central role in Bhutanese life .
Both the new government and the opposition say they are committed to the royal philosophy of Gross National Happiness - or GNH - which aims to strike a better balance between the spiritual and the material .

Create a Natural Thanksgiving Centerpiece
Mom and Dad have got a lot going on these next two weeks before Thanksgiving .
Ordering the turkey , figuring out the stuffing , making pies…yummy !
Why not help them out by creating an awesome natural centerpiece for the table ?
It ’s the perfect opportunity to get your nature hat on and your creative juices flowing .
Go for a walk in a nearby park and collect anything that you think would look good on the table .
There ’s loads of Autumn stuff out there … lightweight twigs , fallen leaves , pine cones , acorns .
Go for whatever you can find based upon where you live … you want your Thanksgiving centerpiece to reflect your own part of the country .
Look for natural objects of different shapes , sizes and colors .
The more variety you have on , they greater they will look on the table .
Once you ’re back home , plan your color scheme .
For a really festive look , try painting some leaves gold .
Or sprinkle glitter over the pine cone .
Then figure out how you ’re going to organize your centerpiece .
Here are two ideas from the Greenhouse Gang .
Centerpiece In a Bowl
Place the bigger objects such as the pine cones in the center of your Mom ’s favorite bowl .
Surrounded them with smaller things like leaves , acorns and so on .
Then stick some lightweight twigs down into the arrangement ; hold them in place with the pine cones or maybe some stones .
Read more ideas for natural centerpieces at Green Gorilla !
MANIFESTLY UNSERIOUS ….
At this point , I realize I ’m belaboring the point .
“ Sarah Palin is an awful choice for a running mate , ” I can hear you saying , “ We get it . ”
But I ca n’t help but think the magnitude of this mistake has not yet sunk in among political observers .
I was talking to a friend last night who is a political professional in DC , and the discussion , not surprisingly turned to Palin .
He has extensive campaign experience , and every time I argued that this is completely insane , he explained to me a variety of reasons why this John McCain ’s campaign will benefit , significantly , as a result of this move .
I suspect he ’s probably right .
We were , however , talking about different things .
The Palin announcement probably stepped all over Barack Obama ’s post - convention bounce .
Hell , for all I know , this one decision might actually help McCain win the presidency .
But that does n’t change the fact that this is the single most ridiculous development in presidential politics in a generation .
A top “ loyal Bushie ” told the Politico ’s Mike Allen that McCain ’s decision is “ disrespectful to the office of the presidency . ”
That ’s actually a pretty good way of characterizing it .
Campaigns have their ads , their polls , and their tactics , but at the end of the day , credible people who care about the country know that this is more than just a theatrical game — the future of the nation counts more than the future of a candidate .
Those who take affairs of state seriously may take cheap shots , shade the truth now and then , and run the kind of conventional campaigns we ’ve all grown accustomed to , but honorable Americans of character do n’t gamble with the nation ’s well - being .
They know there are lines that ca n’t be crossed for expediency ’s sake , no matter how strong the temptation .
McCain was asked a while back about what he ’d look for in a running mate .
He said the “ key ” is to find the person “ most prepared to take my place ” in the event of a crisis .
McCain spent the ensuing months with a motto : “ Country first . ”
I do n’t doubt for a moment that Sarah Palin is a nice person and probably a competent Alaskan governor .
But she also has the thinnest background of any candidate for national office since 1908 .
Is McCain willing , with a straight face , to argue that Palin is the single “ most prepared ” person in the entire United States to assume the presidency should tragedy strike ?
Is anyone , anywhere , prepared to argue that McCain has put “ country first ” ?
Of course not ; these ideas are literally laughable .
Palin ’s qualifications are , to a very real degree , secondary to the issue at hand .
What matters most right now is John McCain ’s comically dangerous sense of judgment .
He picked a running mate he met once for 15 minutes , who ’s been the governor of a small state for a year and a half , and who is in the midst of an abuse - of - power investigation in which she appears to have lied rather blatantly .
She has no obvious expertise in any area , and no record of any kind of federal issues .
McCain does n’t care .
Sensible people of sound mind and character simply do n’t do things like this .
Leaders do n’t do things like this .
It ’s the height of arrogance .
It ’s manifestly unserious .
It ’s reckless and irresponsible .
It mocks the political process .
Faced with a major presidential test , McCain thought it wise to tell an imprudent joke of lasting consequence .
Kevin noted :
This is all part of what I was talking about the other day when I noted that McCain is running such a palpably unserious campaign .
Steve Schmidt seems solely interested in winning the daily news cycle ; his staff spends its time gleefully churning out juvenile attack videos ; McCain himself has retreated into robotic incantations of simpleminded talking points ; and now he ’s chosen a manifestly unqualified VP that he knows nothing about .
I ’ve honestly never seen anything like it .
No one has ; it ’s without precedent in modern American politics .
The novelty and gimmickry might hold sway with those who base their votes on who they ’d like to have a beer with , but that does n’t make it any less of a joke .
Sullivan added , “ Palin is n’t the issue here .
McCain ’s judgment is .
It ’s completely off the wall .
Is there something wrong with him ? ”
That may sound like a flippant question , but it deserves a serious answer .
Is there something wrong with him ?
Might this be evidence of some kind of impulse problem , as reflected in his shoot - first , think - second approach to foreign policy ?
When I think about the respect that John McCain had worked so hard to develop , the stature he ’d taken years to cultivate , and the reputation he ’d built his career on , it ’s breathtaking to see him throw it all away .
If there ’s a more complete collapse in modern political times , from hero to clown , I ca n’t think of it .
We ’re poised to learn a great deal about Sarah Palin , but we ’ve just learned even more about John McCain .
He ’s fundamentally unsuited for the presidency .

" If this were a dictatorship , it'd be a heckuva lot easier .
Just so long as I'm the dictator . " — George W. Bush , December 18 , 2000
One morning in 2001 , one of President Bush 's most senior economic advisers walked into the Oval Office for a meeting with the president .
The day before , the adviser had learned that the president had decided to send out tax - rebate checks to stimulate the faltering economy .
Concerned about deficits and the dubious stimulatory effect of such rebates , he had called the president 's chief of staff , Andy Card , to ask for the audience , and the meeting had been set .
As the man took his seat in the wing chair next to the president 's desk , he began to explain his problem with the president 's decision .
The fact of the matter was that in this area of policy , this adviser was one of the experts , really top - drawer , and had been instrumental in devising some of the very language now used to discuss these concepts .
He was convinced , he told Bush , that the president 's position would soon enough be seen as " bad policy . "
This , it seems , was the wrong thing to say to the president .
According to senior administration officials who learned of the encounter soon after it happened , President Bush looked at the man .
" I do n't ever want to hear you use those words in my presence again , " he said .
" What words , Mr. President ? "
" Bad policy , " President Bush said .
" If I decide to do it , by definition it 's good policy .
I thought you got that . "
The adviser was dismissed .
The meeting was over .
It is one story among many such stories .
Why , you might ask , would the president bother to have advisers who are expert in various constellations of policy - making if he then disregards utterly whatever they have to say ?
The answer is at the heart of the failure of this presidency .
George Walker Bush is not a stupid or a bad man .
But in his conduct as president , he behaved stupidly and badly .
He was constrained by neither the standards of conduct common to the average professional nor the Constitution .
This was not ignorance but a willful rejection on Bush 's part , in the service of streamlining White House decision - making , eliminating complexity , and shutting out dissenting voices .
This insular mind - set was and is dangerous .
Rigorous thinking and hard - won expertise are both very good things , and our government for the past eight years has routinely debased and mocked these virtues .
President Bush was unmoved by any arguments that challenged his assumptions .
Debate was silenced , expertise was punished , and diversity of opinion was anathema , so much so that his political opponents — other earnest Americans who want the best for their country — were , to him and his men , the moral equivalent of the enemy .
It is important to note just how different such conduct has been from the conduct of other presidents from both parties .
Anyone who has drawn this sad conclusion has been dismissed as a " Bush hater " by those who defend the president .
I am not a " Bush hater . "
I am a reporter , and it is incumbent in the enterprise to scrutinize power and follow facts .
I began chronicling this administration for Esquire in late 2001 , and have been compelled to write about nothing else since .
Among many other things , I learned that the bright lines typical in a White House between policy - making and political operations had been obliterated in the Bush White House , abandoned in favor of political calculations routed through Karl Rove 's office .
In his critique of this troubling power dynamic , one of my sources , the former director of the president 's faith - based initiative , John DiIulio , called Rove 's swarming operatives the " Mayberry Machiavellis . "
That was in 2002 .
DiIulio could n't have known then just how right he was .
I also learned from another source , Bush 's first treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill , that at President Bush 's very first National Security Council meeting , in January 2001 , finding a rationale for overthrowing the regime of Saddam Hussein topped the agenda .
I learned that the president 's message - makers derided the rest of us who live in the " reality - based community , " as opposed to the alternate reality that they saw it in their power to create .
And most recently I learned that the White House was apprised by the Iraqi intelligence chief in January 2003 — well in advance of the war — that Saddam Hussein 's regime possessed no weapons of mass destruction and had no such active weapons programs .
The intelligence chief , in his secret back - channel meetings , also described the mind of Saddam — his fear of the Iranians finding out he was weaponless — which explained his odd prewar behavior .
When this fact was borne out after the invasion , the White House directed that a fraudulent document be created to establish a connection between the Iraqi regime and the leader of the 9/11 hijackers , Mohammed Atta .
( This document miraculously materialized in Baghdad in December 2003 . )
A common thread running through all of these discoveries is a basic misunderstanding of — or disregard for — the limits of presidential power .
Indeed , this ahistoric president seems to have never appreciated just how hard - won are the institutions of American liberty .
Article II of the United States Constitution grants stunning power to the president , power almost beyond imagining to be entrusted to one man .
But for George Bush and Dick Cheney , it was n't enough .
And so , with a level of secrecy that betrayed a basic mistrust of the American people , they proceeded to expand the awesome power of the presidency and in the process upset the balance of powers designed by the founders .
And in this , the president and vice president found their greatest success .
In fact , this presidency has succeeded spectacularly in the project that most mattered to Bush and Cheney , and that is putting the United States on a more authoritarian footing .
And with our fear being very carefully managed by our national leaders , and with President Bush exploiting our darker instincts , we in the press , in the Congress , in the electorate generally , simply were n't vigilant enough .
And that is perhaps the best lesson to take away from the presidency of George W. Bush .
During his 2000 campaign for the presidency , Governor Bush spoke of dignity and humility in the conduct of the office , and of a more humble foreign policy that he intended to pursue if elected president .
Of course , that was before the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , before the major threat of our time came into clear focus .
But it is a paradox of this presidency that because Bush so outspent the treasury , and so exceeded his powers — in ways that have already been demonstrated by the courts to be illegal — and because he often seemed to use the prerogatives of his office not to protect the country but to protect himself , the next occupant of the office will actually find himself presiding over the more humble institution that Bush the candidate once described .
That is the correction that is coming .
That is , if we are lucky .
That is , if we have the will to restore the moral position that we have lost .
That is , if our next president demonstrates the grace to show restraint in the exercise of his office .
For the misshapen institution left by Bush is not so elastic as to snap back into the four corners of the Constitution easily , and restoring equilibrium and credibility to the presidency will require an act of will .
After all , the test for a president is n't , How powerful can you be ?
Because presidential power is a given .
The true test for the future of the American government is , Will the next president respect the institution enough to show self - restraint in the exercise of that power ?
Will Congress and the courts fight to recover the power that Bush has grabbed for himself ?
Will the next president negotiate new terms with the American people and with the world to repair the damage done ?
Can we afford for him not to ?
Without success in this mission , and swift success , this nation , this last best hope of mankind , will no longer be exceptional .
It is Bush 's legacy that he has handed his successor history 's pitiless , ticking clock . =

WASHINGTON --
The Senate handily passed a controversial financial rescue package Wednesday , giving the bill its first legislative victory but adding provisions that could complicate efforts to push the $ 700 billion plan through the House of Representatives .
The compromise bill represented a marriage of the rescue proposal with a host of measures designed to win the support of reluctant lawmakers .
Additions include an increase in bank deposit insurance limits , a suggested change to accounting rules , and a $ 150.5 billion package of unrelated personal and corporate tax cuts .
The additions boosted support in the Senate , which voted 74 to 25 in favor , the latest twist in the proposal 's roller - coaster ride this week .
Opposition came from conservatives , populists and senators facing tight races where the rescue bill is drawing criticism .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said he expected the House would pass the bill , a sentiment echoed by other senators .
House leaders expressed cautious optimism they could secure passage , but could n't be definitive .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s military said on Friday it had intensified efforts to develop new ballistic missiles in response to U.S. plans to deploy an anti-missile system in Europe and Russia ’s navy test fired a new generation rocket .

The decision by the United States to deploy interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic has angered Moscow , which says Russia ’s national security will be compromised by the U.S. anti-missile system .
Colonel - General Nikolai Solovtsov , Commander of Russia ’s Strategic Missile Forces , was quoted by Interfax as saying that Russia had bolstered its efforts to develop new missiles .
“ At the present time , work has been intensified to create the research and technical foundation for new missile systems , which will be needed after 2020 , ” Solovtsov said .
A few hours later , the Dmitry Donskoy nuclear submarine launched a Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile from the White Sea , a navy spokesman said .
The missile hit the Kura testing site on the Kamchatka peninsula in the Pacific .
Russia ’s RIA news agency quoted an unidentified source in the Defense Ministry as saying it was the most successful test of the Bulava to date , after a string of failures and delays .
The previous test of the Bulava on September 18 was pronounced a success by the navy .
Several launches of the Bulava , which is designed for Russia ’s new generation of Borei class nuclear submarines , have failed however .

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev announced on November 5 that Moscow would install Iskander short - range missile systems near the Polish border if Washington proceeds with its missile plans .
Medvedev also said Russia would try to electronically jam the U.S. system .
Russia ’s relations with Washington this year hit their lowest ebb since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union after a row over the war against U.S. ally Georgia and Moscow ’s recognition of two Georgian rebel regions as independent states .
Kremlin officials say the U.S. has failed to listen to their concerns about the missile shield , which Washington says is needed to protect against “ rogue states ” such as Iran .
Russia ’s missile forces commander said the first of a new generation of Russian RS - 24 intercontinental ballistic missiles would enter service in December 2009 , Interfax reported .
Russia test fired one of the RS - 24 missiles on November 26 , the third such test in two years .
Russian generals say the RS - 24 can pierce any anti-missile system .
It can be armed with up to 10 different warheads and is intended to replace Russia ’s earlier generation intercontinental missiles such as the RS - 18 and RS - 20 .
Solovtsov said the global financial crisis probably would impose some limits on funding , although Russia would test 13 missiles next year , almost double the seven tests this year , Interfax reported .
“ Due to the world financial crisis , certain resource restrictions will be applied but still the ( missile ) force should be able to fulfill its duties , ” he was quoted as saying .
Civilian personnel in Russia ’s military forces also will be cut by 150,000 to 600,000 as part of ongoing reforms to defense structures , Interfax separately reported , quoting a source in the Defense Ministry .
Steve Kubby was a candidate for the Libertarian Presidential nomination in 2008 , and the runner up for the party ’s VP nomination in 2008 and 2000 .
He was also the party ’s candidate for Governor of California in 1998 .
He is currently working on a new business venture in the medical field .
Disclosure : I worked on his presidential campaign .
Last Tuesday voters delivered historic landslides in support of medical marijuana and decriminalization , despite heavy opposition by local and federal officials .
Michigan voters made their state the 13th to allow the medical use of marijuana by a whopping 63 percent to 37 percent , the largest margin ever for a medical marijuana initiative .
In Massachusetts , voters delivered a landslide of 65 percent to 35 percent , decriminalized the possession of up to an ounce of marijuana , replacing arrests with a $ 100 fine , much like a traffic ticket .
These historic landslide votes come during the most extreme anti-marijuana campaign by federal officials in American history .
Marijuana arrests have been setting all - time records year after year and one American is arrested on marijuana charges every 36 seconds .
More Americans are arrested each year for simple marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined .
Given such breathtaking and historic results , one might ask , “ Where was the Libertarian Party ? ”
The answer is that we were nowhere to be found .
Unless you can name any other issue in American politics that delivers 65 % of the vote , this is THE biggest issue on the political landscape .
While some may argue that the economy is a far bigger issue , there is little consensus , nor is there any constituency that can consistently deliver 65 % of the vote .
How is it then , that the LP has largely turned its back on such a popular issue ?
The answer may surprise you —
The Libertarian Party has bought into “ Reefer Madness . ”
Of course the LP leadership will tell you otherwise and spin your wheels with empty ideological rhetoric .
Bottom line , nearly every decision maker in our party believes that marijuana is a “ fringe issue , ” and that our party “ wo n’t be taken seriously if we put too much emphasis on medical marijuana or decrim . ”
Unless you want the LP to follow you and the rest of the aging LP population to the grave , it ’s time to get with the program .
The Greens and Ron Paul folks have tables and booths at hempfests and legalization events around the country .
Sadly , I rarely see a LP table or speaker , confirming my suspicion that many Libertarians have bought into the fringe issue nonsense .
Perhaps it was this kind of thinking that was behind the Barr campaign ’s decision to politely deny my offer to introduce Bob Barr to over 50,000 libertarian - leaning young people at the Seattle Hempfest .
The war on cannabis is an obsolete holdover of the Spanish Inquisition and the Witch Hunts .
As it has no basis in evidence , science or public health it is therefore a religious belief imposed upon the people – an act that is forbidden in most Western democracies .
Indeed , Puritanism has become the new state religion .
These issues are all essentially Libertarian issues , because they define our rights as individuals and our humanity as a society .
The world desperately needs the guidance and leadership of Libertarians who are willing to stand up for liberty and actually do something to protect and defend their fellow citizens .
The world is waiting , while the LP continues to slumber .
Wake up and smell the ganja .
It ’s the smell of freedom and it is calling for all Libertarians to report for duty .
Following AMD 's launch of its latest server chips last week , it 's Intel 's turn to be in the spotlight .
Intel plans to launch its newest generation of desktop processors on Monday .
Called Core i7 , the chips are aimed at the high - end desktop and gaming market .
The move puts Intel ahead of its rival AMD by more than a few months , as AMD 's comparable desktop processor is n't scheduled to launch until early next year .
" AMD now just does n't have a competitive chip against Intel on the desktop , " says Patrick Wang , an analyst with brokerage firm Wedbush Morgan .
And until AMD launches its product , Intel is going to be the only option for consumers who want the latest chips for their computers , says Wang .
The Core i7 will be almost four to six times faster than Intel 's current platform , says the company , and will have greater power efficiency than ever .
It is based on the 45 - nanometer production technology that first appeared in a server chip called Xeon ( aka Penryn ) , which debuted earlier this year .
The 45 - nm chips utilize smaller circuitry than the previous , 65 - nm generation , making them faster , and also enabling Intel to manufacture them more cheaply .
The new Core i7 chips are based on a newly designed microarchitecture called Nehalem , which includes major design changes in areas such as power management and integrated memory control .
The first three quad - core Core i7 chips from Intel will reintroduce " hyperthreading " technology , which gives the chips the ability to execute 8 threads simultaneously on 4 processing cores , greatly increasing their processing power .
Hyperthreading was seen earlier in Pentium 4 chips and some Xeon processors from Intel .
Core i7 processors are also different from their predecessors in that they have " QuickPath , " a new microarchitecture that integrates memory controller into each microprocessor .
QuickPath will replace Front Side Bus used in
Xeon and Itanium platforms .
The move increases the bandwidth directly available to the processor , reducing lag time before a CPU can begin executing the next instruction .
" Core i7 will be one of the first Intel chips to integrate a memory controller , " says Shane Rau , PC analyst at research firm IDC , " though it is something AMD has had for a while . "
Intel is taking no chances with Core i7 .
The company has spent millions to test the chips and ensure flaws in it do n't trip it up , says The New York Times .
In the past , both Intel and AMD have paid a big price for bugs in their chips .
In 1994 , Intel 's Pentium chips sported a tiny error in floating - point calculation that led to a product recall .
More recently , AMD 's Barcelona range of chips that launched last year were delayed by months after discovery of flaws that among other things caused systems to lock up and crash .

For a third day in a row , Bay Area folks will be deprived of a roaring fire due to the wood - burning ban still in effect .
See , it 's illegal for us to burn wood , pellets or manufactured logs in fireplaces , stoves or other wood - burning devices because of all the pollution the logs emit .
But do n't tell that to a local neo -pagan pantheist who fired off this wicked email to Bay Area Air Quality Management District employees and members of its board of directors .
" I will NOT be deprived of my constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of religion by bureaucrats looking for more ways to control even more aspects of our lives ...
I 'm claiming an exemption because this ban violates my right to practice my religion , a right that is guaranteed by the Constitution ...
When the government controls everything we do , say and think , that 's fascism . "
When all else fails , the yule log might do the trick , neo -pagan pantheists .
Everybody knows how President - elect Barack Obama 's amazing campaign money machine was dominated by several million regular folks sending in hard - earned amounts under $ 200 , a real sign of his broadbased grassroots support .
Except , it turns out , that 's not really true .
In fact , Obama 's base of small donors was almost exactly the same percent as George W. Bush 's in 2004 -- Obama had 26 % and the great Republican satan 25 % .
Obviously , this is unacceptable to current popular thinking .
But the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute just issued a detailed study of Obama 's donor base and its giving .
And that 's what the Institute found , to its own surprise .
" The myth is that money from small donors dominated Barack Obama 's finances , " said CFI 's executive director Michael Malbin , admitting that his organization also was fooled .
" The reality of Obama 's fundraising was impressive , but the reality does not match the myth . "
Adding up the total contributions from the same small individuals ( in terms of dollar amounts , not their height ) , the Institute discovered that rather than the 50 + % commonly ....

Leahy : Lieberman should lose chairmanship Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Friday November 14 , 2008
Print This Email This Joe Lieberman should lose his Senate committee chairmanship after serving as a key surrogate for Republican John McCain 's failed presidential campaign , Vermont Sen.
Patrick Leahy , who chairs the Judiciary Committee said Friday .
Leahy , whose comments came in an interview with Vermont Public Radio , becomes the first Democrat to publicly call for Lieberman 's ouster as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Oversight Committee .
" I'm one who does not feel that somebody should be rewarded with a major chairmanship after doing what he did , " Leahy said , referring to Lieberman 's role as a McCain attack dog .
Lieberman 's attacks " went way beyond the pale " and " perpetuated some of these horrible myths that were being run about Senator Obama , " Leahy said .
While he allowed that each Democratic senator would need to make up his or her own mind , Leahy said that he would not expect to hold on to the Judiciary chairmanship if he 'd acted in the same manner as Lieberman .
Leahy is the first senator to go on the record calling for Lieberman to be dismissed , although there have been reports that Sens. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) and Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) also are lobbying for him to lose the post .
Obama has steered clear of the fight over whether Lieberman should remain chairman , although he has said that the Connecticut Independent should remain a member of the Democratic caucus .
TPM notes that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been trending towards trying to broker a deal to allow Lieberman to remain in the caucus .
There has been discussion of offering Lieberman the chairmanship of the Veterans Affairs Committee , although Lieberman has demonstrated a commitment to remaining atop Homeland Security .
After losing Connecticut 's Democratic primary in 2006 , Lieberman ran as an independent and won re-election .
He 's continued to caucus with the Democrats , although he sharply disagrees with the party on the Iraq war and national security policy .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A landscape restoration of a rubbish dump has won the Energy , Waste and Recycling category at the 2008 World Architecture Festival in Barcelona , Spain .
Spanish architects Batlle and Roig have returned a 150 hectare rubbish dump back to nature .
more photos »
" La Vall d'en Joan " ( The Valley of Joan ) project , designed by Spanish architects Batlle and Roig , has transformed a 150 hectare site in the Garraf Natural Park , south - west of Barcelona into a green terraced agricultural landscape .
In awarding the prize , judges Luis Mansilla -- Mansilla +
Tunon architects -- and Martin Keiding -- editor - in- chief of Arkitektur DK -- described the scheme as : " a perfect example of bringing dead nature back to life by converting rubbish into a beautiful piece of landscape architecture ... using few and humble means " .
Joan Roig of Batlle and Roig Architects told CNN : " The idea was to create a system of hills and banks in a way that would avoid erosion from water and to give the rubbish dump back to nature with a natural design . "
Work to transform the site -- the largest landfill in Spain -- began in 2000 and was completed earlier this year .
It is a striking redrawing of a previously scarred and polluted landscape .
The landfill has been servicing Barcelona 's metropolitan area for over 30 years .
More than 20 million tons of rubbish was spread around the valley before the site was closed in 2006 .
In some places , you would have to dig down over 100 meters before you found soil again .
But this is n't just a cosmetic makeover .
There is an underground drainage system on site which filters contaminated waste fluids .
Part of this recycled water is then used to irrigate the park .
" The whole project is very sustainable , " Roig said .
Furthermore , the dump is also utilizing the bio gas that is emitted to provide electricity .
Some of the rubbish has remained above ground .
Housed in large steel cages which flank the entrance to the site , Roig says they serve as a permanent reminder to visitors of the site 's previous life .
Judge , Martin Keiding told CNN : " It 's a very beautiful and simple design .
It is landscape architecture that is inspiring .
It is a very good example that everyone could look at and say : ' We could do the same . '
This competition is about pointing out good examples that could inspire architects . "
Batlle and Roig 's winning design was one of eight short - listed projects in the Energy , Waste and Recycling category , which was notable for the variety of entries .
They range from state of the art , hi-tech plans such as the Digital Beijing designed by Studio Pei Zhu and Urbanus , right down to low - cost , primitive ventures like the Community Cooker devised by Kenyan company , Planning Systems Services .
The communal cooker is turning rubbish into fuel to feed residents of one of Africa 's biggest slums -- Kibera -- on the outskirts of Nairobi , Kenya .
The project was highly commended by the judges .
" Sustainability is a very important issue and so are the questions about rubbish , especially in Third World countries , " Keiding said .
" The community cooker is a way of introducing a solution directly into the society . "
Keiding , himself a trained architect , believes that Energy , Waste and Recycling is the most important category at the inaugural World Architecture Festival .
" We are facing big problems , so it is a great opportunity for architects to work seriously with this problem on many different levels .
" I think flashy executive buildings are interesting in one sense but they are not interesting if they are not dealing seriously with this matter .
In my opinion you can throw them out .
We have to be far more serious about integrating aspects of sustainability into architecture . "
Both Mansilla and Keiding noted that engineering and architecture had to combine to deal with issues concerning waste and recycling .
They said that achieving sustainability was a difficult task but it also represented a great opportunity for architects to contribute to the sphere .

NYTimes commentator David Brooks is not my favorite commentator by a long shot , but I find his occasionally scathing looks at his fellow conservatives to be remarkable .
Today commentary ( “ The Class War Before Palin ” ) is one of those .
Unfortunately , as with many other conservative self - criticisms , the people who need to read it and understand what Brooks is saying are the ones least likely to do so .
In short , Brooks takes his fellow Republicans to task for allowing disdain of intellectual liberals to become disdain for all intellectuals and everyone who has the audacity to be educated .
Brooks starts with a brief history of recent developments in the GOP , going from the rejection of liberal intellectualism at universities to the founding of “ counterestablishment ” conservative think tanks and magazines as a means to counter liberal intellectuals with conservative intellectuals .
But then he points out that recent developments have brought Republicans to the point where they ’re not longer countering thought with thought , but rather thought with intuition , reason with faith .
The nation is divided between the wholesome Joe Sixpacks in the heartland and the oversophisticated , overeducated , oversecularized denizens of the coasts .
What had been a disdain for liberal intellectuals slipped into a disdain for the educated class as a whole … .
Republicans developed their own leadership style .
If Democratic leaders prized deliberation and self - examination , then Republicans would govern from the gut .
And what does Brooks say this has earned the Republicans ?
The complete loss of both coasts , the majority of educated professionals , and the gradual loss of the working class and the intellectuals .
The Republicans have alienated whole professions .
Lawyers now donate to the Democratic Party over the Republican Party at 4 - to - 1 rates .
With doctors , it ’s 2 - to - 1 . With tech executives , it ’s 5 - to - 1 .
With investment bankers , it ’s 2 - to - 1 .
It took talent for Republicans to lose the banking community .
If Brooks is right – if bankers actually donating more to Democrats than to Republicans – then the GOP has a great deal of work to do before it becomes even remotely viable again .
Supporting honest and effective public education reforms instead of trying to drag everyone else down to their own anti-intellectual level might be a good place to start .

" In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low - income consumers , the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing credit requirements on loans that it will purchase . . . [ to ] encourage . . . banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good . . . .
Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk . "
~ New York Times , September 30 , 1999
The main cause of the current economic crisis is the boom - and - bust cycle that was caused by the Greenspan Fed .
Years of artificially - lowered interest rates caused trillions of dollars in mal - investment in real estate and other industries , and now we must endure the bust .
But crackpot egalitarianism within the Fed and , indeed , in the entire Washington establishment , has made the crisis infinitely worse .
In the early 1990s the Boston Fed did all that it could to fabricate " evidence " of widespread lending discrimination against racial minorities .
But when Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer of Forbes magazine asked Boston Fed official Alicia Munnel what evidence of discrimination she really had , she was forced to admit that she had none .
Fighting discrimination was not the Fed ’s real goal .
The real goal was to achieve a more " egalitarian distribution " of housing , period .
So under the phony guise of " fighting discrimination " the Fed , the Congress , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and myriad other federal government agencies forced , bribed , and extorted mortgage lenders of all kinds into making literally trillions of dollars in bad loans to unqualified borrowers .
Countrywide Bank alone was praised by the Fed for making $ 600 billion in such loans ( shortly before it went bankrupt ) .
The Fed ’s " smoking gun " in this entire charade is a Boston Fed publication entitled " Closing the Gap : A Guide to Equal Opportunity Lending . "
There is a gap , you see , between the value of real estate owned by middle - and upper - income Americans on the one hand , and lower - income Americans on the other .
( There is also a luxury automobile gap , a two - week European vacation gap , a luxury boat gap , an expensive suit gap , and many others ) .
The federal government has used all of its powers of threats , force , and intimidation over the past two decades to try to close the housing " gap . "
" The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston wants to be helpful to lenders as they work to close the mortgage gap , " the publication states .
In addition to closing the " mortgage gap , " the Fed also pressured lenders to adopt a more vigorous racial hiring quota system , presumably under the theory that minority loan officers would be more likely to acquiesce in the Fed ’s dictates to make more mortgage loans to its political mascots , sub - prime borrowers .
The Boston Fed report claims that it is only offering lenders " guidelines , " and " suggestions , " but it is very clear that failure to obey the Fed ’s " guidelines " can lead to serious financial problems for any mortgage lender .
The report states in bold type that " Failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or Regulation B can subject a financial institution to civil liability for actual and punitive damages in individual or class actions .
Liability for punitive damages can be as much as $ 10,000 in individual actions and the lesser of $ 500,000 or 1 percent of the creditor ’s net worth in class actions . "
All lenders — banks , independent mortgage companies , etc. — were told that they needed to pay close attention to " such laws and regulations as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( Regulation B ) , the Fair Housing Act , the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ( Regulation C ) , and the Community Reinvestment Act . "
A " conscientious [ bank ]
Board will recognize the potential liability associated with noncompliance . . . "
Ah , the subtle power of suggestion .
The Fed instructed lenders to ignore traditional measures of creditworthiness when it came to " minority and low - income consumers . "
Traditional underwriting standards were said to contain " arbitrary or unreasonable measures of creditworthiness . "
" Special standards " that " are appropriate to the economic culture of urban , lower - income , and non-traditional consumers " were urged .
For example , traditional underwriting standards take into consideration such things as age , location , and condition of a house , but these should be abandoned when it comes to sub - prime borrowers , said the Fed .
Traditional ratios of mortgage payments to monthly income can also be ignored , said the Fed .
And besides , " the secondary market [ i.e. , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ] is willing to consider ratios above the standard " ones for other borrowers .
" Lack of credit history " should not be a factor either .
" Successful participation in credit counseling " was said to be an adequate substitute .
Lenders were repeatedly urged to " work with special secondary mortgage market programs " such as those administered by Fannie and Freddie .
Lenders were told to " be aware that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have issued statements to the effect that they understand urban areas require different appraisal methods . "
If a sub - prime borrower has a property appraisal problem , then the Fed or Fannie Mae could help to find " another experienced appraiser " who would presumably see to it that the property was " correctly " reappraised so that the sub - prime loan could be made .
Yours truly was always under the impression that shopping around for " the right " appraiser who would give you the number you wanted ( for a fee ) was fraudulent and illegal .
Silly me .
In sum , the Fed ’s policy of housing market socialism ( endorsed and supplemented by numerous federal laws and regulations ) , combined with the boom - and - bust cycle that it created , has been an unmitigated economic catastrophe for the entire world .
Naturally , the Fed ’s response has been to grant itself even more powers , while the executive branch and Congress are busy nationalizing the capital markets , a move that will kill American capitalism .
Abolishing the Fed would be a very modest first step in dismantling our rotten Leviathan state so that the next generation can at least have some hope of living in a reasonably free and prosperous society .
The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
When Congress reopens for business this week , lobbyists will descend upon Capitol Hill , seeking relief for clients suffering from the economic meltdown .
Among those pressuring for a bailout : city transit agencies .
As ProPublica and othersreported recently , the meltdown of insurance giant AIG could leave more than 30 public transit agencies on the hook for up to $ 3 billion .
The problem stems from the recent failure of longstanding financing deals between banks and agencies such as the Washington , D.C. , Metropolitan Area Transit Authority , or Metro .
As part of the deals , banks bought transit equipment from cities and then leased them back to the transit agencies to use at a discount .
The banks received sizeable tax breaks , and the agencies enjoyed much - needed cash up front from the deals , which are now banned by the IRS .
AIG guaranteed many of these so - called tax shelters -- until its credit rating was slashed in September , sending the deals into default .
Now , banks have begun to demand huge termination fees from Washington , D.C. , and other major cities .
D.C. ’s Metro authority settled last Friday with a Belgian bank , which had been seeking $ 43 million from the agency .
Though neither side disclosed the terms of the deal , Metro officials touted the settlement as a success that might discourage other banks from seeking collection .
" This sends a message to banks that you ’re not going to be able to make a windfall on the backs of transit agencies , " said Metro spokeswoman , Candace Smith .
Last week ’s settlement apparently was not enough to satisfy Metro .
The agency has dispatched its lobbyists to the lame duck session of Congress , seeking help on another 14 now - in - default deals with banks that could cost Metro about $ 300 million , more than half its capital budget .
Metro's lobbyists , Holland & Knight , will ask Congress to carve out aid for transit agencies from the potential upcoming stimulus package , Smith said .
( So far this year , Metro has paid $ 120,000 to Holland & Knight , a top lobbying firm that also represents Atlanta 's transit agency , another system facing bank disputes .
The firm did not return a phone call seeking an explanation of its plan to help the agencies . )
Holland & Knight could find allies in the Senate .
Last month , top Senate Democrats from states affected by the deals wrote to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , saying " several banks could enjoy unjustified windfalls " if the government did n’t intervene .
But the stimulus package could fail , or some lawmakers might balk at bailing out transit agencies that helped banks shelter millions in income from taxes .
In that case , transit officials have a contingency plan : Executives from several city transit agencies will hit the Hill tomorrow to plead their case .
Specifically , they will ask Congress to pressure the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to replace AIG as the guarantor of the deals .
This plan " wo n't cost the federal government anything , " said Smith , of Metro .
That is , unless transit agencies go bankrupt or fail to make lease payments to the banks .
Because the federal government approved and once promoted ( PDF ) some of the tax shelters in its " innovative financing handbook " ( PDF ) , Metro officials argue that the government is obliged to help .
" The only reason we pursued these is the federal government said , ' Go ahead and do it , ' " Smith said .
But the Treasury has been reluctant to offer support .
Secretary Paulson said at a news conference last week that aiding the transit agencies is " not the focus " of the government 's $ 700 billion bailout plan .
If the government does not intervene , the dozens of shelter deals remaining nationwide could end up in court .
If the banks win in court , transit agencies have threatened to make significant cuts to services .
Agencies in Los Angeles , San Francisco , Chicago , Atlanta , Philadelphia , San Diego , New Jersey and several other cities and states could face service cuts , according to news reports .
Still , some banks are eager to settle , because the IRS is offering a kind of amnesty for firms that terminate their now - banned shelters by the end of the year .
In Metro 's dispute with the Belgian bank , a U.S. District Court judge suggested a settlement that would give the bank about $ 17 million from a trust account that Metro created to make lease payments .
The judge barred the final settlement terms from being disclosed , though it 's likely that Metro paid less than the $ 43 million the bank demanded .
In an earlier settlement , Metro paid another bank $ 30 million .
Secretly , Mr Harter had instructed six investment banks to each buy options on 4.99 pc of VW shares to bring Porsche 's stake up from 35 pc to the magic 75 pc level .
Now he allowed the banks to lend this stock too to make even more money from the hedge funds .
It has been speculated that , as the hedge funds piled in , he foresaw the opportunity of cornering the short - sellers , therefore being able to name his price to settle and force billions out of them , but there is no evidence of this .

KISUMU , Kenya ( Reuters Life ! ) -
The U.S. election has triggered a new generation of mini Barack Obamas with parents in Kenya and the United States naming their newborns after the new president - elect .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
At the Nyanza Provincial General Hospital in Kisumu , western Kenya , Barack ’s ancestral homeland , several mothers were naming their babies after the U.S. ’s first African - American president .
The mothers told Reuters Television that they wanted their babies to grow up to have the same successful traits as Obama .
“ I would like that by the time he is in his 40s he becomes the president of this country , ” said Nancy Otieno proudly of her newborn son Barack Obama .
Another new mother , Millicent Akoth , named her new daughter Michelle Obama after the soon - to - be first lady .
Obama has been elevated to rock star status in the east African nation which has named a beer , “ Senator , ” after him and where “ Obama : The Musical ” opened last weekend .
Obama , who was born in Hawaii to a white mother from Kansas and a Kenyan father , is idolized by many Africans in the way the Irish revered U.S. President John F. Kennedy in the 1960s -- as one of their own who succeeded beyond their wildest dreams .
But it is not just Kenyans naming their babies after him .
South Florida couple Patrick and Sasha Hall were reported on Wednesday to be among the first since the election to bestow the name Obama on their child , Obama Hall , according to the Miami Herald .
The name Barack means blessed , according to Web site babynames.com , while Obama was the given name of his great - grandfather that became his grandfather ’s surname .

Which banks are getting the Treasury Department ’s billions ?
As we noted earlier today , a slew of regional banks have signed up for the government ’s capital injection program , but the government is not saying which banks are getting taxpayer money .
Based on news reports and press releases , we ’ve cobbled together a partial list , totaling 26 banks at an overall investment of approximately $ 160 billion .
According to reports , the Treasury Department has approved at least 28 banks – meaning that there are two that , as far as we can tell , have n’t been made public .
If you know who we ’re missing , please drop us a line .
Here ’s our list :
In the last several days , the Treasury has reportedly approved some 20 regional banks to participate , added to the eight national banks that joined two weeks ago , that should make 28 .
A refresher :
Under the terms of the program , the Treasury ’s money is technically invested as preferred stock , though it ’s essentially a loan , returning 5 % per year ( after five years , the rate rises to 9 % ) .
The government is also given common stock warrants worth 15 % of the investment .
In their press releases touting the investment , the banks have tried to play it cool , insisting that while they 're happy to have the cash , of course they do n't need it .
Most stress that they have no real need of the money , but could n’t resist the attractive terms .
A number boast that they are among the most strongly capitalized banks in the country , These banks tend to say that they ’ll use the money to increase lending , protect against bad times , and buy up weaker banks .
Others trumpet the Treasury ’s investment as a blessing that they are a “ healthy ” bank .
( UCBH ’s CEO : " This is an enormous statement of confidence and demonstrates that we are a healthy financial organization that can help support the U.S. financial markets in this time of economic turmoil . " )
And then there ’s what you might call the patriotic reaction .
A handful of banks proclaimed themselves honored to do their part for the U.S. economy .

Paul Krugman calls for Obama and his advisors to push an expanded version of the New Deal ( see the link below by Mark R. Hatlie ) .
According to Krugman , they should boldly throw caution to the winds and figure out how much help they think the economy needs , than add 50 percent .
It s much better in a depressed economy , to err on the side of too much stimulus . 
Obama should reject this advice .
If he listens to Krugman , the likely result will be a wave of stagflation that makes the experience of the 1970s look mild by comparison .
Such a prescription would both continue and accelerate Bushs fiscally reckless policy of propping up malinvestments through massive increases in spending , deficits , and easy credit by the Federal Reserve .
As the continuing fall of the stock market and the rise of unemployment indicate , more bailouts and more  shock socialism  do not work .
Obama made a fatal mistake in failing to oppose the aptly described billionaire bailout .
This call for a hyper New Deal rests on a flawed view of history .
According Krugman , the only reason Roosevelt failed to bring recovery was because he spent too little , not too much .
At the same time , he tries to have it both ways by stating that the crisis of the 1930s would have been much worse without the New Deal .
A key problem with Krugmans analysis is that it does not adequately explain why the decade - long New Deal era depression lasted so much longer than previous depressions .
Prior to the 1930s , depressions ( as in the sharp and short downturn of 1921 and 1922 ) had typically lasted for two to three years .
The predominant anti-depression policy before Hoover and Roosevelt was to cut spending , balance budgets , and let prices , profits , and wages readjust to more sustainable levels .
Yet Krugman regards this older approach for curing depressions as much worse than the New Deal .
The logical implication of his argument is that the New Deal , modest as it was , would have made the Great Depression at least somewhat shorter than previous downturns .
The fact that it did not stands as a stunning indictment of FDRs policies .
The unprecedented duration of the depression also represents an indictment of Herbert Hoovers approach .
This was because Hoover intervened too much not , as Krugman would have it , too little .
Krugmans article neglects the relevant point that Hoover had pursued a mini-New Deal from 1929 to 1933 via programs such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Federal Farm Board .
It was Hoover , not Roosevelt , who was the first president to reject the advice of the leave it alone liquidationists .
Instead of letting malinvestments ( or toxic assets in todays parlance ) readjust at a lower level , he desperately propped them up .
In great part because of Hoovers high - wage policies , real wages were actually 12 percent higher in 1932 than in 1929 !
Meanwhile , of course , unemployment advanced to record levels as businesses saved on payroll costs by laying off workers .
Perhaps if Hoover had listened to the advice of the so - called liquidationists ,  the depression would have been over by 1931 .
More troubling , at least for opponents of war , is Krugmans dubious contention that  What saved the economy , and the New Deal , was the enormous public works project known as World War II , which finally provided a fiscal stimulus adequate to the economys needs .
The evidence does not support the view that that war was beneficial for the economy .
In a seminal article for the Journal of Economic History , Robert Higgs convincingly challenged the Keynesian theory of World War II as put forward by Krugman and others .
While unemployment disappeared during the war , it was hardly a step forward .
Moving men and women from the unemployment lines to the killing fields of Anzio did not represent economic progress in any meaningful sense .
During the war , Americans at home suffered from rationing , shortages , more accidents on the job , longer hours , and many other measures of economic deprivation .
Moreover , as Higgs points out , real personal consumption declined .
So did real private investment .
From 1941 to 1943 real gross private domestic investment plunged by 64 percent ; during the four years of the war it never rose above 55 percent of its 1941 level ; only in 1946 did it reach a new high . 
According to Higgs , genuine prosperity did not begin to return until the last months of 1945 and 1946 .
This prosperity occurred under a policy of reverse Keynesianism which included massive reductions in spending because of demoblization , rapid steps toward price decontrol , and scaled back deficit spending .
Higgs sums it up :
World War II , the so - called Good War , has been a fount of historical fallacies .
One of the greatest  and one of the most pernicious for subsequent policymakers  is the notion that prosperity prevailed during the war .
Although Americans might have been dying in the Pacific and European theaters of war , people on the home front actually benefited from the war , because it propelled the economy at long last out of the Great Depression .
This view of the war would be sufficiently egregious if it were true , but despite the claims of historians for the past half century , it is not true .
Obama ’s best hope to bring lasting recovery is to let the economy go through a short , but sharp , readjustment .
He needs to remove the malivestments not , contra Krugman , perpetuate them .
Obama can facilitate this readjustment to a more sustainable level by cancelling the bailout , cutting spending , and pruning deficits .
Another worthy goal would be to dismantle the Federal Reserve which helped to create this mess through its easy credit policies .
Most of all , however , Obama should end our costly empire by closing down our overseas bases and bringing home the troops .
Only then , can we start to get our financial house in order and move towards genuine economic well being .

The Best of David T. Beito
EXCLUSIVE :
From his sickbed , Sen. Edward M. Kennedy has secretly been orchestrating meetings with lobbyists and lawmakers from both parties to craft legislation that would greet the new president with a plan to provide affordable medical coverage to all Americans , a measure he has called “ the cause of my life . ”
Mr. Kennedy has been sidelined for months with a dangerous form of brain cancer .
But despite his disheartening medical prognosis - or maybe because of it - aides and activists say , the Massachusetts Democrat ’s decades - long quest for health care reform may now be closer to success than ever .
“ There is a serious process moving forward and that augurs well , ” said Ron Pollack , executive director of Families USA , a nonprofit health care advocacy group .
“ There really is a sea change that should not be underestimated in terms of attitude . ”
Among those who are receptive to a bipartisan plan and who have participated in the initial talks is Sen. Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming , the ranking Republican on the Senate health committee , which Mr. Kennedy leads .
The meetings “ are a testament to how people feel about him , ” Enzi spokesman Michael Mahaffey said .
“ Senator Enzi is looking forward to working with Senator Kennedy on this issue . ”
Mr. Kennedy ’s goal , his aides say , is to introduce a universal health care bill as soon as the new Congress convenes next year and to push quickly for its passage - a much - accelerated timetable compared with the last time that a health care overhaul was on the agenda , at the start of the Clinton administration .
“ Senator Kennedy has spent the last several weeks laying the groundwork for reform so that we can be ready to go in 2009 , ” said his spokesman Anthony Coley .
“ This is and has been the cause of Senator Kennedy ’s life . ”
He also hopes the bill ’s fortunes will be helped by the extensive private consultations between his staff and major players in the health care system .
His aides have met with representatives of business groups , labor unions , consumer organizations , insurers , physicians , drug companies and hospitals .
President Clinton ’s health care initiative faltered 15 years ago largely because he was unable to gain the support of many of these key factions after constructing a plan that kept many Congress members in the dark for months .
Mr. Kennedy is also moving with the knowledge of the presidential candidate who ’s now leading in the polls , Sen. Barack Obama , and appears determined not to repeat the Clinton - era mistakes .
While Mr. Kennedy is shooting for universal coverage , the two men running for president - John McCain and Mr. Obama - have their own plans that many analysts say fall short of that goal .
An Obama Senate aide sat in on many of the early Kennedy meetings ; no McCain aide did .
The wide - ranging talks have taken place behind closed doors on Capitol Hill and have been monitored by Mr. Kennedy through daily telephone updates from his staff , said his aides and several participants .
The discussions , which started in June , included 14 roundtable meetings in the Dirksen Senate Office Building .
These were attended not only by Kennedy aides but also by staffers , both Republicans and Democrats , from the Senate committees with jurisdiction over health care .
Those include the Budget Committee , the Finance Committee and the committee that Mr. Kennedy leads , the Committee on Health , Education , Labor and Pensions .
Also attending was the entire panoply of interest groups with stakes in the cost and availability of health coverage .
These included the AFL - CIO , the Business Roundtable , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the National Federation of Independent Business , the National Retail Federation , the Federation of American Hospitals , the American Medical Association , America ’s Health Insurance Plans , Families USA , AARP and the Consumers Union .
Mr. Kennedy ’s staff has started to meet regularly with a small group of people representing each facet of industry as well as consumers .
Kennedy aides said they have not drafted legislation but probably will do so soon .
The conversations are extraordinary for several reasons .
First , they have been bipartisan - a rarity in the increasingly polarized capital these days .
The talks also have managed to put in the same room interests that rarely meet - let alone agree with one another .
No one is under the illusion that finding a compromise will be easy .
Indeed , it remains unclear that a long - elusive consensus can be found .
Participants agree , however , that Mr. Kennedy ’s active role - particularly during his convalescence - have increased the likelihood of a breakthrough .
“ He sets aside several hours each day .
He ’s calling senators .
He ’s working tirelessly , ” Mr. Pollack said .
“ He ’s making things happen . ”
“ Kennedy is really seizing the moment , ” said Adrienne Hahn of Consumers Union .
“ He ’s a real bridge - builder .
He can bring strange bedfellows together . ”
Mr. Kennedy ’s close relationship with Mr. Obama could prove a boon to those prospects as well .
Kennedy aides say that although they were not working with the Obama campaign on their plan , they also are not considering proposals to which a President Obama would object .
“ Were Obama to win , [ Mr. Kennedy ] will have significant influence on an Obama administration ? ” Mr. Pollack predicted .
The senator from Massachusetts was an early backer of Mr. Obama ’s presidential run , and his speech at the Democratic National Convention in August , which focused on health care reform , was one of the event ’s highlights .
“ I pledge to you that I will be there next January on the floor of the United States Senate , ” Mr. Kennedy told the cheering crowd in Denver .
“ This is the cause of my life , new hope that we will break the old gridlock and guarantee that every American - north , south , east , west , young , old - will have decent , quality health care as a fundamental right and not a privilege . ”
But Mr. Kennedy will not be the only lawmaker to offer a health care package next year .
Sen .
Max Baucus , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , also might introduce a proposal , though a Baucus aide said the Montana Democrat plans to work closely with Mr. Kennedy .
The 76 - year - old senator received a diagnosis in May of a malignant brain tumor and , after surgery , chemotherapy and radiation treatment , has been recuperating at his family ’s compound in Hyannis Port .
Insiders say he devotes several hours a day to his health care project .
“ Here ’s a guy who has made a serious effort on health reform several times in the past and failed , ” said John Rother , a top executive at AARP , the senior citizens lobby .
“ There will be a very strong impulse in the Congress to do things for him , especially things he really cares about , and health care would be at the top of that list . ”
“ There is this real feeling , ” Mr. Rother added : ” ‘ Let ’s do it for Ted . ’ ”

There is a little girl in the Meir Wais hospital with livid scars and dead skin across her face , an obscene map of brown and pink tissue .
Then there is another girl , a beautiful child , Khorea Horay , grimacing in pain , her leg amputated , her life destroyed after her foot was torn to pieces .
In another ward , two girls lie on their backs , a tent above their limbs .
One has lost an arm , another – a 16 - year - old – a leg .
Then there is the grim young man with the beard , also in the darkest pain , who looks at me with suspicion and puzzlement .
He has a bullet wound in the abdomen , a great incision sutured up after the doctors found it infected .
Two other young men , also bearded , cowled in brown " patu " shawls , sit beside this suffering warrior .
They , too , stare at me as if I am a visitor from Mars .
Perhaps that 's what I am in Kandahar .
Better to be a Martian than a Westerner in a city which in all but name has fallen to the Taliban .
The black turbans are everywhere .
So are the blue burkhas which we Westerners confidently – stupidly – believed would vanish from Afghan society .
But the Taliban insist they were not responsible for throwing acid in the face of the little girl in the second - floor ward at Meir Wais hospital .
You know what she is thinking .
You know what her parents are thinking .
Who will marry this girl now , with her patchwork face of pain ?
Four men on a motorcycle threw acid at her and 13 of her friends on their way to school .
Four were brought here , two dispatched immediately to the eye department .
The Taliban deny any involvement .
But they would , would n't they ?

Khorea Horay is a victim of that other tormentor of southern Afghanistan , the forces of Western " civilisation " who dispense " collateral damage " to the poor and the illiterate of Kandahar province in their determination to bring " freedom " and " democracy " to the land that defeated both Alexander the Great and Ghengis Khan .
The Americans air - raided her village of Shahrwali Kut in their battle against " terrorism " ; a Taliban on a nearby hilltop appears to have fired a missile at Nato troops before our Western technology arrived to crush Khorea 's village .
" I looked downwards and my foot was in little pieces , " she said .
" They came from the sky and from the ground .
It started in the afternoon and went on into the night . "
In all , 36 members of a wedding party were killed in Shahrwali Kut on 5 November .
That 's why she is one of the lucky ones .
But luck is relative .
Nato forces in southern Afghanistan have promised an inquiry .
Needless to say , not a single Western soldier has visited Khorea 's hospital ward to say sorry , even to offer a little compassion .
The two girls with amputations are very definitely victims of the Taliban .
They were walking in the very centre of Kandahar when a suicide bomber exploded an oil tanker packed with explosives outside the council office which still – theoretically – belongs to the government .
The target was Wali Karzai , governor of Kandahar , brother of President Hamid Karzai , a man still desperately denying that he is a local drugs warlord .
He escaped .
Six died .
Of the 45 wounded brought to the Meir Wais hospital , almost all were women and children , many of them crushed by falling walls after the explosion .
The doctors lost only one of their patients , a senior police officer , while two bodies were brought to the hospital morgue , one of them a woman .
The Taliban happily claimed responsibility for the bomb which tore their own people apart – and which allowed the Nato commander , US General David McKiernan , to pump out some familiar warspeak .
" These cowardly acts reflect how dishonourable the insurgents truly are , " he said .
" No one can honestly say they are fighting for the people ... " .
But who is " fighting for the people " of Kandahar ?
To its immense credit , the International Committee of the Red Cross is donating £ 1 m a year to the Meir Wais hospital and 11 of its international staff are – incredibly – working full - time in Kandahar .
Every other NGO has fled the Taliban city but the ICRC – in contact with " all parties " , as the ubiquitous codicil goes – are dispensing medicines , surgical help and courage .
They come from Switzerland , France , Ivory Coast , Hungary , New Zealand , Australia and other nations – and walk a tightrope in this terribly dangerous city .
Anyone who still chastises the ICRC for its pusillanimous role in confronting the Nazi Holocaust of the Second World War should meet the brave men and women who work here .
A little girl is brought into the hospital in a green dress .
" Is n't she beautiful ? " Nola Henrya nurse from Australia asked us .
" She fractured a bone , but it got infected .
Now we will see if we can save her leg . "
Green -eyed , her tousled black hair falling over her face , the three - year - old sits on the cold concrete floor , eyeing us , half suspicious , half - mischievous , conscious of being the centre of our attention .
They often arrive like this , too late for surgery or for cure .
Many families arrive from the villages with children dying in their arms .
" We are an uneducated people , " an Afghan doctor told me with painful if unnecessary humility .
" These people do not know what is wrong with their children and they wait till it 's bad before they bring them here .
By then , it is very bad . "
I look at one - year - old Nourallah .
He is a skeletal creature as light as a pillow , his eyes glazing over at us within circles of skin .
And it is all too clear what is wrong with many of these children .
They are dying of hunger .
There is a mini-famine in the desolation of the deserts of Kandahar and Helmand .
Malnutrition here is a kind of disease .
So is fear .
I talk to a young Afghan woman hospital worker , dressed in a burkha , educated in Pakistan , fluent in English .
" I am afraid , " she said .
" We are all afraid .
We all feel threatened .
It 's not just ' them ' [ she means the Taliban ] but it 's my own relatives , my aunt , my cousin .
I do not tell them what I do .
I just say I work in a hospital . "
Across Kandahar , there is great anger .
At the government 's corruption , at the Nato occupation and their killings .
Little is said of the Taliban .
But who condemns those who are winning the war ?
Taliban officials now speak with near - courtesy of the Tadjiks and Uzbeks and Hazaras who were their sectarian enemies in the awful years of Taliban rule .
" If they are against the occupation , they are all friends now , " one of the wisest local residents said .
There is a new vein of nationalism within the Taliban .
" Twenty per cent of the population here are Shias and their mosques were turned into Sunni places of worship by the Taliban during their rule .
But now the Shias are asking their mullahs what they should do if America attacks Iran , and their mullahs told them that if this happens , they should support the Islamic Republic and attack all American and Nato interests in Kandahar . "
Beside the vast American airbase 20 miles away , a Nato metropolis adjacent to the most Islamist city in Afghanistan , the " international " airport sits in a slough of despond , its chain - smoking Afghan soldiers scarcely bothering to carry out security procedures on passengers , its echoing , empty departure lounges adorned with crude advertisements for tourist agencies that no longer exist and for an Afghan army which disappears from the roads after 4 pm every day .
I stood beside the runway yesterday , watching the armada of US air fleets roaring into the pale blue wintry sky , Russian - built transports and high - flying US reconnaissance jets and Kiowa helicopters and the softly landing Predators and Raptors , the hi-tech , broad - winged pilotless spotters and killers .
The Predators look for the targets .
The Raptors fire Hellfire missiles – manufacturers , Boeing and Lockheed Martin .
One Raptor returned with its missiles still locked to its wings .
Was its mission aborted over Pakistan ?
Or Helmand ?
Another took off .
Two minutes later – I could still just see it – at 1,500 feet , US personnel at Tampa , Florida , would have taken over its flight path .
It was 11.30 in the morning , a computer guiding its progress at 2 am US Eastern Standard Time .
Does the guiding hand on the other side of the world have any idea of the political direction in which this machine is flying ?
Or of the people it threatens .
Barack Obama wants to send 7,000 more American troops to this disaster zone .
Does he have the slightest idea what is going on in Afghanistan ?
For if he did , he would send 7,000 doctors .
Iceland : A portent of the future
29 November 2008
Iceland is facing a social and economic catastrophe .
Its 300,000 people have suffered the worst and most immediate impact of the worldwide financial crisis of any advanced country .
For that reason , the events in Iceland offer a portent of developments that must inevitably unfold in much larger nations and on the international arena .
Iceland 's banking system has collapsed , plunging its entire economy into an accelerating decline .
In the space of seven days in October , its three major banks became insolvent and the government was forced to step in and take them over .
The Brown Labour government in Britain used anti-terror laws in an effort to force the return of hundreds of millions invested there by individuals , company 's pension schemes , local councils , charities and police forces — much of which will not be retrieved .
The scale of the losses was due to Iceland 's efforts to become a centre for global speculative investments , primarily by linking bank rates to inflation , which exceeded 15 percent .
Its banks offered rates often 50 percent higher than available elsewhere .
At its height , Iceland 's banks held foreign assets worth up to ten times its gross domestic product , with much of this investment secured against international loans .
It represented a huge speculative bubble built on a pyramid scheme of unsustainable debt .
Iceland is effectively bankrupt and cannot possibly repay its vast debts .
The losses that have now been suffered by foreign creditors are estimated to be above $ 40 billion .
Landsbanki's online banking unit Icesave , for example , attracted more $ 6.75 billion in investments in the UK and $ 1.5 billion in the Netherlands .
Both countries are demanding these sums are returned , a debt greater than Iceland 's entire GDP .
As Jon Danielsson , reader in finance at the London School of Economics , pointed out , " By comparison , the total amount of reparations payments demanded of Germany following World War I was around 85 percent of GDP . "
Iceland has only staved off default by securing $ 10 billion in financial assistance .
A $ 2.1 billion loan from the IMF is the first time that a developed country has received such assistance since Britain in 1976 .
It will be accompanied by demands for the type of " structural adjustment programmes " suffered by many impoverished African and Asian countries so that global debts can be " serviced " .
In addition Sweden , Norway , Denmark and Finland have lent $ 2.5 billion , with additional loans agreed by other European countries fearing the impact of total economic collapse .
The economy is in meltdown .
In domestic currency terms GDP has contracted by 15 percent , but due to the collapse of the krona 's value this represents 65 percent in euro terms .
Iceland 's currency is almost impossible to trade internationally .
The value of the krona has halved and inflation has reached 17.1 percent , rising by 1.74 percent in a single month .
Essentials have risen even faster , with food prices rising by 30 percent .
Companies are folding every day and making thousands of workers redundant .
About a third of the population are believed to have lost all or most of their savings .
The situation is so bad that , in surveys , one third of respondents said they were considering emigration .
Many young people , with employment skills , are already leaving .
This is the background for the political protests now taking place regularly in the capital Reykjavik — directed against both the coalition government of the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance and the IMF .
The concern within the media and ruling circles for the fate of Iceland is palpable .
Max Keiser wrote in the Huffington Post asking , " Who Could Have Predicted Revolution in Iceland ? "
He reports how earlier , " I asked the Head of Research at Kaupthing Bank , if when the global debt bubble did burst , the people might ‘ rise up ' in anger as they did in France in the 1780's .
He laughed at the question : Today , the Icelandic people are calling for revolution , literally . "
The investment journal Fall Street.com also poses the question , " Who would have ever imagined that Iceland would be in a virtual state of economic anarchy and revolution ? "
However , fears extend far wider than the economic and political fate of Iceland .
Danielson insists that " Europe 's leaders urgently need to take steps to prevent similar things from happening to small nations with big banking sectors . "
Hungary has already negotiated a $ 16 billion loan from the IMF and $ 8 billion from the European Union that demands massive cuts in services , jobs and pensions , workers suffering a wage freeze and losing a yearly bonus worth eight percent of pay .
Ukraine was loaned $ 16.5 billion from the IMF and Belarus , Serbia , Romania , Latvia , Estonia and Lithuania are reportedly actively seeking loans .
Ireland is predicted to also follow Iceland 's path .
All News Web Ireland states that " there is a good chance that Ireland might be the next European nation to hit the skids in a big way .
‘ The Irish property market is severely overpriced , and the level of debt here is sky - high : as people realise they can't eat a house and as investment from the US starts drying the bubble will burst ' argues Sean McCarthy , a senior economic advisor to the Irish banking sector .
‘ When the property bubble truly deflates here and panic takes over God help Ireland . ' "
The investment blog Credit Writedowns notes that whereas " Ireland was the first country to offer a blanket guarantee to its banks ' depositors , " the " country has an outsized financial sector which could not possibly be guaranteed by the Irish government . "
Therefore , " It remains to be seen whether there is a sub-current of panic about the fragile Irish banking system that could lead it to Iceland 's fate . "
Fears of national bankruptcy leading to social and political unrest are not , moreover , confined to small nations .
There is serious discussion of a similar fate awaiting the world 's fifth largest economy , the UK .
Patrick Hosking asked in the November 22 edition of Times , " Is Britain simply a bigger version of Iceland ?
Certainly the City of London is starting to look a bit too much like Reykjavik , but with taller buildings and fewer cod ...
In essence the domestic banks are largely bust .
The Government 's £ 500 billion bailout plan is primarily designed not to keep banks lending to small firms and to homebuyers but to prevent an unimaginable financial calamity . "
Hosking concludes with an ominous warning : " Banks provide the very foundations and plumbing of the entire economy .
A failure of confidence in them could still bring the entire capitalist edifice tumbling down ...
At the risk of hyperbole , we should not be worrying about whether this is going to be a thin Christmas for retailers ( it is ) , but whether Britain and the West are about to plunge into a years - long economic Dark Age — complete with mass unemployment and social unrest . "
It is such an understanding of the implications of the unfolding global economic crisis that must now begin to inform and animate a political rebirth of the workers ' movement internationally and its reorientation on a socialist programme for the abolition of the profit system .

Chinese carmakers SAIC and Dongfeng have plans to acquire GM and Chrysler , China ’s 21st Century Business Herald reports today .
[ A National Enquirer the paper is not .
It is one of China ’s leading business newspapers , with a daily readership over three million . ]
The paper cites a senior official of China ’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology – the state regulator of China ’s auto industry – who dropped the hint that “ the auto manufacturing giants in China , such as Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation ( SAIC ) and Dongfeng Motor Corporation , have the capability and intention to buy some assets of the two crisis - plagued American automakers . ”
These hints are very often followed with quick action in the Middle Kingdom .
The hints were dropped just a few days after the same Chinese government gave its auto makers the go - ahead to invest abroad .
And why would they do that ?
A take - over of a large overseas auto maker would fit perfectly into China ’s plans .
As reported before , China has realized that its export chances are slim without unfettered access to foreign technology .
The brand cachet of Chinese cars abroad is , shall we say , challenged .
The Chinese could easily export Made - in - China VWs , Toyotas , Buicks .
If their joint venture partner would let them .
The solution : Buy the joint venture partner .
Especially , when he ’s in deep trouble .
At current market valuations ( GM is worth less than Mattel ) the Chinese government can afford to buy GM with petty cash .
Even a hundred billion $ would barely dent China ’s more than $ 2t in currency reserves .
For nobody in the world would buying GM and ( while they are at it ) Chrysler make more sense than for the Chinese .
Overlap ?
What overlap ?
They would gain instant access to the world ’s markets with accepted brands , and proven technology .
21st Century Business Herald , obviously with input from higher - up , writes that Chinese industry must change and upgrade .
China wants their factories to change from low - value - added manufacturing to technically innovative and financially - sound high - value - add industries .
Says the paper : “ It would be much easier now for strong Chinese automakers to go global by acquiring some assets of their U.S. counterparts in times of crisis . ”
Deloitte & Touche sees a trend : “ Chinese automakers can start with buying out the OEM projects and Chinese ventures of some global carmakers such as GM and Chrysler . ”
The Chinese appear to have bigger plans than an accounting firm can imagine .
21st Century Business
Herald acts and writes as if its already a done deal , and the beginning of more to come .
“ In the coming two years China is likely to see a few of its large Chinese automakers and other manufacturing enterprises set a precedent for achieving globalization by acquiring global companies , just like SAIC or Dongfeng ’s possible acquisition of troubled GM or Chrysler . ”
Just in case you missed it , the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation ( SAIC ) is China ’s largest auto manufacturer .
In 1984 , the company entered a joint venture with Volkswagen .
A decade later , SAIC entered a joint venture with General Motors .
In 2007 , SAIC bought the Nanjing Automobile Corporation , which had acquired British MG Rover in 2005 .
Dongfeng Motor Corporation is a public company , although 70 percent of their shares are reported to be in government hands .
They also are one of China ’s Big Three .
The company has numerous joint venture partners , such as Nissan , Peugeot - Citroen , Honda , and Kia .
Dongfeng ( which means “ East Wind ” ) was founded at the behest of Mao Zedong himself in 1968 .

Forensic " Lie Detection " :
Procedures Without Scientific Basis
William G. Iacono , PhD
ABSTRACT .
This paper provides a critical overview of the scientific status of the control question test ( CQT ) , the type of polygraph test most likely to be used in forensic settings .
The CQT is based on an implausible set of assumptions that makes it biased against innocent individuals and easy for guilty persons to defeat using countermeasures .
Due to serious methodological problems that characterize research on CQT validity , it is not possible to use the existing literature to provide a satisfactory error rate estimate .
Scientists , including members of the Society for Psychophysiological Research and APA Fellows , hold negative views about the CQT .
They do not believe that it is based on sound theory , that it has adequate psychometric properties , or that it should be used as evidence in court .

KEYWORDS .
Forensic , lie detection , Control Question Test , polygraph
Although there are several types of " lie detector " tests , psychologists are most likely to encounter use of the control question test { 76} ( CQT ) in a forensic setting .
The CQT is not so much a standardized test as it is a collection of procedures that combine interview techniques with physiological recording .
These procedures vary in the nature of the interview , how questions are developed and ordered , and how the results are scored and interpreted .
All CQTs , however , whether referred to as zone of comparison tests , modified general question tests , or directed lie tests , have certain elements in common that make it possible to evaluate them as a group .
The aim of this article is to familiarize readers with this type of polygraphic interrogation and to critically evaluate it .
Readers interested in a more comprehensive treatment of this subject matter , including coverage of other types of polygraph tests and detailed critiques of the scientific literature pertinent to the evaluation of polygraphy , will find ample coverage of these topics in other recent publications ( Ben -Shakar & Furedy , 1990 ; Iacono , 1991 ; Iacono & Lykken , 1997a ; Iacono & Lykken , 1999 ; Iacono & Patrick , 1997 ; Iacono & Patrick , 1998 ; Lykken , 1998 ; Saxe , 1994 ) .
NATURE OF THE CQT
Because there is no characteristic physiological response associated with lying , it is not possible to ask a person to answer a relevant question about an alleged misdeed ( e.g. , " Did you stab John ? " ) , record nervous system reactions , and make a determination of truthfulness .
Polygraphy has attempted to circumvent this problem by including in addition to a relevant question , a comparison question that is also used to elicit physiological reactions ( typically electrodermal activity , blood pressure , and respiration ) .
The first polygraph tests used as comparisons what have been called irrelevant questions , items dealing with unimportant facts known to both examiner and suspect ( e.g. , " Are you sitting down ? " , " Is today Tuesday ? " ) .
If a suspect responds more strongly to the relevant question , guilt is indicated , while similar sized responses to both types of questions signifies innocence .
This relevant / irrelevant test ( RIT ) format has been found wanting even by proponents of polygraphy because the irrelevant items do not provide an adequate control for the emotional impact of simply being presented with the accusatory relevant question .
Because the relevant question is more likely to be physiologically arousing than the irrelevant question even to an innocent person , it is perhaps not surprising that the RIT is widely believed to be strongly biased against innocent { 77} persons ( Horowitz , Kircher , Honts , & Raskin , 1997 ) .
Hence , it is seldom used in forensic investigations .
The CQT represents an effort to circumvent the problems inherent to the RIT by introducing a so - called " control " question , the response to which is compared to the relevant question .
Control questions are intended to elicit a lie or at least concern by posing a vague question covering possible minor misdeeds from a person 's past .
Examples of control questions include " Have you ever hurt someone to get revenge ? ' , or " Have you ever lied to a person in a position of authority ? "
The theory of the CQT assumes that it is highly likely that you have hurt someone or lied to an authority figure , so these questions will provide an example of what your physiological reactions to lies look like .
CQT theory further assumes that innocent people , because they are being truthful when they answer relevant questions " no , " will be relatively unaroused by these questions .
Instead , they are expected to be worried about their response to the control questions , so these items should produce larger reactions .
Guilty individuals , even though presumably lying to both questions , are expected to respond more strongly to the relevant question because it carries greater significance .
Hence , for the CQT to be valid , two assumptions must hold .
The first requires innocent individuals to be more responsive to control than relevant questions .
The second requires guilty persons to respond more intensely to relevant than control questions .
The plausibility of both of these assumptions can be easily challenged .
A major limitation of the CQT is that , as was the case for the RIT , the comparison questions do not offer an adequate psychological control for the emotional impact of being asked the accusatory relevant question .
Most innocent people are savvy enough to understand that whether they pass or fail the test will depend on how they respond to the relevant questions rather than to the trivial issues covered by the control questions .
That is , the relevant questions are the most important questions on the test for both innocent and guilty people .
One reason why we might be tempted to believe that lie detection works stems from the common knowledge that lying is often associated with anxiety and accompanied by physiological arousal .
However , we are likely to respond similarly when confronted with a false accusation , even when truthfully denied .
It is for this reason that the CQT , like the RIT , is also biased against innocent individuals .
{ 78 } The notion that guilty suspects will necessarily respond more strongly to relevant than control questions is unlikely for several reasons .
The work of Honts and colleagues ( Honts , Raskin , & Kircher , 1994 ) indicates that the guilty can beat a CQT by augmenting artificially their responses to control questions .
This can be accomplished using simple countermeasures such as curling the toes , lightly biting the tongue , or performing mental arithmetic when control questions are asked .
Because information regarding how to use these types of countermeasures is readily available in bookstores , libraries and through the worldwide web , examiners are unlikely to know when a subject possesses countermeasure knowledge .
Moreover , because the use of these procedures is invisible to the examiner , it is not possible to determine when they are employed ( Honts et al. , 1994 ) .
The work of Honts et al . shows that with less than 30 minutes of instruction , during which subjects are taught to recognize control questions and are told to use these countermeasures in response to them , 50 % or more of guilty individuals subsequently defeat the CQT .
Although polygraph proponents assert that typical polygraph subjects may not be able to figure out how to use countermeasures on their own , this hypothesis has not been adequately evaluated .
There are studies that have addressed this issue by having introductory psychology course students , guilty by virtue of carrying out a mock crime , try to defeat the CQT , but these studies have done little to adequately motivate subjects to succeed .
For instance , in one experiment where subjects were specifically taught countermeasures ( Honts , Hodes , & Raskin , 1985 ) , although students were offered double course credit if they could beat the CQT , over 20 % of the subjects admitted not trying countermeasures , and it is not known how many others failed to comply with the study protocol .
A possible advantage of the typical CQT is that when questions are introduced to subjects , no distinction is made between control and relevant questions .
Hence , some unsophisticated individuals may not readily understand how important it is to respond more strongly to control questions if they expect to pass the test , or that passing the test would be assured if they artificially augmented their responses to control questions .
A similar advantage is not conferred by a variant of the CQT that is gaining more widespread use : the directed lie test ( DLT ) .
With the DLT , the control questions are replaced with directed lie questions that the subject is told are designed to elicit a response to { 79 } a known lie .
Examples of directed lies include " Have you ever told even one lie ? " and " Have you ever made even one mistake ? "
Subjects are told to think of specific incidents of lies or mistakes when answering these questions " no " to deliberately provoke a reaction to a lie .
Given the transparent purpose of directed lies , even psychologically naïve guilty subjects are likely to comprehend the value of an augmented response to directed lie control questions , making this CQT variant especially vulnerable to countermeasures .
Another factor undermining the CQT 's validity with guilty suspects concerns habituation to the charges covered by the relevant question .
Often subjects are given lie detector tests long after a crime was committed and only after repeatedly denying the accusations covered by relevant questions .
With repeated presentation to emotionally charged material , autonomic responses habituate over time .
Hence , the issues raised by relevant questions on a CQT are likely to lose their potency over time , eventually eliciting weak autonomic nervous system reactions .
Control questions , by contrast , represent novel issues that are unlikely to have come up prior to the polygraph test , and therefore can be expected to elicit relatively strong responses in some individuals .
These factors are also likely to lessen the likelihood that guilty individuals will respond more strongly to relevant than control questions .
CQT ERROR RATE
Unfortunately , it is not possible to use the existing polygraphy literature to accurately estimate the validity of the CQT .
This state of affairs persists for a variety of reasons ( Iacono & Lykken , 1997a ) , the most important of which is that it is very difficult to conduct research on polygraph test validity that provides an accurate estimate of how well the CQT works in real life .
Laboratory Studies .
Two types of validity study are possible .
One relies on laboratory investigations where volunteer subjects , often undergraduate students seeking course credit , are asked to simulate a crime .
These mock crime studies are too unlike real life to offer any realistic insight to how polygraph tests work in the field .
For instance , the consequences of failing a test are trivial ; the privacy - invading control questions are apt to be more disturbing to innocent subjects than relevant questions that carry little psychological significance ; and { 80} guilty individuals are tested immediately after the simulated crime , minimizing the likelihood of habituation to the issues raised in relevant questions .
In addition , because the stakes are so low , it matters little if a guilty person fails a laboratory - based CQT , so there is no natural incentive to develop or learn about countermeasure strategies .
Field Studies .
Field studies of real - life cases provide the best opportunity for estimating CQT error rates .
However , studies based on such cases are severely limited by methodological problems that are generally ignored by CQT proponents .
The main advantage of laboratory studies , that one can be certain of ground truth ( who is guilty and who is innocent ) , is the major disadvantage of field studies .
Typically ground truth is established by using confessions to identify the guilty and exculpate co-suspects in the same case .
Once ground truth is established , the polygraph charts of these individuals can be blindly scored and hit rates for verified guilty and innocent individuals can be determined .
About a dozen field studies have been carried out using confessions to determine ground truth ( for critiques of these studies , see Iacono & Lykken , 1997a ; Iacono & Lykken , 1999 ; Iacono & Patrick , 1987 ) .
These studies vary widely in their methodological sophistication and in reported hit rates , which range from about 50 % accuracy for innocent people to nearly 100 % for guilty suspects .
However , as explained below , these confession - based investigations have one serious flaw in common : the ground truth criterion is not independent of the outcome of the polygraph test .
A major goal of polygraph testing is to solve crimes by extracting occasional confessions from those who fail the tests .
Indeed , it is this benefit of polygraph tests that justifies their use in the absence of compelling validity data .
Law enforcement agencies tend to administer polygraph tests only in certain cases ( Iacono , 1991 ; Patrick & Iacono , 1991 ) .
For most of these cases , investigative efforts have failed to yield compelling incriminating evidence , and it is likely the case will go unsolved unless a suspect confesses .
It is at this point in an investigation that suspects are likely to be asked to take a polygraph test .
In a case with multiple suspects , only one of whom could be guilty , suspects are tested until one fails .
This individual is then presented with the results of the test , and subsequently interrogated in an effort to extract a confession .
Even if no confession is obtained , the case will be considered resolved , with the individual who failed the test identified as the suspect most likely to be guilty .
If there are other { 81} suspects in the same case who have not yet been polygraphed , it is unlikely that they will be tested because : ( a ) polygraph examiners believe the CQT to be highly accurate , so they are comfortable with the conclusion that the individual with the " deception indicated " polygraph verdict is in fact guilty ; and ( b ) polygraph testing involves an expenditure of a limited resource that could best be applied to other cases which , unlike the one in question , are still in need of resolution .
It is against this backdrop that scientists doing field research on polygraph accuracy must select cases , relying only on those that elicited a confession from one of the suspects .
Once such cases have been selected , the standard procedure is to have the polygraph charts blindly rescored by an examiner with no knowledge of the case facts , and to compare the verdicts from these rescored charts to confession verified ground truth in the particular case .
Because polygraph test scoring is highly reliable ( e.g. , when 267 blindly rescored polygraph charts were compared to the scores of original police examiners , the interscorer reliability was .93 ; Patrick & Iacono , 1991 ) , the blindly rescored charts will almost always match the scoring of the original examiners .
There are a number of reasons why this field study research methodology will overestimate polygraph test accuracy .
Selecting cases because they generated a confession systematically eliminates from study all cases where the original examiner made an error .
If an innocent person failed a polygraph test , this error would go undetected because there would be no confession .
Absent this ground truth criterion , the case would not be included in the field validity study .
If a guilty person passed the test , again there would be no confession , and the case would not be selected for study .
In fact the only cases selected for study would be those where the original examiner was both correct and obtained a verifying confession .
For these selected , unrepresentative cases , the original examiner must be correct 100 % of the time .
Because chart scoring is so reliable , the blind rescoring of the charts is likely to match the original examiner 's scoring , and is thus likely to match ground truth .
Hence , the validity estimate derived from the degree to which the blindly rescored charts match ground truth will yield a greatly inflated , misleading estimate of polygraph test accuracy .
A scientifically sound field validity study must remove the confound that exists when cases are selected only when a confession followed a test scored deceptive .
To date , there has been only one { 82} study that has attempted to circumvent this methodological problem ( Patrick & Iacono , 1991 ) .
In this study , which was carried out with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , cases were selected because no confession was obtained following the administration of polygraph tests .
The researchers examined evidence subsequently collected , as police investigations of the cases continued , to identify those cases that ultimately ended with a confession .
These confessions , which were not dependent on polygraph test outcome , were used to establish ground truth and were compared to the results of blindly rescored polygraph tests administered in the case .
Two interesting results emerged .
First , the accuracy of the CQT with confession verified innocent suspects was only 57 % .
Second , it was not possible to estimate accuracy for guilty subjects because once a suspect failed a polygraph test , even with no confession , the police generally stopped investigating the case , so no new evidence was developed to establish ground truth .
The cases that the police continued to investigate after suspects were polygraphed were generally those that ended without strong polygraphic indications of guilt , and some of these cases turned up suspects who confessed but who did not take a polygraph test .
Hence , their confessions verified that those who took the polygraph test were innocent , and it was the inclusion of cases like these that made it possible to estimate polygraph test accuracy for innocent individuals .
Friendly Tests .
Defense attorneys representing defendants who have passed a CQT often ask the court to admit the test results .
These types of tests have been characterized as " friendly " because the outcome of the test is protected by attorney - client privilege : results are released only if a truthful verdict is obtained .
Under the circumstances , defendants have little to lose by taking the test , and the fear of being identified as guilty that exists when the police administer an adversarial CQT is absent with a friendly test .
Unfortunately , field studies of the CQT are based on the outcomes of adversarial tests .
There are no investigations regarding the validity of friendly tests .
Given that the fear of detection likely to exist with friendly tests must be substantially lower than that for adversarial tests , it is likely that the false negative error rate associated with friendly tests is higher than that for adversarial tests .
{ 83} GENERAL ACCEPTANCE
IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY
Because the existing literature on the CQT cannot be used to provide a satisfactory accuracy estimate and experts are sharply divided on this issue , the opinions of unbiased scientists capable of evaluating the soundness of the CQT and the claims of polygraph proponents are of considerable interest .
To obtain this information , David Lykken and I ( lacono & Lykken , 1997b ) carried out two surveys of the members of two different scientific organizations varying in the type of expertise and perspective they bring to the evaluation of polygraphy .
The first survey was of members of the Society for Psychophysiological Research ( SPR ; 91 % response rate ) and the second was of Fellows of the American Psychological Association 's Division of General Psychology ( APA - DGP ; 74 % response rate ) .
Two earlier surveys , neither of which was published in a scientific journal , were carried out with SPR members .
Responses to a single question , repeated across both surveys , have been used to argue that scientists have a favorable view of forensic polygraphy because about 61 % of respondents to both surveys agreed that " polygraph test interpretation " constituted " a useful diagnostic tool when considered with other available information . "
We found it difficult to interpret this survey result because the question dealt neither with the CQT nor its use in court .
In addition , the question does not specifically address validity , and no questions were asked regarding either the soundness of the psychological foundation of the CQT or the claims of high accuracy made by the pro-polygraph community .
To remedy these deficiencies , we made clear to respondents that we were querying them about the CQT and included a description of the test and its theoretical basis from one of the CQT 's leading proponents ( Raskin , 1986 ) .
We also asked a variety of questions relevant to the scientific controversies surrounding the CQT .
The results of our survey indicated that the members of both scientific organizations had very similar opinions about the CQT .
Only about a third of those surveyed believed the CQT was scientifically sound , and only about a quarter thought polygraph evidence should be admissible in court .
Few opined that the CQT was a standardized test ( 20 % ) or objective ( 10 % ) .
The great majority held that the CQT could be defeated by countermeasures that were easily learned and they { 84} expressed substantial skepticism in the validity of friendly CQTs and in the accuracy claims of polygraph proponents .
When members of both organizations were divided into subgroups according to their level of self - professed expertise on CQT validity , there was little difference in their opinions as a function of how informed they were on the topic , with the vast majority of both more and less informed respondents from both organizations possessing a strongly negative view of the CQT .
CONCLUSION
Although the CQT may be useful as an investigative aid and tool to induce confessions , it does not pass muster as a scientifically credible test .
CQT theory is based on naive , implausible assumptions indicating ( a ) that it is biased against innocent individuals and ( b ) that it can be beaten simply by artificially augmenting responses to control questions .
Although it is not possible to adequately assess the error rate of the CQT , both of these conclusions are supported by published research findings in the best social science journals ( Honts et al. , 1994 ; Horvath , 1977 ; Kleinmuntz & Szucko , 1984 ; Patrick & Iacono , 1991 ) .
Although defense attorneys often attempt to have the results of friendly CQTs admitted as evidence in court , there is no evidence supporting their validity and ample reason to doubt it .
Members of scientific organizations who have the requisite background to evaluate the CQT are overwhelmingly skeptical of the claims made by polygraph proponents .

But in every case , the resources in question are much too expensive or polluting , or , in the case of “ clean coal , ” too imaginary to make a difference in protecting either our national security or the global climate .
Indeed , those who spend hundreds of millions promoting “ clean coal ” technology consistently omit the fact that there is little investment and not a single large - scale demonstration project in the United States for capturing and safely burying all of this pollution .
If the coal industry can make good on this promise , then I ’m all for it .
But until that day comes , we simply cannot any longer base the strategy for human survival on a cynical and self - interested illusion .

Here ’s what we can do  now : we can make an immediate and large strategic investment to put people to work replacing 19th - century energy technologies that depend on dangerous and expensive carbon - based fuels with 21st - century technologies that use fuel that is free forever : the sun , the wind and the natural heat of the earth .
What follows is a five - part plan to repower America with a commitment to producing 100 percent of our electricity from carbon - free sources within 10 years .
It is a plan that would simultaneously move us toward solutions to the climate crisis and the economic crisis  and create millions of new jobs that cannot be outsourced .
First , the new president and the new Congress should offer large - scale investment in incentives for the construction of concentrated solar thermal plants in the Southwestern deserts , wind farms in the corridor stretching from Texas to the Dakotas and advanced plants in geothermal hot spots that could produce large amounts of electricity .
Second , we should begin the planning and construction of a unified national smart grid for the transport of renewable electricity from the rural places where it is mostly generated to the cities where it is mostly used .
New high - voltage , low - loss underground lines can be designed with “ smart ” features that provide consumers with sophisticated information and easy - to - use tools for conserving electricity , eliminating inefficiency and reducing their energy bills .
The cost of this modern grid  $ 400 billion over 10 years  pales in comparison with the annual loss to American business of $ 120 billion due to the cascading failures that are endemic to our current balkanized and antiquated electricity lines .
Third , we should help America ’s automobile industry ( not only the Big Three but the innovative new startup companies as well ) to convert quickly to plug - in hybrids that can run on the renewable electricity that will be available as the rest of this plan matures .
In combination with the unified grid , a nationwide fleet of plug - in hybrids would also help to solve the problem of electricity storage .
Think about it : with this sort of grid , cars could be charged during off - peak energy - use hours ; during peak hours , when fewer cars are on the road , they could contribute their electricity back into the national grid .
Oldest bug ever
I 've had my share of old bugs , but # 234448 holds the distinct record of being the oldest bug that I ever found a fix for .
It 's so old , I do n't even know how old exactly .
Do n't be betrayed by the number 234448 .
While the Debian bug was filed in 2004 , the bug itself is older than that .
Take a look at this FreeBSD commit , for example ; the original import of the 4.4BSDLite code of the ' trek ' program already has the bug .
And that was over 14 years ago .
The first NetBSD commit is even older : 15 years , 7 months ago .
BSD itself , of course , is much older than that , and so is trek .
The copyright header contains ' Copyright ( c ) 1980 , 1993 ' , which suggests that this bug might be as much as 28 years old .
That 's almost as old as I am ...
Like I said , a record .

Linux Tape Backup With mt And tar Command Howto
Magnetic tape is a non-volatile storage medium consisting of a magnetic coating on a thin plastic strip .
Nearly all recording tape is of this type , whether used for video , audio storage or general purpose digital data storage using a computer .
How do I make backup using tapes under Linux operating systems ?
ADVERTISEMENTS
Linux ( and other Unixish system ) use mt command to control magnetic tape drive operation .
You need to use mt command while working with tape drive .
It allows you to reading and writing to tape .
The default tape drive under Linux is / dev/st0 ( first SCSI tape device name ) .
You can read more about tape drives naming convention used under Linux here .
Following paragraph summaries command you need to use control tape drive for backup / restore purpose .
Rewind tape drive : # mt -f / dev/st0 rewind Backup directory / www and / home with tar command ( z – compressed ) : # tar - czf / dev/st0 /www / home
Find out what block you are at with mt command : # mt -f / dev/st0 tell Display list of files on tape drive : # tar - tzf / dev/st0 Restore / www directory : # cd /
# mt -f / dev/st0 rewind
# tar - xzf / dev/st0 www Unload the tape : # mt -f / dev/st0 offline Display status information about the tape unit : # mt -f / dev/st0 status Erase the tape : # mt -f / dev/st0 erase
You can go BACKWARD or FORWARD on tape with mt command itself :
(a) Go to end of data : # mt -f / dev/nst0 eod ( b ) Goto previous record : # mt -f /dev/nst0 bsfm 1 ( c ) Forward record : # mt -f / dev/nst0 fsf 1 Replace / dev/st0 with your actual tape drive name .
Linux Tape Backup Example
To backup to multiple tape use the following command ( backup / home file system ) :
# tar - clpMzvf / dev/st0 /home
To compare tape backup , enter :
# tar - dlpMzvf / dev/st0 /home
To restore tape in case of data loss or hard disk failure :
# tar - xlpMzvf / dev/st0 /home

The European Union has finally opened its digital online library , Europeana , to the public , allowing users everywhere free access to the rich archives of EU 's 27 member states .
The library includes more than 2 million books , maps , recordings , photographs , archival documents , paintings , and films from national libraries and cultural institutions , all of which have been digitally encoded and uploaded to Europeana .
And that 's just the beginning ; the EU plans to continue adding content over the next several years .
" Europeana offers a journey through time , across borders , and into new ideas of what our culture is .
More than that , it will connect people to their history and , through interactive pages and tools , to each other , " EU Commissioner for Information Society and Media Viviane Reding said in a statement .
" I now call on Europe 's cultural institutions , publishing houses and technology companies to fill Europeana with further content in digital form .
We should make Europeana a home for interactive creative participation at the fingertips of people who want to mould their own piece of European culture and share it with others . "
Needless to say , Europeana has gotten quite the reception upon its launch .
The site was initially overwhelmed by more than 10 million hits per hour , which temporarily took down the server .
( As of publication time , the server still appears to be moving quite slowly . )
" It shows the huge interest of European users in this project , " a spokesperson told Reuters .
Right now , Europeana mainly offers content that is public domain , which should allow it to avoid the same type of copyright issues that Google faced when trying to let users browse works online .
At the same time , however , the European Commission said that it's in talks with rights holders to work out a way to add copyrighted materials to the online archive .
The EU 's objective is to have more than 10 million works available through Europeana by 2010 , and it hopes to achieve that growth by funding Europeana to the tune of € 2 million per year between 2009 and 2011 .
Now , get to browsing !
We hear that the Louvre has some lovely offerings online , for those of you who can't quite make it to Paris this time of year .
Today , expect more reviews on the new Intel Core i7 processors according to CNet.com .
Core i7 processors expected to launch later this month include 2.66GHz ( Core i7-920 ) and 3.20 GHz ( Core i7 -965 ) versions .
Prices will range roughly between $ 285 and just under $ 1,000 .
The Nehalem / Core i7 architecture will scale from two to eight processor cores , have faster chip - to - chip communication ( Intel calls this technology QuickPath ) , do a better job of adjusting performance levels to suit power needs , and have a higher level of integration ( more logic will be built directly onto the processor die ) .
Other salient features include more scalable memory ( each processor will have its own dedicated memory ) , the ability to do more stuff simultaneously ( up to 16 threads with simultaneous multi- threading ) , and new instructions to increase efficiency ( called SSE4.2 instructions ) .
And who ’s going to buy i7 systems initially ?
Here ’s what CNET Reviews editor Rich Brown says : “ We do n’t expect mainstream users will adopt Core i7 … at first , at least until the motherboard prices come down . ”
Brown continues : “ In the short term , it will benefit gamers and digital media types .
The initial systems will be gaming oriented . ”

It seems like such a simple question .
Which is the best Batmobile ?
To which you would reply , ' Well how many can there be ? '
Five , ten , maybe twenty , tops .
Try two hundred .
Clearly the question needs some boundary conditions .
This article is about the best filmed version of the Batmobile .
Discount all the comics and all the cartoons ( though I do find the one from the Animated Series quite fetching ) there 's simply not enough time , patience or space to deliberate the merits of every single Batmobile .
Can you like animation more than the real life ?
With only the celluloid incarnations to choose from , the field is narrowed substantially .
We begin with a Ford concept car .
The original 1966 TV incarnation of Batman , starring Adam West as the eponymous hero , chose as his wheels a modified Lincoln Futura , a failed concept designed by Ford and manufactured by Ghia in Italy , entirely by hand .
As you would expect from a car designed in the mid-50s sporting a horrifically conspicuous black and red colour scheme , this is a Batmobile that even Burt Ward could drive .
In fact , viewed front - on , it bears an uncanny resemblance to the late Dame Barbara Cartland .
Styling issues aside , the most famous features of the car other than the household phone incorporated into the dashboard were the deployable parachutes enabling speedy 180s , or ' bat - turns ' , or ' bat - complete loss of rear axle turns ' .
Ignoring the definite possibility of catastrophic structural failure due to this ridiculous braking system , the car suffered a number of meltdowns during filming , including overheating and dead batteries .
It could also be outrun by a pram .
The original , but not the best .
Better to execute a bat - turn in the Batmobile featured in Tim Burton 's 1989 film .
Setting a tone recently rekindled by Christopher Nolan 's Tumbler version of the car , Burton went for a mixture of practicality and style .
This Batmobile executed a turn by having a built - in jack capable of lifting the car and turning it 180 degrees .
Okay , so you had to stop to do it , but you still had your rear bat - bumper at the end of it .
Other innovations included the incorporation of the entire design around the idea that a jet engine would require a jet intake at the front of the car , hence the iconic snub - nosed design .
Though even Burton could not resist dipping into the realms of fantasy , with the cars ability to cover itself completely with what is described by one uber - geek as ' ceramic fractal armor ' panels .
You could almost believe it , until Michael Keaton whispers the word ' shields ' into his bat - remote and the whole car wraps itself in an impregnable cocoon of body armour .
When you first got central locking , did you say shields and unlock the car ?
I did .
Cool at the time , but the stop - motion effects have not held up too well .
Still , this is the only Batmobile capable of dropping high yield explosives out of the centre of its wheel caps , and for that it should get bonus points .
Points also for being one of only two Batmobiles ( the other being the Tumbler ) to endure for more than a single film .
In Batman Returns , it sports the nifty feature of being able to jettison half its body weight and turn into the ' Batmissile ' , allowing it to squeeze between the narrow streets of Gotham .
Batman must have felt super - clever until he got back to his cave and realised a tramp was probably sleeping in his fender .
Now we enter the dark times of Batmobile design , referred to by fans as the Schumacher period .
Not Michael , but Joel .
Beginning with Batman Forever , and ending one film later with Batman & Robin , Schumacher turned the Batmobile into what can only be described as a gay bar on wheels .
Do n't believe me ?
Take a look at the Batman Forever iteration of the car and then , if you can bear it , move on to the version featured in what is by unanimous agreement the worst Batman film and , let 's not leave the bush unbeaten , one of the worst films ever made .
Batman and Robin - watch the trailer at your peril .
There is something truly hideous about these cars .
The Batman Forever version looks like a gothic sandal filled with bath gel , and the single fin down the centre of the car gives one the impression of a mohawk .
The Batman & Robin car is even worse , a hideous combination of chrome and ghoulishly oversized fins .
H.R. Giger , designer for the film Alien , drew up plans of a concept car that , due to time constraints , could not be used .
Says it all really .
The only redeeming feature of either of these cars was the Batmobile 's ability to raise itself off the ground , shoot out a grappling hook and drive up the side of a skyscraper during Batman Forever .
Which is excellent until you consider the possibility of there being a balcony in the way .
Better to go the Batman Begins route , which is to start on the roofs and keep driving through things instead of on or around them .
This Batmobile also features in The Dark Knight , and is unique among filmed versions of the car in that , a few effects shots aside , it can do most of what is seen on screen .
By that , I mean high speed pursuits in a vehicle that weighs two tonnes and manoeuvres like a tank which is still capable of 0 - 60 in under six seconds .
It is also the only Batmobile never to be referred to as the ' Batmobile ' , going by the moniker of the Tumbler .
It retains the remote controlled capabilities of the original Burton movie , but apart from that it relies mostly on speed and a couple of rocket launchers on the front to do the brunt of the work .
It does , however , have one cool trick .
When fatally damaged in The Dark Knight by a rocket blast from the Joker , the Tumblee turns into the Batpod , a machine - gun sporting motorbike which Batman uses for the rest of the film .
The Batpod .
Unserious
Bat thing for a very serious Batfilm .
All well and good , but which is the best ?
Ruling out the TV series car on the grounds of taste and the Schumacher cars on the grounds of decency , it 's almost a dead heat between Burton 's 1989 Batmobile and Nolan 's 2008 Batmobile .
Separated by nearly two decades , they both hold true to the notion of Batman 's car being an exceptional piece of mechanical engineering as opposed to a magical one .
In the final analysis , the Tumbler wins out , because it can jump and go where the Burton Batmobile cannot .
And when your contemporaries can swings from rooftops and fly into space , you better be sure you can jump high .
And the winner ?
The Tumbler !

( CNN ) --
On the eve of the U.S. presidential election , CNN.com International speaks to two families from opposite sides of the political divide about their hopes , expectations , concerns and fears for the election and the next four years .
The Armstrong family believes Barack Obama will restore the tarnished reputation of the country abroad .
The Armstrongs
Andrea and Richard Armstrong live in Charlottesville , Virginia with their two children , Emma , 12 , and Teddy , 10 .
The couple both work as attorneys and the whole family are enthused at the prospect of an Obama presidency .
" For me the race issue is very important , " says Andrea .
" He is so representative of the moment .
Here is this man who is black , he grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii .
He is what we need as the face of our nation . "
" I go to school with a lot of friends who are African - American and just for them to see that Obama can be president is good because it shows them anyone can be president , " says Teddy .
With Americans facing economic uncertainty , Richard believes Obama has the leadership abilities to steer the country to better times .
" He seems like he's got the persona , the intellect and the stature to make it through what is going to be a very dark period , " he says .
Can Obama close the deal ? »
Although Charlottesville is a prosperous college town , the couple say the effects of the economic crisis are being felt locally .
" A friend just lost his job .
People we know who have businesses are really frightened .
Everything is so stagnant .
There 's a lot of things shutting down , " says Andrea .
The couple admit they 're " embarrassed " by the damage that U.S. foreign policy under President George W. Bush -- particularly the invasion of Iraq -- has done to the reputation of their country .
" Bush has been an embarrassment from the first day and it's only gotten worse , " says Andrea .
" When did we become such a laughing stock ?
When did we lose our stature ?
It 's very important how we go forward and represent ourselves in the world .
What a bad reputation we now have . "
The couple would also like to see a universal national healthcare scheme rolled out , with Richard calling the fact that so many Americans lack health insurance " an outrage in a civilized society . "
" I am shocked by how many people I know who do n't have healthcare , " says Andrea .
" You can't be without healthcare cover in this country .
First of all , because you wo n't get the care you need and second because you 'll just bankrupt yourself . "
Living in a predominantly Democratic neighborhood , the family have been regular volunteers at the local Obama campaign headquarters , making phone calls , recruiting new voters , canvassing and packaging up leaflets .
" It 's meant a lot to us as a family , " says Andrea .

" Everybody in there is really different but we are all working towards the same thing .
They always seem really happy to see you , " says Emma .
" They do n't treat you like little kids -- they give you important jobs to do , " says Teddy .
Andrea has seen a shift among swing voters towards the Democrats during the campaign .
Richard says his father , a moderate Republican who usually votes on national security issues , is even voting for Obama because he dislikes Sarah Palin .
" Right after they picked her and John McCain got that bump ( in the polls ) we just looked at it with dread , " says Richard .
" But the more people got to know her the more she 's detracted from McCain . "
" How could you take anybody seriously who winks in a debate ?
Somehow she is on the national stage making faces , " says Andrea .
" They thought women would vote for her just because she is a woman .
That 's not giving the women of America much credit . "
Emma says her classmates at school are mainly Democratic .
" We talk about politics a lot .
My school has about 70 people and out of those people there are about 10 Republicans .
I assume they feel really alienated . "
As a lifelong Democrat , Andrea says it is exciting to see the party " get its wheels turning properly " after the election defeats of 2000 and 2004 .
But the couple are taking nothing for granted and admit they are " scared to death " by the thought that Obama might not win .
" Everybody who remembers 2000 knows that bad things can happen , " says Richard .
" It 's just a case of let 's get this one in the bag and get it over with . "
The Pearsons
Jennifer and Sonny Pearson live in Fredericksburg , Virginia , with their two youngest children , Matthew , 17 , and Mary , 15 .
Jennifer is a self - employed tax accountant .
Sonny , a Navy veteran , is studying IT , having previously worked in cable installation .
As an accountant , Jennifer is already seeing the impact of the economic crisis in their blue collar neighborhood .
She fears her business will be hit as clients choose to save money by doing their own tax returns .
Local house prices have fallen by 50 percent and several properties are up for auction .
" It 's the average guys who are affected , not the ones who can go and get a Harvard education , " she says .
" It 's the guys who can swing a hammer or lay a wire and now they 're losing their businesses and their homes .
It 's terrible . "
The couple fear a Barack Obama presidency will mean steep tax rises for the average family .
They believe tax cuts , and government belt - tightening , are needed to kick start the economy .
Watch Sarah Palin on Obama 's tax plans »
" The less you 've got government involved in how people run their lives the better , " says Sonny .
" I would be willing to put good money on the fact that if Obama gets elected within six months we are going to be in a very deep depression . "
National security is another priority .
" It 's a huge issue , " says Sonny .
" Bad guys are real , evil exists and they are looking for opportunities . "
They have supported the war effort in Iraq and believe U.S. troops should stay as long as it takes to get the job done -- something they believe John McCain has the leadership skills to achieve -- and fear fresh terrorist attacks on U.S. soil if Obama is elected .
One of the couple 's older children was in high school a mile from the Pentagon on 9/11 so the " War on Terror " is an issue close to home they say .
" McCain wants to win in Iraq and get us out of there honorably , " says Jennifer .
" The American people just need to suck it up and recognize that we 've lost fewer men there in a year than we lost in Vietnam in a day ...
We 've got men and women going into very dangerous places to get rid of these terrorists and they 're doing it . "
Although concerned by the damage done to the United States ' reputation , they believe national security is more important than popularity .
" Everybody likes to be liked but at the same time I do n't care if somebody does n't like me if it 's going to adversely effect my life and the lives of those people around me , " says Sonny .
" I think we will get back some respect with McCain .
With Obama we are just going to be destroyed , " adds Jennifer .
Despite being a cancer survivor , Jennifer and her children have no health insurance .
As a Navy veteran , Sonny 's medical bills have been covered by a veterans ' scheme since he required brain surgery for a double aneurysm .
" I do n't want socialised medicine because I know too many people who 've come here from Canada to get fixed because they can't get the service , " says Jennifer .
" I had insurance when I had cancer and I cannot tell you how many thousands of dollars we spent . "
As a working mother , Jennifer respects Sarah Palin and has no qualms about her qualifications to be vice - president .
" First of all , she raised five kids and that 's hard , " she says .
" She 's got better credentials than Obama .
It makes no sense to me that people are down on her for being a woman . "
The family are suspicious of Obama , believing he has promised far more than he can deliver .
" You can't promise magic if you do n't have a wand , " says Sonny .
" And he 's got nothing to work with unless he levies some heavy taxes on everyone . "
" It would be better for Obama to be an actor than a president because he just wants the fame , " adds Mary .
At school , Matthew admits it 's tough being a Republican .
" People make a lot of jokes about the Republican Party and so everyone just ends up being liberal , " he says .
" I 've been getting into arguments with entire classes . "
All About Barack Obama • John McCain • George W. Bush • Sarah Palin
There were further nods and grunts of assent when Mr Wilson rolled out a litany of dire predictions for life under a Democrat administration .
" If Obama pulls all our troops out from Iraq , those terrorists are all going to head over here pretty quickly , " he said .
" And another thing I hear is that a lot more of our tax money will be going to Africa if he gets in .
His father 's from there , you know . "
WHEN it was revealed in 2003 that William J. Bennett , author of “ The Book of Virtues , ” had a secret gambling habit , more than one commentator termed it a delicious irony , and it was indeed a pleasure to see a sanctimonious scold get his comeuppance .
But it was n’t irony , just hypocrisy .
It was ironic when , on “ The Daily Show , ” Jon Stewart commended Bennett for his indignation , and for “ standing up to the William Bennetts of the world . ”
Here ’s another example of irony : the 1959 episode of “ The Twilight Zone ” titled “ Time Enough at Last , ” in which Burgess Meredith plays Henry Bemis , a bookish bank teller with thick glasses and an insatiable appetite for reading .
One day , knocked unconscious by a giant explosion , he awakens to find that he ’s the last man on Earth .
Wandering the desolate city , overwhelmed with loneliness , he is about to kill himself when he notices the ruins of ... a library !
Cut to : stacks of books piled high on the library ’s steps and Henry , giddy with joy .
But as he settles down on the curb with the first book , his glasses fall off and shatter on the ground , trapping him forever in a blurry world .

Now that ’s irony .
Irony is one of the most misused words in the English language .
Much of the confusion comes from the existence of several distinct forms of irony .
Verbal irony is the act of saying one thing but meaning the opposite with the intent of being understood as meaning the opposite , as in , “ Nice weather we ’re having ” on a rainy day .
Cosmic irony involves quirks of fate , as when a UPS driver on his way to deliver parts to a hospital has a serious accident , is taken to the same hospital by ambulance , but the hospital ca n’t perform necessary tests because one of its machines is down and the parts to fix it are in the driver ’s wrecked van .
SOCRATIC irony is a strategy for refuting dogma .
In the Platonic dialogues , Socrates assumes the role of the eiron , a sly dissembler who feigns naivete by asking seemingly foolish questions that gradually hang his opponents by their own admissions .
A modern practitioner is Sacha Baron Cohen , whose characters Borat and Ali G expose pomposity by pretending to be stupid .

Irony is about the interplay of opposites , not the random proximity of events .
It ’s ironic that Beethoven was deaf , but merely coincidental that Brad Pitt tore his Achilles tendon while playing Achilles in Troy .
People miss the distinction and say “ ironic ” when they mean “ coincidental , ” an abuse encouraged by Alanis Morissette ’s 1996 hit single , “ Ironic , ” in which situations purporting to be ironic are merely annoying ( “ a traffic jam when you ’re already late , a no- smoking sign on your cigarette break ” ) .
It is ironic that “ Ironic ” is an un-ironic song about irony .
Is that perfectly clear ?
In case you ’re confused , here are some more examples of irony :
* Brewing heir Adolph Coors III was allergic to beer .

* County supervisors in Pima County , Ariz. , held a closed meeting to discuss Arizona ’s open meeting law .
* U.S. Border Patrol uniforms are manufactured in Mexico .
* When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 , so many visitors were taking souvenir pieces that a protective fence was installed , so that , yes , the Berlin Wall was guarded by a wall .
* Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe ’s 2005 state of the nation address , in which he promised to remedy his country ’s chronic electricity shortages , was blacked out by a power failure .
Advertisement
* A 17 - year - old Amish boy was electrocuted by a downed power line that became tangled in the wheels of his horse - drawn buggy .

A column , like a good movie , should have an arc -- start here , end there and somehow connect the two .
So this column will begin with the speech Condi Rice made to the Republican National Convention in 2000 in praise of George W. Bush and end with Colin Powell 's appearance Sunday on " Meet the Press " in praise of Barack Obama .
Between the first and the second lie the ruins of the GOP , a party gone very , very wrong .
It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Bush and now John McCain have constructed a mean , grumpy , exclusive , narrow - minded and altogether retrograde Republican Party .
It has the sharp scent of the old Barry Goldwater GOP -- the angry one of 1964 and not the one perfumed by nostalgia -- that is home , by design or mere dumb luck , to those who think that Obama is " The Madrassian Candidate . "
Karl Rove , take a bow .
It is worth remembering that both Rice and Powell spoke to that Philadelphia convention .
And it is worth recalling , too , that Bush ran as a " compassionate conservative " and had compiled a record as Texas governor to warrant the hope , if not the belief , that he was indeed a different sort of Republican .
When he ran for re-election as governor in 1998 , he went from 15 percent of the black vote to 27 percent , and from 28 percent of the Hispanic vote to an astounding 49 percent .
Here was a coalition - builder of considerable achievement .
Now , all this is rubble .
It is not merely that Barack Obama was always going to garner the vast majority of the black vote .
It is also that the GOP , under Rove and his disciples in the McCain campaign , has not only driven out ethnic and racial minorities but a vast bloc of voters who , quite bluntly , want nothing to do with Sarah Palin .
For moderates everywhere , she remains the single best reason to vote against McCain .
But the GOP 's tropism toward its furiously angry base , its tolerance and currying of anti-immigrant sentiment , its flattering of the ignorant on matters of undisputed scientific consensus -- evolution , for instance -- and , from the mouth of Palin , its celebration of drab provincialism , have sharpened the division between red and blue .
Red is the color of yesterday .
Ah , I know , the blues are not all virtuous .
They are supine before self - serving unions , particularly in education , and they are knee - jerk opponents of offshore drilling , mostly , it seems , because they do n't like Big Oil .
They cannot face the challenge of the Third World within us -- the ghetto with its appalling social and cultural ills -- lest reality be called racism .
Sometimes , too , they seem to criticize American foreign policy simply because it is American .
Still , a Democrat can remain a Democrat -- or at least vote as one -- without compromising basic intellectual or cultural values .
That , though , is not what Colin Powell was saying Sunday about his own party .
" I have some concerns about the direction that the party has taken in recent years , " Powell said .
" It has moved more to the right than I would like . "
He cited McCain 's harping on that " washed - out terrorist " Bill Ayers as an effort to exploit fears that Obama is a Muslim ( so what if he were ?
Powell rightly asked ) and mentioned how Palin 's presence on the ticket raised grave questions about McCain 's judgment .
In effect -- and at least for the time being -- Powell was out of the GOP .
S'long , guys .
Those of us who traveled with Bush in the 2000 campaign could tell that when he spoke of education , of the " soft bigotry of low expectations , " he meant it .
Education , along with racial and ethnic reconciliation , was going to be his legacy .
Then came 9/11 , Afghanistan and finally the misbegotten war in Iraq .
After that , nothing else really mattered .
But just as Bush could not manage the wars , he could not manage his own party .
His legacy is not merely in tatters .
It does not , as he intended , even exist .
In the end , Powell was determined not to be one of the GOP 's useful idiots .
Those moderates willing to overlook the choice of Palin , those capable of staying in a party where , soon enough , she could be an important or dominant force , retain the intellectual nimbleness that enabled them to persist in championing a war fought for duplicitous reasons and extol cultural values they do not for a minute share .
Powell walked away from that , and others will follow -- the second time that a senator from Arizona has led the GOP into the political wilderness .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks slumped for a second straight session Thursday , bringing the Dow 's losses to 929 points since Election Day , as fears of a prolonged recession sent investors running for the exits .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) lost around 443 points , or 4.9 % .
The two - session decline of 929 points , or 9.7 % , marked the biggest two - session point loss ever and the biggest two - session percentage decline in 21 years , according to Dow Jones .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index lost 5 % and the Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) declined by 4.3 % .
The Dow slumped 486 points Wednesday as President - elect Barack Obama 's historic victory gave way to worries about the economy he inherits .
Those same worries continued to drag on stocks Thursday .
" Everything is so dismal right now , It 's just an endless flow of bad news and no one wants to buy , " said Dave Rovelli , managing director of U.S. equity trading at Canaccord Adams .
Rovelli said that the steady stream of bad economic reports and weak corporate earnings and forecasts was taking its toll .
In particular , the number of companies announcing layoffs was unnerving investors , especially ahead of Friday 's big monthly jobs report .
October retail sales from the nation 's chain stores were mostly abysmal , with some discounters such as Wal - Mart Stores escaping the fray .
The housing market collapse , credit crunch and strained labor market have all taken their toll on consumers ' wallets .
Even the recent retreat in oil and gas prices has not had much of a positive impact on consumer spending .
" People are realizing that the recession is going to drag on until at least the end of 2009 , " said Rovelli .
Bear market : Stocks , as represented by the S&P 500 , shot up 18 % in the seven trading sessions through Election Day , bouncing off a 35 % slump in the six weeks before .
Since Tuesday , the S&P 500 has lost at least 8 % of that .
The zigzagging reflects the volatility that has been present for months , but also an attempt at finding a bear market bottom .
After such a run , analysts say Wall Street was vulnerable to a pullback .
" I think we 're in a bottoming process , " said Mark Travis , president and CEO at Intrepid Capital Funds .
" But it 's not going to be a V - shaped bottom where it bounces and goes straight up . "
He said that stocks will likely continue to seesaw through year - end , unless some of the traditionally favorable seasonal patterns kick in .
Stocks are n't likely to move higher until at least the second quarter of next year , as investors start anticipating an economic recovery six or nine months out .
During last week 's rally , investors put money into equity mutual funds for the first time in 15 weeks , according to tracking firm Trim Tabs .
The amount of money invested by equity mutual funds in the week ended Nov. 5 totaled $ 2.2 billion versus the $ 9.2 billion withdrawn during the previous week .
Company news :
Among stock movers , automakers were hit especially hard on continued worries about their ability to stay afloat without government help .
General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , a Dow component , slumped 13.7 % .
Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) lost 5.3 % .
On Wednesday , GM's North American president said that the industry is facing a critical 100 - day period in which it needs to amp up its efforts to secure government support .
Cisco Systems ( CSCO , Fortune 500 ) said late Wednesday that it has stopped hiring and that revenue for the current quarter wo n't meet forecasts .
That overshadowed the company 's better - than - expected earnings report .
Shares fell 2.6 % Thursday .
Las Vegas Sands ( LVS ) continued to plummet on worries that it may default on certain debt obligations and that it can't raise enough capital .
The company operates the Venetian and Palazzo casinos and a pair of casinos in China .
Declines covered a variety of sectors , with all 30 Dow stocks falling , led by GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , Alcoa ( AA , Fortune 500 ) , American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , General Electric ( GE , Fortune 500 ) , Intel ( INTC , Fortune 500 ) and Boeing ( BA , Fortune 500 ) .
Market breadth was negative .
On the New York Stock Exchange , decliners topped advancers by more than four to one on volume of 1.53 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , losers beat winners by almost three to one on volume of 2.43 billion shares .
Retail sales :
With the exception of discount chain Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) , most retailers saw October sales in line with the bruised economy .
Thomson Reuters estimates the monthly sales could be the worst in eight years .
( Full story )
Gap ( GPS , Fortune 500 ) reported a 16 % drop in sales at stores open a year or more , a retail industry metric known as same - store sales .
Macy's ( M , Fortune 500 ) same - store sales fell 6.3 % and the company warned November sales would weaken .
AnnTaylor Stores ( ANN ) said same - store sales fell 19 % from a year ago .
The women 's clothing retailer also said it was expanding its restructuring program and warned that third - quarter results wo n't meet forecasts .
Shares fell 25.7 % .
Signs of the recession were evident in economic reports released earlier this week .
They included dour readings on manufacturing , factory orders and the services sector and the worst monthly auto sales in 25 years .
Jobs :
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment last week topped forecasts .
The weekly number followed a pair of monthly reports Wednesday that showed the labor market continued to get hammered in October .
The reports were especially worrisome ahead of Friday 's big government report .
That report is expected to show that employers cut 200,000 jobs from their payrolls in October .
Meanwhile , the unemployment rate , which is generated by a separate survey , is expected to rise to 6.3 % from 6.1 % the previous month .
Other markets :
In global trade , Asian markets tumbled on recession fears .
European markets also closed with big losses , after European and British central banks cut interest rates .
The dollar rallied against the euro and the pound after monetary policy makers in Europe cut interest rates in response to growing economic weakness .
However , the greenback edged lower versus the Japanese yen .
COMEX gold for December delivery fell $ 10.20 to settle at $ 732.20 an ounce .
U.S. light crude oil for December delivery fell to a 19 - month low , sinking $ 4.53 to settle at $ 60.77 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Gasoline prices fell another 2.5 cents to a national average of $ 2.34 a gallon , according to a survey of credit - card activity released Thursday by motorist group AAA .
The decline marks the 50th consecutive day that prices have decreased .
During that same time period , prices dropped by $ 1.51 a gallon , or 39.2 % .
Lending rates :
The credit market continued to improve .
The 3 - month Libor fell to 2.39 % from 2.51 % Wednesday , a nearly four - year low , according to Bloomberg.com .
Overnight Libor rose slightly to 0.33 % , bouncing off an all - time low of 0.32 % the previous day .
Libor is a key interbank lending rate .
The yield on the 3 - month Treasury bill , seen as the safest place to put money in the short term , fell to 0.30 % from 0.39 % Wednesday , with investors preferring to take a small return on their money than risk the stock market .
Last month , the 3 - month yield reached a 68 - year low around 0 % as investor panic peaked .
Treasury prices were little changed , with the yield on the benchmark 10 - year note at 3.70 % .

I ’m going to break my sequence of concepts to present an interesting analogy I just came up with to explain why this argument is subtly wrong :
“ There ’s no way to prove that god does not exist ”
Say I have two urns :
One is filled with numbered green balls , all of which lie in the range of 1 to 100 .
balls , all of which lie in the range of 1 to 100 .
The other is filled with numbered red balls all of which lie in the range of 1 to 500 .
I draw a sequence of balls from a single urn , announce the numbers and I then ask you what color you think the urn I picked was .
Obviously , if there is a single ball >= 101 , then you can assert with 100 % probability that the urn is red .
However , there ’s no possible sequence of balls that could definitively prove a green urn .
But if I keep on drawing balls under 100 , consistently and without a single ball over 100 .
The more balls are being drawn , the more sure you are that I picked the green urn .
I view this as analogous to the problem of the existence of god .
The space of possible universes in which god does not exist is a strict subset of the space of possible universes in which god does exist .
It ’s therefore strictly impossible to prove that god does not exist .
Each observation is like drawing a ball out of the urn and each observation can be consistent with an atheistic or supernatural interpretation of the world .
Say you observed stones independently arranging to form the words of the koran , the ten commandments written in fire across the sky and routine , repeatable , spontaneous limb regeneration after praying .
If any one of these happened ( and they were verified to be bona fide miracles and not just what seemed like miracles ) , it would be the equivilant of drawing ball 328 : absolute proof that god exists .
But we keep on picking balls and observing the world and they keep on being strictly naturalistic phenomena .
Sure , it ’s still possible that god exists and we ’re going to find evidence of him if we keep on looking harder .
But to me , we ’ve picked enough balls that it ’s not where the smart money is anymore .

AFTER AN agonizing 17 years , the U.S. government will finally have to admit what veterans and their families have long known -- Gulf War Illness is a very real and debilitating condition that has affected one - quarter of soldiers who served in the 1990 - 91 war .
The Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans ' Illnesses ( RAC - GWVI ) -- a committee of scientists and veterans appointed by Congress in 2002 to investigate the illnesses experienced by veterans of Operation Desert Storm -- presented its 450 - page report to Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake on November 17 .
The new report , which chronicles the ailments suffered by some 175,000 Gulf War veterans -- including memory and concentration problems , persistent headaches , unexplained fatigue , widespread pain , respiratory symptoms , digestive problems and skin rashes -- contradicts previous reports , which denied that Gulf War Illness even existed .
Among those previous reports , a 2006 National Academy of Science 's Institute of Medicine , claimed that the soldiers were simply suffering from merely suffering from stress disorders typical to any combat zone .
Exposure to chemical weapons may have contributed to Gulf War Illness
As the RAC - GWVI report plainly states :
Gulf
War illness fundamentally differs from trauma and stress - related syndromes described after other wars .
Studies consistently indicate that Gulf
War illness is not the result of combat or other stressors and that Gulf War veterans have lower rates of posttraumatic stress disorder than veterans of other wars .
According to the committee 's scientific director Roberta White , veterans " have been plagued by ill health since their return 17 years ago .
Although evidence for this health phenomenon is overwhelming , veterans repeatedly find that their complaints are met with cynicism and a ' blame the victim ' mentality that attributes their health problems to mental illness or non-physical factors . "
Lea Steele , who served as RAC - GWVI scientific director , told the Washington Post , " VA docs often know nothing about it and are n't able to help them .
Sometimes , they treat them as if they are head cases or malingering . "
As Anthony Hardie , national secretary for Veterans of Modern Warfare , told the Seattle Post - Intelligencer , " It really closes one of the darker chapters of the legacy of the Gulf War , and that is Gulf War illness . "
What else to read The Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans ' Illnesses report is available on the Boston University School of Public Health Web site .
Hardie , a 23 - year - old sergeant during the war , now suffers from respiratory problems , fatigue and chronic pain .
" The report clearly lays out that Gulf War illness was caused by unique exposures ; it lays out clearly that Gulf war illness is not a stress - related or trauma condition , that it is not the same as in wars before or since .
It is unique , " he said .
THE REPORT cites two main causes of Gulf War Illness -- exposure to toxic chemicals , including pesticides that were used against sand flies and other pests , and pyridostigmine bromide , or PB , a drug administered to troops that was supposed to protect them from nerve gas .
At least half of all troops in the 1991 war took PB , a drug that was not approved by the Federal Drug Administration , but for which the FDA gave the Defense Department a waiver for informed consent .
In other words , soldiers were being used as guinea pigs , and they had no way of knowing .
The committee also did not rule out some other causes of Gulf War Illness , including exposure to nerve agents and smoke from oil well fires , and receiving a large numbers of vaccines .
Department of Defense reports show that about 100,000 U.S. troops may have been exposed to low - level nerve agents after the demolition of Iraqi munitions near Khamisiyah , Iraq , in 1991 .
Even being exposed to low levels of nerve gas can have lasting brain deficits .
The report cites a veteran who said :
I arrived in Theater on January 6 , 1991 ... During official visits to strategic military cities , there were frequent SCUD attacks during which I heard chemical alarms sound .
When I asked if these alarms meant chemicals had been detected , I was told that the chemical alarms had malfunctioned .
I became ill and was treated for nausea , headaches , vomiting , diarrhea and high temperature .
Rashes I had over my body I thought were normal and expected since I spent most days in the sand , wind and sun , with all the attendant fleas , flies and desert parasites .
Headaches I attributed to fatigue and lack of sleep .
The symptoms ... continued after I returned home and got progressively worse .
British Gulf
War veterans are also seeing the effects .
" Recognition of the full extent of the illnesses suffered by these veterans of the conflict and the obligation owed to them is long overdue , " said David Craig , Marshal of the Royal Air Force and chief of the defense staff during the Gulf War .
" They are victims of the war , as much as any one struck by a bullet or shell . "
While the report did not link depleted uranium ( DU ) to the Gulf War Illness , the widespread effects of soldiers ' exposure to DU are also a part of the report .
Said one veteran :
I knew we were shooting DU rounds , but we were never told to stay away from vehicles that were hit by DU rounds .
Now I know that we probably got DU dust all over us .
But we did n't know any better , and we were dipping , smoking and eating without having washed our hands .
Right after the war , we saw lots of guys from other units climbing on the vehicles we had shot with DU rounds ...
In April 1991 , while we were in Kuwait , I started getting diarrhea , nausea , stomach cramps , headaches , and tightness in my chest .
My problems have gotten worse since then .
According to the RAC - GWVI report , Gulf War veterans developed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS , also known as Lou Gehrig 's Disease ) at twice the rate of nondeployed veterans .
It also found that personnel stationed downwind from the Khamisiyah munitions demolitions have died from brain cancer at twice the rate of other Gulf War veterans .
THE REPORT showed that very few veterans have recovered from Gulf War Illness , and the researchers had no recommendations for treatment .
This is hardly surprising , since the government has done everything it could to refuse to recognize that the condition even existed .
And even though millions of federal dollars have gone to supposed Gulf War research , little has changed for sick veterans of the war .
" In recent years , both the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have reported a lot of studies that were n't Gulf War illness as Gulf War research , " said the RAC - GWVI 's Steele .
" Some of the money was misused . "
The Department of Defense ( DOD ) and the Department of Veterans Affairs claim they have spent nearly $ 440 million since 1994 on Gulf War research .
But the RAC - GWVI found that the money was largely used to fund research that had nothing to do with Gulf War Illness .
A lot of the DOD money actually went to projects for soldiers currently deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
According to the report , the department has cut funding for the Gulf War research from about $ 30 million a year in 2003 to less than $ 5 million in 2006 .
This is hardly unique for the soldiers sent to fight U.S. wars .
It took 20 years for the soldiers suffering from the effects of Agent Orange , the chemical defoliant used during the Vietnam War , to force the government to acknowledge their illness .
Now that the facts are finally exposed on the impact of Gulf War Illness , we have to press the federal government to spend the money necessary to find a treatment for the tens of thousand of veterans who are paying for the U.S. 's wars with their health .
All Small - Chested Drivers Banned from Motorbikes
If you happen to be a motorbike rider living in Vietnam , you better hope your not too short , thin , or skinny .
Vietnam is considering new regulation that would ban anyone with a chest smaller than 28 inches from operating a motorbike .
“ The new proposals are very funny , but many Vietnamese people could become the victim of this joke , ” said Le Quang Minh , 31 , a Hanoi stockbroker .
“ Many Vietnamese women have small chests .
I have many friends who wo n’t meet these criteria . ”
Many people see the regulation as silly and have joked that “ from now on , padded bras will be best - sellers . ”
It in unclear how this new ban is expected to help some of the most dangerous streets in the world .

Sarah Palin Tried To Have Stand - In Take Her Place In Gubernatorial Debate
Case seen as test of Turkey 's ability to ditch authoritarian past and become fully - fledged democracy
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
The opening of a long - awaited trial billed as an attempt to expose Turkey 's so - called " deep state " was delayed amid chaotic scenes today after the court was overwhelmed by nationalist demonstrators and journalists .
In an atmosphere of rising tension , the hearing in the town of Silivri , near Istanbul , was adjourned for several hours after judges decided that the tiny courtroom was too overcrowded for the trial to begin .
As hundreds of Turkish flag - waving supporters of the 86 accused gathered outside the court , lawyers inside complained that the crowded conditions inside prevented them from working properly .
The trial eventually started several hours later but was subsequently adjourned again until Thursday .
The delay marked a farcical beginning to a case seen by many as a litmus - test of Turkey 's ability to ditch its authoritarian past and become a fully - fledged democracy .
The trial is intended to cross-examine a hardline nationalist - secularist group called Ergenekon , which is accused of plotting a series of violent acts calculated to provoke a military coup and unseat the Islamist - leaning Justice and Development party ( AKP ) government .
The 2,455 - page indictment accuses plotters of planning political assassinations and a wave of bombings designed to create a climate of chaos and fear .
The trial is expected to last for months , if not years .
It is alleged that the group bombed the headquarters of the secularist newspaper , Cumhurriyet , and tried to make it look like the work of Islamist extremists .
A list of purported assassination targets is said have included the prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the Nobel prize winning novelist , Orhan Pamuk and the former armed forces chief of staff , Yasar Buyukanit .
Among the accused are a retired army brigadier - general , the leader of an ultra-nationalist party , academics , mafia - linked figures , a secular newspaper columnist and Kemal Kerincsiz , a nationalist lawyer responsible for a spate of prosecutions against prominent writers , including Pamuk , for " insulting Turkishness " under Turkey 's notorious Article 301 .
The investigation was opened in June last year after a cache of grenades was found hidden in a house in a run-down area of Istanbul .
The scope of the investigation has broadened so much that several of the key figures arrested have not been indicted for today 's hearing and are expected to face trial later .
These include two four - star generals arrested in July - Sener Eruygur , former head of the paramilitary gendarmerie and secretary of the pro-Ataturk Kemalist Thought Association , and Hursit Tolon , a former first army commander who is the most senior person linked to the investigation .
The powerful armed forces - which sees itself as the guardian of Turkey 's secular constitution - has denied involvement with Ergenekon .
At its heart , the case exposes the deep fissure between secularists - who uphold the vision of the modern Turkish state 's founder , Mustafa Kemal Ataturk - and social conservatives , who want a more prominent place for Islam .
The investigation 's supporters have depicted it as an attempt to unearth unaccountable elements said to have existed within Turkey 's military - security apparatus for decades and believed to be responsible for a host of atrocities , including in Turkey 's long war against Kurdish militants .
But critics have dismissed it as a politically - motivated attempt by the AKP to weaken the military and other pillars of the secular state .
Some have accused the AKP of a witch hunt in revenge for a separate case this year in which the constitutional court narrowly decided against closing it for allegedly plotting to turn Turkey into an Islamic state .
" Of course it 's political but it 's still a big test for Turkey , " said Cengiz Aktar , professor of EU studies at Istanbul 's Bahcesehir univeristy .
" Some have linked Ergenekon to the AKP closure case but I think it is so big that it 's moved beyond that .
It 's a test of whether this country is serious about transparency and about getting rid of extra-political elements from its political life .
" But if it 's a simple purging element to get rid of bad elements from the military , it wo n't hold any lasting results .
This is my worry . "
NASA probe to study edge of solar system Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday October 19 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON , ( AFP ) 
The US space agency was on Sunday to launch a space probe that will go into orbit high above earth to study the distant edge of the solar system where hot solar winds crash into the cold outer space .
The Interstellar Boundary Explorer ( IBEX ) is on a two - year mission to take pictures and chart the mysterious confines of the solar system , located billions of kilometers ( miles ) from Earth .
The IBEX is equipped with instruments that will allow it to take images and for the first time chart a remote region known as the interstellar boundary , where the solar system meets interstellar space .
The area is a vast expanse of turbulent gas and twisting magnetic fields .
" The interstellar boundary regions are critical because they shield us from the vast majority of dangerous galactic cosmic rays , which otherwise would penetrate into Earth 's orbit and make human spaceflight much more dangerous , " said David McComas , IBEX principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute ( SwRI ) in San Antonio , Texas .
The only information that scientists have of this distant region are from the twin Voyager 1 and 2 probes , launched in 1977 and still in service today .
After flying past Jupiter and Saturn , and in the case of Voyager 2 , Uranus and Neptune , the probes are on their way to travel beyond the solar system .
In December 2004 Voyager 1 reached an area that scientists describe as the " termination shock " zone , where solar winds crash into the gas of interstellar space , marking the boundary of the solar system .
" The Voyager spacecraft are making fascinating observations of the local conditions at two points beyond the termination shock that show totally unexpected results and challenge many of our notions about this important region , " said McComas .
In 2007 Voyager 2 reached the heliosheath -- the area where the termination shock begins -- and on its current path and speed should reach the heliopause in 2010 .
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) remains in regular contact with the two probes , which return data recorded by their particle detectors .
By 2020 however contact with Voyager probes will be lost because of the weakening of their plutonium generators .
IBEX , armed with two very large aperture single pixel " cameras " that measure energetic neutral atoms , is to produce images of the region that will allow scientists for the first time to better understand what happens when the solar system meets the outer space galaxy .
The mission will also study cosmic radiation , which has a negative impact on human health and space exploration .
The IBEX probe weighs 462 kilos ( 1016 pounds ) and is shaped like an octagon , measuring a mere 52 centimeters ( 23 inches ) high and 97 centimeters ( 38 inches ) across .
The probe is to be launched from the Kwajalein Atoll , a part of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean , aboard a Pegausus rocket that will be dropped from a large Lockheed L- 1011 carrier aircraft flying some 12,000 meters ( 40,000 feet ) above the Marshall Islands .
The Pegasus will put the IBEX in a low orbit some 96 kilometers ( 60 miles ) above the earth .
The IBEX spacecraft 's own solid rocket motor will then carry the probe into a much higher altitude orbit of around 200,000 miles , NASA said .
The launch window is on Sunday between 1744 GMT and 1752 GMT , NASA said
NOVEMBER 20 --A 10 - year - old Wisconsin girl drafted a hit list containing the names of 21 classmates and four teachers who would be targeted " when I go on my killing spree . "
The handwritten list was confiscated Monday afternoon by a teacher in a McKinley Middle School classroom , according a Kenosha Police Department report , a copy of which you 'll find here .
At the top of the one - page list the sixth grader wrote , ' When I go on my killing spree the victims are ...'
A second list contained the names of four students -- including the girl herself -- who were ' people I do n't want 2 kill . '
When interviewed by cops , the student denied she wanted to hurt anyone , claiming she drafted the list ' because she was angry with some other students who accused her of spreading rumors . '
The girl said she was angry with teachers on the list ' because they ignore her when she raises her hand in class . '
The teacher who seized the note told cops that she ' feared for my safety after reading the list , ' and thought it was ' possible for [ the student ] to hurt me and the other people on the list . '
A Kenosha detective has forwarded the girl 's case to juvenile justice officials with the recommendation that she be charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct .
The child , who has not had prior disciplinary problems , was suspended from school pending an administrative review of the November 17 incident .
However , the school 's principal told police that she was not recommending that the child be expelled .

Barack Obama should set drastic targets to force the US to switch to renewable energy in an effort to slow down climate change , according to the former vice president Al Gore .
Gore said that one of Obama 's first acts as US president should be to demand a move to 100 % renewable energy within 10 years .
" We can do that , " he said during the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco last Friday .
" The declaration from President [ John F ] Kennedy that we would land a man on the moon and bring him back safely was thought by many to be impossible . "
During his presidential campaign , Obama promised to invest $ 150 bn ( £ 96bn ) in renewables over 10 years as part of the plan to increase US energy security amid fear of oil shortages , while also cutting carbon emissions .
Many hope to see those policies enacted with a far - reaching climate - change bill that would bring the US back into the global environment fold .
Gore 's call for action , made at the summit , one of the hi-tech industry 's leading events , included his view that the internet had a vital role to play in the mission for energy ; but he stressed that people needed to start using the web for social good .
Gore has got close links to the industry through his work as a board member at Apple , as an adviser to Google , and as a prominent investor in a number of hi-tech companies .
Making an analogy between the march of the internet and the early development of electricity , Gore suggested the web should find a real purpose beyond making money and sharing information .
He said : " The early uses of electricity were aimed at specialised applications and gimmicks . "
But the web 's real purpose , he suggested , was " to bring about a higher level of consciousness about our planet and the imminent danger ... we face because of the radical transformation in the relationship between human beings and the earth " .
Gore 's perspective and the similar views of his allies formed the biggest call at the summit for hi-tech development , saying technology should be used to tackle the problem of climate change .
At the summit , delegates heard about how a range of developments , in green technology , hi-tech monitoring systems and alternative energy sources , was now attracting growing interest from investors .

Introduction and Overview
Background
This paper describes the evolution of a genetic program to optimize a problem featuring task prioritization in a dynamic , randomly updated environment .
The specific problem approached is the " snake game " in which a snake confined to a rectangular board attempts to avoid the walls and its own body while eating pieces of food .
The problem is particularly interesting because as the snake eats the food , its body grows , causing the space through which the snake can navigate to become more confined .
Furthermore , with each piece of food eaten , a new piece of food is generated in a random location in the playing field , adding an element of uncertainty to the program .
This paper will focus on the development and analysis of a successful function set that will allow the evolution of a genetic program that causes the snake to eat the maximum possible pieces of food . [ size = " 5 " ]
Artificial intelligence ( AI ) techniques have been proven highly successful at the problems of navigation , task prioritization , and problem avoidance .
Traditionally , humans have encoded rule - based AIs to create the behaviors necessary to allow an automaton to achieve a specific task or set of tasks .
Genetic programming ( GP ) , however , has been proven to allow a computer to create human - competitive results .
Specifically , examples such as the wall - following robot ( Koza 1992 ) and Pac Man( R ) ( Koza 1992 ) demonstrate the effectiveness of GP at evolving programs capable of navigation and task prioritization behaviors which are competitive with human - produced results .
In an original approach to demonstrating the effectiveness of GP at producing human - competitive results , this paper describes the evolution of a genetic program that can successfully achieve the maximum possible score in the " snake game . "
The problem posed by the snake game is of particular interest for two main reasons .
First , the size and shape of the area through which the main game character , the snake , can move is constantly changing as the game progresses .
Second , as the snake eats the single available piece of food on the game board , a new piece is generated in a random location .
Because of these two factors , the snake game presents a unique challenge in the developing of a function and terminal set to allow GP to evolve an optimal solution that is generalized for successive runs of the snake game .
The " Background " section of this paper outlines the rules and discusses the specific details of the " snake game . "
Next , " Statement of the Problem " explains the problem being addressed by this paper .
The " Methods " section provides the GP specifics of how the problem was approached .
The " Results " section gives numerous examples of results produced by the GP runs along with a discussion and analysis of those results .
The " Conclusion " section summarizes the ultimate results achieved by the paper .
The " Future Work " section discusses potential for further study in line with the work discussed in this paper .
Finally , the " References " section provides a bibliography for the paper . [ size = " 5 " ]
The " snake game " has been in existence for over a decade and seen incarnations on nearly every popular computing platform .
The game begins with a snake having a fixed number of body segments confined to a rectangular board .
With each time step that passes , the snake can either change direction to the right or left , or move forward .
Hence the snake is always moving .
Within the game board there is always one piece of food available .
If the snake is able to maneuver its head onto the food , its tail will then grow by a single body segment and another piece of food will randomly appear in an open portion of the game board during the next time step .
The game ends when the snake 's head advances into a game square that is filled with either a snake body segment , or a section of the wall surrounding the game board .
From a task prioritization standpoint , then , the snake 's primary goal is to avoid running into an occupied square .
To the extent that this first priority is being achieved , its second priority is to pursue the food .
The version of the game used for this paper , shown in figure 1 , is a replica of the game as it currently exists on Nokia cell phones .
In this version , which is available for play online at www.nokia.com/snake , the game board is made up of 220 total squares , 20 horizontal and 11 vertical , and the food begins in position ( 11,6 ) on the game board , represented by a diamond in the figure .
The snake is initially made up of 9 body segments , occupying positions ( 1,11 ) - ( 9,11 ) on the board , with the head in position ( 9,11 ) and the snake moving to the right , represented by the arrow in the figure .
The maximum number of pieces of food that can be eaten is the size of the game board minus the initial size of the snake .
With the given parameters , then , this equates to 220 - 9=211 pieces of food .
This is because with each piece of food eaten , the snake grows by a body segment , reducing the amount of free space in which it can move .
Hence when it has eaten 211 pieces of food , its body will fill the entire game board , rendering any further movement impossible .
One critical piece of information is whether or not it is even possible for the snake to eat the maximum amount of food .
Indeed it is conceivable that after eating a certain amount of food , the snake will have grown so large that it restricts itself from access to a portion of the board .
Upon close inspection , however , the reader will note that by tracing certain patterns repeatedly over the board , it is possible for the snake to cover every square exactly once and return to its initial position .
One such pattern is shown in figure 2 , which features a snake of 210 body segments about to eat the final piece of food .
Hence by continually tracing the pattern shown , the snake can eat the maximum possible pieces of food .
In evolving a genetic program to successfully eat the maximum amount of food , a human competitive solution , in terms of score , will have been obtained .
With that in mind , there are some important differences in the game when being played by a human as opposed to a computer - generated program .

An additional function would be required , as there would need to be one for all cardinal directions in order to account for all possible surrounding dangers .
An added downfall of this complexity is that one of the " ifDanger * " functions will be virtually meaningless depending on the direction of snake 's travel , since the snake 's neck segment adjacent to the snake 's head is always an adjacent danger , although not one of any consequence to the snake , since it is unable to move back on itself .
Anytime an " ifDanger * " function was used , it would need the aid of a helper function , such as the new " ifMoving * " functions in order to make intelligent moves based on an assessment of the danger .

Results
For a human player , the fact that the snake is always moving adds an element of pressure , forcing him / her to make decisions in a timely manner .
When using a computer to play the game , this is not a concern , as the computer will have the time between each move to parse through a program tree and determine the next move .
The nearest equivalent to " pressure " for a computer is any limitation imposed on the size and depth of the genetic program 's function tree .
These limitations restrict the possible number of decision trees that can be generated , thereby ensuring that the computer will have a finite amount of time in which to determine the next move for the snake .
The particular function tree limitations imposed for this problem will be discussed in the following " methods " section . [ size = " 5 " ]
The fundamental problem of the snake game is to eat the maximum number of food pieces before " dying " by running into either a wall or a segment of the snake 's body .
The problem being addressed in this paper is to provide a function and terminal set that will allow for the evolution of a GP that will maximize the number of food pieces eaten by the snake .
The maximum goal for the particular configuration of the snake game used in this paper is 211 pieces of food . [ size = " 5 " ]
Table 1 provides the tableau for the initial runs of the snake game .
Following over twenty initial runs of the program , the maximum score that had been achieved was 123 hits .
As it was apparent that a maximum solution would not be obtained using the initial function set , the function set was expanded to enhance the snake 's movement and environment sensing capabilities .
For the remainder of the paper , any GP runs performed with the function and terminal sets given in Table 1 will be referred to as a run made with the " initial " function set .
Any run made with the enhanced function set , which includes the complete initial function set as a subset , will be referred to as having been made with the " final " function set .
A discussion of both the initial and final function sets follows .
Objective : Find a computer program that eats the maximum possible pieces of food .
Terminal set :( forward ) , ( left ) , ( right ) Function set:ifFoodAhead , ifDangerAhead , ifDangerRight , ifDangerLeft , progn2 Fitness cases :
One fitness case .
Raw Fitness : Pieces of food eaten .
Standardized fitness : Maximum possible pieces of food eaten ( 211 ) minus the raw fitness .
Hits : Total pieces of food eaten during a run of the program , same as raw fitness .
Wrapper : None .
Parameters : M = 10000 . G = 500 .
Success predicate : A program scores 211 hits . :
The terminal set chosen for the problem was right , left , and forward .
Each terminal was a macro that would cause the snake to take the corresponding action during a time step as follows : the snake would change its current direction , making a move to the rightthe snake would change its current direction , making a move to the leftthe snake would maintain its current direction , and move forward .
This is the same as a no - op , as the snake must make a move during each time step .
These three terminals represent the minimal terminal set with which the snake can effectively navigate its surroundings .
While some problems consisting of navigation in a two - dimensional grid can be successfully navigated by way of only one direction changing terminal , that is impractical for the snake game because the facts that the game board is enclosed and that the snake has an extended body that is impassible necessitate the ability for the snake to move in either direction in order to avoid death .
More advance terminals , such as moving the snake along the shortest path to the food , were not implemented .
Rather , the function set was constructed in such a manner that the GP could evolve the necessary capabilities to achieve the maximum score . :
Initially the snake was given very limited functionality .
One function gave it information about the location of the food , three other functions gave it information about any immediately accessible danger , and progn2 was provided as connective " glue " to allow a function tree to make multiple moves in a single pass .
All functions were implemented as macros of arity two , and therefore would only execute one of their arguments depending on the current state of the game , except for progn2 , which would execute both of its arguments .
Even though no expressions evolved from this initial function and terminal set were able to achieve the optimum score of 211 pieces of food , this set served as a baseline by which to evaluate progress and determine enhancements the would lead to the eventual optimal solution .
Following is a description of the initial function set :
If there is food in line with the snake 's current direction , this function will execute its first argument , otherwise it will execute the second argument .
This was the only initial function that gave the snake information beyond its immediate surroundings .
If the game square immediately in front of the snake is occupied with either a snake body segment or the wall , this function will execute its first argument , otherwise it will execute its second argument .
If the game square immediately to the right of the snake is occupied with either a snake body segment or the wall , this function will execute its first argument , otherwise it will execute its second argument .
If the game square immediately to the left of the snake is occupied with either a snake body segment or the wall , this function will execute its first argument , otherwise it will execute its second argument .
This is a connectivity function that will first execute its right argument , then its left .
It is the only function that allows execution of more than one terminal in a single parse of the function tree .
Although this function will always execute both of its arguments , it was necessary to implement it as a macro because of the way that the software used to make GP runs , Dave 's Genetic Programming in C ( DGPC ) , evaluated functions vs. macros .
To avoid unnecessary modification of DGPC , implementing progn2 as a macro proved the simplest option .
As mentioned previously , no GP runs performed with the initial function set were able to score greater than 123 hits .
In order to increase the probability of evolving a function tree capable of achieving the maximum number of hits , the initial function set was enhanced .
Functions were added to extend the snake 's capabilities for detecting food and danger , as well functions that were conditional on the snake 's current movement direction .
Following is a discussion of the additional functions that , along with the initial function set , make up the final function set .
Additional Functions , all of arity 2 : If the game square two spaces immediately in front of the snake is occupied by either the wall or a segment of the snake 's body , this function will execute the first parameter , otherwise it will execute the second .
If the current piece of food on the board is closer to the top of the game board than the snake 's head , then the first parameter of this function will be executed , otherwise the second parameter will be executed .
If the current piece of food on the board is further to the right of the game board than the snake 's head , then the first parameter of this function will be executed , otherwise the second parameter will be executed .
If the snake is moving right , then the first parameter of this function will be executed , otherwise the second parameter will be executed .
If the snake is moving left , then the first parameter of this function will be executed , otherwise the second parameter will be executed .
If the snake is moving upward , then the first parameter of this function will be executed , otherwise the second parameter will be executed .
If the snake is moving downward , then the first parameter of this function will be executed , otherwise the second parameter will be executed .
There are two characteristics of the final function set that should be given special attention .
First , note that the " ifFoodUp " and " ifFoodRight " functions are direction independent , meaning that the direction in which the snake is moving has no impact on the function 's behavior .
This is in contrast to the initial set of functions , such as " ifDangerAhead " , in which the direction that the snake was traveling would have an impact on the return value of the function .
The reason for the difference is to maintain simplicity in the function set .
The snake can potentially be surrounded by danger , but there will only be one piece of food on the board at any one time .
If the " ifDanger * " functions were direction - independent , then two significant complexities would be added to the problem .
Taking the second complexity into account , the reader may now note that the same disadvantage is true of the two new functions , " ifFoodUp " and " ifFoodRight . "
Indeed this is true , but an important difference between the role of food and the role of danger in the game makes for a worthwhile tradeoff .
The difference is that there will only be one piece of food on the board at any time .
This allows the new " ifFood * " functions to serve as two functions each .
To clarify , consider the ifFoodUp function .
When not true , it is indicating that the food is either down , or on the same horizontal plane as the snake 's head .
Now consider a hypothetical " ifDangerUp " function .
If this function were not true , it would tell nothing about whether or not danger is down , because it can be anywhere simultaneously .
Likewise is would not even tell whether existing danger that was " up " posed a immediate threat to the snake , as the further information of the snake 's current moving direction would need to be known , as discussed earlier .
For the second special characteristic of the new functions , consider the new " ifMoving * " functions .
These functions can be used as helper functions with the two new " ifFood * " functions to create beneficial schemata .
As an example of a beneficial schemata , consider " ifFoodUp( ifMoving Right ( left , ifMoving Up ( fwd , right ) ) ) ) " , which will orient the snake to pursue food that is upward .
As will be seen in the results section , not only does the GP learn how to use these functions in conjunction with the two new " ifFood * " functions , but they also prove useful in helping the snake discover patterns that greatly extend its life .
Discussion of other schemata is given below in the description of schemata , and specific examples are given in the " Results " section . :
For initial runs of the problem , only a single fitness case was used to determine the fitness for each individual .
Because the food placement is random both during a single run , and from one run to another , occasionally individuals would score a number of hits because of fortuitous placement of the food , and not as much on the merit of their function tree .
To better ensure that the most successful individuals achieved high fitness measures primarily on the basis of their function tree , new GP runs were often made featuring a " primed " population in which the fitness was measured as the average of four runs of an individual .
The procedure for this is as follows : once a run had completed without obtaining a solution , or if a run had stalled on a single individual for a large number ( 100 or more ) of generations , a new run was begun with this final individual as one of the initial individuals .
For this new run , however , the fitness was taken as the average fitness of an individual over four runs instead of merely a single run .
The averaging of the fitness over four runs helped eliminate the possibility of an individual having a high fitness due simply to lucky placement of the food .
Using this averaging method to determine fitness was only used in primed populations because it increased the time of a GP run fourfold .
Furthermore , it was common for the generations that timed out to feature an individual who had scored a high fitness as a result of a lucky run .
By beginning a new run with this individual in the initial population , it not only assured a more realistic fitness measure , but it introduced an entirely new mix of randomly generated schemata that could potentially benefit the stalled individual .
Details of results produced by primed runs are given in the results section . :
The fitness measure used is the maximum possible pieces of food eaten , 211 , minus the actual number of pieces of food eaten .
Furthermore , if the snake was unsuccessful at eating any food the fitness would be penalized by the number of board squares that it was from the food .
This additional criterion was added to favor individuals who moved toward the food in early generations of snakes who were unable eat any food . : Population was set to 10000 .
The maximum number of generations was set to 500 .
The size of a function tree was limited to 150 points .
These parameters were chosen mainly based on available computer resources , covered in computer equipment and run-time explanation below . :
The best of generation individual will be the one that is able to eat the most pieces of food .
A run will end when one of three termination criteria are met :
The reader may note that there is no termination criterion for the completely successful snake .
That is because upon eating the final piece of food , the snake 's tail will grow onto its head , causing it to satisfy termination criteria 2 above .
Hence even the optimal solution will end in death for the snake . :
Crossover of nodes was the primary genetic operator employed during the GP runs .
The crossover fraction for leaves was set to .10 ; the crossover fraction for a node was set to .80 ; the mutation fraction was set to 0 .
Additionally , primed GP runs were used to improve genetic diversity , as described above in the description of fitness cases . :
The majority of the computer runs were performed on a 550MHz Intel ( R ) Celeron Processor running Microsoft ( R ) Windows 98 SE Operating System .
The software used was Version 2.0 of Dave 's Genetic Programming In C , and Microsoft ( R ) Visual C++ 5.0 .
In addition , a stand - alone simulation of the snake game was created that was able to read in the function trees produced by DGPC and graphically display a run of a particular function tree .
This utility proved invaluable , as it provided a fast , visual method to determine the overall optimization strategy represented by the function tree .
The alternative of hand - evaluating each function tree would have proven not only more time consuming , but much less conclusive .
A complete run of 500 generations took around 20 hours to complete .
Because of the length of time for each run , many runs were farmed out to separate computers , all with approximately equivalent computer power . :
Given the initial function set , there were a few highly desirable sub - tree schemata that could be produced .
First , considering a minimal sub - tree of 3 points , any sub - tree that would evade impending danger by changing directions is certainly the key to survival of an individual .
One such sub - tree is " ifDangerAhead ( right , forward ) . "
Secondly , a basic sub - tree that will avoid changing directions into impending danger is solely beneficial to an individual .
One example is " ifDangerRight ( forward , right ) . "
The reader will note that anytime a change in direction is about to be undertaken , it would be wise to have such a check before making the move .
Thirdly , a 3 - pointed sub - tree that aims at pursuing the food , and modifying directions if no food is ahead , is required to give the individual more than a random opportunity to eat the food pieces .
One such individual is " ifFoodAhead ( forward , right ) .
" As explained previously , the " ifFoodAhead " function will return true for a piece of food any number of squares in front of the snake .
Therefore , in addition to seeking the food , it would also be desirable for the individual to continually scan for impending danger while the food is being sought .
Hence a final example of a desirable schemata is any combination of the above three examples that effectively combines the goals of each .
For example , consider the following function tree of 7 points : ifFoodAhead ( ifDangerAhead ( right , forward ) , ifDangerRight ( left , right ) ) .
This schema will cause the snake to pursue food ahead as long as no immediate threat is observed .
If however , there is a threat or no food ahead , the sub - tree will cause the individual to change direction avoiding any observed danger , or pursuing a new vector to find food .
Specific examples of the emergence of such schemata will be given in the results section .
In addition to the potential beneficial schemata , touched on above , there are also " detrimental " schemata .
The detrimental schemata would be any function branch whose primary goal is to either seek danger or avoid food .
Examples of detrimental schemata are essentially the converse of the previously outlined beneficial schemata , and their further consideration is left to the reader .
Certainly all schemata are not strictly beneficial or detrimental , and any such schemata will be called " neutral schemata . "
Consider , for example , the simple subtree " ifDangerRight ( left , forward ) . "
This function will turn left if danger is present to the right , and continue forward otherwise .
This schema makes either a left or forward move without having any apparent knowledge of what lies in those directions .
This could certainly prove to be detrimental , but the move to the left when danger is right is at least avoiding the danger to the right .
Schemata such as this can actually prove beneficial when placed in the context of a complete function tree .
An examination of actual schemata produced during the GP runs in question follows in the results section . [ size = " 5 " ]
As mentioned in the methods section , there were three types of GP runs made in an attempt to evolve a solution to the snake game : runs using the initial function set , the final function set , and primed runs , also using the final function set .
The highest number of hits generated by a run using the initial function set was 123 .
Three separate solutions were generated using the final function set , although none of them were found to consistently generate a solution .
The number of hits achieved by each solution depended on the placement of the food .
It was not until the method of " priming " a run , described in the methods section , was used that a consistent solution was generated .
Of ten primed runs , using various initial seeds , exactly five of them evolved a solution , all of which were consistent solutions over multiple runs .
Comparatively , over twenty runs using the full function set were made , and only three of them produced solutions , none consistent .
Zig-zagger
A summary of the overall results achieved in each type of run is given in figure 3 .
Each line on the graph is the average of ten runs .
Note that the initial and final function sets produce a roughly equivalent maximum number of hits until about generation fifty .
At this point the final function set continues to improve while the initial function set levels off .
By generation 200 , the initial function set has virtually no improvement , while the final function set continues improving past generation 400 .
Because the final function set is both more complete and larger , new and more successful individuals continue to evolve while individuals produced by the initial function set max out around 100 hits .
Another feature to note in figure 3 is the impressive results achieved by the primed runs .
All primed runs were begun with an individual from a final function set run who had achieved at least 150 hits .
When taken as the average over four runs , however , these individuals are only able to achieve about 50 hits , as shown in the first generation of the primed runs .
These individuals jumpstart the population to great success , and by generation 25 the maximum number of hits has more than tripled to around 160 .
By generation 150 the primed runs level off to about 200 hits .
Following is an evaluation of some of the most prominent strategies evolved during the various GP runs .
Specific examples of individuals from each type of run are presented and analyzed , and all function trees are reduced for simplicity sake . :
One strategy that was prevalent in individuals across multiple runs is what will be referred to as the " zig - zagger . "
These individuals would trace the board diagonally in a stair - stepper pattern until they either reached a wall or had lined the direction of their movement up with the food .
Upon reaching a wall , they would change their direction as if bouncing off of the wall , and continue diagonally tracing the board in a new direction .
If they were successful in aligning their movement with the piece of food , they would typically head directly toward the food , perhaps avoiding danger depending on the particular individual .
Variations in zig - zaggers occurred between which directions they would head when hitting the wall , how often they would seek the food , and how they would react in enclosed situations , such as corners or heading towards food that was blocked by their body .
Obviously the more successful individuals evolved traits that allowed them to avoid danger in close quarters and dodge their body when it blocked progress toward the food .
One example of a zig - zagger , who was able to score a maximum of 33 hits in one particular run , is given below : [ font = " Courier New " ] [ color= " #000080 " ]( ifFoodAhead[nbsp ](ifDangerLeft[nbsp ]( right[nbsp ] ) ( ifDangerRight[nbsp ]( [ sup]1[/sup] forward[nbsp ] ) ( ifDangerAhead[nbsp]( left[nbsp ] ) ( [ nbsp ] [sup]1[/sup]forward[nbsp ] ) ) ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp] [nbsp](ifDangerAhead[nbsp](ifDangerLeft[nbsp]( right[nbsp ] ) ( left[nbsp ] ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp](ifDangerLeft[nbsp](ifDangerRight[nbsp ]( forward[nbsp ] ) ( [ nbsp ] [sup]2[/sup]right[nbsp ] ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] ( progn2 [nbsp ] ( left[nbsp ] ) ( right[nbsp ] ) ) ) ) ) [ / color ] [ / font ]
Consider initially the rightmost sub - tree of the function tree , which is given on the last line as progn2 ( left ) ( right ) .
This is the branch executed initially and for the majority of this zig - zagger 's run .
When executed repeatedly , this sub - tree will cause the snake to move left then right , progressing diagonally across the board .
For this example , the sub - tree is executed whenever there is no food ahead of the snake 's line of movement , and there is no danger in front of or to the left of the snake 's head .
This continuous zig - zagging motion allows the snake to examine successive rows or columns of the board in search of the food .
Because both branches of the progn2 are executed before returning to the beginning of the function tree , however , the snake will only detect the food if the second argument of the progn2 , right , leaves the snake 's head in line with the food .
Wall - slitherer
Once the food is directly in line with the movement of the snake 's head , the left - hand sub - tree , given on the first line above , is executed .
As noted with a " 1 " above , the snake will continue forward if there is no danger to the left , and either there is danger to the right , or there is no danger to the right or ahead .
Unfortunately for the snake , if there is no danger to the left , but danger to the right and ahead , this function tree will lead it directly into the danger ahead , noted with the first " 1 " above .
This is exactly what happened to the snake in figure 4 , shown one time step before its demise after having eaten 24 pieces of food .
This snake , whose head is in ( 14,5 ) , began moving towards the food in ( 4,5 ) after having released from the wall .
Finally , note that when the " right " portion of the " progn2 " sub - tree causes the snake to be either facing or next to a wall , the sub - trees on the second and third line above will be executed respectively .
Further investigation reveals that each of these sub - trees will cause the snake to move away from the wall in a direction that avoids danger , even in corners .
In this fashion , the snake appears to " bounce " from the walls and proceed to zig -zag in an alternate direction .
Two examples of this are seen at positions ( 17,1 ) and ( 20,5 ) of figure 4 .
In both of these cases the snake made the right turn noted with a " 2 " above in order to avoid the wall . :
The strategy that scored the highest out of all individuals using the initial function and terminal set is what will be referred to as the " wall - slitherer . "
These individuals would follow along the wall , not simply moving forward , but rather slithering back and forth between the two squares closest to the wall .
Once able to align its head with the food , the individual would move away from the wall in a straight line to obtain the food .
Than , when the food was eaten , successful wall - slitherers would either double - back along their own body and head for the wall or head in a random direction toward a wall .
Variations on wall - slitherers occurred in the direction they would take around the wall and when they would leave the wall to pursue the food .
One highly successful wall - slitherer is shown below .
This individual scored a maximum of 107 hits in one particular run , and an evaluation of its important characteristics follows : [ font = " Courier New " ] [ color= " #000080 " ]( ifFoodAhead[ nbsp ](ifDangerAhead[nbsp ]( left[nbsp ] ) ( forward[nbsp ] ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] ( [sup]1[/sup]ifDangerAhead[nbsp](ifDangerRight[nbsp]( left[nbsp ] ) ( progn2[nbsp]( right[nbsp ] ) [ nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp ] [nbsp](ifFoodAhead[nbsp](ifDangerRight[nbsp ]( forward[nbsp ] ) ( right[nbsp ] ) ) ) ( ifDangerRight[nbsp ] ( forward[nbsp ] ) ( right[nbsp ] ) ) ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp ] ([sup]2[/sup]ifDangerRight[nbsp](ifDangerLeft[nbsp ]( forward[nbsp ] ) ( left[nbsp ] ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] ( [sup]3[/sup]ifDangerLeft[nbsp]( right[nbsp ] ) [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp ]([sup]4[/sup]progn2[nbsp]( left[nbsp ] ) ( ifFoodAhead[nbsp](ifDangerLeft[nbsp]( right[nbsp ] ) ( left[nbsp ] ) ) ( ifDangerRight[nbsp ]( left[nbsp ] ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [ nbsp ] [ nbsp ] [ nbsp] [ nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] ( [ nbsp ] [sup]5[/sup]progn2[nbsp](ifDangerAhead[nbsp]( right[nbsp ] ) ( ifDangerLeft[nbsp]( right[nbsp ] ) ( left[nbsp ] ) ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ](ifDangerRight[nbsp ]( forward[nbsp ] ) ( right[nbs p ] ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) [ / color ] [ / font ]
In evaluating this individual , first consider the root , which consists of the " ifFoodAhead " function .
For any case in which there is food ahead , the very simple left sub - tree is executed .
This subtree simply checks for danger ahead and attempts to avoid it to the left if present , otherwise the snake will continue along its current movement path towards the food .
While this sub - tree proves both simple and effective , the fact is clear that the individual spends the majority of its run without the food immediately ahead , which is handled by the much larger right - hand sub - tree .
While it appears much more complicated than the left - hand sub - tree , the fundamental strategy of the right - hand sub - tree is to avoid danger .
This strategy is executed impressively by the three different " ifDanger * " functions , noted with 1 , 2 , and 3 .
These functions provide the roots for the three sub - trees along the right - hand side of the main function tree .
The reader can verify that each of these three sub - trees contains schemata that are highly effective at avoiding any impending danger to the snake .
Having already taken precautions to pursue food and avoid danger , the final sub - tree provides the snake with its wall - slithering motion , in which it spends the majority of its time .
The final sub - tree , noted with a " 4 " above , is rooted with a progn2 .
This indicates that multiple actions will be carried out every time this sub - tree is reached , which proves to be very frequently .
Initially the branch will make a move to the left , which is already known to be safe .
Following this move , if there is no food ahead and no food to the right , then the second progn2 , noted with a " 5 " , is reached , making for a total of three moves to be executed on this single pass of the function tree .
This three - move sequence is both common and highly beneficial to the success of this wall - slitherer .
In figure 5 , note the snake 's body segment at ( 19,8 ) .
At this point in the past , the snake was facing downward and a new parse of the function tree was beginning .
As no danger was immediately present , sub - tree 4 was reached and the snake turned left towards the wall .
Needing to complete the second argument of the progn2 , and with no food ahead or danger to the right , the progn2 at 5 was reached , which caused the snake to turn right twice , leading to the next parse of the function tree .
Looking back in history through the illustration , note that the same pattern was carried out at points ( 19,6 ) , ( 19,4 ) , ( 19,2 ) , and numerous other times in the brief potion of the snake 's run demonstrated here .
This repeated slithering pattern served to maximize the amount of ground covered by the snake while minimizing the danger that its body would pose to itself .
A time step prior to a fatal flaw in the snake 's movement , however , is illustrated .
Circler
Pattern Following Solution
While moving upward , if there is not danger two ahead , move forward twice .
Once there is danger two ahead , turn right ; snake now moving right one row from the top of the board .
Turn right again , to begin heading downward .
Continue moving downward until there is danger directly ahead .
Once there is danger ahead , turn left ; snake now moving right at the bottom of the board .
Turn left again and return to step one until there is danger to the right of the snake .
Danger right indicated the final right - hand column , so the snake now moves up until danger is one ahead .
Once there is danger ahead , turn left to follow the top row of the board ( 4,7 ) while moving left ; repeat this same step to move down the left - hand side of the board , and when the bottom of the board is reached , return to step 5 .
Conclusion
Future Work
References
As the food is in front of the snake 's head , the simple sub - tree on the left is entered .
Since there is danger ahead of the snake , it will simply turn left .
As shown in the illustration , this turn will lead to the snake 's death , as it hits it 's own body after having eaten 61 pieces of food .
While it may seem surprising that this flaw in the left - hand function tree was not encountered sooner , the snake survives by keeping its body along the walls as much as possible .
In the illustration , it is clear that the snake left the wall 57 time steps earlier in order to pursue a piece of food across the board .
Once the food was eaten , the snake resumed its slither pattern clockwise around the edge of the board .
Unfortunately , its body had grown so long that by the time its head was in line with the food at position ( 19,9 ) its body was still blocking its path to the food .
The snakes evasion tactic of going to the left when danger is encountered with the food ahead had saved in previous similar situations because once a single successful left was made , the snake was no longer in line with the food and it would continue any necessary evasive maneuvers via the much more robust sub - trees , 1 , 2 , and 3 .
In this final , fatal case , however , the combination of the snake 's long body , its previous cross - board pursuit of the food , and the placement of the next piece of food three board squares off of the wall caused the evasive left to lead the snake directly into its own body . :
After the function set was enhanced to include the further food - sensing capabilities of " ifFoodUp " and " ifFoodRight " as well as the four " ifMoving * " functions , a new strategy of behavior that evolved is what will be referred to as the " circler . "
These individuals would follow along the outside of the wall in a circular pattern and only leave the wall to get the food .
Once they reached the food they would continue forward until they reached the wall , then they 'd start to circle again .
Typically they would only attempt to eat the food while moving in one particular direction .
While similar to the wall - slitherer , they differ in two key ways .
The first is that the circler will always remain directly next to the wall and not move back and forth like the wall - slitherer .
The second is that the circler will typically only leave the wall while headed in one direction .
Both of these differences are a direct result of the new functions .
Before further discussion , consider the following circler , who scored a maximum of 80 hits over a single run :[ font = " Courier New " ] [ color= " #000080 " ]( ifDangerAhead[nbsp](ifDangerTwoAhead[nbsp](ifDangerLeft[nbsp]( right[nbsp ] ) ( left[nbsp ] ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp]( ifFoodUp[nbsp](ifDangerLeft[nbsp]( right[nbsp ] ) ( [ sup]2[/sup]left[nbsp ] ) ) ( forward[nbsp ] ) ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp ](ifMovingUp[nbsp](ifDangerRight[nbsp]( ifFoodUp[nbsp ]( forward[nbsp ] ) ( [ sup]3[/sup]left[nbsp ] ) ) ( right[nbsp ] ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] ( [ sup]1[/sup]forward[nbsp ] ) ) ) [ / color ] [ / font ]
First note the leftmost branch of the function tree , in which the snake will primarily avoid danger to both the front and the left .
Certainly the left - hand sub - tree , though simple , proves highly effective at achieving the snake 's primary goal of avoiding danger .
Secondly , take note of the right - hand sub - tree , which is parsed whenever danger is not immediately ahead of the snake .
If the snake is not moving upwards , it simply continues forward , which is already known to be a safe move .
This proves to be the move that snake most commonly makes .
If , however , the snake is moving upwards , and there is danger to the right , then it will turn left as soon as the food in no longer above it .
The primary moves of this snake , then , are to continue forward around the outside of the board until either there is danger ahead and it turns left , or the snake is moving upwards and there is food to left , when it turns left .
Note that these moves are marked 1 , 2 , 3 respectively in the function tree above .
Hence when seen in action the snake will make a counterclockwise circular motion around the outside of the board with the top of the circle determined by the current piece of food . :
As a final example of an evolved strategy , an individual that was able to score the maximum number of hits , 211 , will be considered .
All individuals who were able to score the maximum number of hits demonstrated some pattern similar to that shown in figure 2 .
All of these individuals took little to no consideration of where the food was on the board , but rather followed a set pattern that would cover the entire board , eventually causing them to eat the food .
Furthermore , the pattern they followed would be continuous , meaning that their head would eventually reach its original starting position , allowing the pattern to continue indefinitely .
One such pattern follower , produced in generation 27 of a " primed " run , is given below : [ font = " Courier New " ] [ color= " #000080 " ]( ifDangerRight[nbsp](ifDangerAhead[nbsp](ifDangerTwoAhead[nbsp ]( [ sup]8[/sup]left[nbsp ] ) ( forward[nbsp ] ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp](ifMovingRight[nbsp ]( [ sup]6[/sup]left[nbsp ] ) ( [ nbsp ] [ sup ]4,7[/sup]forward[nbsp ] ) ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp] [nbsp](ifDangerAhead[nbsp](ifDangerLeft[nbsp]( ifFoodUp[nbsp]( right[nbsp ] ) ( right[nbsp ] ) ) ( ifDangerTwoAhead[nbsp]( left[nbsp ] ) ( forward[nbsp ] ) ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp ](ifMovingUp[nbsp](ifDangerTwoAhead[nbsp](ifFoodAhead[nbsp](ifMovingRight[nbsp ]( [ sup]3[/sup]right[nbsp ] ) ( [ nbsp ] [sup]9[/sup]forward[nbsp ] ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ](ifMovingDown[nbsp]( left[nbsp ] ) ( [ nbsp ] [sup]2[/sup]right[nbsp ] ) ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] ( [ sup]1[/sup]progn2[nbsp ]( forward[nbsp ] ) ( forward[nbsp ] ) ) ) [ nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [nbsp ] [ nbsp ] [ nbsp ] [ nbsp ] [ nbsp ] [ nbsp ](ifMovingRight[nbsp]( right[nbsp ] ) ( forward[nbsp ] ) ) ) ) ) [ / color ] [ / font ]
This individual followed a pattern exactly the same as that shown in figure 2 .
There were only a few minor deviations from the pattern that would occur during very infrequent states of the game board .
Before considering any such deviations an examination of the major pattern following steps will be made .
The overall pattern followed by the individual above is as follows , with the movement steps noted by superscripts on the individual .
To simplify the analysis consider that the snake has already eaten enough food to be as long as the board is high , 11 segments , and that the snake is currently moving upward with its head at position ( 2,10 ) of the board :
While it is clear that by repeatedly following this pattern the snake will continually trace the whole board , causing it to eat at least one piece of food on each pass of the board , there is one notable exception from the pattern that is made whenever the food is in the top row of the board and the snake is moving upward toward it .
In this rare case , when step 2 of the pattern is reached , rather than turning right , the snake will continue forward to eat the food , as noted with a " 9 " in the function tree .
When this case occurs the snake will resume the pattern to the right following its consumption of the food .
If , however , this case occurs too far to the right and the snake 's body is long enough , the snake can trap itself on the right side of the board , causing it to die .
This is the only way that the way that the individual shown above will not successfully eat 211 pieces of food . [ size = " 5 " ]
This paper has presented the development and evaluation of a function set capable of evolving an optimal solution to the snake game .
An initial function set was presented and evaluated , but proved unsuccessful at evolving an optimal solution .
The initial function set was then expanded upon to create the successful final function set , and consistently optimal solutions were generated using primed GP runs .
A comparison was made of the results achieved by each function set , as well as by the primed GP runs .
Examples of commonly evolved strategies were presented and evaluated , and a final analysis of a consistently successful optimal solution was given . [ size = " 5 " ]
The work presented in this paper provides innumerable opportunities for further investigation into the evolution of a task prioritization scheme within a dynamically changing , randomly updated environment .
Specific to the snake problem , modifications can be made to create completely new and interesting problems , such as a non-rectangular game board , obstacles within the game board , or multiple pieces of food .
Multiple snakes could be co-evolved to competitively pursue the food .
The function set could be modified to feature enhanced detection capabilities and more advanced navigational options .
The techniques used for navigating the snake could be generalized to apply to various other problems of interest .
Possibilities include automated navigation of multiple robots through a crowded workspace , an automaton for tracking fleeing police suspects through harsh environments , or a control scheme for an exploratory vehicle seeking a particular goal on a harsh alien planet .
The possibilities are only limited by the imagination .[ size = " 5 " ] Koza , John R. 1992 .

As a BBC report notes , at least some of the Mumbai attackers were not Indian and certainly not Muslim .
Pappu Mishra , a cafe proprietor at the gothic Victorian Chattrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station , described “ two sprightly young men dressed in black ” with AK47s who were “ foreign looking , fair skinned . ”
Gaffar Abdul Amir , an Iraqi tourist from Baghdad , saw at least two men who started the firing outside the Leopold Cafe .
“ They did not look Indian , they looked foreign .
One of them , I thought , had blonde hair .
The other had a punkish hairstyle .
They were neatly dressed , ” Amir told the BBC .
Other “ men walked into the cafe , drank beer , settled their bills and walked out .
Then they fished out guns from their bags and began firing . ”
Muslims do not drink alcohol , that is unless they are Muslims like Marwan Al - Shehhi and Mohamed Atta , who reportedly not only liked to drink but enjoyed lap dances by topless dancers as well before they supposedly hijacked planes and flew them into buildings .
Even though these firsthand accounts indicate the attackers were white , drank alcohol and displayed the steely and professional reserve of trained military men , the emerging story carried by the corporate media blames the attacks on al - Qaeda and specifically Lashkar - e - Taiba , one Arab and the other Asian .
“ A terrorist group with training camps in Pakistan and strong ties with al - Qaeda as well as a history of mounting attacks in India yesterday became the chief suspect behind the atrocities , ” reports the Times Online , pointing to Lashkar - e - Taiba .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
As the Times Online admits , Lashkar - e - Taiba is a creation of Pakistan ’s Inter - Services Intelligence , or ISI .
It “ receives considerable financial , material and other forms of assistance from the Pakistan government , routed primarily through the ISI .
The ISI is the main source of LeT ’s funding .
Saudi Arabia also provides funds , ” explains the South Asia Terrorism Portal .
Lashkar - e- Taiba “ also played a part in the ISI organized ‘ Bosnian campaign against the Serbs , ’ which was directed above the ISI by the CIA and British intelligence . ”
According to Andrew G. Marshall , the ISI “ has long been referred to as Pakistan ’s ‘ secret government ’ or ‘ shadow state . ’
It ’s long - standing ties and reliance upon American and British intelligence have not let up , therefore actions taken by the ISI should be viewed in the context of being a Central Asian outpost of Anglo - American covert intelligence operations . ”
The presence of “ foreign looking , fair skinned ” commandos who calmly gunned down dozens of people after drinking a few beers indicates that the Mumbai attacks were likely the work of the Anglo - American covert intelligence operatives , not indigenous Indian Muslims or for that matter Arab al - Qaeda terrorists .
The attacks prepare the ground for the break - up of Pakistan and the furtherance of destabilizing terrorism in the Middle East and Asia .
The Mumbai attacks had little to do with India or the relationship between Muslim Pakistanis and Hindu Indians .
“ Pakistan ’s position as a strategic focal point cannot be underestimated .
It borders India , Afghanistan , China and Iran , ” concludes Marshall .
“ Destabilizing and ultimately breaking Pakistan up into several countries or regions will naturally spread chaos and destabilization into neighboring countries .
This is also true of Iraq on the other side of Iran , as the Anglo - American have undertaken , primarily through Iraq , a strategy of balkanizing the entire Middle East in a new imperial project . ”
( See Marshall ’s Divide and Conquer : The Anglo - American Imperial Project . )
It is no mistake , as well , that Barack Obama has called for action against Pakistan .
“ If we have actionable intelligence about high - value terrorist targets and President Musharraf wo n’t act , we will , ” Obama said last August .
Regardless of who occupies the White House , the global elite are determined to continue their agenda of violence and murder in order to realize order through chaos .
Obama and the Democrats will spend the next four years blaming George W. Bush for what the neocons have done while making sure the same destructive policies remain in effect .
It is a shell game .
George Bush and Barack Obama control nothing , they are little more than front men for the New World Order .

JUDGE RICHARD LEON just got the kind of lesson you can't learn in law school .
At least not if you want a Bush appointment .
Last seen denying Guantánamo
Bay inmates the right to challenge their detainments , Mr Leon was over - ruled by the Supreme Court .
Today Mr Leon ruled that five of six detainees exercising their restored habeas corpus rights were detained without merit .
He ordered the men freed " forthwith " .
Demonstrating that justice remains free of fear or favor , Mr Leon then asked the government to waive its right to appeal .
The lesson , and hopefully all those who might need it are already seated on the federal bench , is that habeas is the foundation of justice precisely because the executive branch should never be trusted .
These men spent nearly seven years imprisoned ( and were mentioned during George Bush 's 2002 state - of - the - union address ) based on the strength of a rumour .
Since that time , the administration blocked their release with iterative ridiculous legal arguments , including the one Judge Leon originally upheld .
At least he finally faced up to the truth .
The New York Timesreports that some consider an appeal likely .

A sad , if familiar tale .
But that begs the question : what about Saints Row 2 ?

WASHINGTON , Nov. 30 ( UPI ) --
Top healthcare executives say the U.S. medical system is wasteful , inefficient and not giving people their money 's worth .
" We 're not getting what we pay for , " said Denis Cortese , president and chief executive of the Mayo Clinic .
" It 's just that simple . "

Cortese and other healthcare executives estimate as much as half of the $ 2.3 trillion spent annually on medical care does nothing to improve health , The Washington Post reported Sunday .
An improved healthcare system would revolve around paying for results , which means managing chronic illnesses better , realigning financial incentives to reward success , encouraging disease prevention and rejecting costly , unproven therapies , healthcare providers told the post .
The United States devotes 16 percent of its gross domestic product to medical care -- more per capita than any other nation -- yet ranks
29th in infant mortality and 48th in life expectancy among industrialized nations , the Post reported .
Daniel Murray , who had n't made a field goal since the season opener , hit a 31 - yarder with a second left and the Hawkeyes rallied to stun the third - ranked Nittany Lions 24 - 23 .
All that talk about an unbeaten Penn State possibly being left out of the BCS national title game turned out to be premature .
A third championship for the 81 - year - old Paterno , who 's had four unbeaten teams not win titles , is a long shot now .
Shonn Greene rushed for 117 yards and two touchdowns , and Ricky Stanzi bounced back from an interception and a fumble to lead the Hawkeyes ( 6 - 4 , 3 - 3 Big Ten ) on their game - winning drive , which came after Daryll Clark threw just his third interception of the season .
Murray had lost the regular field - goal duties to freshman Trent Mossbrucker and was relegated to kickoffs .
But with the winds swirling and strong , coach Kirk Ferentz opted for experience and Murray 's strong leg .
He drilled it down the middle , sending Iowa 's freezing fans spilling onto the field .
" I 've always dreamed about it , " said Murray , who grew up in Iowa City .
" I kept hoping and hoping I 'd get my chance . "
The Nittany Lions were third behind Alabama and Texas Tech in the last Bowl Championship Series standings .
They 'll drop Sunday .
The Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl berth are the Nittany Lions ' main goals now .
" We need to keep our heads up .
We can still have a heck of a year , " said Paterno , who again coached from the press box and got around with a cane because of a sore leg and hip .
Iowa was down 23 - 14 heading into the fourth quarter .
But Greene scored his second TD , from 6 yards out , to make it 23 - 21 with 9:20 left .
On the next possession , Penn State looked as if it got a break , when Iowa was called for a roughing the punter penalty that had the Hawkeyes seething .
The Nittany Lions kept the ball and continued its time - consuming march .
But Clark made an errant throw down the middle that was picked off by Tyler Sash , who returned to Iowa 's 29 with 3:46 left .
Iowa then caught another break when Penn State was flagged for pass interference on third down , getting the Hawkeyes near midfield with a first down .
Stanzi , who was 15 - of - 25 passing for 171 yards , hit Derrell Johnson - Koulianos at the Penn State 15 with 18 seconds left to set up Murray 's kick .
" I want to apologize to the whole Penn State nation for my game play today , " Clark said .
" I just keep having that turnover recurring in my head over and over .
I can't get it out of my mind . "
This was the biggest win for Iowa in years , its first against a top - five team since 1990 .
The Hawkeyes suffered through two seasons of mediocrity after finishing No. 8 in the country three years in a row .
The Hawkeyes had lost four games this season by a total of 12 points -- and they got beat last week by Illinois on a 46 - yard field goal with 24 seconds left .
" We knew we had enough to win , " Iowa linebacker A.J. Edds .
" But there were n't a whole lot of people on the outside that thought we were the kind of team we know we are .
We showed that today . "
Clark was 9 - of - 23 for 86 yards and Derrick Williams and Evan Royster each ran for touchdowns to lead Penn State ( 9 - 1 , 5 - 1 ) , which had to settle for Kevin Kelly 's field goals on three different trips inside Iowa 's 20 .
On a day where the wind chill dipped into the 20s , Penn State held the ball for nearly 36 minutes and ran almost twice as much as they threw it .
It worked for the first three quarters .
Penn State 's Tyrell Sales picked off Stanzi on the opening drive of the third quarter , and Kelly 's 25 - yard field goal put the Nittany Lions ahead 16 - 7 .
Iowa 's offense finally woke up , reeling off a 73 - yard drive that Stanzi capped by finding a wide - open Johnson - Koulianos for a 27 - yard touchdown pass to pull the Hawkeyes within 16 - 14 with 4:43 left in the third .
But Stanzi fumbled away the ball and Iowa 's momentum just two minutes later , giving Penn State the ball deep in Iowa territory after botching the snap .
The Nittany Lions wasted little time turning Stanzi's mistake into points , as Williams ' 9 - yard touchdown run put Penn State back up 23 - 14 heading into the fourth .
Penn State held the ball for an astounding 23:34 and outgained Iowa 203- 70 in the first half .
But the Hawkeyes forced a pair of red - zone field goals , keeping Penn State 's lead at 13 - 7 .
After falling behind 7 - 0 early in the first quarter , the Nittany Lions put together scoring drives of 71 , 75 and 78 yards -- all powered by the running game .
They had to settle for 24 - yard field goal by Kelly on the first one , but Royster ran for a 2 - yard score to give Penn State a 10 - 7 lead early in the second quarter .
Kelly drilled a 31 - yarder into the with 55 seconds left in the first half .
Iowa forced Clark to fumble on the game 's opening drive , but the officials said he got it back it at the Penn State 1 .
The Hawkeyes thought they had recovered the ball in the end zone , but they had to settle for a Nittany Lions punt and a short field .
Greene -- with Iowa 's student section decked out in green shirts in honor of the nation 's third - leading rusher -- made Penn State pay just two plays later , scoring on a 14 - yard touchdown run that put Iowa ahead 7- 0 .
The Nittany Lions were shooting for their first 10 - 0 start since 1994 -- incidentally , the last time Penn State went undefeated but did n't win it all -- but with home games against Indiana and Michigan State left , a Big Ten title is still Penn State 's to lose .
" Their balloon still is n't busted , " Paterno said .
" If we win the next two we 'll have an opportunity to go to a big bowl . "

Out on the far - east edge of Contra Costa County , a sprawling icon of national history could soon rot away into oblivion unless an East Bay developer is able to pull off his $ 150 million dream of restoration .
It 's called the Byron Hot Springs Hotel .
A century ago , it was one of California 's premier playlands of the rich and famous , a spa resort set amid 57 natural hot springs that bubbled at more than 100 degrees .
It had tennis courts , one of the first golf courses to be built on the West Coast , and a five - star hotel designed by the architects of San Francisco 's Fairmont and Cliff House .
Its luxury rooms drew glitterati ranging from actors Clark Gable and Mae West to author Jack London and baseball slugger Joe DiMaggio .
Decades later , during World War II , the U.S. Army used the resort as a top - secret interrogation center for prisoners of war - one of only two such interrogation centers in the nation , the other being in Virginia .
In a novel experiment , guards let the mostly Japanese inmates soak in the spas and party in the swank rooms - and then clandestinely recorded their relaxed conversations , gleaning what Army researchers now say were important tips about enemy operations in the Pacific .
After the war , the resort slipped into decline as other areas of the Bay Area boomed and drew tourists away .
It had moments of resurgence , such as a stretch as a religious retreat in the 1950s and a 1970s visit from renegade author and Merry Prankster Ken Kesey , but by the 1980s it was shuttered for good .
Today , if you stand on a hill overlooking the old resort on the edge of the tiny town of Byron , you can still tell this was once a special place .
The magnificent , and intact , shell of the brick - walled hotel sits serenely amid more than 300 palm and olive trees , placid grasslands spread around it for 161 acres - and if you squint , it looks as if it 's ready for business .
Saving structures
East Bay Associates developer David Fowler says he would like to make that squinting impression come to life .
It wo n't be easy .
The remaining buildings need gutting and restoring , the walls that are left are splattered with graffiti , and several historic structures have been burned in recent years by partiers who left empty beer cans among the ashes .
A few more years of intense vandalism , combined with the ravages of time and weather , and it may be too late to do anything in quite the same way , Fowler said .
But like a proud papa who can see no wrong in his child , Fowler professes nothing but optimism .
" Just look at this place , " he said , standing in front of the hotel one recent morning , spreading his arms to take in the building , the nearby spring wells , and a grove of towering palms .
" It has history , beauty and romance .
If I do a primo job , people will come . "
Fowler is about to submit building plans to Contra Costa County planners , and if approved , he intends to begin work on his project early next year .
He says he has loans and potential investors lined up , and by 2011 he expects to have pumped $ 150 million into making Byron Hot Springs a premier tourist destination .

His plan is to rehab the existing brick hotel ( a stately Victorian wonder styled after the Fairmont ) , open up several of the hot springs for soaking , install a high - end restaurant , and - perhaps most ambitious of all - reconstruct a version of a second hotel that burned down in 1912 .
That hotel , a twin - towered Moorish castle of sorts , and the mini-Fairmont were both designed by the famous Reid brothers , James and Merritt , and the architecture alone helped earn Byron Hot Springs a place years ago on the state historic resources list .
Fowler , who builds custom homes , bought the resort property in 1989 for $ 1.5 million , and has been lining up plans and investors ever since .
He submitted an early version of his plan last spring to the county , and was told to come back with more detail .
This time he thinks he has it nailed .
County planners would be happy if he does .
" The county plan does encourage restoration of the historic use of that hotel , " said Robert Drake , principal county planner .
" And there 's no question - there 's some real history there .
We just need to make sure that some of the basic public health , safety , welfare and building issues are addressed before such a project can go through . "
For Contra Costa County historian Carol Jensen , author of " Byron Hot Springs , " seeing the resort come back to life would be " absolutely amazing . "
" Look , back when it was a luxury resort , people came from all over the nation to stay there , " she said .
" It was called the ' Carlsbad of America , ' ( a riff on the centuries - old spa in the Czech Republic ) .
There was just nothing like it in all the West . "
Just as important as the playland aspect , though , is the resort 's place in military history .
From 1943 to 1945 , more than 3,500 high - ranking Japanese POWs were sent there , along with hundreds of German and Italians .
The resort had already begun to fade by the start of World War II , so the owner at the time , Mae Mead , was only too happy to lease it to the Army .
Interrogation center
The Army , according to Maj .
Alex Corbin , who conducted a history study of the camp earlier this year , had decided it would try kindness instead of harshness to get information from the prisoners .
Byron fit the bill perfectly , Corbin wrote .
The Army dubbed the prison Camp Tracy , and kept its true nature hidden from the community .
Guards installed secret microphones all over the resort , and by listening they managed to glean valuable information about Japanese biological weapons , the location of ships and munitions plants , and code names for some Japanese Army units .
" Nobody even knew what was going on there until years later , " said Jensen .
" But it 's an incredibly important part of history . "
The National Park Service last year began compiling an oral history on Camp Tracy and Fort Hunt in Virginia , the only other World War II interrogation center in the United States .
And on Nov. 16 , a Japanese documentary made last year about the center , " Camp Tracy , " will make its American premier with a showing at the Delta Theater in nearby Brentwood .
Fowler hopes the surge in historical interest will help his cause .
And if he rebuilds , he plans to install a little museum of sorts honoring the resort 's past .
" This place is the big daddy of historical restorations , " he said .
" By the time I 'm done , it should feel when you come here like you are going all the way back to 1900 . "

SPRINGFIELD -
The bishop of a predominantly black Tinkham Road church , destroyed by a suspicious fire Wednesday morning , said , " It gives every appearance of being a deliberate act or hate crime . "
Federal investigators were at the scene of the ruined church which was still under construction at 215 Tinkham Road , Springfield Fire Department spokesman Dennis G. Leger said .
It was to be the new home of the Macedonia Church of God in Christ .
The fire loss is estimated at $ 2 million , Leger said .
" This is big .
This is huge , " a neighbor , Michael R. Caron , of Fox Wood Drive said .
" This is like Springfield , Miss. , here . "
Bishop Bryant Robinson , speaking from the fire scene , said parishioners are " in shock and disbelief that somebody would do that .
Particularly when the church is not doing any harm to anybody and trying to help people . "
The suspicious fire started hours after Barack Obama made history as the nation 's first black president - elect .
" There is a symmetry , " Robinson said of the joy following Obama 's win and the horrific loss that quickly followed .
Caron , whose house is adjacent to the church property , was awakened by the blaze .
" It was kind of a surreal thing , " he said .
He said he woke up out of a sound sleep and immediately saw smoke .
" At first , I thought the grass was burning , " he said .
Then , he thought to himself , " Oh it did n't get the church . "
But when he walked across the street , he found out otherwise .
" I could see fire through the church and I knew it was bad , " he said .
Robinson said the church will rebuild .
" Our belief in God will sustain us .
...
Our faith is of such quality and maturity that we will be building . "
Robinson said .
A church member , Martha C. Ortiz , of Westfield , a photographer who has been documenting construction of the church on camera , called the blaze " really , really devastating .
" Everybody is supporting each other and supporting our pastor , " she said .
" Faithwise , it is going to bring us together and make us stronger .
Faith is everlasting and God will take care of us , " she said .
The church 's current home is 201 King St .
The fire was reported shortly after 3:10 a.m. , Leger said .
Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives were at the scene Wednesday morning , Leger said .
State troopers attached to the state fire marshal 's office and the Springfield arson and bomb squad are also investigating , Leger said .
The large structure , about 90 percent complete , was fully involved in flames when firefighters arrived shortly after 3:15 a.m. , Leger said .
The fire scene commander , Springfield District Chief Joseph Contant , ordered an exterior attack only due to the intense flames and fear that the building would collapse due to its truss construction
" Nobody was allowed into the building , " Leger said .
Three firefighters , including Contant , Roland Dupre and Anthony Santaniello , suffered minor injuries , Leger said .
The fact that the building was vacant , yet to be occupied , is cause for suspicion , Leger said .
" Any vacant building is suspicious until proven otherwise , " he said .
" It 's awful , really , " Caron said .
" This is an absolutely tranquil neighborhood .
I do n't know what to say .
We are devastated . "
Yellow police tape was draped around the church and what appear to be two private homes Wednesday morning .
Last year , arson destroyed a 130 - unit retirement complex , also under construction , off Parker Street in East Longmeadow .
The Bluebird Estates fire , which happened on Sept. 26 , 2007 , was started when someone poured gasoline throughout the multi-million dollar facility and set it ablaze .
Three melted gasoline containers were found in the ruins , and accelerant - sniffing dogs found traces of gasoline at several locations , officials said .
Robinson said in the larger scheme of things he is still " somewhat proud of the country . "
The coming transfer of power to a new administration and party is " one of the few places on the globe where we do this in some kind of a regular basis without havoc being unleashed on people , " Bryant said .
" We are also mindful ( that ) in the fabric of our nation there are people who hate people , who are racist people , people who did n't vote for Obama just because he was an African - American . "
More details in The Republican tomorrow .

From FreeThoughtPedia
The Mormons , or the Church of Jesus of Latter - Day Saints is a sect of Christianity formed in the early - to - mid 1800s in North America .
Mormons believe that around 1830 , Joseph Smith was given gold plates by God and translated them into the Book of Mormon .
God told Smith personally that all other churches are an abomination to Him and in apostasy .
Or so Smith claimed .
Smith began practicing polygamy on the sly .
He married over 30 women , including a couple of 14 year olds .
When he died , the church was taken over by Brigham Young , who moved them all to the Utah territory because the polygamy was getting them in a lot of trouble .
They stopped the approving polygamous marriage in 1890 .
The religion is based around the Book of Mormon .
The problem is that the Book of Mormon is supposed to be a history of early America , and it is obvious when you read it that it is just a fantasy written before we knew much about the Native Americans ' history .
In reality , before becoming LDS founder , Joseph Smith was a con man who had been in court three times for various schemes including involving digging for " treasure " .
He 'd approach farmers with a " treasure map " and them to pay him and promise them gold .
He also started an illegal bank that fleeced his followers , and he destroyed a newspaper that was about to expose his polygamy .
He just was n't a very nice man , and seems an unlikely candidate for a prophet .
Ironically , Smith was murdered by a mob of his own followers after he was thrown in jail after his polygamist activity came to light .
He had been sleeping with his own followers ' wives on the side , telling the women that God told him to do this and they should n't mention it to their husbands .
The LDS theology is hodge podge of masonry , Campbellites , Swedenborg and more .
They have a lot of temple rituals from masonry .
They will baptize you Mormon by proxy after you are dead , for example .
They believe if worthy enough , they will become gods after death .
The church believes they are headed at all times by a current living prophet and seer , and the members are taught to obey the prophet .
The LDS puts a lot of emphasis on family , although in Utah where they have the highest density among the population , there is also some of the highest prescription rates of giving children mood - altering drugs like Ritalin and Prozac .
Scandals involving the Church of Latter - Day Saints ( Mormons )
The Book of Abraham
The Book of Abraham is believed by Mormons to be the handwritten account of the prophet Abraham .
In 1835 Smith was able to use his “ Angel - given ” tools to translate some Egyptian scrolls that he was given access to ( at that time no one could read hieroglyphics ) .
Upon inspection , Smith declared that they contained the Book of Abraham .
He promptly translated the lot and it was accepted as scripture by the church ( it is included as part of the Pearl of Great Price ) .
The scrolls vanished and everyone thought the story would end there .
But it did n’t - in 1966 the original scrolls were found in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art .
The scrolls turned out to be a standard Egyptian text that was often buried with the dead .
This fraud caused a number of mormons to leave the church and is still a hotly debated topic amongst mormons and their critics .
Mountain Meadows Massacre
The Mountain Meadows massacre was a mass killing of the Fancher - Baker wagon train at Mountain Meadows in Utah Territory on September 11 , 1857 , by a group of Mormons and Paiute Indians .
The Arkansas emigrants were traveling to California shortly before Utah War started .
Mormons throughout the Utah Territory had been mustered to fight the invading United States Army , which they believed was intended to destroy them as a people .
Initially intending to orchestrate an Indian massacre , [ citation needed ] two men with leadership roles in local military , church and government organizations , Isaac C. Haight and John D. Lee , conspired for Lee to lead militiamen disguised as Native Americans along with a contingent of Paiute tribesmen in an attack .
The emigrants fought back and a siege ensued .
Intending to leave no witnesses of Mormon complicity in the siege and avoid reprisals complicating the Utah War , militiamen induced the emigrants to surrender and give up their weapons .
After escorting the emigrants out of their fortification , the militiamen and their tribesmen auxiliaries executed approximately 120 men , women and children . [ 1 ]
Joseph Smith's 33 Wives
While the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints officially condemns polygamy , its founder was quite the ladies ' man .
Historians widely agree that Joseph Smith Jr. taught and practiced polygamy .
This position is supported by " sealing " records , public marriage licenses ( in many cases notarized ) , affidavits , letters , journals and diaries .
The church even publishes Joseph Smith 's geneaology to back it up .
Established Brothels to Catch Gentile Public Officials
While the federal government was investigating Mormon leaders practice of polygamy , the church hatched a plot to catch these officials using brothels .
Brothels were established in 1885 and invitations were sent to government officials .
When the plot was discovered the brothels were closed and the women sent out of the territory . [ 2 ]
Posthumous baptism of Holocaust victims
In 1995 it came to light that the Mormon church had been posthumously baptizing Jews killed during the holocaust .
This outraged the Jewish community .
It was agreed the LDS church would cease such activities , but again in 2002 , evidence came to light indicating the church was still practicing these baptisms of deceased people of other faiths .
False claims on the origins of Native Americans
For 175 years the leaders and general membership of the Mormon Church have believed American Indians and Polynesians are descended from Israelites based on their understanding of the Book of Mormon .
We now know conclusively , from DNA studies that the ancestors of these native peoples were essentially all derived from Asia , not the Middle East , contradicting claims made by Joseph Smith / The Book of Mormon . [ 3 ]
The Book of Mormon is later edited to whitewash the conflict with science
An introductory paragraph added to the Book of Mormon in the 1981 revision states in part : " After thousands of years , all were destroyed except the Lamanites , and they are the principal ancestors of the American Indians . "
That addition from 1981 was changed in a 2006 edition , that stated only that " the Lamanites ... are among the ancestors of the American Indians . "
This change , church leaders said , was in harmony with the claims of the Book of Mormon itself , and what some Latter - day Saints had long perceived .
Joseph Fielding Smith ( presiding patriarch 's homosexual affair covered up by the church )
Joseph Fielding Smith ( 30 January 1899 – 29 August 1964 ) was presiding patriarch and a general authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS Church ) from 1942 until 1946 .
At the age of 43 , Smith was ordained a high priest and Patriarch to the Church on 8 October 1942 by Church President Heber J. Grant .
He served but four years before it was reported by the church that he had requested to be released from his position .
His request was granted by Church President George Albert Smith on 6 October 1946 , with the church announcing that Smith was released for reasons of " ill health . " [ 4 ]
After Smith 's death it was discovered that the patriarch had been involved in a homosexual affair with a 21 - year - old U.S. Navy sailor , who was also a Latter - day Saint . [ 5 ]
Joesph Smith admitted he was a fraud
Smith once broke down and admitted he was a fraud
Testimony of Smith family neighbor and friend of Joseph Smith :
“ In the month of August , 1827 , I was hired by Joseph Smith , Jr. to go to Pennsylvania , to move his wife ’s household furniture up to Manchester , where his wife then was . ”
“ When we arrived at Mr. Hale ’s , in Harmony , Pa. from which place he had taken his wife , a scene presented itself , truly affecting .
His father - in - law ( Mr. Hale ) addressed Joseph , in a flood of tears : “ You have stolen my daughter and married her .
I had much rather have followed her to her grave .
You spend your time in digging for money — pretend to see in a stone , and thus try to deceive people . ” "
“ Joseph wept , and acknowledged he could not see in a stone now , nor never could ; and that his former pretensions in that respect , were all false .
He then promised to give up his old habits of digging for money and looking into stones . ”
“ Joseph told me on his return , that he intended to keep the promise which he had made to his father - in - law ; “ but , ” said he , “ it will be hard for me , for they will all oppose , as they want me to look in the stone for them to dig money . ”
And in fact it was as he predicted .
They urged him , day after day , to resume his old practice of looking in the stone . ” [ 6 ]
Isaac Hale , Joseph Smith ’s father - in - law separately testified :
“ Emma wrote to me inquiring whether she could have her property , consisting of clothing , furniture , cows , etc .
I replied that her property was safe , and at her disposal .
In short time they returned , bringing with them a Peter Ingersol , and subsequently came to the conclusion that they would move out , and resided upon a place near my residence . ”
“ Smith stated to me , that he had given up what he called “ glass - looking , ” and that he expected to work hard for a living , and was willing to do so . ” [ 7 ]
Watered - down version found in the Official History of the Church :
“ Joseph secured the services of a neighbor , Peter Ingersoll , to assist and accompany him in acquiring Emma ’s property .
In August 1827 , eight months after their marriage , Joseph and Emma returned with Ingersol to face Isaac .
Ingersol reported that Isaac exclaimed in a flood of tears ,
You have stolen my daughter and married her .
I had much rather have followed her to her grave .
You spend your time digging for money –pretend to see in a stone , and thus try to deceive people . ”
“ Yet on that visit there was an attempt to reconcile Joseph and his father - in - law , for an invitation was extended to Joseph and Emma to make their home in Harmony .
Isaac , with evident paternal concern and with some compassion , indicated to Joseph that if he would move to Pennsylvania and work , giving up “ his old practice of looking in the stone , ” Isaac would assist him in getting into business .
Isaac claims , “ Smith stated to me he had given up what he called `glass - looking , ’ and that he expected and was willing to work hard for a living . ” " [ 8 ]
In response to denials of Joseph Smith ’s confession , Randy Jordan explains :
Mormon apologists saying that Ingersoll was an “ aggrieved former neighbor of the Smiths ” has no foundation in truth .
Ingersoll ’s attitude when swearing his affidavit was more of bemusement than bitterness over the way Smith transformed himself from a poor - man ’s fortune - teller to a Biblical - style “ prophet . ”
Mormon apologist allegations that Hurlbut gathered his affidavits with “ malicious intent ” is moot because of the fact that the affidavits were sworn before justices of the peace , and the testators were legally responsible for their statements .
Ingersoll ’s account of the confrontation between Smith and Isaac Hale is corroborated by Hale ’s own affidavit .
Also ,
Hale swore his affidavit at Harmony , Pennsylvania , and Ingersoll swore his at Manchester , NY ( where he lived , some 80 miles away . )
Mormon apologists cannot claim that the two affidavits were contaminated by the “ malicious ” Hurlbut , because Hurlbut never went to Harmony and never met Hale .
But because they were sworn independently of each other , and yet corroborate each other , they are highly credible .
Ingersoll ’s , Hale ’s , and numerous other affidavits from Smith ’s 1820 ’s acquaintances were published in Eber D. Howe ’s 1834 “ Mormonism Unveiled ” [ 9 ]
Ingersoll ’s affidavit was quoted in the Official History of the Church .
In addition to that , both Ingersoll ’s and Hale ’s affidavits were quoted in the February 2001 “ Ensign ” magazine , in an article dealing with Smith ’s Pennsylvania experiences .
( Read the article at www.lds.org.)
Although the “ Ensign ” article is careful to not quote the parts of those affidavits telling of Smith ’s “ glass - looking ” or his admission of fraud , the very fact that church apologists use those affidavits as credible historical sources negate any attempts to wholesale dismiss them as unreliable ( in other words , “ cherry - picking ” . )
Therefore , when Mormon apologists opinion that the affidavits have been “ discredited at worst , not taken seriously at best , ” perhaps the should tell that to the GAs and scholars who approve material for publication in the “ Ensign . ”
While Mormon apologists contend that Smith never outright admitted his fraud , or at least argue that that admission came via the hearsay testimony of Ingersoll , Hale , etc. , the fact that Smith ’s “ peep - stoning ” was a fraud is evidenced by the fact that Smith never found any buried treasures or anything else of value .
Also , another instance of Smith ’s admission of fraud is the account of his 1826 “ glass - looking ” trial at Bainbridge , where he admitted that his activity was a fraud , expressed contrition , and promised the judge to cease the activity — and yet , a mere 2 years later , he was claiming to translate the “ golden plates ” with the same “ peep - stone in the hat ” business he had used in his glass - looking scam , according to eyewitnesses such as Emma Smith , David Whitmer , and Joseph Knight . [ 10 ]
For decades , Mormon apologists have attempted to discredit the numerous affidavits concerning Smith ’s 1820 ’s peep - stoning and money - digging activities by attacking Hurlbut or Howe ’s motives or character — opining that Hurlbut “ invented ” the affidavits or “ coached ” the testators .
However , that argument is negated by the fact that Hurlbut never even joined the Mormonite church until March 1833 , in Ohio , and he did n’t travel to NY to interview Smith ’s acquaintances until the following November .
The reason that ’s relevant is that many , many accounts of Smith ’s peep - stoning , money - digging , occult activities , and details of how he produced his “ Gold Bible ” had been published by 1830 - 31 , before Hurlbut or Howe were even factors in history .
Mormon hypocrisy on the stance of marriage
" The ancient order of marriage is the divinely sanctioned union , recognized by the state , between one man and one woman . "
" We follow Jesus Christ by adhering to God 's law of marriage , which is marriage between one man and one woman .
This commandment has been in place from the very beginning . "
- Mormon Apostle Dallin H. Oaks
EXCEPT , if you are the Patriarch , Abraham , in which case you can be married to Sarah ( who might be your half - sister ) , and to Sarah 's slave girl , Hagar .
The ancient order of marriage is pretty liberal when it comes to marrying siblings , cousins and slaves .
EXCEPT , if you are Kind David or King Solomon , in which case you might have as many as 300 wives and 300 additional concubines , and copulating with and siring children by slaves was perfectly acceptable , both in the eyes of your citizens , and in the eyes of God , who sanctioned the practice .
EXCEPT , if you are Jesus , and married to both Mary Magdalene and Elizabeth ( and likely others ) , according to previous Mormon Church prophets [ 11 ]
EXCEPT , if you are Mormon Church founder and prophet Joseph Smith , in which case you can secretly practice polygamy to girls as young as 14 [ 12 ] , and also be married to women who are already married to other men . [ 13 ]
The ancient order of marriage demands , however , that you do n't tell your first wife about all the others , because it makes her really mad .
For that matter , it 's best not to tell ANYONE except your good buddies , because then they might think twice about your apostolic calling .
EXCEPT , if you are Mormon Church Prophet Brigham Young , in which case you can have as many as 55 wives married to you in this life , and untold numbers sealed to you in the life hereafter .
It is also perfectly acceptable to divorce them if they do n't take care of themselves , or expect you to take care of them .
EXCEPT , if you are Mormon Church Apostles John Taylor , Lorenzo Snow , Wilford Woodruff , George Cannon , Heber Kimball , and on and on and on , in which case you can obtain a new wife every time your last wife gets worn out .
EXCEPT , if your wife died , and you 're a Mormon Church apostle , you can be sealed to another , much younger woman , so you 'll get both of 'em in the eternities .
( Dallin H. Oaks married June Dixon in 1952 , who passed away in 1998 .
In 2000 , he married Kristen McMain , both of whom are sealed to him for time and all eternity -- contrary to the " ancient order of marriage . " )
But other than THAT , the Mormons are absolutely correct in defending the " ancient order of marriage . "

Israel rejects black Hebrews as Jews
By : News
Date :
Scripps Howard News Service
DIMONA , Israel - In Chicago , kindergarten teacher Samaheyah Bat - Yisrael says her life was " desolation . "
But in this hardscrabble Negev desert town , she says she has found her " salvation . "
Resplendent in a blue African - style headdress , a flowing outfit to match and gold earrings , the beaming 44 - year - old Samaheyah - whose Hebrew name means " She who will make God happy " - is adamant about never returning to the crime - and drug - ridden South Side where she grew up .
" We were slaves there .
Here I know I 'm safe . "
Feeling safe may seem like an odd concept in conflict - driven Israel .
It may seem especially odd in Dimona - a town of about 30,000 people created in 1955 to accommodate new immigrants - which is now home to Israel 's only nuclear reactor .
But for the 2,000 - strong vegetarian and polygamous black Hebrew community , as they are widely known here , living in Israel is the fulfillment of a scriptural promise to create what they call the " Kingdom of Yah , " or God on earth .
Calling themselves the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem , their origins are rooted in their charismatic leader , Ben Ammi Ben Israel .
Ben Ammi , who was a foundry worker named Ben Carter in Chicago , had a vision in 1966 that his African ancestors were descended from one of the 10 lost tribes of Israel .
Since 30 disciples followed him to Israel in 1969 , the community has established many celebrated professional gospel choirs and R&B singing troupes , sent their Hebrew - speaking offspring to Israeli universities and even represented the country in the annual European - wide Eurovision Song Contest .
But last Jan. 17 , their connection to Israel took a tragic turn when the first black Hebrew born on Israeli soil was killed by a Palestinian gunman .
Singer Aharon Ben - Yisrael
Alis , 32 , was gunned down as he performed at a bar mitzvah in the northern city of Hadera .
Nonetheless , after 33 years of living and now dying alongside Israelis , the black Hebrews are still fighting to achieve a crucial long - standing goal - full Israeli citizenship , giving them such rights as voting and serving in the army .
" Our identity is here in Israel .
We are Hebrew Israelites , not Americans , and I think the Israeli government has n't known what to do with us , " said 44 - year - old Yaffa Bat - Gavriel , who was known as Freda Waller when she arrived here in 1976 . " . . .
This is our home .
We do n't have any other . "
Israeli authorities , however , disagree .
On several occasions , they have tried to expel the group , which has fought back by enlisting the help of prominent African American politicians and going on hunger strikes .
Israeli authorities reject the claims that the black Hebrews are authentic Jews , and have insisted in vain that they convert to Judaism so they can be recognized as full citizens .
The native - born members are as stateless as their immigrant parents and the grandchildren of the original founders might not even be eligible for U.S. citizenship .
The black Hebrews share many aspects of Judaism , including observing the Sabbath and rites of circumcision , instructing their children in Hebrew , celebrating Jewish holidays and studying the Torah , the book of Jewish laws .
But most Israelis find some of their other practices to be odd and contend they are a cult subservient to the whims of the 63 - year - old Ben Ammi .
" Just because you live by certain rules , it does not mean you are a cult , " Bat - Gavriel said .

Comment by Ayinde
White Jews migrate to all parts of the world and want equal rights but some people cannot have equal rights in Israel .
Most White Israelis are recent converts to ' Judaism ' so the argument in the article is to disguise racism .
This is institutional racism .
Israel is the only country on earth that gets widespread legitimacy while practicing apartheid .
Africans and Arabs who feel ties to Israel / Judaism are just as misinformed as most White Jew fundamentalists .
There is much more history with a richer legacy to build on than trying to fit into a ' culture ' that presently oppresses people .
But that is another story .

GM has been in talks with Cerberus about buying Chrysler since last month but the discussions have been snagged by difficulty in securing investment or financing at a time when credit is tight and global auto sales are in rapid retreat , others close to the talks have said .
A decision by the Bush administration to provide the government ’s first funding for the auto sector since the $ 1.5 billion bailout of Chrysler in 1980 has been widely seen as the merger ’s best chance for success .
“ The automakers are facing a maelstrom and that ’s why I think an unprecedented government infusion could happen , ” said Efraim Levy , an automotive equity analyst with S&P .
An injection of $ 3 billion in equity to support a GM acquisition of Chrysler would be roughly equivalent to the current , depressed value of the top U.S. automaker .

It would also give U.S. taxpayers a large stake in the turnaround of a struggling auto industry that employs more than 350,000 American workers and is credited with supporting employment for another 4.5 million in related fields .
Analysts perceive GM , Chrysler and rival Ford Motor Co F.N as driven to the brink of failure by a combination of management missteps , slowing global growth and problems in credit markets .
Now , in addition to taking a stake in what would be the world ’s largest automaker by volume , the U.S. government is also being asked to provide support by taking over some $ 3 billion in pension obligations , the first source said .
The final component of the proposed support would be a credit line that could include U.S. government purchases of commercial paper to relieve short - term pressure on liquidity , the person said .
GM could not immediately be reached for comment .
Cerberus and Chrysler had no comment .
TOO BIG TO FAIL ?
A combined GM - Chrysler would control roughly a third of the U.S. auto market by sales and would face immediate pressure to cut costs stemming from excess capacity in almost every facet of its business .
Those would include a stable of 11 brands , some 10,000 dealers and 97,000 union - represented factory workers .
But one of the conditions of a merger would be that GM - Chrysler spare as many jobs as possible to win broad political support for the government funding , people familiar with the merger discussions said .

Many analysts are skeptical that balance can be struck .
“ I still think they need to make deep cuts to survive , ” said IHS Global Insight analyst Aaron Bragman .
The roughly $ 10 billion in government funds to support a merger would be in addition to whatever funds would be allocated under an already - approved $ 25 billion program to provide low - interest loans to the auto industry for retooling to make more fuel - efficient cars .
A government rescue package would come at a time when investors and creditors are increasingly concerned about the ability of U.S. automakers to survive a punishing downturn in sales now expected to continue into 2010 .
" Nobody reasonable is going to tell you that next year we 're going to be out ( of this crisis ) , " Carlos Ghosn , head of Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Renault SA RENA .
PA , told a business seminar in Tokyo , adding the worst is yet to come .
Ghosn predicted U.S. auto sales would stay at an annualized rate of 12.5 million vehicles through March .
U.S. car sales slumped by 26 percent last month to that level .
Moody ’s Investors Service cut its GM rating on Monday deeper into junk territory on the view that GM ’s liquidity would continue to erode into 2009 .
The ratings agency also cut Chrysler for similar reasons and said it might cut Ford .
GM has a market capitalization of just over $ 3 billion based on Monday 's close and roughly $ 10 billion of outstanding debt .
Chrysler 's privately held auto operations were valued at zero last week by Daimler AG DAIGn .
DE , which holds the 19.9 percent of the struggling automaker not owned by Cerberus .
Chrysler ’s U.S. sales have tumbled by 25 percent this year , almost twice the rate of decline for the overall market .
GM ’s sales had dropped almost 18 percent through September .
GM ’s shares have slumped nearly 80 percent this year and its market value has dropped below what it was in 1929 .
Defying a trend toward baffling abstraction in movie titles  “ Synecdoche , New York ” ?
“ Quantum of Solace ” ?
“ The Secret Life of Bees ” ?  Kevin Smith has given his new opus a name that tells you exactly what it ’s about .
Literal - mindedness has always been among Mr. Smith ’s calling cards .
His first film , about clerks , was called “ Clerks . ”
And so it will hardly be shocking that “ Zack and Miri Make a Porno ” is about two people , named Zack ( Seth Rogen ) and Miri ( Elizabeth Banks ) , who make what my copy editors would prefer that I call a pornographic movie .
And really , in spite of an avalanche of verbal filth ( and a smaller quantum of the visual variety ) , “ Zack and Miri ” is not very shocking at all .
Mr. Smith has been tinkering with the dirty - mind / soft - heart combination for quite some time , forming a link of sorts between the humanist sexual anarchy of John Waters and the smutty Victorianism of Judd Apatow .
He and his characters revel in dialogue that riffs on body parts and bodily fluids , but Mr. Smith ’s stories are bathed  metaphorically !
 in syrup and schmaltz .
So “ Zack and Miri Make a Porno , ” in spite of its sometimes tiresome , sometimes amusing lewdness , follows a gee - whiz romantic - comedy formula that would not be out of place on the Disney Channel .
Two best friends who have always been in love with each other discover that ... they have always been in love with each other .
Granted , this revelation occurs while they are having sex in front of a camera , but it is so sweet and predictable that these potentially tawdry circumstances hardly matter .
Mr. Smith tries , with mixed results , both to rub our faces in the tawdriness and to erase it altogether .
The movie wants to insist that pornography is a jolly , innocuous pursuit , but also to take refuge in a sincere , romantic traditionalism that is antithetical to the cynical , often playful sexual ethos of pornography .
Mr. Smith is intent on making a love story , which is almost by definition the opposite of the kind of movie Zack and Miri set out to produce .
The Campanile Movie and The Matrix When I saw Debevec 's movie , I knew that was the path .
-- Visual Effects Supervisor John Gaeta , WIRED 11.05 .
Campanile project Master 's student George Borshukov was hired by Manex Entertainment where he and his colleagues applied the Campanile Movie 's virtual cinematography techniques to create some of the most memorable shots in the 1999 movie The Matrix .
Watch the backgrounds in the " bullet time " shots in the film ( see Quicktime movies of the principal bullet time shot and the trailer at The Matrix website ) to see how image - based modeling and rendering were used in the film .
Articles on this technique and others that gave the film its mind - blowing effects are in the April 1999 issue of American Cinematographer magazine , the October 1999 issue of Cinefex , and the August 1999 issue of SoftImage Magazine .
The techniques continued their use in films such as Mission Impossible II and The Matrix Reloaded .
The Matrix won the 1999 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects .
The visual effects supervisor was Campanile Movie fan John Gaeta ; the bullet time supervisor was Kim Libreri , and the director of research at Manex was Dan Piponi .

The G20 Summit faced a conundrum on Saturday : its members wanted to make sure credit is available to those who need it , while also making sure that banks would tighten their lending standards in order to avoid high - risk behavior .
The solution implicitly found is to continue carrying out easy monetary policy as well as designing a series of agreements that give the IMF , the Financial Stability Forum , and others a greater role .
The steps taken revolve mostly around greater transparency , adequate disclosure , capital requirements ( etc. ) , and give international bureaucrats more things to do .
The good news is that the world has been , so far , spared from Nicolas Sarkozy ’s idea of creating a new international structure of control of financial markets and the G20 members agreed to “ reject protectionism . ”
The bad news is that what has been decided will not fundamentally change the incentives in the system and will still leave the door open to bad policy in the future .
Gerald O’Driscoll has a very good Op - Ed today in the Wall Street Journal in which he addresses the current situation and offers commodity money as its best solution .
It may be the case that the opportunity to return to a commodity money system is now greater than one may believe .
Considering the type of solutions that the G20 summit delivered , it is thinkable that if some leader were to push for a return to gold in order to prevent future financial meltdowns , people would listen .
It would have to be done right of course , considering the mess that was done in the past with the various systems based on commodity money .
This would also be the opportunity to kill Keynes ’s unfortunate assessment of gold as commodity money , which has been in the minds of many for decades .
China to classify internet addiction as an official disorder
China has become the first country to classify internet addiction as a clinical disorder as growing numbers of people spend hours online every day .
Doctors in Beijing have released a diagnostic definition of the addiction amid increasing concern over psychological problems said to result from overuse of the internet .
According to the definition , based on a study of more than 1,300 problematic users , symptoms of the addiction include yearning to get back online , mental or physical distress , irritation and difficulty concentrating or sleeping .
China could become the first country in the world to officially recognise internet addiction as a clinical disease , as growing numbers of people spend hours of their time in chatrooms , blogging or playing online games
It classifies addicts as those who spend at least six hours online a day and have displayed at least one symptom on the last three months .
Tao Ran , who set up China 's first internet addiction clinic at the Military General Hospital in Beijing , told China Daily : ' Eighty per cent of addicts can be cured with treatment , which usually lasts about three months . '
Dr Tao wants the country to designate hospital psychiatric units specifically to treat such cases .
Beijing ’s Health Ministry is expected to adopt a new manual on internet addiction next year , which will recognise the condition as similar to compulsive gambling or alcoholism .
According to Chinese estimates , about 10 per cent of young users - or four million people - suffer from addiction and of those about 70 per cent are male .
The condition is often a symptom of deeper psychological problems , according to Dr Tao , and all child addicts have behavioural problems , which are then made worse by their addiction .
China has an online population of 253 million people - the world 's largest - which is growing rapidly as computer use rises with economic levels .
Dr Tao said he compared his data with that of experts in the United States , where internet addiction is not recognised as a disease .
Research by the internet media company InterActiveCorp revealed that 42 per cent of Chinese youngsters polled felt addicted to the internet , compared with just 18 per cent in the US .
Polls by the China Network Information Centre showed that nearly half of China ’s online population were aged between 18 and 30 .
Dr Tao 's clinic treats patients who may also suffer from depression , fear and an unwillingness to interact with others .
Many have sleep disorders , stop communicating with family or friends , and spend their days glued to a computer screen , in chat rooms or playing violent games .
During the therapy , Mr Tao , who built his career on treating heroin addicts , is said to offer addicts counselling , military discipline , hypnosis and mild electro - shock therapy to help them reform .
Unlike drugs , the internet does not create dependency , and Dr Tao places his success rate of curing patients at about 70 per cent .
He told The Times : ' The increase now is not as rapid as it was a few years ago .
However , this was the first such clinic in China when it opened in 2005 .
Now there are several hundred across the country . '

Democratic leaders are n’t expected to initiate a formal campaign , as former House Majority Whip Tom DeLay ( R - Texas ) did in the 1990s , to change the partisan bias in the top business lobbying shops .
K Street suffers election anxiety
Congressional Republicans are n’t the only ones bracing for big Election Night losses .
Their partisan brethren in the business trade associations and corporate offices are , too .
Almost all of those high - paying jobs are held by Republicans — former Capitol Hill staffers and White House aides — whose influence will be significantly diminished if Democrats take over the White House and extend their majorities in the House and Senate .
Advertisement
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , National Association of Manufacturers , National Association of Chain Stores , and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America are all led by Republicans .
And the list goes on and on .
The same red hue hangs over big corporate government affairs offices .
Disney , AT&T , Verizon , Visa , Time Warner , Pfizer , Lockheed Martin and BlueCross BlueShield all are paying big bucks to top lobbyists with ties to the GOP , which is expected to lose power Tuesday rather than gain it .
Is a K Street partisan bloodbath in the offing ?
That ’s what many Republicans expect , even if Democrats do n’t systematically go after their heads .
“ I think corporate America will be very risk averse on this stuff , ” said one Republican lobbyist .
“ They will try to do anything they can to avoid getting smacked .
I definitely think there will be some pressure .
They are a bunch of wussies . ”
Already , the signs of change are in the air .
Global financial giant Citigroup last week promoted Jimmy Ryan , former chief counsel to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , to senior vice president of federal government affairs .
He will co-direct the company ’s government affairs office with Heather Wingate , a former Bush White House adviser .
Also last week , Kerry Knott , a onetime top aide to former House Majority Leader Dick Armey ( R - Texas ) , was ousted as head of Comcast Corp . ’s government affairs office and replaced by Melissa Maxfield , who once worked for Tom Daschle , the former Senate Democratic leader who now advises presidential candidate Barack Obama .
Democratic leaders are n’t expected to initiate a formal campaign , as former House Majority Whip Tom DeLay ( R - Texas ) did in the 1990s , to change the partisan bias in the top business lobbying shops .
DeLay and former Sen. Rick Santorum ( R - Pa. ) openly pressured corporations and business trade groups to fire Democrats and replace them with Republicans in what was dubbed the K Street Project .
The sophisticated program included circulation around K Street of available Republican job candidates on the Hill and scorecards showing which firms were toeing the line and which ones were n’t .
DeLay ’s efforts paid off later when those former Republican aides gained control of big corporate and trade association political action committees and doled out donations to their old friends in Congress .
The former Hill aides also could galvanize the grass roots of the various trade groups to put pressure on members during legislative fights .
Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) vowed not to duplicate such a program when they gained control of Congress in 2006 .
And last year , they pushed through ethics reform that could punish members if they interfered with a lobbying shop ’s hiring practices .
It also required members and their senior staffers to disclose any job negotiations with K Street .
But that ’s not to say they are n’t willing to air their gripes about the continuing Republican dominance in the business lobby .
Last summer , Reid , Pelosi and others were furious when those organizations did not rally behind legislation that included popular tax extenders for industries .
New York Sen. Charles Schumer , who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , has recently criticized the Chamber for its multimillion - dollar ad campaign on behalf of Republican candidates .
Steve Elmendorf , a Democratic lobbyist who advised former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt ( D - Mo. ) , said that , despite the complaints , Democratic congressional leaders will be bound by their promise not to mimic DeLay ’s K Street Project .
“ You are going to see a shift over time , ” Elmendorf predicted .
“ When jobs open up , more Democrats will be hired . ”
“ If you want to make a strategic decision about how you are going to lobby the next Congress and White House , ” he added , “ you have to think about hiring Democrats . ”
One Republican lobbyist who heads a business trade group and asked to remain anonymous said the real game - changer for K Street could turn out to be the White House rather than shifts on Capitol Hill .
When Democrats regained control of the House and Senate in 2006 , many trade and corporate lobbyists kept their jobs because of their close ties to people inside the Bush administration .
An Obama presidency would give Democrats complete control and could make it harder for many Republican business advocates to justify their positions .
On the other hand , the lobbyist speculated that the diversity of the expanded Democratic caucuses on Capitol Hill may curb any K Street bloodlust among the Democratic leadership .
Many of the incoming House and Senate freshmen are expected to come from conservative and moderate districts , swelling the pro-business Blue Dog wing of the caucus rather than the traditional liberal base .
He recalled the arrival of President Bill Clinton in 1993 .
Rather than going after business , Clinton presented a moderate image and reached out to the corporate community .
Clinton ’s goal was to “ co- opt a portion of the business community ” through his positions on free trade and other issues , said this lobbyist .
And the strategy worked pretty effectively with global corporations .
But that might be a tougher pivot for Obama , who has promised to rewrite some of the Clinton trade deals to make them more labor and environmentally friendly .
Another Republican lobbyist sees what he hopes is a silver lining in a Democratic takeover : the need for a Republican lobbyist or two in corporate shops who are willing to stand up to the majorities on behalf of their clients .
In addition , one - party rule may also force the business community to conduct broader and more expensive lobbying campaigns to get their messages heard , the second lobbyist predicted .
“ These associations and firms are going to have to employ a different type of campaign to shape public opinion and move it on its side , ” the lobbyist said .
“ That will require paid advertising , earned media campaigns , grass roots .
“ It will require a whole different way of looking at how the lobbying game is played . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The man steering the Republican Party has said he 's concerned that Democrats may try unfairly to influence Minnesota 's Senate contest , which is headed toward a recount , and the Senate runoff battle in Georgia .
In a fundraising letter to supporters , Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan said that " the Obama - Biden Democrats and their liberal special interest allies are trying to steal these election victories from Republicans . "
" They are pouring all their available resources into these campaigns .
The Obama campaign has tens of millions of dollars left over that they are sure to dump into the Democrat challengers ' campaign coffers , " he added .
Sen . Charles Schumer , D - New York and chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , dismissed such charges .
" The right - wing machine has worked itself into a lather in a clear attempt to intimidate election officials from doing their job , " adding that " they clearly want a repeat of the 2000 recount in Florida , when Republicans flooded into the state from all over the country and used threats and intimidation to stop another recount they were afraid would n't go their way . "
Duncan faced questions Friday on CNN's " American Morning " about his letter 's allegations , especially in the Minnesota race , where Sen.
Norm Coleman is 206 votes ahead of his Democratic challenger , Al Franken .
" We have got to make sure there 's not a thumb on the scale , " Duncan said .
" We have to got to make sure that we have our people in the rooms making sure that it 's a straight count .
And that 's what we 're doing .
We have deployed people up there [ in Minnesota ] .
We need resources to be able to do that .
That recount is very close . "
Watch more of Duncan 's interview »
" I want to make sure that we 're vigilant , and we do not allow anyone to irregularly influence the outcome of this election , and we have to have the resources to do that and we 're asking people to help us do that . "
In Georgia , Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss faces Democrat Jim Martin in a December 2 runoff .
On another matter , Duncan was noncommittal about the possibility of a run for re-election as RNC chairman .
" I do n't know .
My job is to continue this election , " he told CNN .
" We have the runoff in Georgia , we have the recount going in Minnesota , we have two elections that have n't been held yet in Louisiana .
My first responsibility is to do my day job .
After that I will make a decision . "
Asked about the criticism after the GOP 's loss of the White House and seats in both chambers of Congress in last week 's election , Duncan said , " The Republican Party has not lost its way , " adding that " we have a deep bench in the Republican Party , and we have a lot of people who are interested in being RNC chairman . "
Former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael
Steele threw his hat into the ring for the job Thursday .
He 's the second person formally to become a candidate , joining Michigan Republican Party Chairman Saul Anuzis .
The national RNC is expected to hold its election for chairman in January .

Iskander missiles have a range of up to 400 km ( 248 miles ) Russia is to deploy new missiles in a Baltic enclave near Nato member Poland , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev says .
Short - range Iskander missiles in the Kaliningrad region would " neutralise " the planned US anti-missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic , he said .
The US says its shield is a defence against missiles from " rogue " nations , but Moscow sees it as a direct threat .
Mr Medvedev also said he wanted to extend Russia 's presidential term to six years from the current four .
He did not explain if he wanted to extend his own term , or change the rules for his successor .
There has long been speculation that Mr Medvedev is a stop - gap so that Prime Minister Putin - who served the maximum two consecutive terms - can return to the top job , correspondents say .
' Conceited ' US policy
In his first state - of - the nation address , Mr Medvedev said Moscow would deploy the Iskander missile system in the Kaliningrad region - between Nato members Lithuania and Poland - to " neutralise - if necessary - the [ US ] anti-missile system " .
" Naturally , we also consider using for the same purpose the resources of Russia 's navy , " he said .
Mr Medvedev also said Russia would jam the US anti-missile system electronically .
Mr Medvedev 's announcement is extremely provocative , but the Kremlin 's clear message is that America is to blame , the BBC's Rupert Wingfield - Hayes in Moscow says .
Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus later said that Russia 's decision to deploy missiles was " beyond comprehension " .
In his speech to lawmakers , the Russian leader also said the August war in Georgia had resulted from a " conceited " US foreign policy .
He said " the conflict in the Caucasus was used as a pretext for sending Nato warships to the Black Sea and also for the foisting on Europe of America 's anti-missile systems " .
Mr Medvedev , who succeeded Vladimir Putin in May , vowed that Russia " wo n't retreat in the Caucasus " .
Mr Medvedev also blamed Washington for the global financial crisis , but said Russia would " overcome " the challenge .

Jessica Biel Has it All ( Photos )
Actressofficially has it all !
Not only is she absolutely gorgeous and in a solid relationship with hot guy , word has it that she has a great set of lungs too .
Recently Biel paid a visit to NightBird recording studios located in the Sunset Marquis Hotel to record a few songs for her upcoming role in Easy Virtue , which is a remake of the 1928 Alfred Hitchcock film .
Biel will be working side by side with actor Colin Firth .
As a child Jessica performed in kid musicals Annie and Beauty and the Beast .
Now my weekend is going to be filled with " It 's a hard - knock life . "
I LOVE Annie and secretly think I sound just like her when I sing .
Biel is n't sharing any details about the possibility of recording her own album .
Who knows ... maybe she will decide to take the stage with Justin and do a little song and dance .
More photos of Jessica and Justin below .
Sun is going through a lousy spell right now .
Well , so is the world ’s economy in general and the IT business in particular , but this is about Sun .
This is my opinion about what my employer should do about it .
Notices and Disclaimers ·
This is not an official opinion from Sun Microsystems .
Nor does it reflect any particular insider knowledge ; I am not privy to the executive decision - making process about what the company should look like after the current transitions .
Internally , I have been free with my opinions about what the company should do , and while some of those are private , many are n’t , and now I think sharing them with the world might be beneficial to the company .
Our Advantages ·
As I look at Sun ’s portfolio of technologies and judge them solely on the basis of their excellence relative to the rest of the field , these stand out to my eye , in no particular order :
Solaris : Offers superior observability , manageability , and reliability via the combination of DTrace , ZFS , and a policy of not screwing with binary interfaces .
The advantages of ZFS in terms of management and ease - of - use are really underappreciated .
The storage - products portfolio , particularly as demonstrated in the recently - announced Unified Storage product line .
The HotSpot JVM , which offers deployment - time advantages not available on any other software platform .
The NetBeans IDE , which for certain classes of software development ( for example POJOs , Ruby , ME ) , is the best you can get .
The line - up of scalable low - to - medium - end servers : Intel , AMD and especially the “ Niagara ” or “ CMT ” line , low - wattage high - throughput SPARCs .
Glass Fish , which with the addition of the open - source secret sauce , has become a really outstanding app server , especially in its soon - to - arrive V3 incarnation .
MySQL , which is a really good choice for anyone who needs a highly functional and performant database that does n’t come with permanent lock - in to onerous licensing charges .
The Strategy · To my ears , these technologies scream “ Deployment time ! ”
In particular server - side deployment , in particular of Web applications .
Therefore , Sun should adopt a laser focus on building a Sun Web Suite and becoming the Web application deployment platform of choice .
It ’s a large space , a growing space , and one where we can win .
The rest of this piece assumes this strategy and considers how to get from here to there .
The Suite · At the center of everything should be the Sun Web Suite , and everything we produce should have a crisp , easy - to - explain role in driving the Web Suite ’s quality , performance , or ease of adoption .
It ’s easy to understand how our servers , CMT and x86 , and the Solaris OS , fit into the Web Suite .
All the software , including the HotSpot , Glass Fish , and MySQL runtimes , needs to be obsessively tuned and optimized to run best in the context of the Suite .
Obviously , the Suite will also include Ruby and Python and PHP runtimes , similarly tuned .
All of Sun ’s software tooling should have a laser focus on usability , performance , and ease of adoption for the Web Suite .
The Field Sales Organization ·
My belief is that our field organization is somewhere between competent and excellent at taking care of the few hundred largest customers who represent Sun ’s largest revenue stream .
They do a good job , first of understanding those customers ’ concerns , and second , finding ways to match the products that Sun Engineering gives them to those concerns .
It is also my belief that the current organization is entirely unsuited to addressing the needs of small businesses and startups , which have two ways of buying infrastructure :
Getting hardware specs from a Web site , filling in their credit card number , and waiting for delivery .
Buying it in the form of services from a hosting or “ cloud ” provider , which involves getting the specs from a Web site , filling in their credit card number , and waiting for deployment .
More on the cloud below , but we need a sales organization , probably independent of the current large - account teams , that knows how to move product and services through a Web - only presence with low friction and high customer satisfaction .
The Software Business · Sun has a variety of software businesses , some of which make money .
Let ’s just keep the ones that are essential parts of the Web application deployment platform of choice story and exit the rest .
Sell the ones that make money and just shut the rest down .
Then they wo n’t distract attention from executing the Web Suite strategy .
Developers · Increasingly , developers are migrating to the Mac platform , with lots left on Windows and a slower - growing minority on Linux , mostly Ubuntu .
I do n’t think Sun is going to be successful in getting them to abandon those platforms in favor of Solaris .
The Mac and Linux platforms are remarkably similar once you drop into the command - line mode where developers live around deployment time ; they have a mostly - common “ GNU Userland ” .
Solaris needs to offer a similar set of commands and utilities , so that when you go there for deployment the commands you ’re used to using will Just Work .
Also , developers depend crucially on package management with the implied provision of dependency and version tracking .
Solaris must have something that ’s generally competitive with APT , which means that we need to get IPS polished and finished pretty damn quick , or adopt the Nexenta approach of combining the Solaris kernel with the Debian userland .
Cloud ·
Here are some things we do n’t know yet about “ The Cloud ” :
Will it operate at the level of virtual hardware , like Amazon ’s AWS , or at Platform as a Service , like Google App engine ( and , de facto , much of the PHP community ) ?
Will buyers accept a certain amount of lock - in , or will they insist on zero barriers to exit ?
Will those who deploy enterprise applications be willing to let their data offsite and into the cloud ?
If so , what kinds of privacy guarantees will they require ?
Will those who deploy enterprise applications want to build internal cloud - flavored infrastructure ?
Here ’s something we do know :
The business arguments for cloud computing look overwhelmingly attractive .
I ’m not convinced that Sun can succeed as a large - scale supplier of cloud services , and I ’m not even convinced that we need to .
I am convinced that we have to go ahead and build some Cloud infrastructure anyhow and operate it and make it pay for itself , so that when the ecosystem does find its shape , we ’ll understand it and be positioned to sell the Web Suite into it .
Java · The HotSpot and GlassFish runtimes are technically excellent and , I think , crucial components of the Sun Web Suite , especially after they ’ve been exhaustively DTrace - enabled and optimized to run stinking fast on CMT hardware .
As for Sun ’s role as Steward of Java , and in particular the Java Community Process , let it go already .
Java has mostly won and is mostly the establishment , and the community is smart and conservative enough to keep anyone from doing what Microsoft tried last millennium , or in any other way to subvert Java ’s interoperability .
In 2008 , the JCP is costing Sun opportunities and friends and gaining us very little that I can see .
So I ’d like Sun to set the JCP free , turn it over to the community , and when we develop some cool Java - based technology in - house , take it to market , try to make some money with it , and after it ’s caught on and the bugs are shaken out , consider whether or not it ought to be taken to the JCP .
The Desktop ·
There are some interesting desktop apps , mostly editors of one form or another : code editors ( think Eclipse / NetBeans ) , number editors ( think Excel ) , photo editors ( think Photoshop ) , or film editors ( think Final Cut ) .
In only one of these , namely code , does Sun have serious domain expertise .
For actual business apps , the kind that our servers spend most of their time running , the war for the desktop is over and the Web Browser won .
I just totally do n’t believe that any combination of Flash and Silverlight and JavaFX is going to win it back .
AJAX is increasingly central and we need to make sure that our Web Suite and its tools support it well .
But as for GUIs and the client side , let it go already .
And as for the mobile world , the “ new desktop ” ?
Sun should let Google and Apple and Nokia and those guys duke it out , and focus on being the back - end of choice for all the great Net- centric apps that are going to be running on those platforms .
Looking Forward · I can see a future , a couple years out , as the economy emerges from the doldrums , where a smaller , tougher , faster Sun has a great big piece of the storage market and a Web Suite that is pretty well everyone ’s first choice to deploy on .
Especially the first choice of cloud vendors .
The first choice because it ’s got ridiculously low barriers to entry , amazingly great observability and manageability , and outstanding price - performance .
I ’d love to work for that company .
Ahhhh , you ’ve got to love the French paradox .
France is notorious for fattening , artery - clogging food , yet has some of the lowest cancer and heart attack rates in the world , primarily due to a substance named resveratrol , naturally found in pomegranates , grapes , and incidentally , red wine .
Just a few months back , a group of scientists at the University of Wisconsin discovered that by adding small amounts of resveratrol to the diet of mice , the creatures ’ aging process would slow and their hearts would remain healthy , even when constantly exposed to high - fat food .
So with this in mind , another group of researchers from the Houston - based Rice University decided that creating a cancer and heart - disease - fighting beer would be a great idea .
Boy , as far as I ’m concerned , this is the idea of the century .
Unfortunately for beer lovers , who may have seen this as an opportunity to indulge in regular drunken stupors , only half a glass of the stuff each day will be needed to get the substance ’s beneficial effects .
Let ’s just hope that when it comes out , which–if it happens–should be in about five years , “ resveratrol beer ” will taste better than all those light beers out there .
Knock on wood .

A team of investigators from Valencia has developed a machine that separates automatically the seeds from the rind and pith of the pomegranate .
The mechanism uses a computer vision system to distinguish and sort the different parts of this fruit , according to a study published on - line by the Journal of Food Engineering .
The difficulty in peeling pomegranates and separating out the seeds disheartens many consumers when they eat the fruit of the pomegranate ( Punica granatum ) .
Now a Spanish invention enables this food to be de-seeded automatically .
“ This involves a machine that discards the non edible parts and sorts the seeds according to their quality ” , José Blasco explains to SINC and who is from the Institute of Agrarian Research in Valencia ( Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias [ IVIA ] ) , where they have carried out research .
The results of the research have been published recently in the Journal of Food Engineering , and the patent has already been requested .
The initial idea for creating this machine came from a project financed by the European Union for the comprehensive utilization of the pomegranate .
A firm from Valencia became involved in the project and uses the machine to separate the seeds from the pomegranate and commercialises them .
The seeds arrive at the machine in a pile and mixed with the rest of the fruit , following a prior process of wholesale de-seeding .
The material is placed on a conveyor platform with hoppers that organises it into a queue before going on to the “ inspection chamber ” where two videocameras record each object going through .
Images are processed in a computer with vision software especially designed for this task that identifies what is seed from what is not ( pith , rind , strange items from the countryside ) , in addition to evaluating the quality of the seeds .
This information enables the fruit to be put to one side in the “ separation area ” , which has four exits .
When the system detects that an active skin is passing through , a “ blast ” is emitted from air projectors thus pushing it towards the first exit .
By means of these “ blasts ” ( which last about 30 milliseconds ) the rest of the material is separated gradually .
The seeds that do not fulfil the quality requirements demanded by the firm are eliminated through the second exit , prime quality seeds go through the third exit , and those of excellent quality go through the fourth exit .
Anti-carcinogenic properties of pomegranates
Nearly 35,000 tons of pomegranates are produced in Spain each year , and the harvesting period is concentrated between the months of October and January .
Until now a lot of the fruits were not commercialised because of their cracked and discoloured appearance due to “ too much sun ” , although in both cases the nutritive and organoleptic quality of the seeds was not affected .
With the new machine these pomegranates will be used to full advantage .
The nutritional and anti-carcinogenic properties of the pomegranate fruits have been highlighted in various studies .
Moreover this tree does not need fertilizers , phytosanitary products , or large quantities of water , and so adapts well to arid soils .
Skin Care Products Backed by 30 Years of Clinical Research
FaceDoctor proudly offers Clear 60 and FaceDoctor RX , strong , naturally medicated treatments for rosacea , acne and related skin problems for people of all ages .
FaceDoctor ’s “ truly advanced skin care products ” earned the 14th Annual Salon International Award for inventions , presented in Geneva , Switzerland .
Medical doctors have isolated a small parasite called Human Demodex ( aka the Eyelash Creature ) , thought to be the cause of many complexion problems .
Skin that is rough and flushes , is aging prematurely , or is experiencing acne , eczema , psoriasis or other blemishes , is a sign of parasite activity .
If left untreated , it leads to acne rosacea , a bizarre type of skin rash that occurs primarily on the face .
Clear 60 and FaceDoctor RX products eliminate these parasites , allowing the skin to heal .
Regular use of FaceDoctor RX and Clear 60 products improves appearance of the skin significantly in as little as a week .
FaceDoctor RX products use sea buckthorn oil as their primary ingredient .
Sea buckthorn oil is effective in killing the Human Demodex parasite .
Used in both soap and skin cream , sea buckthorn oil also has general nourishing , revitalizing , and restorative properties and can be used for acne , dermatitis , irritated , dry , itching skin , sore skin , eczema , skin ulcers , postpartum pigmentation , burns , scalds , cuts , and tissue regeneration .

The underwear is being issued to female officers as part of their uniform
It is being dubbed the new " bullet - proof bra " , a new kind of Wonderbra which could help protect thousands of women police officers here in Germany .
It may sound like a joke , but this is a serious matter - the policewoman who came up with the idea said normal bras can be dangerous when worn in combination with a bullet - proof vest .
" The impact of a bullet can push the metal and plastic bits of the bra into an officer 's body , causing serious injury , " said Carmen Kibat , an adviser on equal opportunities for the Hamburg - based Bundespolizei - Germany 's federal police force .
" I always thought normal bras posed a safety risk and I wanted to change that , " she said .
" These new bras are very important and they will help all our women officers . "
Dozens of German policewomen have already tested the new bras and , after a two - month long trial , the underwear is being issued to officers as part of their uniform .
Under a vest
So what do the new bras look like ?
Well , looking similar to sports bras , the new bras are white , made from cotton or polyester and padded .
They also have the word " Police " printed at the bottom .
Crucially , though , the bras do not have any under - wire or fastener made out of metal or plastic .
These new bras represent pioneering work
Ruediger Carstens
Bundespolizei spokesman
From now on , women police officers will be allowed to pick three bras from a range of designs , varying in size and style .
" These new bras represent pioneering work , " said Ruediger Carstens , a spokesman for the Bundespolizei .
" It shows that the safety of our officers is a top priority . "
In all , more than 3,000 front - line women police officers across Germany are being encouraged to wear the new bras on duty .
So that includes female officers deployed at airports , train stations , or those deployed at border crossings .
But at the end of the day , it is up to each individual officer to decide whether she will go for the latest " bullet - proof " lingerie - a police spokesman was keen to point out that the new bras " are optional " .

What are these ?
As financial collapse threatened Wall Street and consumed Washington , John McCain appeared to undergo a dramatic transformation .
The candidate who would shrink government became the candidate who would bulk it up .
Just a day after debuting a television ad warning that “ big government casts a big shadow on us all , ” the Republican presidential hopeful told business leaders in Wisconsin that a new federal agency was needed to intervene in the markets .
“ Government , ” he said , “ has a clear responsibility to act . ”
The turnabout is a move McCain has perfected in 26 years on Capitol Hill .
The Arizona senator embraces his party ’s popular critique of government , frequently invoking the deregulatory rhetoric that has helped Republicans win five of the last seven presidential elections .
Advertisement
But when a crisis or scandal makes headlines and sparks a public outcry , McCain is among the quickest in his party to call for robust government intervention .
McCain most famously pushed to regulate campaign contributions and greenhouse gas emissions .
But over the last decade , he also championed greater government authority over airlines , automobiles , tobacco , television programming , even baseball , which he targeted after reports of steroid use in the sport .
“ There is little secret about what is going on , ” said David Boaz , executive vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute .
“ Even in this country that is more skeptical about regulation than any other , during a crisis , people tend to want an answer .
. . .
The obvious one is , ‘ There ought to be a law . ’ ”
McCain ’s maneuvering has at times put him at odds with his party , helping him cultivate a “ maverick ” image .
Advertisement
It has also allowed him to capitalize on distrust of government and still play the tough cop on the beat , ready to protect Americans from corruption and corporate malfeasance .
Yet these two sides of McCain make it hard to discern how the politician who boasts of delivering “ straight talk ” would govern from the Oval Office .
It is unclear if a McCain administration would be led by the small - government crusader who claims President Reagan as his touchstone , or the energetic regulator who once advocated a new federal agency to license professional prizefighters .
The McCain campaign did not respond to requests to discuss the candidate ’s record .
Advertisement
For much of the last year , McCain has triumphantly carried the conservative standard .
“ I was part of the Reagan revolution .
. . .
I was proud to be a foot soldier , ” McCain said at the 40th president ’s library this year .
“ I ’m prepared to follow in his tradition and in his footsteps . ”
When he accepted the nomination last month in Minnesota , McCain put the federal government in the crosshairs .
He criticized bureaucrats , pledged to cut government spending and accused his political colleagues of breaking faith with voters by expanding Washington .
“ Rather than reform government , ” he told his cheering supporters , “ both parties made it bigger . ”
Advertisement
The rhetoric placed McCain in the mainstream of public opinion .
For more than a quarter century , most Americans have said they think government regulation does more harm than good , according to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research .
As a lawmaker , McCain has taken broad swipes at government oversight .
After Republicans captured control of Congress in 1994 by running a sharply anti-government campaign , McCain and 37 GOP senators pushed legislation to place a yearlong moratorium on all regulatory rule - making .
McCain even helped kill efforts to exempt from the moratorium new regulations for clean drinking water and meat inspections .
A less restrictive compromise ultimately passed with bipartisan support .
Advertisement
A year later , McCain was one of five senators to vote against a bill to deregulate telecommunications .
He believed it did not go far enough .
McCain has also worked closely with lawmakers who wanted to relax federal oversight of the banking and financial services industry , including former Sen .
Phil Gramm of Texas , until recently a senior advisor to the McCain campaign .
“ He ’s an extreme free - marketer , ” Consumer Federation of America research director Mark Cooper said of McCain .
McCain kept up his anti-government rhetoric throughout his campaign for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination .
In one October 1999 primary debate in Durham , N.H. , he attributed the decade ’s “ almost unprecedented prosperity ” partly to “ a lack of regulation . ”
Advertisement
Yet there has long been another side to McCain .
Facing popular outrage over defective vehicles , or tobacco marketing to minors , or airline flight delays , the senator has responded with moral indignation and surprisingly zealous efforts to enact more regulation .
When McCain took the gavel of the Senate commerce committee in 1997 , reports were mounting of children being killed by automobile air bags .
The previous year , USA Today , the nation ’s largest newspaper , had published 68 stories , editorials and op - ed pieces about problems with the devices .
Advertisement
Some of McCain ’s Republican colleagues blamed the children ’s deaths on federal rules that required air bags powerful enough to protect adults .
Backed by automakers resistant to federal mandates , GOP lawmakers demanded the regulations be scrapped .
Instead , with consumer advocates at his side , McCain pushed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to come up with new requirements to protect children and then applauded the additional regulation .
“ This rule - making is a good step toward improving traffic safety , ” McCain said .
The same year he tackled air bags , McCain championed even more ambitious regulation of the tobacco industry .
With cigarette makers in court and under fire for concealing information about the danger of their products , McCain hauled dozens of witnesses to his committee room .
Advertisement
A former smoker , he railed against cigarettes from his perch at the head of the horseshoe - shaped table and pledged to use federal law to rein in the industry .
After 10 hearings between July 1997 and March 1998 , McCain pushed a 514 - page bill that would have given the Food and Drug Administration extensive new powers to control the marketing and sale of tobacco products .
McCain struck at airlines in 1999 , championing new regulations amid public outrage over news that passengers on a cramped Northwest Airlines jet had been trapped on the runway in Detroit for seven hours .
He sponsored legislation to crack down on automakers after reports that Ford had known for years about rollover problems with its SUVs .
Advertisement
“ He understands that industry is not going to do certain things , ” said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook , a leading consumer advocate who has worked with McCain on auto safety legislation .
McCain wanted to regulate when broadcasters could air violent programming and how boxing matches should be scored .
In one unusual bid to expand government authority , McCain introduced legislation in 2003 to control how broadcasters cover elections .
Under McCain ’s proposal , broadcasters would have been required to air two hours a week of candidate - or issue - centered programming and to offer political candidates the lowest advertising rates .
The same year , he signed onto a bill to beef up regulation of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , three months after news reports that federal prosecutors had begun investigating accounting irregularities at Freddie Mac.
McCain now points to the legislation , which did n’t pass , as evidence he has advocated market reform .
Advertisement
McCain ’s Republican admirers say he remains a reluctant regulator , endorsing government intervention only when he feels industry wo n’t act .
“ At the end of the day , he hopes the private sector will come up with something , ” said Ken Nahigian , a former commerce committee counsel .
But McCain ’s legislative record also reflects an activist streak that diverges significantly from mainstream conservative ideology .
In his books , McCain has written admiringly about Theodore Roosevelt , who split with the Republican Party a century ago to break up monopolies and to regulate railroads , food processing and the use of federal lands .
“ Many contemporary conservatives have let their healthy skepticism about government sink into something unhealthy , an embittered loathing of the federal government , ” McCain wrote in his 2002 book “ Worth the Fighting For . ”
Advertisement
In the last week , however , McCain seemed to do one more turnabout .
Facing Democrat Barack Obama in the first presidential debate Friday in Oxford , Miss. , he trained his rhetoric on a familiar target .
“ We ’ve let government get completely out of control , ” McCain said .
Then , on Wednesday , McCain left the campaign trail for Capitol Hill to vote for the largest federal intervention in the nation ’s financial markets since the Great Depression .

Stop Australian Internet Censorship
Australian Senator , Stephen Conroy , is set to introduce mandatory Internet filtering in 2008 .
This petition has been organised to put an end to the filtering in Australia , before it begins !
Existing reports ( some even conducted by the Australian Government ) show that ISPs and customers will be forced to pay if mandatory filtering is introduced .
The 2003 Ovum report on filtering commissioned by the Howard Government even finds that smaller ISPs will not be able to absorb the costs like large ISPs .
Furthermore , industry groups have all warned that the filtering can and will be bypassed .
Why waste money on something that is n't going to work ?
Show your support by signing this petition .
Show Mr Conroy and Mr Rudd that Australia does not require a Government babysitter .
This petition will be forwarded to all politicians concerned .
What is an AK47 ?
In short , it ’s an assault rifle : and this is just the first of many misleading death - tech terms we ’ll encounter .
( Gun bureaucrats of all nations seem to delight in confusing the outsider . )
For those not up on the history of shooters , here 's an introduction .
Assault rifles first began to be seriously considered during and after World War One .
Back then in the early 20th century , most up - to - date soldiers carried bolt - action rifles such as the British Lee-Enfield , German Mauser etc .
These old - school shooters fired high - powered ammo , using a strong powder charge in the cartridge to throw a bullet very fast .
Being speedy , these slugs could fly a long way and still kill someone , and the rifles were designed to exploit this .
They were precision instruments , able to hit man-sized targets at 800 or even a thousand yards – if the user had the necessary eyesight and skill , which very few did .
Bolt - action weapons like this were powerful and accurate , and highly trained users could achieve a fairly rapid rate of fire with them as well .
But they were expensive to make , and far from ideal for close - up scuffling in trenches or bunkers .
They were too long and heavy to be handled easily in a tight spot , and working the bolt manually between shots was slow work in an arms - length fight .
The main alternative for individual soldiers back then was pistols , either revolvers or semi-automatics , which would fire a shot each time the trigger was pulled without needing any help from the user .
Pistol ammo used less powder and threw much slower slugs , which meant that handguns could be fired without a shoulder stock .
There was a kind of weapon which would shoot faster still ; the machine gun .
Machine guns fired high - powered rifle cartridges fully automatically .
That is , the gun would keep shooting very fast as long as the trigger was held back , until it ran out of ammo or broke down .
The massive recoil this generated meant that these weapons could only realistically be fired from a tripod or fixed mounting .
The other big snag was that the weapon ’s barrel would rapidly become so hot that its service life could be measured in minutes .
This was usually dealt with by fitting a circulating water - cooling jacket around the barrel , which would draw off the excessive heat – but made the gun even heavier and more unwieldy .
The first gun of this kind much used by the British was known as the Maxim Gun , after its American developer .
Up close and impersonal
Europeans and Americans had found this selection of weapons more than adequate against primitively - equipped adversaries in colonial campaigns at the end of the 19th century .
Enemy tribesmen were n’t , quite , down to the level of being equipped only with sharp pieces of fruit – as Blackadder would have it – but they often had nothing better than spears or knives .
As Hilaire Belloc put it , explaining why the British usually won their wars back then :
Whatever happens , we have got
The Maxim Gun
And they have not
The only serious weakness of the advanced armies was close - in fighting , where machine guns were much too cumbersome for use .
The rapid - firing pistols were often carried only by officers , and usually held only six cartridges .
Officially , if the natives ever got in amongst you , you were supposed to settle them with cold steel .
Officers and cavalrymen would draw their swords , and foot soldiers would fix bayonets .
It was generally felt by Victorian commentators that British pluck would still vanquish superior numbers , even without any serious technological advantage .
In fact , there were often gruesome results when muscular primitives who had trained and fought all their lives with cutting and stabbing weapons came to grips with physically unimpressive British slum - dwellers and public schoolboys no better armed than they .
The more thoughtful European officers – for instance the young Winston Churchill - often replaced their six - shot revolvers with larger - capacity semi-automatics , and some US Cavalry units in the Indian Wars got rid of their swords altogether in favour of extra revolvers .
But nobody really started thinking seriously about new weapons until the civilised armies left the developing world alone for a bit and took on each other in World War I .
The Great War saw several new ideas take to the field , including a forerunner of the AK47 .

14 Original Disneyland Attractions That Are Still Around Today
Walt Disney once said that , “ Disneyland will never be completed .
It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world . ”
Those of us who have visited the park time and time again over the years know this statement to be true as we have seen the park constantly evolve and improve .
With all the changes and transformations the park has endured throughout its more than five decades of existence , many attractions unfortunately have gone by the wayside .
However , not all originality is lost as there are still many attractions in the park today that were present on opening day – July 17th , 1955 .
Do you know which ones they are ?
Disneyland originally opened with five themed lands – Main Street , U.S.A. , Fantasyland , Adventureland , Fronteirland and Tomorrowland .
Each of those lands contained at least one if not more rides ( Disney calls them attractions ) .
While some of the original attractions are no longer with us , 14 originals remain and continue to delight young and old alike to this day .
MAIN STREET U.S.A .
Disneyland Railroad – Originally called the Santa Fe & Disneyland Railroad , the Disneyland Railroad is a narrow gauge railroad that circles Disneyland park .
This live steam railway was constructed at a cost of $ 240,000 and each of the original four locomotives cost in excess of $ 40,000 .
Riders can use the railroad as transportation to other areas of the park including New Orleans Square , Mickey ’s Toon Town and Tomorowland or simply for the experience of the “ Grand Circle Tour . ”
The Main Street railroad station is the first thing visitors see upon entering Disneyland .
The railroad opened with two engines – the C.K. Holliday and the E.P. Ripley , both 4 - 4 - 0 steam powered locomotives that were built in the Walt Disney Studio in 1954 .
Today there are three additional engines – the Fred Gurley which was built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1894 and went into service at Disneyland March 28 , 1958 , the Ernest S. Marsh , a 2 - 4 - 0 originally built by Baldwin Locomotive Works as a 0 - 4 - 0 saddle - tank in 1925 which went into service at Disneyland July 25 , 1959 and last but not least , the Ward Kimball , a 2 - 4 - 4 built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1902 for the Laurel Valley Plantation of Louisiana and later received in trade from Cedar Point Amusement Park as the inoperative Maud L in 1999 .
Restoration was begun by Boschan Boiler and Restorations of Carson in 2004 and the unit went into permanent service on June 25 , 2005 , as part of the park ’s fiftieth anniversary celebration .
Fire Engine – While all the Main Street Vehicles may look like priceless antique means of transport , few of them have ever dated from the turn of the century .
Robert Gurr designed the original vehicles in 1954 and 1955 using modern means and engineering , simply designing them to look like “ the real thing ” .
The only genuine antique of the original Omnibus for example is its authentic Klaxon horn !
The original fire engine that debuted during opening day still picks up in Town Square and near Sleeping Beauty Castle in Central Plaza .
Although not an authentic antique , it was modeled after fire engines actually used in the early 1900s .
Main Street Cinema – The Main Street Cinema is a small movie theater located on Main Street , U.S.A. at Disneyland .
The theater plays Disney shorts on six different screens while a recorded musical accompaniment plays .
Five of the six shorts are played without sound ; these shorts are changed from time to time .
The third short is always Mickey Mouse ’s 1928 debut cartoon “ Steamboat Willie ” , which is played with its original sound .
Unfortunately many guests pass right by this gem which can be found shortly after you enter the west entrance tunnel .
I know that I did for years .
It is however one of the few great places to escape the crowds that so often encompass the park .
You may even find yourself enjoying some of the original cartoons that helped to make Disney what it is today .
ADVENTURELAND
Jungle Cruise –
This attraction was in the opening day roster of the park and in fact was the only attraction available in Adventureland at that time .
It has remained largely unchanged in theme and story since its debut .
Aside from alterations and maintenance changes , four completely new show scenes have been added to date including the 1962 addition of Indian Elephant pool , the 1964 addition of African Veldt and Lost Safari scenes , and the 2005 addition of the Piranhas , and updates to Gorilla Camp scene ( they throw bombs at the boats ) .
In 1995 the river channel was rerouted to make way for the queue buildings and entrance courtyard of the Indiana Jones Adventure .
Also noteworthy is the 1997 replacement of the original ride vehicles .
Through its changes and many years of service , the Jungle Cruise continues to delight guests of all ages .
FRONTIERLAND
Mark Twain Riverboat – When Disney decided to include a Mississippi river boat in its theme park , it would be the first functional paddlewheeler to be built in the United States in fifty years .
Because of this , WED designers conducted extensive research to build it very similar to the riverboats that were built in the heyday of steam powered ships .
The decks were assembled at the Disney Studios at Burbank , while the 105 - foot hull was constructed at Todd Shipyards in San Pedro , California ( where the Sailing Ship Columbia ’s hull was built years later ) .
Fortunately , when the hull and decks were put together for the first time at Disneyland , they fit perfectly .
Joe Fowler , Disneyland ’s construction supervisor and a former navy admiral , insisted on creating a drydock for the ship along what was to be the Rivers of America .
Walt Disney , dismayed at how much land was taken up by the massive excavation , referred to the drydock first as “ Joe ’s Ditch ” and then later “ Fowler ’s Harbor , ” the name by which it goes by today .
The Mark Twain had its maiden voyage on July 13 , 1955 , four days before the park officially opened , for a private party celebrating Walt and Lillian Disney ’s 30th wedding anniversary .
The Golden Horseshoe Stage ( Golden Horseshoe Saloon ) – The Golden Horseshoe Stage unofficially opened on Wednesday , July 13 , 1955 , as the Golden Horseshoe Saloon , when Walt and Lillian Disney , along with dozens of guests , celebrated their 30th anniversary with a private party and premiere showing of the original Golden Horseshoe Revue .
On Saturday , July 16 , 1955 , the Golden Horseshoe opened a day early for a private party of corporate sponsors .
This show marked Wally Boag ’s first official performance as Pecos Bill / Traveling Salesman at the Golden Horseshoe Saloon .
The first venue to open in the Stage was Slue Foot Sue ’s Golden Horseshoe Revue ( mistakenly spelled review when the correct word should have been “ revue ” ) on July 17 , 1955 .
This variety show ran a record 39,000 times and is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest - running musical of all time .
One of the features of the show was to have children from the audience , sing and dance on stage .
“ Davey Crockett , ” was a favorite song performed by the guests .
Today , the Golden Horseshoe Stage is still popular inside and out and currently shows Billy Hill and the Hillbillies seven days a week .
For years Disneyland served chili at the bar as well as drinks and deserts .
Outside on the front balcony , there is a periodic , comedic wild west shoot - em ’ up show performed by Laughing Stock and Company that always draws a crowd .
FANTASYLAND
Casey Jr. Circus Train – While the Casey Jr. Circus Train was one of the original attractions of Disneyland , it almost did not debut on opening day .
In fact , as the day drew closer , safety concerns were encountered .
A test run over the new tracks led to the engine almost tipping over backwards as it attempted the 25 - percent grade .
To counteract the issue , lead weights were added to the front and the train as able to run on opening day .
However , the next day it was shut down and Casey Jr. did not run again until July 31 after work crews had leveled the grades and slowed down the ride .
King Arthur Carousel –
This attraction was originally a Dentzel Menagerie Carousel that had been operated at Sunnyside Amusement Park in Toronto , Ontario since 1932 .
It was taken from there and moved to Disneyland in 1954 .
The carousel originally consisted of three rows of horses and animals on a 22 meter diameter platform but was refurbished and turned into a 4 row unit ( thus increasing ride capacity ) by adding additional horses that came from various other carousels from around North America .
Since its debut at Disneyland , the carousel has been significantly altered .
The original chariots were removed and are used as cars on the “ Casey Jr. Circus Train ” attraction .
A Wurlitzer # 157 band organ face is on the carousel , but does not operate .
Motifs from Sleeping Beauty were used in 1955 to replace elements of the carousel .
Also the Princess and the Jester Head motifs have been redone in 18 k gold leaf .
Today the carousel has seventy - two horses , most which were originally carved in the Dentzel factory in the late 19th and early 20th century .
Some of the horses were taken from a Stein and Goldstein carousel and Coney Island ’s carousel in 1955 to add a fourth row , which I might add is completely made of jumpers and operated by custom - built crankshafts .
Standers on the original three rows were converted to jumpers in 1955 as Walt wanted an “ all jumper ” carousel .
King Arthur Carousel reopened in February 2003 after extensive renovations .
These renovations included an entirely rebuilt turntable and a new computerized operating system that stops the carousel in the same spot every time .
A couple of interesting facts – because of the overwhelming popularity of the carousel ’s single white horse back in its early days , all horses have been painted white since 1975 .
Also , one of seventy - two horses is a mule .
Mad Tea Party – The Mad Tea Party is a spinning tea cup ride that not only debuted opening day at Disneyland but is featured at all five Disneyland - style theme parks around the world .
The ride theme is from the Unbirthday Party scene of Disney ’s animated film version of the story Alice In Wonderland .
The Tea Cups have gained infamy over the years for the amount of guests who get motion sickness as a result of the spinning part of the ride .
I ’m one of them .
The Disneyland version was originally located directly behind Sleeping Beauty Castle ( in the present - day location of King Arthur Carousel ) and was moved to its present - day location in 1983 .
Another interesting fact is that the original attraction at Disneyland is unable to run in the rain .
Once the turntables are saturated with a moderate amount of water they slip and can no longer spin .
All other versions of this attraction are covered to prevent such situations , as well as protect riders from extreme heat and sun .
Mr. Toad ’s Wild Ride – Mr. Toad ’s Wild Ride storyline is based on Disney ’s adaptation of The Wind in the Willows , one of the two segments of the film The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad .
Guests board stolen old - fashioned multi-colored motorcars ( mirroring the film ’s story ) with the names of characters ( including Mr. Toad , Toady , Ratty , Moley , MacBadger , Cyril , Winky and Weasel ) in the front of each motorcar and then begin their wild journey through Toad Hall , the countryside , a warehouse , the streets of London , a pub , and a town square before ending up in a courtroom where they are pronounced guilty .
The cars then enter what is presumed to be dark prison cells before abruptly turning right and landing on railroad tracks .
The vehicles bounce up and down on the tracks before colliding head - on with an oncoming train , where after they are sent to one of the ride ’s most famous scenes — the ending scene in “ Hell ” ( Disney style of course ) .
The Hell scene is actually quite hot which provides an excellent effect .
Guests are not in Hell too long and eventually escape back into the confines of Toad Hall and the real world .
A version of the ride used to exist at Walt Disney World in Florida but closed September 7 , 1998 despite its popularity and many protests and was subsequently replaced with The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh .
Peter Pan ’s Flight – Peter Pan ’s
Flight is a single - bench suspended dark ride which is based on Walt Disney ’s Peter Pan , the animated film version of the classic Peter Pan story by J.M. Barrie .
The original intent of the attraction was for the guests to fly through the ride as if they were Peter Pan .
Unfortunately audiences did not quite grasp this concept and were left wondering , “ Why was n’t Peter Pan in a Peter Pan ride ? ”
A Florida version of the ride opened in 1971 , and while the overall theme and format of the ride was consistent with the original in California , this one would feature Peter Pan characters in Audio - Animatronic style .
In 1983 , Fantasyland was completely revamped and in that revamping , Audio - Animatronic versions of the Peter Pan characters were added to the attraction , just like in Florida .
Snow White ’s Scary Adventures ( Snow White ’s Adventures ) – Snow White ’s Scary Adventures originally opened as Snow White ’s Adventures .
Like the Peter Pan attraction where you are supposed to be Peter Pan , this ride experienced the same dilemma only in this case guests were Snow White .
Few people understood this and wondered why Snow White was n’t in a Snow White ride .
During the major 1983 overhaul to Fantasyland , Snow White was actually incorporated into the ride .
Some interesting facts regarding this attraction :
1 . The ride vehicles are the Seven Dwarfs ’ beds , each one named randomly after one of the dwarfs , just like in the film .
2 . In the scene when the Witch offers the guests the poisoned apple , guests consistently tried ( and often succeeded ) to steal the apple .
When Fantasyland was reopened in 1983 , they solved the problem of the ever - missing poisoned apple by replacing it with a 3 - D image of an apple .
Guests who reach out to steal the apple now find their hands passing through it .
3 . If you look in the window above the entrance to the attraction , you will see the queen open the curtains and peer out the window about every 30 seconds .
Storybook Land Canal Boats ( Canal Boats of the World ) –
The original plan for this attraction was to be a “ Lilliputianland ” , inspired by Madurodam , a miniature city in the Netherlands that Disney once visited .
However , the technology did not yet exist for creating the miniature animated figures that were to inhabit the “ Lilliputian ” village , so the canal ride opened under the name Canal Boats of the World .
It was intended to be a journey past miniature recreations of the great landmarks of the world , but time and money prevented its completion by opening day .
The ride was plagued with other problems .
The outboard motors were prone to overheating , often forcing the boats to be pulled by hand , and because the attraction opened with little landscaping , it earned the nickname among park executives as “ The Mud Bank Ride ” .
After only two months of operation , the Canal Boats closed on September 16 , 1955 while Storybook Land was constructed and the muddy banks were landscaped with miniature plants , including a bonsai tree planted by Walt Disney himself .
The idea of having Monstro the whale consume the canal boats came from a never - implemented concept for a “ Monstro the Whale ” ride , in which small boats were to be swallowed by Monstro and hurtled down a watery path into a pond below .
The attraction was re-opened on June 16 , 1956 under the new name Storybook Land Canal Boats .
Over the years there have been many scenes added and removed from the attraction .
Most notably , the Sultan ’s Palace from Aladdin appeared where the miniature Toad Hall previously stood for a major refurbishment done in 1994 .
However , Toad Hall returned the following year in another location .
TOMORROWLAND
Autopia –
This attraction was to represent the future of what would become America ’s multilane limited - access highways , which were still being developed at the time of the park ’s opening .
It also provided young ones the experience of getting behind the wheel of a real gas - powered vehicle , although a small one .
Prior to opening day , the cars were tested without the bumpers , and were almost completely destroyed by the test drivers .
Bumpers were then fitted around the vehicle , but there were still problems with collisions , as a guide rail had yet to be implemented on the ride .
Eventually the vehicles were fitted with spring - loaded bumpers to discourage collisions .
The Tomorrowland version received makeovers in 1967 and 1999 .
This version was not the only form of Autopia to exist at Disneyland over the years .
Other versions included the Midget Autopia , Fantasyland Autopia ( Rescue Rangers Raceway ) , and Junior Autopia .
Of these , the Tomorrowland Autopia has existed the longest and remains today .
