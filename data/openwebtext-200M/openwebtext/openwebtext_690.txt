The Mexican security services have struggled to deal with the traffickers Mexico has agreed to tighten its immigration rules to crack down on the smuggling route used by Cubans who want to flee to the United States .
The agreement , signed at a ceremony in Mexico City , restricts the main exit route for thousands of Cubans as many travel via Mexico .
Mexico 's past reluctance to halt the practice has led to tensions with Cuba .
More than 11,000 Cubans slipped into the US via Mexico last year , according to US authorities .
Correspondents say most evade immigration officials , and that the few who are caught are rarely deported .
In most cases , they are given transit permits allowing them to reach the US border , they say .
Thawing of relations Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said : " We believe now there will be fewer attempts to use Mexico as an illegal corridor for Cuban immigrants trying to get to the United States . "
Mexico and Cuba are victims of this policy that promotes illegal immigration from Cuba
Felipe Perez Roque
Cuban Foreign Minister Earlier , Mr Perez Roque said the accord would also " allow us to work together to prevent and confront illegal migration , people trafficking and all related crimes " .
" Mexico and Cuba are victims of this policy that promotes illegal immigration from Cuba , " Perez Roque said , referring to the US Cuban Adjustment Act ( CAA ) allows most Cubans who reach American soil to remain in the country and apply for residency after one year .
In recent months , the security services have been struggling with violence associated with the trafficking of the illegal migrants .
Correspondents say Mr Perez Roque 's visit is being seen as a part of a thawing of relations between Cuban and Mexico , which were strained during the presidency of Vicente Fox , who left office in December 2006 .
Cuba 's foreign minister said he would invite the current President , Felipe Calderon , to visit the island in the near future .

Clarke : bin Laden wanted to help Bush in 2004 David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday October 23 , 2008
Print This Email This On CNN 's Newsroom Thursday , reporter Rick Sanchez talked with Mike Brooks , Kelli Arena and Richard Clarke about a potential " October surprise " by al - Qaeda .
Clarke , who served as a counter - terrorism czar under multiple presidents , including George W. Bush , said Osama bin Laden 's taped message just before the 2004 election was intended to help the Republican incumbent win .
As the host and guests speculated on what targets would be the most vulnerable to a terrorist assault , Clarke leveled his argument .
" The fundamental issue is n't throwing up guards everywhere , " he said .
" The fundamental issue is getting into these terrorist organizations ...
So far , the FBI has penetrated a lot of organizations that turned out really not to be terrorist organizations ...
These were wanna - be's , and not serious terrorist organizations .
" And that leaves us with two options : Either the FBI can't find the real ones , or there are not real ones within the United States .
And that later case may be true , because after all , the team that came in to do 9/11 was brought in from outside ...
" At the moment , as far as I can tell , the FBI , other intelligence agencies , do not have any credible information that would lead them to believe an attack might take place .
Why are we asking this , though ?
" Because in 2004 , bin Laden did try to influence the US election .
Whether or not he succeeded , who knows ?
But he issued a video tape on Halloween , a few days before the election , that implied that he supported Senator Kerry .
" He knew , that if he seemed to be supporting Senator Kerry , that would help President Bush .
And it did . "
" Hm , " replied Sanchez .
" So , we know he likes to try to influence elections , " said Clarke .
" So , we can look forward to perhaps another video tape like that , or an attack .
But an attack is a heck of a lot harder for them to stage than the easy job of putting out a video tape . "

I 've got this idea for an exhibition .
The centrepiece would be a light spectacular , a ring of 150 searchlights beaming straight up into the darkness like columns .
There 'd be heroic statues , too , and projections of formation movement , and uniforms and flags .
The gist of the show would be that a bit of history , normally seen in political and military terms , actually offers a rich visual culture .
My working title is REICH : Power and Style in Germany 1933 - 45 .
I 'm hoping that maybe the V&A will be interested .
I do n't see how we can fail , with the talents involved .
The films of Leni Riefenstahl are recognised classics .
The sculpture of Arno Breker is much maligned , and overdue for reconsideration .
As for the architect Albert Speer , who staged that light show for the 1934 party rally , he 's a kind of genius .
Of course , we would n't be skirting round the difficult issues raised by the display .
Clearly there are aspects of the period that will seem distasteful to a contemporary audience .
But , hey : that 's civilisations .
Look at the Aztecs .
Systematic human sacrifice , sure – but what buildings , what artefacts !
Or am I missing something ?
Well , what are the rules here ?
A Nazi visual - culture blockbuster is clearly intolerable .
An Aztec blockbuster is clearly not .
There was one at the Royal Academy of Arts in 2002 .
It made no bones about the bloodletting involved : there were sacrificial knives on view , blood cups , skulls , ample evidence of the sun-oriented death - cult .
It drew record - breaking crowds .
Some people found it disturbing .
Nobody said it should have been banned .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
When it comes to gauging the exhibition - worthiness of a culture , it 's a question of balancing up various factors .
You measure its evil against how long ago it happened and its artistry .
With the Aztecs , time and wonder outweigh butchery .
With the Nazis , it 's too recent , too abominable .
So , how about the Romanovs ?
Next week , an exhibition opens at the V&A with an elaborate title : Magnificence of the Tsars : Ceremonial Men's Dress of the Russian Imperial Court , 1721 - 1917 .
It offers some of the most extravagant examples of formal court wear , from Peter the Great to Nicholas II .
And if that 's your kind of thing , it 's certainly going to be magnificent .
There 'll be coronation mantles , heralds ' livery , headdresses , spurred boots , dress coats , postilions ' jackets , cushions , gloves and gunpowder flasks – everything embroidered and inlaid with gold .
This wardrobe is n't just lavish for lavish 's sake .
It is a blazing sign of authority .
Here is a culture where intricacy of workmanship and opulence of materials are – as so often – the expression and instrument of rule .
The visual is integral to the political .
As one witness to the coronation observed , it was " a spectacle incomparable with anything else in its gripping beauty and intrinsic meaning ... for those few hours alone it is possible to experience at once all the might , all the greatness of Russian power " .
Visitors to the show can hope to get just a bit of that shiver of awe .
But were they such great guys , those tsars ?
A bit slow to abolish serfdom , not really pioneers in the field of civil liberties – and not all that long ago , either .
Is this the kind of celebration they deserve ?
Set off autocracy , the secret police and the prison camps against a marvellously adorned pair of boots , its turnover tops shaped like lions ' heads : how do the sums work out exactly ?
The usual answer , I suppose , is : just grin and bear it .
If you like fancy goods , a little bit of oppression is the price you probably have to pay .
High craft and high art have always been complicit with big power , and if big power is n't always very nice , well , get over it .
Or if you can't , then try to believe that art and craft can rise above it .
The great work , even possibly the great boot , transcends its circumstances .
Maybe it does .
You might think that at least we'd hope it does .
But looking at the way exhibitions go , it seems the opposite is true .
Art 's complicity with power is not something art - lovers resist .
On the contrary , they embrace it .
Getting a frisson of power – military , dynastic , ecclesiastical – is part of the point of being an art - lover .
Exhibition organisers know this .
Consider the titles they devise , and consider this list of words : Magnificence .
Majesty .
Splendour .
Grandeur .
Glory .
Golden .
Triumph .
Treasure .
Any show that has one of those words in its title is playing on power - appeal .
Or simply look at the shows , and the effect on attendance when it's a total - culture spectacle – when the exhibits come with massive historical force behind them .
The force does n't even need to be all that wicked to have this effect .
It just needs to be big , an empire , a civilisation , an epoch .
Go to Byzantium 330- 1453 at the Royal Academy now – Byzantium , heir to the Roman Empire , medieval superpower , centre of the Eastern Church .
Move through its crowded and semi- darkened galleries , glinting with metal work , gleaming with gold - leafed images .
There is a great deal of stuff .
There 's a load of finely wrought gold and ivory .
There are a great many intensely eyeballing icons .
The exhibits individually may tell many different stories , but altogether they communicate the greatness of a culture and a faith .
Here , opulence and craftsmanship are the material signs of untold spiritual riches .
If they could have got Hagia Sophia itself over from Istanbul , they would have .
Unfortunately , it 's fixed to the ground and bigger than the RA .
But what the show wants to convey is what some 10th - century visitors to that great church said , trembling : " We knew not whether we were in Heaven or on Earth . "
True , in these shows , there 's a tension between the pleasure of being overwhelmed and the duty of being informed .
But being overwhelmed is the decisive thing , and what overwhelms is always a compound of visual power and some other kind of power .
Think back to last year 's The First Emperor at the British Museum .
It only had on display a small deputation from the Emperor 's vast funerary terracotta army , but managed to summon up the power of ancient China , and its mad despot who wanted to guarantee his eternal life .
Or think back 35 years to the ancestor of these shows , the British Museum 's Treasures of Tutankhamun – or to last year 's cheap - and - cheerful repeat version at the O2 , Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs .
It 's another case of a supreme ruler - god , and masses of human artistry and human lives being dedicated to his afterlife .
If you want a wonder of the world that gets the crowds rolling up , you can't beat a slave economy .
The British Museum 's current show puts a bit of perspective on this phenomenon .
Babylon – Myth and Reality looks like it should be another one , another homage to a magnificent and merciless conquest - regime and its visual glories .
But they have n't got enough of the big stuff to do that job .
In Berlin , there 's a full - size reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate , with its walls of deep blue brickwork molded with lions and fantastic creatures .
In London , we have a 1:1,000 scale model .
Art -power - trippers wo n't get much directly out of it .
The show is intelligently and lucidly instructional .
There 's some ancient history .
There 's much on the legends surrounding Babylon : Tower of Babel , Hanging Gardens , Nebuchadnezzar eating grass , Jewish captivity , Belshazzar and the Writing on the Wall , the Whore of Babylon .
And there 's contemporary history , about the archaeological site , under Saddam and then under Coalition occupation , both destructive in different ways – and the urgent need now to reconserve .
But that moral is complicated , because the Babylon story is mainly a story of falling down .
It 's a cycle of magnificent construction and destruction .
All the images of Babel invite us to revel in the grandeur of collapse and ruins .
It 's a power spectacle by another means – as Albert Speer , the Nazi architect , knew .
" Ruin - value " was one of his building principles .
An edifice should look good newly up , and also , centuries later , tumbled down .
In both states , it would declare the might behind it .
And though I trust there will be no Nazi blockbuster show for a while yet , it seems to me that the spirit of Speer presides over the grand culture exhibitions we already have .
Just as he did , these shows understand too well an awkward fact about us .
How we love to be overpowered .
How our visual pleasures are part of a general power fix .
Tsars , kings , pharaohs , emperors , patriarchs , leaders : small wonder we 're so often putty in their hands .

Ranging from thousands of dollars to millions of dollars , the following toilets are n’t necessarily comfortable , they are n’t necessarily beautiful , and they are n’t necessarily ones you can afford .
For some reason or another they all exist and now you can learn a little more about them and perhaps be a feel a little envious in the process .
Russian Toilet System for NASA – $ 19,000,000
NASA announced on July 3 , 2007 it they would be investing $ 19 million on a Russian - design toilet system to be installed on the American side of the International Space Station .
Previously , Americans had been using the same toilet system on the Russian side of the space station .
What makes this toilet special ?
All things considered , perhaps the price tag is justified .
The toilet comes with leg braces that help position astronauts while they do their business , while the system uses fans to suck everything into a septic tank where it uses a three - step filtration process to make all waste water into extremely pure drinking water .
Considering that sending water into space with the astronauts is a very expensive proposition , and that designing a system like this from scratch would ’ve cost more , NASA seems to have taken the economical route .
3D Gold Washroom and Toilet – $ 5,800,000
Built by Hong Kong ’s Hang Fung Gold Technology Group in 2001 and located in their “ Hall of Gold ” , this toilet , called “ The World ’s Most Expensive Gold and Jewelry Sparkling Environmental Friendly Washroom ” is not for public use .
Instead it is meant to be a tourist attraction , used to showcase the ‘ technological brilliance ’ of the company .
Among the treasures in the washroom is a solid gold telephone , sink , 24 - carat solid gold toilet , and much more .
Unfortunately visitors cannot see the washroom anymore after the owner died suddenly earlier this year and the company and his family were embroiled in a huge scandal ( watch the video above while you can ) .
Shanghai ’s Moon River Art Park Toilet – $ 602,000
Though the park has other nearby toilets , visitors have in some cases waited hours to visit this one .
And even though the park authorities spent 5 million yuan on its construction , the toilet itself is obscured in a man-made cave surrounded by trees and flowers .
Having become somewhat of a legend in the community , visitors come not with expectations of grandeur , but curiosity about what the all the money was spent on .
According to the park ’s marketing manager , the toilet , housed inside the man-made cave , is decorated like a grotto with stalactite - like water faucets .
Certainly not the most luxurious toilet in the city , agrees the founder of the park , but perhaps one of the more artistic ones .
“ Dagobert ” Wooden Toilet Throne – $ 14,123
Built completely from ash wood and decorated with hand painted designs inspired by Dagobert , the last ruler of the 8th - century Merovingian dynasty , this wooden throne toilet literally goes ‘ medieval on your ass ’ .
As you raise the lid of your throne , the music to ‘ Le Bon Roi Dagobert ’ plays , helping you ease into position , and in true medieval fashion the flush is activated by the pull of a chain .
Toto Neorest 600 – $ 5,800
While still not affordable by most of us average people , the Toto Neorest 600 is possible the most ‘ value for money ’ on this list .
At $ 5,800 for the toilet , it comes with some truly amazing and innovative features including : automatic hands - free lid opening and closing , heated seat , automatic and remote hands - free flush , automatic and self - cleansing system , water conserving dual - flush mode , warm air drier , and air purifier .
With all those features and more , not only does the toilet start to sound like a great investment , but the company ’s tagline , “ calling it a ‘ toilet ’ is too limiting ” also starts to ring true .
The cyberpunk science fiction that emerged in the 1980s routinely paraded “ neural implants ” for hooking a computing device directly to the brain : “ I had hundreds of megabytes stashed in my head , ” proclaimed the protagonist of “ Johnny Mnemonic , ” a William Gibson story that later became a wholly forgettable movie starring Keanu Reeves .

This is the first - ever Human Action Study Guide , and congratulations to Robert Murphy for being the only person in 60 years to complete this much - needed task that has been attempted many times before .
This Guide is 380 pages , complete with summaries , notes , and study questions written by Amadeus Gabriel , a top student of the Misesian approach .
Throughout , its pagination is keyed to the Scholars Edition published by the Mises Institute .
Human Action is the core text of the Austrian School and the most rigorous and extended defense of the free economy ever written .
And the Guide , years in preparation , opens it up as never before .
Everyone knows of the difficulty of the book , which is matched only by its centrality to a thorough understanding of economic logic and the free society .
Even Mises himself hoped for a guide to be written .
Many people tried but did n't make it to the end or became frustrated with the sheer difficulty of the task .
Only Murphy managed it , and he does it with great authority and attention to detail , even as it makes the book newly accessible .
Part of the genius here is the structure : summary : " Why it Matters , " " Technical Notes , " and " Study Questions " .
The writing is exactly what you would expect from Murphy .
As with Man , Economy , and State , he has come to the rescue .
It is crystal clear , very precise and always interesting .
Author 's explanation of the stucture :
Given the current state of the McCain / Palin campaign ( it ’s crashing ) — and the horrible state of the economy ( it ’s crashing ) — you have to know some major distraction is in the pipeline from the GOP .
McCain has to do something to change the subject .
So , expect some vintage Rovian trick .
But , this one will have to be extra ugly .
This poses a real challenge for the traditional media .
The political reporters know they get played by the GOP over and over .
( Read Eric Boelhert to more fully understand this . )
So , the question is whether the campaign reporters continue to cover the real issues — like the horrible state of the economy — or whether they take the bait and cover whatever new ridiculous lie John McCain comes up with .
The safe bet is that the reporters will fall for the GOP distractions AGAIN .
McCain and Palin are counting on the press being gullible .
And , they have good reason .
The press corps always falls for it .
( Think Mrs. Greenspan , Candy Crowley and all of FOX News )
And , we know that Chris Cillizza , the self - described Drudge - ologist , will do whatever Drudge tells him to do .
It ’s actually pathetic how gullible Cillizza is .
The Washington Post editors really need to read Cillizza ’s Drudge column paean and think about just exactly what it is they get from “ The Fix ” if “ The Fix ” just regurgitates Drudge .
In any case , possibly as soon as tomorrow , McCain ’s going into Red Alert distraction mode .
You ’ve been warned .
Drinking in Aberdeen just got a whole lot more complicated , as police warned those popping out for a swift half that they may need to undergo drug testing before they are served .
In Lancaster , police were last week setting up scanners near the central bus station to check passers - by for knives .
Meanwhile , on Waterloo station , sniffer dogs that will check you out for drugs or bombs – but not knives – have become a regular part of the daily commuter experience .
Welcome to the world of preventive policing .
This , as Catholic readers may recognise , is one in which you may be penalised not just for the sins you have committed , but also for ones you are about to commit , or may just casually have thought about committing .
In Aberdeen , pub - goers will soon be faced with The Itemiser ( pdf ) - also known as the Ion Detector .
This device can detect traces of drugs - including cocaine , cannabis , heroin and ecstasy - from hand swabs in a matter of seconds , flashing up green , amber or red according to what it thinks may be present .
Green will get you straight into the pub or club : amber means you will receive a drug information pack ; red may result in your being refused entry , and possibly searched .
The test is voluntary , but customers will be refused entry if they do not take part .
Or , given the police track record with knife - related stop and searches , it is just possible that a refusal to agree to being checked would itself be grounds to search you .
After all , if you have nothing to hide ...
Similar hijinks have been going on recently in Lancaster , as police and the Lancashire County Council ’s Safer Travel Unit began stop and search procedures on members of the public travelling to and from Lancaster bus station .
This ‘ Gateway Check ’ involved the use of two airport - style metal detectors and handheld metal detectors , along with the frisking of travellers as they left the station .
One officer explained : " Due to recent anti-social behaviour and knife crime on buses we are trialling this method as an attempt to deter knife crime , we are currently randomly searching every fifth person . "
Historically , police powers to stop and search have been limited to instances where there is reasonable suspicion that they might find something you should n't have on you : stolen goods , drugs , an offensive weapon , any article made or adapted for use in certain offences ( for example a burglary or theft ) , knives , or items which could damage or destroy property .
Over the last few years , that limit has been seriously eroded .
Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 allows arbitrary stop and search with the purpose to prevent terrorism when authorisation is given by a commander of Metropolitan Police .
This builds upon section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 , which permits searches for offensive weapons or dangerous instruments when authorisation by an officer of the rank of inspector or above is given in relation to a specific place and time period .
In general , court rulings have tended to uphold those powers , rather than diminish them - so even if you have done nothing wrong , failure to comply with a police search may now be an offence in itself .
Reports from locations as far apart as Wellingborough , North Wales and Ipswich all suggest that this is an approach to policing that is increasingly finding favour with police across the country .
Meanwhile , the issue of surveillance on railway stations can be attested to by Reg staff , who regularly brave the sniffer dogs of Waterloo in their journey to work each morning .
For once , we have n’t asked the police to comment on the above .
We could reasonably expect some canned statements about the need to reduce risk , increase public safety , and further explanation that if we have n’t done anything wrong , we would have nothing at all to fear .
Instead , we will repeat a comment made by Head of the Police Improvements Agency , Peter Neyroud : Peter Neyroud , chief executive of the NPIA .
In a Policing paper earlier this year , he and his fellow authors argued that " factual questions about the effectiveness of new technologies ... in detecting and preventing crime should not , and cannot , be separated from ethical and social questions surrounding the impact which these technologies might have upon civil liberties " .
In the end , these measures will either become an acceptable everyday part of British policing , or they will thoroughly alienate Police and public .
Only time will tell . ®
W. Mark Felt , who was the No. 2 official at the F.B.I. when he helped bring down President Richard M. Nixon by resisting the Watergate cover - up and becoming Deep Throat , the most famous anonymous source in American history , died Thursday .
He was 95 and lived in Santa Rosa , Calif .
His death was confirmed by Rob Jones , his grandson .
In 2005 , Mr. Felt revealed that he was the one who had secretly supplied Bob Woodward of The Washington Post with crucial leads in the Watergate affair in the early 1970s .
His decision to unmask himself , in an article in Vanity Fair , ended a guessing game that had gone on for more than 30 years .
The disclosure even surprised Mr. Woodward and his partner on the Watergate story , Carl Bernstein .
They had kept their promise not to reveal his identity until after his death .
Indeed , Mr. Woodward was so scrupulous about shielding Mr. Felt that he did not introduce him to Mr. Bernstein until this year , 36 years after they cracked the scandal .
The three met for two hours one afternoon last month in Santa Rosa , where Mr. Felt had retired .
The reporters likened it to a family reunion .
Mr. Felt played a dual role in the fall of Nixon .
As a secret informant , he kept the story alive in the press .
As associate director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , he fought the president ’s efforts to obstruct the F.B.I. ’s investigation of the Watergate break - in .
New money for energy efficiency upgrades in public buildings is part of a federal economic recovery plan President - elect Barack Obama plans to pitch to Congress in January , according to an announcement during his weekly radio address on Saturday .
But legislators will likely try to tack some preconditions onto the proposal before states get any federal handouts .
In a speech last Friday at the Northwest Energy Coalition in Portland , Representative Earl Blumenauer , an Oregon Democrat , said a “ significant portion ” of the recovery package — on the order of $ 1 billion to $ 10 billion a year of a potential $ 1 trillion proposal — should be funneled directly to the states for energy efficiency projects .
But only states that require utilities to separate , or “ decouple , ” their revenues and profits from their customers ’ energy use should be eligible , said Mr. Blumenauer , a member of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Climate Change .
If some states choose not to enact such standards by the end of 2009 , he added , “ The money will go to states that do . ”
Decoupling is essentially an attempt to divorce a utility ’s revenues from the amount of energy it sells , which in turn would increase efficiency .
How ?
Under conventional regulation , customers pay for what they use .
If they use less — by installing efficient lighting , say , or unplugging appliances and electronics when not in use — the utility loses money .
This arrangement creates a fundamental conflict between a utility ’s interest in selling more energy and the public interest in conserving it .
Under a decoupling scheme , customers pay for electricity more or less like they pay for their cable bill : a pre-determined rate every month , even if they never turn on the television .
If overall revenues fall below a utility ’s fixed costs , the rate is adjusted accordingly across the entire customer base — though some states are establishing rate caps , to protect consumers .
The overall result , however , is that a utility ’s revenues are no longer tied directly to the amount of energy it sells .
( A primer on decoupling from the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy can be found here . )
California was the first state to implement electricity decoupling — in 1982 .
As a result , its per capita consumption has remained relatively flat , while per person electricity use nationally has grown by 50 percent .
The idea is already catching on in at least 10 other states , including New York and Indiana , where at least one natural gas or electric utility has undergone decoupling , according to the October 2008 state energy efficiency scorecard issued by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy .
The promise of a multi-million dollar annual check from Congress could further push some states to mandate decoupling — though not everyone is keen on the idea .
In Oregon , ranked as the second - most energy efficient state on the scorecard , the proposal would likely face some resistance from utilities and regulators — the latter suggesting that such schemes are unfair to consumers .
Pacific Power , an Oregon subsidiary of PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy Holdings , opposes mandatory decoupling .
The Oregon Public Utility Commission , which regulates the utility industry , has also rejected a past proposal from Portland General Electric , the state ’s largest utility , to allow decoupling .
Instead , Oregon law requires utilities to pay 3 percent of gross revenues to the Energy Trust of Oregon , which is responsible for overseeing energy efficiency programs in the state .
Mr. Blumenauer would be “ at odds with his own state ” if he requires decoupling in return for federal money , said Pat Reiten , the president of Pacific Power .
Portland General Electric has again asked for permission to decouple this year as part of a bid to raise its electricity rates by 9 percent starting Jan .
1 . But the company has encountered some resistance from regulatory agency staff members who oppose their request , said P.G.E. spokesman Steve Corson .
The Oregon Public Utility Commission declined to comment on P.G.E. ’s proposal , which is under consideration until the end of December .
Commissioners turned down P.G.E. ’s 2001 request saying that decoupling would shift too much risk to utility customers , and that charging a set fee was unfair to customers who use less electricity than other rate - payers .
And that , my friends , brings us back to the “ rape kit ” story .
For a while now , folks have been trying to poke holes in the story that Palin ’s city had a policy of charging rape victims for their forensic exams because the city wanted to keep taxes low .
But those critics really have n’t been able to disprove the basic point – Palin ’s city was one of the only in Alaska to refuse to pay for rape exams , and the state had to pass legislation requiring cities pay for such exams .
If it was n’t a problem , why did they pass the legislation ?
Because it was a problem , and it ’s been in a problem in a number of states .
That ’s why victims ’ groups fought for years to get those anti-women policies changed .
And while Palin ’s hand - picked chief of police at the time says the city tried , “ when possible , ” to charge the victim ’s insurance company for the exam , he never did quite say what happened when the victim did n’t have insurance , when it was n’t possible .
Not to mention , Sarah Palin ’s city charged rape victims ’ insurance companies , and we ’re to believe that the insurance picked up the emergency room visit 100 % and the victims never were forced to pay a dime ?
Really ?
I have never gotten any doctor visit free via my insurance .
I have ALWAYS had to pay a deductible and a co-pay .
Always .
I had to go the emergency room last year , I had to fork out $ 92 AFTER my insurance paid the rest , and I have GREAT insurance , the best policy I can get for someone self - employed .
We ’re to believe that charging the insurance company somehow made these exams free for rape victims ?
Are these people high ?
And while Palin put out a statement saying she ’s all for rape victims not being charged for the collection of evidence , she never did say how she feels about the charging the victims for the emergency contraception often included in the rape kit used to treat the victim .
Well , now we may know .
Katie Couric got Sarah Palin to admit that she is fine with “ contraception , ” but she objects to the morning after pill because she ’s pro-life .
So Sarah Palin thinks the morning after pill is a form of abortion .
And Sarah Palin opposes all abortion unless the mother ’s life is in danger ( though in the video below she seems to hedge on that point ) .
So the question remains , does Sarah Palin support government agencies paying for rape kits which include emergency contraception ?
Have her answer that question , and we can put the entire rape kit story to rest once and for all .
At the end of this video , Palin makes the comment about emergency contraception .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECTnBYQjDH8]
One other thing .
Anyone else get the sense that Palin was basically putting out the pro-choice position during this interview – she would personally urge women not get abortions , but would n’t require it ?
Nov. 6 , 2008  --
By all accounts , the meeting today between Joseph Lieberman , the independent senator from Connecticut , and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , was a cordial , even friendly , one .
But Lieberman made a hard push to remain chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , suggesting he may leave the Democratic caucus if he is demoted , ABC News has learned .
For Democrats , this is payback time .
They want to punish Lieberman for his high - profile support of John McCain 's failed presidential bid , observers say .
Democrats were especially infuriated by Lieberman 's attacks on Barack Obama during his primetime speech at the Republican National Convention in September .
Lieberman is a lifelong Democrat who served as the party 's vice presidential nominee in 2000 .
He became independent in 2006 but continues to caucus with Senate Democrats .
Reid and Lieberman met in Reid 's Capitol Hill office for 45 minutes this afternoon .
Reid told Lieberman that he intended to take away his chairmanship of the Homeland Security Committee , according to sources who have spoken with both senators about the meeting .
But Reid told Lieberman that he wants him to remain in the Democratic caucus , offering Lieberman a leadership role in a lesser committee if he agreed to continue caucusing with Democrats .
But Lieberman refused the offer , sources said , and said that taking revenge for Lieberman 's support of McCain was not consistent with President - elect Obama 's promise to change Washington and to work in a way that transcends partisan politics .
Despite Lieberman 's high - profile support for McCain , Republicans do n't expect him to join forces with them .
As one senior Senate Republican aide told ABC News , " Why would he become a Republican ?
He votes against us on everything except Iraq . "
After the meeting , both senators were tight - lipped about the meeting .
Reid released a statement saying the discussions would continue , adding , " While I understand that Sen. Lieberman has voted with Democrats a majority of the time , his comments and actions have raised serious concerns among many in our caucus . "
Lieberman made a short statement after the meeting , saying he was going to spend the next few days thinking about his options .
Of his actions during the campaign , Lieberman said , " We have just finished an historic election .
As you know , I decided in that election that partisanship should take a back seat to doing what , in this case , I believe , was best for our country .
But the election is over , and I completely agree with President - elect Obama that we must now unite to get our economy going again and to keep the American people safe .
That is exactly what I intend to do with my colleagues here in the Senate in support of our new president .
And those are the standards that I will use in considering the options that I have before me .
And of course I will ask others to do the same . "

You knew it was going to happen .
For all his big talk about being happy to talk to the House Judiciary Committee looking into the conviction and incarceration of Don Siegelman , when push came to shove , you had to know that Karl Rove would never , ever freely respond to the HJC subpoena .
CQPolitics :
Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , cited executive privilege as the reason that the former White House adviser would not appear before the Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee on July 10 .[.. ]
" Mr. Rove will respectfully decline to appear before the Subcommittee on July 10 on the grounds that Executive Privilege confers upon him immunity from process to respond to a subpoena directed to this subject , " Luskin wrote .
Luskin renewed an offer that would have Rove submit to an off - the - record , untranscribed interview or answer written questions about the Siegelman case , but not the broader issue of the politicization of the Justice Department .
Not even man enough to stand up for his actions .
Hear that , Karl ?
Not even man enough .
Dan Abrams brings NYU Law School Professor Michael Waldman and former HJC counsel Julian Epstein to discuss the latest in Bush League ( In ) Justice :
Abrams : Okay , Michael , let me start with you : it is clear , Karl Rove is not coming .
I mean , the House Judiciary Committee can say as much as they want , we 're still hoping , we 're still encouraging him to come , we 're still insisting that he come , he 's not coming .
So what do they do now ?
Waldman :
Well , it 's really quite remarkable , as you say , you can just say no to a lawful subpoena from Congress .
Congress has a bunch of tools they can use .
They can , of course , throw him in jail .
There 's a jail in the basement of the Capitol .
That 's probably the extreme remedy .
There 's all kinds of other things .
They can cut off funding , they can hold up nominations , they can bring a lawsuit as has been the case in the Miers ... the Harriet Miers contempt case .
But what Congress has to have when it looks in its toolbox is not any of these tools but some backbone .
Congress is a co-equal branch of government and it needs to stand up for its rights in this .
Backbone in Congress ?
What 's that ?
I 'll believe it when I see the perp walk .
If I were a Jew , I would be a Zionist .
I am a Zionist .
You do n’t have to be a Jew to be a Zionist .
— Senator Joseph Biden
Considering the last eight years and the current ( viable ) options , I ’ll admit to wanting Barak Obama in the White House in January .
Undoubtedly , more people around the world will have a better chance of surviving the next four years with his finger on — or rather off — the button .
However . . .
For all of Obama ’s campaign promises of “ change , ” his choice of Joseph Biden as his running mate sends a clear signal to Israel ’s lobby in Washington and its right - wing government in Jerusalem that for the next four years there will be no change in the United States ’ unconditional support or its annual $ 6 billion in direct and indirect aid .
Predictably , neither will there be a change in the hopelessness and the impotent rage of the Arabs suffering under a US - supported Zionist ideology in Palestine .
Senator Biden is the ardently pro-Israel chair of the Foreign Relations Committee .
He is a 36 - year veteran politician whose specialty is foreign policy .
When he told a reporter from the Jewish cable network , Shalom TV , that he is a Zionist , he knew the implications of that admission for the Palestinians , the entirety of the Arab world , and America ’s global “ war on terror . ”
Matt Dorf , the Jewish outreach coordinator for the Democratic National Committee , said that “ Israel would have no better friend in the vice president ’s office than Joe Biden . ”
Dorf might just as easily — and as honestly — have said , “ Palestinians would have no greater foe in the vice president ’s office than Joe Biden . ”
Commenting on the unrest in Palestine in 2007 , Biden planted his flag deep in Israel ’s camp : “ The responsibility rests on those who will not acknowledge the right of Israel to exist , will not play fair , will not deal , will not renounce terror . ”
Obama ’s running mate has chosen his side .
He cannot be a neutral American statesman brokering a Middle East peace or he cannot be a Zionist .
One cannot be a Zionist and place the suffering of Palestinians on the same moral plane as that of Israeli Jews .
One cannot be a Zionist and demand that Israel dismantle its illegal settlements that co-opt nearly half the land in the Gaza Strip and Occupied West Bank .
One cannot be a Zionist and place the blame for sixty years of violence and the deaths of innocent thousands — both Palestinian and Israeli — on the cold - blooded determination with which the Zionist cadre executed the ethic cleansing of 800,000 Palestinians from the land they had inhabited for untold generations .
One cannot be a Zionist and contemplate the return of Palestinians to their homes that are now occupied by Israeli Jews or the rebuilding of the 500 Palestinian villages destroyed during the great Nakba ( catastrophe ) of 1948 .
One cannot be a Zionist and abandon the dream of Eretz Israel in order to live as equals with an Arab neighbor in a truly democratic Palestine - Israel .
One cannot be a Zionist and demand that Israel ’s apartheid wall be torn down .
One can be a Jew .
One can be an Israeli .
But one can not be a Zionist .
Joseph Biden is neither a Jew nor an Israeli .
He is the Democratic vice presidential candidate who unabashedly declared , “ The Democrats ’ support for Israel comes from our gut . . . and ends up in our heads . ”
Sound familiar ?
Have n’t we already had eight years of a president who “ thinks ” with his gut and expects the rest of us to behave like dung beetle larvae ?
Speaking strictly for myself , I ’m tired of their balls of poo .
Could it be there is no difference , no possibility of change as Obama promises , between the Democratic and Republican parties ’ subservience to Israel ’s shadow government on K Street or their tacit support of Israel ’s internationally condemned policies toward the Palestinians ?
Could it be that the two parties ’ overt support for Israel ’s regional aggression exacerbates the “ war on terror ” and makes the people their candidates swear to God to protect and defend less safe ?
Could it be that the “ ball of dung ” being fed to the American people by both parties conceals the obvious truth that there is no strategic value in our irrational alliance with Israel ?
Commenting on the unrest in Palestine in 1921 , Winston Churchill , one of the architects of the modern Middle East , told the House of Commons : “ The cause of unrest in Palestine , and the only cause , arises from the Zionist movement , and from our promises and pledges in regard to it . ”
Joseph Biden ’s self - professed Zionism plays well on Shalom TV , but it is a liability for the United States in the global “ war on terror ” and a death warrant for Palestinian and Israeli innocents .

I rather like Late Night with Conan O’Brien .
Unfortunately , I seldom get to watch , mainly because I usually show up at work sometime between 7:00 and 7:30 AM , and I do n’t like watching more than a few minutes of video on my computer .
However , Hugh Laurie , star of House , was interviewed by Conan and revealed himself to be not unlike me in that he ’s definitely a booster of reason and science in medicine over irrationality and dubious “ complementary and alternative medicine ” ( CAM ) therapies .
In fact , his attitude towards CAM appears to be not at all unlike that of the character he plays on House .
Check out the interview .
( If you want to watch , the relevant part of the interview begins at about 23:50 into the show . )
For those who might have problems playing Internet video , I ’ve found a transcript :
From Late Night with Conan O’Brien Tuesday , December 9 , 2008 CONAN O’BRIEN :
We have something in common , which is …
I believe your father is a doctor and my father is a doctor .
And so you ’re playing a doctor now , and I ’m curious .
Did you learn anything from your father ?
Is there anything from growing up with a doctor in the family that helped you with the role ?
HUGH LAURIE :
In a way , yes .
I mean , not , not …
Not to do with the character , but to do with my attitude toward medicine .
Because I admired my father so much , I grew up with this immense reverence for Western Medicine .
I think it ’s about the noblest calling there is .
I do n’t know about you , but I have no patience with the sort of bog - sucking crystals and the herbs and all that sort of stuff .
I ’m a great believer in antibiotics and anesthetics .
These are great things that have saved millions of lives .
( GESTURES TOWARD AUDIENCE )
You know half the people who are here would n’t be here if it were n’t for antibiotics .
CONAN : I am the same way .
Whenever something is wrong with me , and someone says , “ There ’s a tree root that you can hold against your head and then think good thoughts , ” HUGH : Right .
CONAN : I push them aside and go to a pharmacy .
( LAUGHTER ) HUGH : Right , me too !
CONAN : I want actual medicine .
HUGH : I want actual medicine , little white pills .
Yeah .
Because when people try to persuade you of this alternative course because its an ancient medicine , its an ancient therapy .
“ It ’s two thousand years old . ”
But two thousand years ago people died at twenty !
CONAN : Yes .
HUGH : It ’s no recommendation !
( LAUGHTER ) CONAN :
If they made it to twenty , it was , “ Hey old man !
Hey old timer ! ” HUGH : Absolutely .
( LAUGHTER ) HUGH : Let ’s have some more of that tree bark !
But , no .
Yes , I definitely grew up with that .
And that made me ( I suppose ) sympathize with the —
Is it left brain or right brain ?
I do n’t know which side it is —
But that sort of logical , scientific side of the character , which I do greatly admire .
For all his cynicism , sarcasm , etc. etc. , I love his belief in reason .
It is his religion .
I definitely got that from my father .
I knew there was a reason that I liked Hugh Laurie .
I have n’t really watched House much during the last couple of seasons ( it seemed to be getting too formulaic ) , but maybe I should give it another try .
In any case , it ’s great to see two major stars being straight up skeptical about unscientific medical claims .
You do n’t see that very often .
Unfortunately , what you do see far more often are stars like Oprah Winfrey , whose appetite for woo has become legendary and made her arguably the most influential promoter of unscientific medical practices in the media .
I wonder if Hugh Laurie ’s ever been on her show , and if he has would his contact with Oprah result in the credulous heads of every audience member exploding ?

Mail to a friend Print this article Introduction Mathematics has long played an important role in timekeeping as cultures created calendars to express their unique values .
In this article , we will look at an interesting mathematical construction , the Stern - Brocot tree , that was created , in part , to help build timepieces .
As we 'll see , the tree gives an exceptionally elegant way to enumerate the positive rational numbers and is a surprisingly useful tool for constructing clocks .
Moritz Stern , a German mathematician who succeeded Gauss at the University of Göttingen first described the tree and explained its relation to other topics in number theory in a mathematics paper in 1858 .
Stern 's co-discoverer , Achille Brocot , was born into an esteemed family of clockmakers in 1817 , and later held several patents on his work .
Our focus here , however , will be on his discovery of the Stern - Brocot tree and its use in clock making .
Construction of the Stern - Brocot tree
To construct the Stern - Brocot tree , we will define the mediant of two rational numbers to be The mediant always lies between the two rational numbers that define it .
To see this , we may identify a rational number p/q with the point in the plane ( q , p ) .
With this convention , the slope of the line through the origin and the point ( q , p ) is the rational number p/q .
( Strictly speaking , the mediant depends not on rational numbers , but rather on representations of rational numbers .
For example , 2/3 = 4/6 but 2/3 5/7 is not the same as 4/6 5/7 .
We will typically represent rational numbers as fractions p/q in simplest terms -- that is , where p and q have no common factors -- so that this should cause no confusion .
The same point applies to the definition of the point ( q , p ) associated to a rational number . )
Notice that the operation of forming the mediant of two rational numbers corresponds to vector addition .
This shows that the slope defined by the mediant lies between the slopes defined by the two original rational numbers , which implies that the mediant lies between the two rational numbers .
We will now construct the Stern - Brocot tree in steps beginning with the two fractions 0/1 and 1/0 .
You may worry that 1/0 does not define a rational number , but , as we 'll see , it will be convenient for us to think about this as representing infinity .
We continue the construction forming the next level by inserting the mediant of any two consecutive rational numbers that are already in the tree .
Notice that we have constructed a binary tree : when a rational number r appears , it is the mediant of two rationals , one of which is r's immediate predecessor , the other is r's immediate successor .
The mediant of r and its predecessor is r's left child , while the mediant of r and its successor is its right child .
A rational number appears in the tree only one time .
This is because the rationals added to the tree are always between consecutive numbers that are already in the tree .
The rational numbers always appear in simplest form .
We 'll explain this momentarily after introducing a useful tool .
Remembering our identification of rational numbers with points in the plane , we see that two rationals define a parallelogram , as shaded below .
It is well - known that the area of this parallelogram may found by A ( p / q , p' /q ' ) = qp ' - q'p .
This quantity has some important features that are easy to check .
If r 1 and r 2 are rationals , then A( r 1 , r 2 ) is an integer .
and r are rationals , then A(r , r ) is an integer .
A( r , r ) = 0 .
A satisfies an additive property : A( r 1 r 2 , r 3 ) = A ( r 1 , r 3 ) + A ( r 2 , r 3 )
r , r ) = A( r , r ) + A( r , r ) A ( sp / sq , r 2 ) = s A ( p/ q , r 2 ) .
We now claim that , if r 1 and r 2 are consecutive rational numbers at any step of the construction of the Stern - Brocot tree , then A( r 1 , r 2 ) = 1 .
It is certainly true at the beginning step , since we begin with 0/1 and 1/0 .
Now suppose that it is true for r 1 and r 2 , consecutive rationals at some step of the construction .
To form the next step , we add the mediant of r 1 and r 2 between them .
We may then check that In the same way , we see that We can now explain why rationals that appear in the tree are expressed in simplest terms -- that is , as ratios p/q where p and q have no common factors .
Suppose instead that the rational sp / sq appears in the tree with s >
1 . Suppose that r is the rational following sp / sq when it appears in the tree .
Then A ( sp / sq , r ) = s A ( p/ q , r ) = 1 .
This is impossible if s > 1 , which implies that the rationals appear in simplest terms .
Sliding down the tree Every positive rational number appears in the Stern - Brocot tree .
As we come to understand this fact , we 'll also see how to navigate in the tree .
Let 's begin by asking , how , for example , we would find 4 / 7 .
The construction begins with the fractions 0/1 , 1/1 , 1/0
We will begin at the fraction 1/1. Since 0/1 < 4/7 < 1/1 , we will move left to the mediant of 0/1 and 1/1 , which is 1 / 2 .
It will be convenient to denote this move by L since it is a move to the left child of 1/1 .
Now we have 1/2 < 4/7 < 1/1 so we will move to 2/3 , the right child of 1 / 2 .
We denote this move as R so that our path from 1/1 is described by LR .
In the same way , we have 1/2 < 4/7 < 2/3 so we will move left to 3/5 .
Our path from 1/1 is now LRL .
With one more step to the left , we arrive at 4/7 , which we may represent as LRLL .
How does this show that every positive rational appears in the tree ?
Suppose that we are looking for the rational r.
At every step , r is bracketed by two rationals p/q and p'/q ' .
If r is equal to mediant of p/q and p'/q ' , then we have found r.
If not , move from the mediant to the left if r is less than the mediant and right otherwise .
Suppose that we never find r so that this process continues indefinitely .
As this happens , the denominators of the rationals p/q and p'/q ' that bracket r grow arbitrarily large .
Let 's think about this geometrically .
Since q and q ' grow arbitrarily large , the points ( q , p ) and ( q ' , p ' ) are eventually to the right of r .
And since p/q < r < p'/q ' , it follows that r lies in the parallelogram as shown below .
Remember that the area of the shaded parallelogram above is A ( p / q , p' /q ' ) =
1 . Consider now the area of the parallelogram defined by p/q and r , shaded darkly below .
Its area must be a positive integer A ( p / q , r ) that is less than 1 .
Since this is clearly impossible , r must have appeared somewhere earlier in the tree .
We now have a way to label positive rational numbers as finite strings of L's and R's .
( We need a special symbol , perhaps I , to denote 1/1. )
What happens if we allow ourselves to consider infinite strings of L's and R's ?
Clearly , infinite strings correspond to positive irrational numbers .
If α is a positive irrational number , we may determine the corresponding string using the following algorithm : Begin at r = 1/1 and let S be the empty string .
If α < r , replace r by its left child and replace S by SL .
Otherwise , replace r by its right child and S by SR .
Repeat step 2 .
It is amusing to consider some obvious strings , for example , S = RLRLRLRLRLR ....
Notice that we begin at 1/1 , move to 2/1 , 3/2 , 5/3 , 8/5 , ....
Since we alternate right and left moves , we always move to the mediant of the two preceeding terms in the sequence .
Alert readers will recognize these rationals as ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers F n / F n - 1 .
( You may remember that the Fibonacci sequence is the ubiquitous sequence defined by F 0 = 0 , F 1 = 1 , and F n = F n - 1 + F n - 2 .)
As it is well known that F n / F n - 1 converges to the golden ratio , one of mathematics ' very special numbers , we have φ = RLRLRLRLRLR ....
A result of Euler implies that e , the base of the natural logarithm , corresponds to the curious string : e = RL0 RLR2 LRL4 RLR6 LRL8 ...
Summarizing what we have seen , we can represent any real number x by a string , either finite or infinite , of L's and R's .
By considering these strings as paths in the Stern - Brocot tree , we obtain a sequence of rational numbers that converges to x .
Remembering that e is approximately 2.7182818 ... and that e = RL0 RLR2 LRL4 RLR6 LRL8 ... , we obtain the following sequence that converges to e. R 2/1 2.0000000 ... RR 3/1 3.0000000 ... RRL 5/2 2.5000000 ... RRLR 8/3 2.6666666 ... RRLRR 11/4 2.7500000 ... RRLRRL 19/7 2.7142857 ... RRLRRLR
30/11 2.7272727 ... RRLRRLRL
49/18 2.7222222 ... RRLRRLRLL
68/25 2.7200000 ... RRLRRLRLLL
87/32 2.7187500 ... RRLRRLRLLLL
106/39 2.7179487 ...
Rational approximations
The key to the use of the Stern - Brocot tree in clock making is that the sequences obtained in this way are optimal in the following sense .
The rational numbers in the sequence approximate the real number x to which they converge .
Simply said , given any rational approximation of x , the sequence typically contains an element that is a better approximation and that has a smaller numerator and denominator .
Said with more precision ,
If the rational number r is not in the Stern - Brocot sequence that converges to x , then some element in the sequence , with a numerator no larger than r's and a denominator no larger than r's , lies between r and x .
To illustrate , consider the case where x = φ 1.61803398875 ....
We may take p/q to be the rational number 1.618 = 809/500 .
Here is the first part of the sequence produced by the Stern - Brocot tree .
R 2/1 2.0000000 ... RL 3/2 1.5000000 ... RLR 5/3 1.6666666 ... RLRL 8/5 1.6000000 ...
RLRLR 13/8 1.6250000 ... RLRLRL 21/13 1.6153846 ... RLRLRLR
34/21 1.6190476 ... RLRLRLRL 55/34 1.6176471 ... RLRLRLRLR
89/55 1.6181818 ... RLRLRLRLRL
144/89 1.6179775 ... RLRLRLRLRLR
233/144 1.6180556 ... RLRLRLRLRLRL
377/233 1.6180258 ... RLRLRLRLRLRLR
610/377 1.6180371 ... RLRLRLRLRLRLRL
987/610 1.6180328 ... RLRLRLRLRLRLRLR
1597/987 1.6180344 ...
Notice that 610/377 , which is approximately 1.6180371 , has a smaller denominator and numerator than 809/500 and is a better approximation .
To see why this property holds , consider the process by which we create the sequence that converges to x .
At every step , we have consecutive rationals p/q and p'/q ' that bracket x .
Since r is a rational different from x , eventually r is not bracketed by these two rational numbers .
Consider the last step at which r is bracketed by p/q and p'/q ' .
If p'' /q ' ' is the next mediant obtained in the process , then it must lie between r and x.
Now r will be found in the Stern - Brocot tree under p'' /q ' ' , which means that the numerator of r is no smaller than p' ' and the denominator is no smaller than q' ' .
Thus , p'' /q ' ' is closer to x than r is and the numerator and denominator are no larger than r's .
Clock making and the Stern - Brocot tree
So why would a clock maker be interested in this tree ?
If you open up a clock , you 'll probably see something like what I did when I pried open a cheap travel clock .
Clocks typically have a source of energy -- such as a spring , a suspended weight , or a battery -- that turns a shaft at a fixed rate .
If the clock has , say , a minute hand and an hour hand , then some mechanism is needed to speed or slow the motion of the shaft as it is transferred to the hands .
Gears are used to slow the motion of the shaft .
In the figure below , the smaller green gear , with 20 teeth , drives the larger blue gear , with 60 teeth .
( In the language of clock making , the smaller gear is called a pinion while the larger one is a wheel . )
As the green pinion advances by one tooth , so does the blue wheel .
Therefore , one revolution of the green pinion produces 20/60 or 1/3 of a revolution of the blue wheel and so the angular speed of the blue wheel is 1/3 that of the green pinion .
If we want a shaft that rotates once a second to drive a minute hand , we could use a pinion and wheel whose ratio of teeth is 1/60 .
But we have another option .
The figure below illustrates a gear train ; the green pinion turns the blue wheel slowing the speed by a factor 1 / 6 .
However , the blue wheel turns the red pinion at the same rate , and this pinion , with 10 teeth , turns the gray wheel , with 100 teeth thus slowing the speed by another factor of 1/10 .
Therefore , the ratio of the speed of the green pinion to the gray wheel is 1/6 1/10 = 1/60 .
Any number of stages can be added , at least in theory .
For instance , we could mount another pinion on the gray wheel and have it drive yet another wheel .
To illustrate the use of this thinking , imagine that we have a shaft that rotates once per minute and we wish to drive an hour hand , which rotates once every 12 hours .
The ratio of these speeds is 1/720 .
We could use a single pinion with one tooth to drive a wheel with 720 teeth or a pinion with 10 teeth driving a wheel with 7200 teeth .
Surely , the larger gears would be unyieldy .
Instead , we could use a three - stage gear train noting that 1/720 = 1/( 10 8 9 ) = 1/10 1/8 1/9
The key here is that we can factor 720 .
Here 's another example suggested by Camus in the eighteenth century :
Suppose we place a pinion on a shaft that rotates once every hour and ask to drive a wheel that rotates once in a mean tropical year , which is 365 days , 5 hours , 49 minutes .
Converting both periods to minutes , we see that we need the ratio 720 / 525,949 .
The problem here is that the denominator 525,949 is prime so we cannot factor it .
To obtain this ratio exactly , we cannot use gears with a smaller number of teeth .
It is likewise impossible to find a multi-stage gear train to obtain this ratio .
Brocot illustrated how to use the Stern - Brocot tree to obtain excellent approximations of the desired ratio in cases like this .
As we slide down the tree toward 720 / 525,949 , the rationals we meet along the way will give good approximations with relatively small numerators and denominators .
We 'll come back to this problem after describing another observation Brocot made that allows us to compute the error in such an approximation .
To illustrate his method , Brocot considered a similar situation in which it is desired that a shaft that rotates every 23 minutes turns a wheel that rotates every 191 minutes .
We therefore seek the ratio 23/191 .
Since both 23 and 191 are prime , we cannot realize this ratio with a multi-stage gear train .
Instead , we will use the Stern - Brocot tree to approximate this ratio and to understand the error in the approximation .
Suppose we are approximating 23/191 with p/q .
Imagine constructing a pinion with p teeth on the shaft and letting it turn a wheel with q teeth .
The pinion makes a revolution every 23 minutes .
This means that the wheel makes a revolution every 23 q / p minutes .
The error is therefore Recalling the additive property of the quantity A , we may easily compute A ( p/ q , 23/191 ) as we descend the tree .
Since 23/191 is between 1/8 and 1/9 , Brocot began by making a table like this : p q A 1 9 +16 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 8 - 7 He now added a row for the mediant .
Notice how each entry in the new row is obtained by adding the corresponding entries in the other rows .
p q A 1 9 +16 2 17 +9 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 8 - 7 This shows that if we approximate 23/191 by 2/17 , the error will result in the wheel taking A ( 2/17 , 23/191 ) / p = 9/2 = 4.5 too many minutes to rotate .
Brocot then continued : p q A 1 9 +16 2 17 +9 3 25 +2 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 8 - 7 p q A 1 9 +16 2 17 +9 3 25 +2 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 4 33 - 5 1 8 - 7 p q A 1 9 +16 2 17 +9 3 25 +2 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 7 58 - 3 4 33 - 5 1 8 - 7 p q A 1 9 +16 2 17 +9 3 25 +2 ... ... ... ... ... ... 10 83 -1 7 58 - 3 4 33 - 5 1 8 - 7 p q A 1 9 +16 2 17 +9 3 25 +2 13 108 +1 ... ... ... 10 83 -1 7 58 - 3 4 33 - 5 1 8 - 7 p q A 1 9 +16 2 17 +9 3 25 +2 13 108 +1 23 191 0 10 83 -1 7 58 - 3 4 33 - 5 1 8 - 7 Among other things , this shows that we can approximate 23/191 with 13/108 , which results in the wheel being late to complete its rotation by 1/13th of a minute .
Let 's apply this thinking to Camus ' problem of 720 / 525,949 , whose corresponding string is : L730 R2 L15 R L6 R2 .
Let 's begin sliding down the tree .
The right column , labeled A , will record A ( p/ q , 720 / 525949 ) .
In this table , the mediants appear in the order in which we encounter them .
p q A 0 1 720 1 0 -525,949 1 1 -525,229 L 1 2 -524,509 L ... ... ... L 1 730 -349 L 1 731 371 R 2 1461 22 R 3 2191 -327 L 5 3652 -305 L 7 5113 - 283 L ... ... ... L 29 21184 -41 L 31 22645 -19 L 33 24106 3 R 64 46751 -16 L 97 70857 -13 L 130 94963 -10 L 163 119069 -7 L 196 143175 -4 L 229 167281 -1 L 262 191387 2 R 491 358668 1 R 720 525949 0
As we descend the Stern - Brocot tree towards 720 / 525,949 , we find the fraction 196 / 143,175 , which may be factored as 196 / 143,175 = 2/3 2/25 7/23 7/83
We can therefore construct a four - stage gear train , turned by the hour wheel , in which the last wheel completes a rotation in 4/196 minutes less than a tropical mean year .
This is just a little over a second too fast .
Not a bad approximation at all !
( Actually , a tropical mean year is nearly 15 seconds less than 525,949 minutes .
However , once we 've taken aim at a target , we 'd like to hit it , even if the target 's not where it should be . )
Why did we look at the approximation 196 / 143,175 ?
Because we could factor the numerator and denominator with relatively small factors .
I found this by factoring the numerator and denominators of all the terms in the sequence and noting which had desirable factorizations .
However , Brocot also constructed a " table of factors of all useful numbers " where a useful number was , of course , one that had relatively small factors .
Had Brocot performed the search we just did , he would have recognized 196 / 143,175 as a good choice since both the numerator and denominator are candidates for his table .
Are you bothered that our clock is a second fast over the course of a tropical mean year ?
Brocot showed us how to do better still .
Up to this point , we have slid down the tree to our desired ratio of 720 / 525,949 .
We could , however , keep moving down the tree to obtain closer approximations .
Brocot would have begun with a table like this : p q A 491 358668 1 ... ... ... 720 525949 0 and began adding mediants : p q A 491 358688 1 1211 884637 1 1931 1410586 1 2651 1936535 1 3371 2462484 1 4091 2988433 1 4811 3514382 1 5531 4040331 1 ... ... ... 720 525949 0
Here , we are sliding down the tree below the ratio we seek , but the mediants are continually better approximations .
In this way , you would find a three - stage gear train with the ratios : 23/218 71/527 107/1111 = 174,731 / 127,638,346 that is too slow by 1 / 127,638,346 of a minute ( roughly two millionths of a second ) over the course of a year .
The Euclidean algorithm and continued fractions We 've seen Brocot 's motivation for discovering the Stern - Brocot tree .
Stern 's interests were more mathematical .
For instance , the tree is intimately related to the Euclidean algorithm .
This algorithm finds the greatest common divisor of two positive integers m and n by performing the following :
If m > n , replace m by m - n .
Otherwise , replace n by n - m .
If n = 0 , then m is the greatest common divisor .
Otherwise , repeat from the beginning .
To see how this works , let m = 52 and n = 12 .
We have m n 52 12 40 12 28 12 16 12 4 12 4 8 4 4 4 0 This shows that the greatest common divisor is 4 .
Now consider beginning with 12/52 and seeking approximations in the Stern - Brocot tree using the sign changes of A ( p/ q , 12/52 ) as a guide for when to change direction .
p q A 0 1 12 1 0 - 52 1 1 -40 L 1 2 -28 L 1 3 - 16 L 1 4 - 4 L 1 5 8 R 2 9 4 R 3 13 0 Notice how the right column may be interpreted as a form of the Euclidean algorithm .
It is well known that the Euclidean algorithm and continued fractions are intimately related so it is no surprise that the Stern - Brocot representation of a rational number is related to its continued fraction .
In particular , the rational corresponding to Ra 0 La 1 Ra 2 ...
La n- 1 is represented as the continued fraction Summary I learned about the " mathematical side " of the Stern - Brocot tree some time ago from the superb book of Graham , Knuth , and Patashnik listed in the references .
Since the Euclidean algorithm and continued fractions are close relatives of the tree , it is clear that we are walking on fertile ground .
I suppose that this represents Stern 's side of the tree , the side that appreciates the tree for its mathematical elegance and its relation to other important ideas in number theory .
It was only recently that I learned from Brian Hayes ' equally good book how Brocot found and used the tree to which he lent his name .
This story interested me , as it clearly did Hayes as well , since it demonstrates the many faces of mathematical ideas ; how they may appear in different places and be both beautiful and useful at the same time .

We have been asserting for many moons that despite having lower incidence of US style , “ another quarter , another writedown ” behavior , European banks are actually in weaker condition than their US counterparts .
That ’s based on the view of a buddy who has top level regulatory connections here and in Europe , and it seems plausible given the fact that European regulators let their bank operate with lower equity levels than US banks can .
Not only have events started confirming this view , but , with a banking crisis starting to take hold in the EU , the stakes are high .
The EU lacks a mechanism for rescuing banks ; the responsibility falls to national central banks .
The rescue over last weekend of Fortis demonstrated that several central banks , shepherded by the EU , can make a coordinated rescue .
But will this prove to be a one - off or a model ?
The biggest banks in Europe , starting with Deutschebank and UBS , are similarly too big for their home country central bank to salvage in case of a meltdown .
Ambrose Evans - Pritchard , who admittedly has an appetite for drama , contends that the survival of the monetary union itself is in play .
From the Telegraph :
It took a weekend to shatter the complacency of German finance minister Peer Steinbrück .
Last Thursday he told us that the financial crisis was an “ American problem ” , the fruit of Anglo - Saxon greed and inept regulation that would cost the United States its “ superpower status ” .
Pleas from US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson for a joint US - European rescue plan to halt the downward spiral were rebuffed as unnecessary .
By Monday , Mr Steinbrück was having to orchestrate Germany ’s biggest bank bail - out , putting together a € 35 billion loan package to save Hypo Real Estate .
By then Europe was “ staring into the abyss , ” he admitted .
Belgium faced worse .
It had to nationalise Fortis ( with Dutch help ) , a 300 - year - old bastion of Flemish finance , followed a day later by a bail - out for Dexia ( with French help ) .
Within hours they were all trumped by Dublin .
The Irish government issued a blanket guarantee of the deposits and debts of its six largest lenders in the most radical bank bail - out since the Scandinavian rescues in the early 1990s .
Then France upped the ante with a €300 billion pan-European lifeboat for the banks .
The drama has exposed Europe ’s dark secret for all to see .
EU banks took on even more debt leverage than their US counterparts , despite the tirades against ” le capitalisme sauvage ” of the Anglo - Saxons .
We now know that it was French finance minister Christine Lagarde who begged Mr Paulson to save the US insurer AIG last week .
AIG had written $ 300 billion in credit protection for European banks , admitting that it was for “ regulatory capital relief rather than risk mitigation ” .
In other words , it was underpinning a disguised extension of credit leverage .
Its collapse would have set off a lending crunch across Europe as banking capital sank below water level .
It turns out that European regulators have allowed even greater use of “ off - books ” chicanery than the Americans .
Mr Paulson may have saved Europe .
Most eyes are still on Washington , but the core danger is shifting across the Atlantic .
Germany and Italy have been contracting since the spring , with France close behind .
They are sliding into a deeper downturn than the US .
The interest spreads on Italian 10 - year bonds have jumped to 92 points above German Bunds , a post - EMU high .
These spreads are the most closely watched stress barometer for Europe ’s monetary union .
Traders are starting to “ price in ” an appreciable risk that EMU will break apart .
The European Commission ’s top economists warned the politicians in the 1990s that the euro might not survive a crisis , at least in its current form .
There is no EU treasury or debt union to back it up .
The one - size - fits - all regime of interest rates caters badly to the different needs of Club Med and the German bloc .
The euro fathers did not dispute this .
But they saw EMU as an instrument to force the pace of political union .
They welcomed the idea of a “ beneficial crisis ” .
As ex-Commission chief Romano Prodi remarked , it would allow Brussels to break taboos and accelerate the move to a full - fledged EU economic government .
As events now unfold with vertiginous speed , we may find that it destroys the European Union instead .
Spain is on the cusp of depression ( I use the word to mean a systemic rupture ) .
Unemployment has risen from 8.3 to 11.3 per cent in a year as the property market implodes .
Yet the cost of borrowing ( Euribor ) is going up .
You can imagine how the Spanish felt when German - led hawks pushed the European Central Bank into raising interest rates in July .
This may go down as the greatest monetary error of the post - war era .
The ECB responded to the external shock of an oil and food spike with anti-inflation overkill , compounding the onset of an accelerating debt deflation that poses a greater danger .
Has it committed the classic mistake of central banks , fighting the last war ( 1970s ) instead of the last war but one ( 1930s ) ?
After years of acquiescence , the markets have started to ask whether the euro zone has the machinery to launch a Paulson - style rescue in a fast - moving crisis .
Who has the authority to take charge ?
The ECB is not allowed to bail out countries under EU treaty law .
The Stability Pact bans the sort of fiscal blitz that has kept America afloat .
Yes , treaties can be ignored .
But as we are learning , a banking system can implode in less time than it would take for EU ministers to congregate from the far corners of euroland .
France ’s Christine Lagarde called yesterday for an EU emergency fund .
“ What happens if a smaller EU country faces the threat of a bank going bankrupt ?
Perhaps the country does n’t have the means to save the institution .
The question of a European safety net arises , ” she said .
The storyline is evolving much as eurosceptics predicted , yet the final chapter could end either way as the recriminations fly .
Germany has already shot down the French idea .
The nationalists are digging in their heels in Berlin and Madrid .
We are fast approaching the moment when events decide whether Europe will bind together to save monetary union , or fracture into angry camps .
Will the Teutons bail out Club Med ?
If not , check those serial numbers on your euro notes for the country of issue .
It may start to matter .

Ladies , your hands are a zoo .
Sampling the bacterial DNA on human skin has revealed that while women ’s hands get washed more often than men’s , they teem with a more diverse selection of germs .
What ’s more , the average person ’s hands probably carry at least 3000 different bacteria belonging to more than 100 species .
This startling cornucopia may make it possible to tell which objects have been touched by someone , just by looking at the bacteria left behind .
Noah Fierer and colleagues at the University of Colorado at Boulder in the US swabbed the palms of 51 undergraduates coming out of an exam .
They then used the PCR technique to amplify the bacterial DNA present , and sequenced the genetic material using a high - throughput method called pyrosequencing .
Previous surveys of skin bacteria involve growing the result of such swabs in culture , but many species were missed as not all the bacteria sampled grew .
The new method caught 332,000 genetically distinct bacteria belonging to 4742 different species – a hundredfold increase on previous studies .
Each student carried on average 3200 bacteria from 150 species on their hands .

Germ fingerprints
Everyone ’s bacterial “ fingerprint ” was unique .
All students carried known skin denizens such as Streptococcus , Staphylococcus and Lactobacillus , but 45 % of the species were rare .
Only five species were found on all the students ’ hands , while any two hands – even belonging to the same person – had only 13 % of their bacterial species in common .
Certain bacteria were more frequent on the dominant hand ( right for a right - hander ) , others on the non -dominant hand .
Unexpectedly , women had different bacteria from men and significantly more kinds , even though women reported washing hands more often ; bacterial diversity needs time to recover when hands are washed .
In a follow - up experiment , the team tracked eight people after they washed their hands .
Some bacteria preferred clean hands , other types showed up much later , but men always had fewer types of bacteria on their hands .
“ We were pretty surprised to see such clear differences between men and women , ” says Fierer .
“ We do n’t know the causes . ”
Differences in sweat and sebum production , hormones and even the use of cosmetics might be involved , but it could simply be that men ’s skin is more acid – acid environments tend to have less microbial diversity .
This unexpected wealth of germs could pose problems for the Human Microbiome Project , launched last year with the aim of determining how our microbial fellow - travellers contribute to disease .
“ It will be difficult to associate changes in skin bacterial communities with skin disease , ” says Fierer , “ because the background variability among healthy individuals is so large . ”
On the other hand , he says , this may make it possible to identify objects touched by a certain individual just by looking at the selection of bacteria they leave on it .

MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Tuesday signed a law extending the presidential term , the Kremlin said , in a move many observers believe is designed to bring former president Vladimir Putin back to the nation 's top office .
Some experts believe Prime Minister Vladimir Putin remains Russia 's real leader .
Medvedev , Putin's hand - picked successor , proposed the changes in November , starting with the next president .
The new law extends the term of the president from four years to six .
Medvedev also signed a law extending the term of members of the lower house of parliament , the Duma , from four years to five .
Putin stepped down as president in May after two terms and is now prime minister .
Earlier this month , Putin shrugged off the suggestion that Medvedev would step down to make way for his return when the law passes .
" The next election is in 2012 , " he said December 4 , according to the Interfax news agency .
But his comments came after a three - hour televised question - and - answer session with the Russian public which reinforced some experts ' view he remained the country 's real leader .
Putin has done call - in programs each year since 2001 , but this was his first one as prime minister , rather than president .
Putin remaining in the chair this year , rather than yielding it to Medvedev , showed he still runs Russia , said analyst Yevgeny Volk , the director of the Moscow office of the Heritage Foundation , a conservative U.S. - based think tank .
Tuesday , Medvedev also signed a law giving the Duma more powers over the Russian government .
The Duma may now consider annual performance reports issued by the government .
CNN 's Mike Sefanov contributed to this report .

WASHINGTON  Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey collapsed during a speech Thursday night and was taken to the hospital after he failed to regain consciousness .
Mr. Mukasey , 67 , who took over as attorney general one year ago after the resignation of Alberto R. Gonzales , was giving a speech on national security to members of the Federalist Society , a conservative legal affairs group , when he lost consciousness at about 10:20 p.m .
Around midnight , a Justice Department spokesman said in a statement that Mr. Mukasey was “ conscious , conversant and alert . ”
The spokesman , Peter A. Carr , said the attorney general would be kept overnight at George Washington University Hospital for observation .

Want to really get away from it all ?
The farthest you can travel from home ( and still remain on Earth ) is about 7,900 miles ( 12,700 kilometers ) straight down , but you 'll have to journey the long way round to get there : 12,450 miles ( 20,036 kilometers ) over land and sea .
Why not take a shortcut , straight down ?
You can get there in about 42 minutes — that 's short enough for a long lunch , assuming you can avoid Mole Men , prehistoric reptiles and underworld denizens en route .
Granted , most Americans would end up in the Indian Ocean , but Chileans could dine out on authentic Chinese , and Kiwis could tuck into Spanish tapas for tea [ sources : NOVA ; Shegelski ] .

Of course , you 'd be in for a rough ride .
First , you 'd have to pass through 22 - 44 miles ( 35 - 70 kilometers ) of continental crust ( 3 - 6 miles / 5-10 kilometers on the ocean floor ) followed by 1,800 miles ( 2,900 kilometers ) of mantle .
After that , you 'd have to traverse a Mars - sized outer core of liquid iron churning as hot as the sun 's surface ( 10,000 degrees F , or 5,500 degrees C ) , then a solid , moon - sized inner core , and , some studies suggest , a liquid innermost core [ sources : Angier ; Locke ; NOVA ] .
For sake of argument ( and survival ) let 's pretend Earth is a cold , uniform , inert ball of rock .
While we 're at it , let 's ignore air resistance .
At Earth 's surface , gravity pulls on us at 32 feet ( 9.8 meters ) per second squared .
That means that , for each second you fall , you speed up by 32 feet per second — but only near Earth 's surface .
Gravity is a function of mass , and mass is a property of matter .
On the surface , all of Earth 's matter lies below your feet but , as you fall , more and more of it surrounds you , exerting its own gravity .
These horizontal tugs counterbalance each other and cancel out , but the increasing proportion of mass above your head exerts a growing counterforce to the proportionately decreasing mass below , so your acceleration slows as you near the core .
At the planet 's center , your acceleration due to gravity is zero — Earth 's mass surrounds you , gravity cancels out and you are weightless [ sources : Locke ; Singh ] .
You 're still moving at a heck of a clip , though , so do n't expect to stop there .
Halfway to the center , your speed hits 15,000 mph ( 24,000 kph ) ; 21 minutes after jumping in , you blow past the center at 18,000 mph ( 29,000 kph ) .
Another 21 minutes later , with gravity slowing you as you go , you reach the far side and stop briefly in midair .
Unless someone catches you , you 'll then head back the way you came and start all over again .
In our idealized case , this will continue indefinitely , like a pendulum or a spring , in a process called harmonic motion [ sources : Plait ; Shegelski ; UCSB ] .
Of course , reality has a tendency to intrude on even the best thought experiments .
The food and soap manufacturing multinational Unilever has announced that it will divest from an Israeli factory in a Jewish settlement illegally built on land confiscated from Palestinians .
Unilever , which makes household staples such as Sunsilk shampoo , Surf washing powder and Vaseline , said it would sell its 51 % stake in the Beigel & Beigel factory in the West Bank settlement of Ariel .
The UK and Dutch - owned multinational has followed Harrods department store - which cleared its shelves of Beigel & Beigel products , such as pretzels , in August - and a campaign by Britain to crack down on Israeli settlement businesses that are allegedly dodging EU import taxes .
Unilever 's announcement also came ahead of a report on its investment in the occupied territories by United Civilians for Peace , a Dutch human rights group .
UCP said the decision of Unilever , which defied the international boycott against South Africa during the apartheid era , showed that the firm was " serious " about international law and social responsibility .
But Unilever Israel , which bought half of Beigel & Beigel in 2001 , said the move was strategic , not ethical .
" This decision has been taken with reluctance after a long period of analysis and review , " it said .
" Following the divestment in recent years of a number of non-core businesses ... the decision has been reached to divest of its interests in the bakery business and will therefore seek to find a buyer for Unilever 's share in the Beigel & Beigel partnership , " the company said in a statement .
Ariel is one of three large Israeli settlement blocs that penetrate and separate northern and southern parts of the West Bank .
It is surrounded by a network of roads that Palestinians are forbidden to use without special permission .
The settlement is built on land that Israel conquered in the 1967 Six Day war .
According to UCP , the land for the Beigel & Beigel factory , in Ariel 's Barkan industrial estate , was confiscated from the surrounding Palestinian villages in 1981 by a Israeli military order .
" International law prohibits the confiscation of occupied land not for military purposes , " the UCP report says .
It also claims that Unilever is in effect supporting Ariel because it pays taxes to the Shomron regional council , which provides services such as rubbish disposal to Barkan .
In return , Unilever receives , via Beigel & Beigel , some of the " generous " subsidies that Israel pays companies to produce in settlements .
Companies that operate in settlements also benefit from employing cheap Palestinian labour , the report says .
At Beigel & Beigel , 45 % of the 140 workers are Palestinians from the surrounding villages whose land was confiscated for the construction .
Most of them work on the assembly line operating machines and contrary to Unilever 's own labour standards , they are not paid the Israeli minimum wage , the report claims .
Many workers are paid to work 46.5 hours a week but they often work 50 hours with no compensation .
One worker , who must pass through a checkpoint gate to go home after work , told UCP that he is often unable to return to his village .
I actually wrote like 80 % of this script weeks ago but could n't think of an appropriate punchline until today .
Sometimes stuff just needs to ferment I guess .
Okay time to go spend another $ 1200 on postage , see you tomorrow .

Join me , fellow readers , as I learn some topology by pretending I know something about it .
I recently uploaded Martin Escardó ’s infinite search monad to hackage , under the name infinite - search .
It is a delightful little thing to play with , and has inspired some deeper thoughts about the connection between computation and topology .
Quick refresher on topology : a topological space is a set X together with a collection of subsets of X , called the open subsets .
The open subsets must include the empty set and the entirety of X itself , and must be closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections .
So for example , you can generate the standard topology on the real line by taking all the open intervals ( a , b ) and closing them under arbitrary unions .
So for example , the set , which is ball of radius 1 / 2 around every integer , is open .
No solitary points are open ; every point must have an arbitrarily small cloud of nearby points .
As another example , there is a topology on the natural numbers called the discrete topology , in which you consider every singleton set to be an open set and take arbitrary unions over those .
In this topology , every subset of the naturals is open .
A space is compact if “ every open cover has a finite subcover ” .
That means for any collection S of open sets whose union is the entire space , there is a finite collection whose union is also the entire space .
Obviously all finite topologies are compact , because there are no infinite collections to begin with .
So the discrete topology on the naturals I talked about is not compact .
Consider this cover : ; just all the singleton open sets .
This obviously has no finite subcollection which also unions to the entire set of naturals ( if you leave out even one of these sets it fails to be a cover ) .
Okay , on to computation .
Roughly what Martin Escardó ’s work says is that compact spaces can be exhaustively searched .
That is , if S is a compact space , then given a total function p :: S ->
Bool , we can either compute an element of S satisfying p or compute that there is no such element .
If we could figure out a way to form topological spaces on our data types , then we can know whether they are exhaustively searchable ( and construct algorithms to search them ) .
A domain is the set of all elements of a data type , including partial ones ( with ⊥s in them ) .
So the domain for Bool is { ⊥ , True , False } , and the domain for Either ( ) is { ⊥ , Left ⊥ , Left ( ) , Right ⊥ , Right ( ) } .
To construct a topology ( the Scott topology ? ) for the type , generate it by the sets of all compatible elements with some finite element of the domain .
So the open sets for our Either ( ) would be { { Left ( ) , Right ( ) } , { Left ( ) } , { Right ( ) } } .
We also toss in the empty set , since it is the union of zero of these .
Earlier we saw that the naturals were not compact .
This is a good sign , because if we could exhaustively search the naturals , then we could write an algorithm to eg. decide the twin - prime conjecture .
However , I will now show that the lazy naturals are compact .
The lazy naturals are the data type :
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat
What is the set of elements of this domain , and what is the topology ?
The set of elements is just the regular naturals plus the special one let infinity =
Succ infinity .
The topology has all the regular finite naturals as singleton sets , just like the discrete topology , but it also has subsets generated by { ⊥ , Succ ⊥ , Succ ( Succ ⊥ ) , … } .
That is , sets of all of them greater than some natural including infinity .
The key is that the singleton { infinity } itself is not open , it only comes from one of these infinite sets .
Now let ’s say you have a cover for Nat .
It includes infinity , so it must include the a set { n | n > k for some k } .
So we pick that one , and then we pick however many sets we need to cover all the naturals less than k ; there will be at most k of them .
So we have constructed a finite subcover .
So regular naturals are not compact , but Nat is .
So regular naturals are not searchable , but Nat is .
But we got Nat only by adding to the regular naturals ; how did we make it searchable in the process ?
There was a little snag in the definition of searchable above : we needed a total predicate .
Many functions which we would not be able to search on the regular naturals would get into an infinite loop if we passed the function infinity , and that would mean the predicate is not total .
Intuitively , that means we can only search on predicates which are bounded in the size of the natural ; which stop looking at some point .
I conjecture that every ADT in Haskell ( without strict fields ) is compact .
It is pretty easy to write combinators which construct Data .
Searchable Sets for any ADT ; whether they are proper compact Sets ( i.e. the search function is in fact total ) is another issue .
So that ’s it .
We can make a compact set of Naturals and exhaustively search them .
For fun , here ’s a little Haskell implementation demonstrating this :
import Data .
Searchable data Nat = Zero | Succ
Nat nat :: Set Nat nat = singleton Zero `union` fmap Succ nat -- decidable equality on functions from Nat ! eqnatf :: ( Eq a ) => ( Nat -> a ) -> ( Nat -> a ) ->
Bool eqnatf f g = forevery nat $
-> f n == g n
Go ahead , write a Num instance for Nat and play around .
Just remember that your predicates need to halt even when given infinity , otherwise they are not total .
In particular , this means that you ca n’t use eqnatf on Nat ->
Nat , because equality on Nat itself is not total ( infinity == infinity loops ) .
License plate sabotage
A number of years ago I was opening a new bank account , and the bank clerk asked me what style of checks I wanted , with pictures clowns or balloons or whatever .
I said I wanted them to be pale blue , possibly with wavy lines .
I reasoned that there was no circumstance under which it would be a benefit to me to have my checks be memorable or easily - recognized .
So it is too with car license plates , and for a number of years I have toyed with the idea of getting a personalized plate with II11I11I or 0OO0OO00 or some such , on the theory that there is no possible drawback to having the least legible plate number permitted by law .
( If you are reading this post in a font that renders 0 and O the same , take my word for it that 0OO0OO00 contains four letters and four digits . )
A plate number like O0OO000O increases the chance that your traffic tickets ( or convictions ! ) will be thrown out because your vehicle has not been positively identified , or that some trivial clerical error will invalidate them .
Recently a car has appeared in my neighborhood that seems to be owned by someone with the same idea :
In case it 's hard to make out in the picture — and remember that that 's the whole idea — the license number is 00O0O0 .
( That 's two letters and four digits . )
If you are reading this in a font in which 0 and O are difficult or impossible to distinguish — well , remember that that 's the whole idea .
Other Pennsylvanians should take note .
Consider selecting OO0O0O , 00O00 , and other plate numbers easily confused with this one .
The more people with easily - confused license numbers , the better the protection .

Skein and SHA - 3 News
There are two bugs in the Skein code .
They are subtle and esoteric , but they ’re there .
We have revised both the reference and optimized code — and provided new test vectors — on the Skein website .
A revision of the paper — Version 1.1 — has new IVs , new test vectors , and also fixes a few typos in the paper .
Errata : Version 1.1 of the paper , reference , and optimized code corrects an error in which the length of the configuration string was passed in as the size of the internal block ( 256 bits for Skein - 256 , 512 for Skein - 512 , and 1024 for Skein - 1024 ) , instead of a constant 256 bits for all three sizes .
This error has no cryptographic significance , but affected the test vectors and the initialization values .
The revised code also fixes a bug in the MAC mode key processing .
This bug does not affect the NIST submission in any way .
NIST has received 64 submissions .
( This article interviews one of the submitters , who is fifteen . )
Of those , 28 are public and six have been broken .
NIST is going through the submissions right now , making sure they are complete and proper .
Their goal is to publish the accepted submissions by the end of the month , in advance of the Third Cryptographic Hash Workshop to be held in Belgium right after FSE in February .
They expect to quickly make a first cut of algorithms — hopefully to about a dozen — and then give the community about a year of cryptanalysis before making a second cut in 2010 .
Lastly , this is a really nice article on Skein .
These submissions make some accommodation to the Core 2 processor .
They operate in “ little - endian ” mode ( a quirk of the Intel - like processors that reads some bytes in reverse order ) .
They also allow a large file to be broken into chunks to split the work across multiple processors .
However , virtually all of the contest submissions share the performance problem mentioned above .
The logic they use wo n’t optimally fit within the constraints of a Intel Core 2 processor .
Most will perform as bad or worse than the existing SHA - 1 algorithm .
One exception to this is Skein , created by several well - known cryptographers and noted pundit Bruce Schneier .
It was designed specifically to exploit all three of the Core 2 execution units and to run at a full 64 - bits .
This gives it roughly four to 10 times the logic density of competing submissions .
This is what I meant by the Matrix quote above .
They did n’t bend the spoon ; they bent the crypto algorithm .
They moved the logic operations around in a way that would n’t weaken the crypto , but would strengthen its speed on the Intel Core 2 .
In their paper ( PDF ) , the authors of Skein express surprise that a custom silicon ASIC implementation is not any faster than the software implementation .
They should n’t be surprised .
Every time you can redefine a problem to run optimally in software , you will reach the same speeds you get with optimized ASIC hardware .
The reason software has a reputation of being slow is because people do n’t redefine the original problem .
That ’s exactly what we were trying to do .

Watch a sea slug eat algae to nab some of its chloroplasts , and the genes that keep them functioning
Elysia chlorotica , the solar - powered sea slug , is about 3 cm long ( Image : PNAS )
It ’s the ultimate form of solar power : eat a plant , become photosynthetic .
Now researchers have found how one animal does just that .
Elysia chlorotica is a lurid green sea slug , with a gelatinous leaf - shaped body , that lives along the Atlantic seaboard of the US .
What sets it apart from most other sea slugs is its ability to run on solar power .
Mary Rumpho of the University of Maine , is an expert on E. chlorotica and has now discovered how the sea slug gets this ability : it photosynthesises with genes “ stolen ” from the algae it eats .
Advertisement
She has known for some time that E. chlorotica acquires chloroplasts – the green cellular objects that allow plant cells to convert sunlight into energy – from the algae it eats , and stores them in the cells that line its gut .
Young E. chlorotica fed with algae for two weeks , could survive for the rest of their year - long lives without eating , Rumpho found in earlier work .
But a mystery remained .
Chloroplasts only contain enough DNA to encode about 10 % of the proteins needed to keep themselves running .
The other necessary genes are found in the algae ’s nuclear DNA .
“ So the question has always been , how do they continue to function in an animal cell missing all of these proteins , ” says Rumpho .
Gene ‘ theft ’
In their latest experiments , Rumpho and colleagues sequenced the chloroplast genes of Vaucheria litorea , the alga that is the sea slug ’s favourite snack .
They confirmed that if the sea slug used the algal chloroplasts alone , it would not have all the genes needed to photosynthesise .
They then turned their attention to the sea slug ’s own DNA and found one of the vital algal genes was present .
Its sequence was identical to the algal version , indicating that the slug had probably stolen the gene from its food .
“ We do not know how this is possible and can only postulate on it , ” says Rumpho , who says that the phenomenon of stealing is known as kleptoplasty .
One possibility is that , as the algae are processed in the sea slug ’s gut , the gene is taken into its cells as along with the chloroplasts .
The genes are then incorporated into the sea slug ’s own DNA , allowing the animal to produce the necessary proteins for the stolen chloroplasts to continue working .
Another explanation is that a virus found in the sea slug carries the DNA from the algal cells to the sea slug ’s cells .
However , Rumpho says her team does not have any evidence for this yet .
In another surprising development , the researchers found the algal gene in E. chlorotica ‘s sex cells , meaning the ability to maintain functional chloroplasts could be passed to the next generation .
The researchers believe many more photosynthesis genes are acquired by E. chlorotica from their food , but still need to understand how the plant genes are activated inside sea-slug cells .
Human photosynthesis ?
Greg Hurst of Liverpool University in the UK says that DNA jumping from one species to another is not unheard of but that normally the DNA does not appear to function in the new species .
“ Here we have something going across and working in an entirely different context , which is altogether more interesting , ” he told New Scientist .
“ There was an example recently of a whole bacterial genome that ended up in a fruit fly species , but no - one knows if it functions , ” he says .
“ What is really unique here is the fact that the gene is transferred and appears to function . ”
Other animals are able to harness sunlight after eating plants , says Rumpho , but this is only because they acquire entire plant cells , which is very different to transforming an animal cell into a solar - powered plant - animal hybrid .
It is unlikely humans could become photosynthetic in this way .
“ Our digestive tract just chews all that stuff up – the chloroplasts and the DNA , ” she adds .

Since my last name is n't Hilton , Trump , or Rockefeller , I wo n't be treating myself to any of these upscale handsets .
Yet , these luxury phones will certainly find a home .
Let 's break down the latest ridiculous offerings :
1 ) Samsung Ego GT - S9402 - Given the derivative design ( Vertu's Ferrari Ascent Ti came first ) , the Ego should be docked some originality points .
What will your $ 1,500 + get you ?
A 5 megapixel camera with LED flash , Bluetooth 2.0 , a microSDHC expansion slot , tri-band GSM connectivity , dual SIM slots , and an FM radio module .
The Ego lacks a 3G radio , which is almost as lame as the measly 1GB storage .
2 ) Bellperre Silver and Gold collection - Bellperre lets you choose from 100 exotic leathers such as crocodile , shark , lizard , and buffalo ( um , does PETA know about this ? ) to customize this phone .
In addition to precious gemstones affixed to the handset , you also get tri-band support , a 2 - inch TFT display of sapphire crystal , Bluetooth ( stereo ) , an MP3 player , Windows Mobile OS , IM , e-mail , and a camera with camcorder .
I could n't find any information on pricing , but believe me when I say I 'd rather use a payphone than pull a pink crocodile rose gold handset out of my purse .
3 ) Mobiado Professional 105GMT
Gold -
I 'm wondering what about this phone says " professional . "
This unfortunate handset looks like it belongs in a blinged - out music video , not a boardroom .
Its CNC - machined frame is crafted from sapphire crystal and ebony wood and dipped in 24 - carat gold , with two mechanical , self - winding Swiss watches below the keypad for God - only - knows why .
And the specs ?
You get a 2 - inch 320 - by - 240 res display , a 2 - megapixel camera , a quad - band GSM radio , Bluetooth , a Discovery watch mechanism , optional diamonds , and again , 1GB of built - in memory .
That hardly justifies whatever the made - to - order price is .
And oh yeah , only 50 of them will be made .
4 ) Vertu Boucheron
150 - Yeah , I could have picked on the Ferrari Ascent Ti , but this phone desperately wants attention , and I 'm going to oblige .
This handset is so ugly , I cringed .
The price includes the hideous wood packing box that this clunky , awkward handset arrives in .
This " solid gold " catastrophe is meant to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Boucheron jewelry house , took a total of 2,200 man hours to create , and costs more than your kid's teacher probably made last year ( $ 30,000 ) .
5 ) Gresso's Avantgarde Skeleton -
This collection is rather limited :
Only fifteen of these will be made , and that 's probably a wise choice .
Again , you get crystal sapphire glass ( for the transparent back panel and for the 240 x 320 display ) , Bluetooth 1.2 , a titanium alloy case , a battery case of stainless steel , and a leather cover with magnet release .
The back of this phone has the Gresso logo covered with 10 micron gold , and it runs Windows Mobile 6.0 .
And the price ?
Steep like Mount Everest : $ 5,000 .

Rhode Island authorities have ordered this illicit junkyard crushed immediately , but such an undertaking takes time .
Word says that these cars are slowly marching towards the fateful crusher , but there is hope .
The owner goes by the name of JR and he 's willing to make a deal .
For the address , you 've gotta swear to not go trampling around this guy 's backyard without his permission .
That 's uncool to start , but what 's more , you might be on the receiving end of a rock salt salvo .
Do n't say we did n't warn you .
Now that we 've got that out of the way , this dream junkyard can be found here , which is in the forests of Rhode Island .
If any readers decide to purchase some vintage iron from said junkyard , drop us a few pictures at tips@jalopnik.com .
Happy hunting .
Hat tip to Zack !

Creative Destruction : Time To Make Companies Small Enough To Fail
from the channeling - schumpeter dept
When he lectured on the economy at Harvard in the midst of the depression , Joseph Schumpeter would stride into the lecture hall , and divesting himself of his European cloak , announce to the startled class in his Viennese accent , " Chentlemen , you are vorried about the depression .
You should not be .
For capitalism , a depression is a good cold douche . "
Having been one of those startled listeners , I can testify that the great majority of us did not know that a douche was a shower , but we did grasp that this was a very strange and certainly un-Keynesian message .

The news is filled with stories of the latest bailout : this time of the US auto industry , and for some reason it has me thinking about Joseph Schumpeter .
Schumpeter , as ( hopefully ) many of you know , was an economist in the first half of the 20th century , who today is probably most well - known for two things : his championship of the concept of " entrepreneurs " and ongoing innovation as the process of economic growth , and the creation of profits , as well as the idea of " creative destruction " brought about by those entrepreneurs , taking down old industries with new ideas , new products and new processes .
There is much that Schumpeter got wrong in his analysis ( in general , I 'm not a huge fan of much of Schumpeter 's work ) , but throughout it all , there were some very important ideas that have been proven time and time again .
It 's important to revisit his work , as we 're seeing a sudden influx of economic philosophy " battles " between different schools of economists over how to deal with the financial crisis .
The new Keynesians still believe that through government tweaking , we can guide the economy to some sort of " soft landing . "
The more free market - focused economists fear the end result of such tweaking .
The split in schools of thinking has become significantly less pronounced than in the past , and ideas seem to permeate back and forth among these and other economic philosophies , but some core beliefs are common across most economists , and they 've been shown to be correct time and time again .
Innovation , driven by competition , is the core of economic growth .
Competition drives companies to keep innovating , creating better and better products ( often for less and less money ) .
Companies that rest on their laurels get beaten in the marketplace , and that 's good for everyone ( except , temporarily , employees and shareholders of those companies ) .
It gives the public better products , made more efficiently , and it keeps companies from becoming burdens .
Encouraging competition should be a key goal of government , but in most cases that means staying out of the way .
Unfortunately , things do n't always work out that way , and the government has often been much more involved than necessary , later causing problems .
This is often seen in a rush to send antitrust lawyers after a company for being successful , but not when it 's doing any actual harm on the market , or preventing any real competition from happening .
We also see it as a problem in the government 's intellectual property policies , which often do little to encourage innovation , and plenty to hinder it by creating defacto monopolies .
If the government should be involved at all , it should be to ( not create ) the infrastructure that 's necessary for further innovations .
It should be enabling the next generation of entrepreneurs to be creating the next great businesses .
But , rather than doing that , we see the government looking to prop up non-competitive , non-innovative behemoths that are being called " too big to fail . "
These are companies that , often with the help of government regulations and subsidies , have become so intertwined in the economy , that a failure on their part really would cause significant ripples throughout the rest of the economy .
While there are some who suggest they should be allowed to simply fail anyway , the economic risk in doing soquite large -- in part , as a result of bad gov't policies for many years , abused and exploited by these companies .
Simply giving these companies more money and new regulations is n't going to make a difference .
It only puts off the inevitable , and potentially will make things even worse when the problems resurface .
The regulations and " oversight " will seem like a good deal at first , but over time the companies will twist the regulations to their advantage .
They 'll create new and larger loopholes , and the regulations wo n't do what they 're intended to do , but will instead have created massive new problems .
It 's what almost always happens .
So perhaps it 's time to go back to Schumpeter , with a big twist .
If we grant the premise that some of these companies are too big to fail , and they absolutely need gov't bailouts to make them work , then why not set the terms of the bailout as being that they need to ?
That is , they can get the money , one time only , and then need to look at breaking themselves up into separate pieces ( even competitive pieces ) that , by themselves , are no longer too big to fail .
The end result is that you are n't left with the same terrible situation , while also creating a new generation of " spinoffs " that can innovate and compete against both older firms in the space , and new upstarts that can more readily enter the market , rather than face a few giants .
That way we 'remore competition and innovation , leading to economic growth , while dismantling the structure of " too big to fail .
"
It 's not quite that simple , of course .
But , on the whole , it makes absolutely no sense to be " bailing out " companies that are too big to fail while leaving them as too big to fail .
The end result is just going to keep sucking in more bailout money and wasting it , rather than encouraging innovation and competition .
This , obviously , is not the " creative destruction " that Schumpeter was talking about at all .
In fact , at times he toyed with the idea that companies too big too fail were where the market would eventually end up .
But , he also recognized the power of destroying old industries and setting the path for new innovations -- and he knew that the process was often messy , tied to business downturns .
In economist Robert Heilbroner 's excellent , Heilbroner recalls sitting in Schumpeter 's class at Harvard during the Great Depression :
And , indeed , this economic restructuring is a good cold shower ( though , some may prefer douche ) , but we do n't get that sort of restructuring when the government is propping up exactly what needs to be restructured .
So , let 's repurpose creative destruction with a clear plan : if you accept government bail out money because you 're too big to fail , then that money needs to be used to make you small enough to fail .

At 5 , the 30 Rock Emmy winner was slashed by a stranger
Since shooting to fame and winning Emmys as the star and creator of 30 Rock , Tina Fey has remained quiet about the dramatic story behind the faint scar that lines that left side of her face .
“ It ’s impossible to talk about it without somehow seemingly exploiting it and glorifying it , ” Fey , 38 , tells Vanity Fair in its January issue .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
But when she was 5 , the future TV star was playing in the front yard of her Upper Darby , Penn. , home when a stranger approached the young Fey and violently cut her cheek .
“ She just thought somebody marked her with a pen , ” says her husband , Jeff Richmond .
The Aftereffects
And while the experience was traumatizing , Fey worked hard to keep it from affecting her childhood .
“ I proceeded unaware of it .
I was a very confident little kid .
It ’s really almost like I ’m kind of able to forget about it , until I was on - camera , ” says Fey , whose scenes are often shot from the right side .
Though she has overcome the obstacle , Fey says that she does worry about how it may one day affect her role as a mother to daughter Alice , 3 .
“ Supposedly , I will go crazy , ” says Fey .
“ My therapist says , ‘ When Alice is the age that you were , you may go crazy . ’ ”

Went on Weight Watchers
Besides collecting her Emmy gold ,
Fey spent this fall mimicking GOP vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin to great acclaim ( even from the Palin camp ) on Saturday Night Live and signing a $ 5 - million book deal .
While Fey may be hotter than ever , it was n’t always the case for the 5 ’ 4 ″ beauty .
“ She was quite round , ” Richmond says of his wife ’s pre-fame days in Chicago , But “ in a lovely , turn - of - the - century kind of round – that beautiful , Rubenesque kind of beauty . ”
But after a makeover and going on Weight Watchers during her SNL period , Fey , who is half - Russian and half - Greek , knows what her greatest assets are .
Military adapting Wii controller for combat RAW STORY
Published : Friday December 26 , 2008
Print This Email This Military contractors are planning to use a popular video game controller to control combat robots .
The application of the " Wiimote , " the Discovery Channel reports , is being given a new look by scientists from the Idaho National Laboratory in collaboration with engineers from the US Army , Foster - Miller and iRobot .
The accompanying video report was broadcast on CNN's American Morning on December 26 , 2008 .

Nov. 1 , 2008  --
Early voting and absentee ballots are a hot topic this political season , but scientists say some folks are laying the groundwork for voting really early -- say from kindergarten .
" Little is known about the association between measured intelligence and how people participate in democratic processes , " says a current Intelligence journal study led by Ian Deary of Scotland 's University of Edinburgh , in a wee bit of an understatement .
" There is debate about the importance of intelligence in relation to whether people vote in elections , and there is currently little information on how people with different levels of intelligence choose to vote in elections , " according to the report .
To tackle the question , Deary and colleagues looked at a United Kingdom research project started in 1970 and continuing today that tracks about 17,200 people born that year .
The researchers check up on them every few years and included intelligence tests at age 5 and 10 , as well as voting affiliation and occupation at age 34 .
Running through the numbers , Deary and colleagues found that smarter folks voted more often , regardless of their occupation .
Average IQ scores are 100 and for every 15 IQ points above average , a study participant was 38 % more likely than average to have voted in the United Kingdom 's 2001 election , for example .
" People who took part in a political meeting or rally in the last year , those who took part in a public demonstration , those who signed a petition , and those who were fairly or very interested in politics had higher mean intelligence test scores at age 10 , " the authors also found .
But how did they vote ?
This was a hot question after recent U.S. national elections , where a chart -- bogus according to Snopes.com -- linking state IQ results to voting patterns proliferated on the Internet .
In 2000 , Seth Hauser of the University of Michigan suggested in the journal Social Science Research that " researchers will lose little if they ignore cognitive ability as a direct causal factor when formulating models of civic participation .?
But more recently , researchers such as Orla Doyle of Ireland 's University College Dublin have suggested otherwise .
" Childhood intelligence is associated with how and how much people engage in the democratic processes , and with support for political ideologies that are based on ecological sustainability and social liberalism , " conclude the Intelligence study authors .
For example , voters were 32 % more likely to vote for the UK's more left - wing Liberal party over the Conservative party for every 15 IQ points they scored above average as children .
They were more likely to be tree - huggers too , voting more often for environment - oriented parties .
" Although these data apply to one country 's political system , there are broad similarities in political parties across Western democracies , and so these data might have wider relevance beyond the UK , " say the authors .
Doyle , who was not part of the study is n't so sure , noting the United Kingdom has small political parties , the Greens and Liberal Democrats , as well as nationalist parties that play a larger role in political life than small U.S. parties .
" My only concern is that when examining the association between intelligence and voting they only adjust for sex and social class .
Normally , voting models control for a range of other individual characteristics that are known to predict vote choice such as trade union membership and , most importantly , education , " adds Doyle , by email .
" They really need to test this assumption to see if there relationship between intelligence and vote choice remains when they include education . "
Her own work in the United Kingdom suggests that " that higher intelligence scores are associated with Conservative voting on average . "
But " those with very high level of intelligence are less likely to vote Conservative and more likely to vote Labour , " Doyle adds .
Of course , " when candidates appeal to ' every intelligent voter , ' they mean everybody who is going to vote for them , " as the New York Tribune 's venerated columnist Franklin Pierce Adams wrote decades ago .
Scientific studies are n't likely to change that , but at least political junkies can take some comfort that following politics seems to be a pursuit for brainy folks , whatever way they are voting .

Kseniya Sukhinova from Russia competed against 108 contestants
Russian contestant Kseniya Sukhinova has won the Miss World 2008 competition at a ceremony in South Africa .
Trindad and Tobago's Gabrielle Walcott was second runner - up and India 's Parvathay Omanakuttan was first runner - up , from among 109 contestants .
Millions of people were expected to watch the annual pageant , being held in Johannesburg .
It was the sixth time that South Africa has held the event , more than any other country except England .
South Africa organisers were said to be keen to calm concerns about the country 's ability to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup .
For this first time in the competition 's history , viewers in 180 countries had the opportunity to vote for one of the semi-finalists through the internet .
An international jury decided the winner .
Miss Sukhinova is from Siberia , studying for an engineering degree .

Databases and procedural programming languages are excellent for automating the data and procedures of an organization .
However , they are n't very good for automating knowledge expressed as logical relationships or pattern - matching rules .
In this article , I describe the difficulties and benefits of switching from a procedural approach for encoding the rules for vaccination scheduling to a logic - base approach .
I worked closely with Visual Data LLC developers and medical experts in the design and implementation of this application .
I was responsible for the underlying Prolog code , the program interface to Delphi , and much of the initial knowledge engineering .
Office Practicum
Office Practicum is a software package from Visual Data LLC ( http://www.visualdatallc .com / ) that automates pediatric offices .
It does all of the things you might expect , such as front - office services like automating billing and the calendar of appointments , and back - office services that make it easier for doctors to review and maintain a child 's medical history .
All of these tasks fall nicely into classic " data processing . "
One particular Office Practicum data - gathering feature is an easy way of recording vaccinations children receive on visits , and associated reporting on the vaccination history .
Doctors using Office Practicum liked the feature , but wanted it to go further .
They asked Visual Data to add features that :
Advise on the vaccines that could or should be given during a visit .
Forecast future vaccinations for scheduling the next visit .
Compare the vaccine history with regulatory information for reporting to schools and summer camps .
Knowledge about vaccination scheduling is contained in documents like the Centers for Disease Control 's ( CDC ) periodical Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR ) , Department of Human Services ( DHS ) reports , drug company literature , and recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) and American Academy of Family Physicians ( AAFP ) .
This knowledge is usually expressed as a combination of :
Definitions of vaccine names , types of vaccines , and commercial product names .
Tables of schedules of doses and ages .
Exception rules covering interactions with other vaccines .
Rules for dealing with nonstandard vaccination schedules .
In other words , the knowledge is a collection of nonprocedural logical relationships sometimes in rules , sometimes in tables , and sometimes as definitions .
Conventional Tools for Logical Knowledge
There is a tremendous temptation to use standard tools for encoding this type of knowledge , and that is exactly what Visual Data did at first .
Visual Data is a Delphi shop , and its developers are comfortable with Delphi , and there 's a lot to be said for sticking to a single development platform .
Consequently , Visual Data pushed ahead with a pure Delphi solution to encoding the vaccination logic .
But it was difficult .
The primary problem was that the flow - of - control branching if - then statements of a procedural language did not have the same semantics as the pattern - matching if - then rules of logical relationships .
Developers must make arbitrary decisions of where in the flow - of - control to code each branch , thereby entangling the declarative rules in the thread of execution .
In the case of the vaccine knowledge , this was made more difficult by the interactions that can happen between vaccines , and the fact that many vaccines are actually combination vaccines covering multiple diseases .
For example , a child might get a measles vaccine and a rubella vaccine ; or a combined measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine .
Because measles is a live virus vaccine , it can't be given within a certain time period after any other live virus vaccine has been given ; and vice versa for other live virus vaccines .
Another difficulty was that the rules were expressed using date intervals and ages .
Intervals and ages could be expressed in days , weeks , months , or years .
To simplify the procedural coding , they converted all intervals to days , but this led to problems as months are n't all the same length .
Doctors complained that if they tried on March 15 to give a two - month dose to a child born on January 15 , the software would say the child was n't two months old yet .
Visual Data did , however , get it to work , although it did n't do everything they wanted it was difficult to write , and the 5000 + lines of Delphi code were abstruse at best .
Customers loved it , but were bothered by the date problems and wanted to know when the software would support the new combination vaccine , Pediarix , which included DTaP , hepatitis B , and polio vaccines ( DTaP is itself a combination of diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis vaccines ) .
Specialized Tools for Logical Knowledge
At this point , Visual Data decided to look at options for encoding the vaccination logic .
Clearly , some sort of declarative , rule - based tool would let them code the knowledge in a manner that was easier to maintain .
Developers looked at a number of tools available for rule - based programming , but they were all either designed for a specific application context , or were general - purpose tools not particularly well suited to encoding the vaccination knowledge .
Many were also prohibitively expensive .
In the end , they opted to use the logic programming language , Prolog , because it allowed for a much more flexible solution specifically adapted to their needs , and it could be easily integrated in the Delphi application .
Two Faces of Prolog
There are two ways to use Prolog for automating logical knowledge .
One is to code the knowledge directly in Prolog rules and rely on Prolog 's built - in reasoning strategy ; the other is to use Prolog to create knowledge structures and reasoning strategies custom tailored for the application .
The advantages of the first approach are that Prolog rules are easy to learn and apply , and compiled Prolog execution is extremely fast .
The main disadvantage is that the rules have precise semantics , which may or may not be well - suited for a particular application .
The advantages of the second approach are that the knowledge representation and reasoning strategy can be perfectly tuned for the application and can be developed quickly due to Prolog 's representational power for building such applications .
The disadvantage is that it is more difficult to learn to use Prolog for crafting custom knowledge base tools , and the runtime execution of the rules will be in an interpretive rather than compiled mode .
Architecture
As Figure 1 illustrates , Visual Data took a hybrid approach when building its " VacLogic " engine .
The definitions and tables were customized Prolog structures with underlying Prolog code to support their use .
The rules , on the other hand , used Prolog 's native syntax , but were made easier to write using a number of utility predicates that made it easy to reason over date and age quantities .
A Prolog file called the " reasoner " served as the engine for the application .
It was written by the software developers and is not intended to be maintained by the application domain experts .
It contains :
The application program interface predicates , called from Delphi for vaccine services .
The implementation of various utility predicates that handle date and age expressions .
The reasoning support for the definitional and tabular knowledge structures .
The predicates that are used to derive higher - level concepts from lower - level ones .
The basic strategy for using the rules to get the status of the various vaccinations .
A Prolog file called " general " contained the definitions of various vaccines , as well as citation information used for vetting the knowledge .
It is intended for use by in - house pediatric experts .
Each individual vaccine has a module that contains the tables and rules that apply to that vaccine .
When a module is consulted , the resulting output is stored with all the pertinent data about the vaccine , such as the next dose , the minimum date for the next dose , whether it is due today or up - to - date .
General Knowledge
The general knowledge is stored in an " ontology . "
Ontologies provide a way to store definitions of related concepts so that those concepts can be readily used by an application .
In this case , the ontology provides a way to record hierarchies of vaccine types and other types of relationships , such as critical definitions of which vaccines contain live viruses .
Listing
One presents some sample entries indicating that Varicella and Small Pox are live viruses : the three elements of the new Pediarix vaccine , various spellings of haemophilus influenzae ( Hib ) , and some of the PRP - OMP flavors of Hib .
These are in an is - a hierarchy of terms , so a rule referring to Hib correctly matches a data record referring to the vaccine PedvaxHIB , because it is -a PRP - OMP , and PRP - OMP is -a Hib .
The idea behind this representation is that it becomes easy to add new entries for different spellings , new vaccines , and new categories of vaccine that are needed by the rules .
In - house pediatric experts can directly examine the definitions and make additions and modifications as necessary .
This is clearly an advantage over the procedural approach , and also a big advantage over rule - based approaches that do not provide ontologies .
In a pure rule - based approach , these definitions would all have to be implemented as rules .
Having the writers of the rules stick to a limited vocabulary does n't work because so many different vaccines and spellings appear in the medical records .
It is the ontology that makes it practical to use the existing medical records .
Tables
The vaccine logic base is used to report on vaccines that can be given at a visit , and to forecast vaccines needed in the future .
There is both a minimum and recommended age for the forecast vaccines , as well as a minimum separation from the last vaccination .
These are reflected in the table entries .
Listing
Two is a table in the Hib module for Hib vaccines that contain PRP - OMP .
There are other tables for Hib reflecting other flavors of the Hib vaccine and schedules that were n't started on time .
As with the ontology entries , tables are intended to be easily reviewed and modified by in - house pediatric experts .
They also provide similar advantages over a pure rule - based approach .
This same knowledge could be encoded as multiple if - then rules , but it would not be as easy to verify or maintain .
Further , because the tables can use any date units , they can be entered almost exactly as they appear in the original documents , without need for conversions .
Rules
The rules use patterns in the data to determine the status of a particular vaccination , deciding whether or not to use a table , and how to qualify the results from the table , if necessary .
It would have been possible to generate a rule syntax customized for this application , but because the rules are crisp goal - driven rules that map nicely to Prolog native rules , Prolog syntax was used .
This approach also had the advantages of faster execution time and shorter development time , but the cost is that the rules are not as clear as they could have been with a custom rule syntax .
The rules are , however , compact and closely reflect the actual knowledge because of the helper predicates in the reasoner that support dates and date intervals .
Each module has as its main predicate status / 0 , which is called by the reasoning engine when it is time to get the information about a particular vaccine .
The status / 0 predicate might defer to other predicates to get the final results for a vaccine .
Listing
Three is a status rule in the Hib module that defers to late_start_status rules if the child has had two valid Hib vaccines but the second one was given after seven months of age .
( Other rules will have previously examined the past history and determined which vaccines were given at valid times . )
A rule that generates output usually has three parts : the conditions under which the rule applies , the calculations for status and dates , and the storing of key information about the vaccine .
Listing Four presents the conditions , calculations , and output expanded for a sample MMR rule .
The conditions rule in Listing Four (a ) applies if there have been measles vaccinations and there have been more than one live virus vaccination given .
The next dose is one more than the current count and the table from MMWR published by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) is used to get the minimum age and recommended age for the next vaccination .
The minimum spacing is not retrieved from the table because the rules for live virus spacing override it .
The calculations rule in Listing Four ( b ) easily refers to the last live virus vaccination .
This is made possible by the ontology .
Also , the recommended age is really a range , with a lower and upper bound .
Once the recommended dates are determined , a utility predicate in the reasoning engine is called to determine the status for a visit today .
This might indicate it's up to date , due , or not due yet but okay to give today .
As with the tables and ontology , the idea is to make the rules as readable as possible , but they do start to get complex .
On the other hand , the complexity is exactly equal to the complexity of the rule itself .
While the goal of the system was to allow in - house experts to work these rules as well , they did get a little too programmatic .
However , they can still be read and critiqued by experts during the vetting process .
The output portion of the rule , see Listing Four(c ) and Figure 2 , directs the reasoning engine to store certain information to be returned to the calling program in response to various requests .
The note is used in verbose reporting and is written by the in - house expert .
The dates , dose , and status are used for various reports .
Testing Tools
The reasoning engine and logic base modules have a test harness that is used for testing and debugging in a Prolog environment .
This allows the use of Prolog trace and debugging tools , as well as other development tools such as predicate cross references and outliners .
Test cases are stored in a file using ages for inputs that are used by the test harness as offsets for a randomly generated starting date .
Listing
Five is test data that is used to drive the MMR and Varicella modules .
The child is 18 months old and has had two MMR vaccinations .
The random dates used for this run ( Listing Six ) have the child born on 5/13/2002 and the date of the office visit as 11/13/2003 .
The output from the test indicates the types of data available from the vaccine logic base , including the history analysis feature of the system .
In the HISTORY report , the first measles vaccination was given too early and does not count , so for planning purposes , the MMR dose # 2 is next and the appropriate dates for that dose are provided .
Varicella was n't given when it should have been , and is behind schedule and due today .
The testing interface also provides for regression testing , so previous test cases can be automatically run and compared against known results .
Delphi Interface
For a given child , the Delphi program first goes to the database and extracts the pertinent information about past vaccinations .
That data is then asserted to the logic base .
The logic base is then queried from different parts of the Delphi code for different reasons .
For example , Figure 3 shows one part of the code displays for the doctor what vaccinations are due and / or allowed on today 's visit .
Another displays future requirements for scheduling follow - up office visits .
Another is used to generate camp , school , and other regulatory forms needed for reporting on a child 's vaccination history .
Future Plans
The development environment provides tools for testing and debugging the logic base , but uses text files for the various modules .
The structure of the various logical knowledge entities would map nicely to a graphical development environment , and this is planned as a future project .
Now that the logic base is a separate unit , it can be deployed and used in different contexts .
Visual Data is considering offering the history analysis portions of the vaccine logic base on the Web using a .NET architecture .
Cost Benefit
The benefits from the logic - base approach include :
A 90 percent reduction in code used for vaccine logic rules .
Direct access to the knowledge by in - house pediatricians .
Localization of all the vaccine logic , which used to be scattered in the different parts of the application with different needs .
Easy maintenance and quality - assurance testing .
Additional capabilities that were too hard to encode before , such as the complete analysis of past vaccination history and support for new multivaccine products .
All of these benefits add up to the one major benefit , which is that Visual Data 's software now provides better services for customers in this area , which is critically important in the running of a pediatric office .
The costs were :
Time spent investigating and learning about various alternative approaches for encoding the vaccination logic .
Software license fees .
A few months of development time .
Time spent learning the new technology .
The calendar time for the project was :
January : Start study of alternative approaches .
March : Begin application development .
June : Deploy to the field .
Conclusion
Unlike factual or procedural knowledge , logical knowledge is difficult to encode in a computer .
However , the ability for organizations to successfully encode their logical knowledge can lead to better services for users .
The question , then , is how best to encode logical knowledge .
It can be shoe - horned into data - and procedure - based tools , but the encoding is difficult , the knowledge becomes opaque , and maintenance becomes a nightmare .
Rule - based and logic - based tools are better suited to the encoding of logical knowledge , but require the selection of the proper tool for the knowledge to be encoded , and the learning of how to use that tool .
Off - the - shelf rule or logic tools sometimes provide a good solution , but often the knowledge representation of the tool does n't fit the actual knowledge , or the reasoning engine does n't use the knowledge as it is supposed to be used .
This leads to the same coding and maintenance problems experienced with conventional tools , but to a lesser extent depending on how big the semantic gap is between the knowledge and the tool .
A viable alternative is the building of a custom logic - based language and reasoning engine .
This allows for the closest fit between the coding of the knowledge and the actual knowledge , and for the cleanest integration between the tool and the rest of the application context .

The Dalai Lama , now a Nobel peace laureate , fled Tibet in 1959 China says it had " no choice but to postpone " a summit with the EU because of the French stance on the Dalai Lama , the Tibetan spiritual leader .
China 's foreign ministry said French President Nicolas Sarkozy 's plans to meet the Dalai Lama had " deprived the summit of a good atmosphere " .
Mr Sarkozy has said he will meet the Dalai Lama in Poland on 6 December .
France - holder of the EU 's rotating presidency - was to have hosted the EU - China summit on 1 December .
In China we have a saying , ' Whoever causes the problem should solve the problem '
Qin Gang
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
" To maintain good relations with France and the European Union , China has told France time and again to properly handle the Tibet issue , so as to create necessary conditions for the China - EU summit , " Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said .
" Regrettably , the French side has not actively responded to [ these ] efforts , so that the summit cannot be held in a good atmosphere , nor achieve its expected goals . "
Mr Qin added : " In China we have a saying , ' Whoever causes the problem should solve the problem ' .
It is not China that caused the present situation . "
Beijing has previously said Mr Sarkozy risks losing " hard - won " gains in ties with Beijing if he meets the Dalai Lama .
On Wednesday , an EU statement said " the European Union , which set ambitious aims for the 11th EU - China summit , takes note and regrets this decision by China [ to postpone it ] " .
It added that the EU planned to continue to " promote the strategic partnership it has with China " .
Territorial dispute The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 , after Chinese troops had crushed an uprising by pro-independence Tibetans .
Beijing says Tibet has been part of the Chinese nation since the 13th Century .
Many Tibetans disagree , pointing out that the Himalayan region was an independent kingdom for many centuries , and that Chinese rule over Tibet has not been constant .
Mr Sarkozy has said he plans to meet the Dalai Lama in the city of Gdansk on 6 December , where Poland will mark the 25th anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Lech Walesa , who led the anti-communist Solidarity union in the 1980s .
A French diplomat has confirmed that Mr Sarkozy still intends to meet the Dalai Lama in Poland next week , the BBC's Oana Lungescu reports from Brussels .
During a trip to France this summer , the Dalai Lama met Mr Sarkozy 's wife Carla Bruni and the foreign minister Bernard Kouchner .
Earlier this year the EU voiced serious concern about a crackdown by Chinese authorities on Tibetan protesters .

Deflation and the Destruction of America 's Wealth
Martin Weiss writes :
The deflation we 've been warning you about is here , and it 's striking hard .
Last week , the Fed released a report that sent chills down the spine of economists all over the world , revealing a sweeping destruction of wealth in America .
Just in the third quarter alone , U.S. households lost $ 647 billion in real estate ; $ 922 billion in stocks ; $ 523 billion in mutual funds ; $ 653 billion in life insurance and pension fund reserves ; plus $ 128 billion in private business interests .
Total destruction of household wealth in the third quarter : $ 2.8 trillion , the worst in recorded history .
That 's four times more than the government 's entire $ 700 billion bailout package ( TARP ) .
Total destruction of household wealth in the last year : $ 7.2 trillion or over TEN times more than the $ 700 billion TARP package .
Meanwhile , the Treasury reports that only $ 330 billion of the TARP funds have been committed so far .
Worse , most of the funds that have reached the banks are sitting idle in their coffers .
If as much as $ 30 billion has trickled down to households , I 'd consider it a minor miracle .
See the contrast ?
The destruction of wealth is large and swift ; the government rescues , relatively small and slow .
Yes , the White House may decide to shift some of the TARP money to cover General Motors and Chrysler 's cash needs for the next few weeks ; they do n't want the auto giants going down on their watch .
But even if they can somehow save GM and Chrysler for now , they cannot save the countless smaller and medium - sized companies that are going bankrupt .
They cannot save the thousands of municipalities and states that are running out of money .
They certainly cannot make whole the millions of households that have gotten smacked with the $ 7.2 trillion in losses .
More evidence of deflation :
U.S. consumer prices falling at an annual rate of 12 % !
U.S. producer prices falling at an annual rate of 26.4 % !
Commodity prices slammed by as much as 70 % from their peak !
My friend , these are not numbers that denote less inflation .
They are hard evidence of deflation !
Your Next Steps
The critical question of our time :
Will this deflation be less severe , equally severe or more severe than the 1929 - 1932 deflation ?
If I were you , and you 've got your portfolio or your 401 k in stocks or stock mutual funds , I would n't stick around for the answer .
Yet that 's what most Wall Street experts are telling you to do .
Two full years after the first obvious signs of a housing industry collapse , most people who give advice about investing are still in denial .
Wall Street cheerleaders refuse to admit that an obviously massive deflation can lead to an equally massive collapse in the nation 's economy .
They 've repeatedly sworn on a stack of Bibles that the deflation in housing would “ soon end , ” the crisis would be “ contained ” and everything would be “ just fine . ”
They 've tried to persuade nearly every investor to stay the course , keep their money in the stock market , or even buy more .
But as 2008 comes to a close , no one can possibly deny that the U.S. economy is in deep trouble .
Anyone can see the evidence — the sharpest declines in the economy since the 1970s , the worst debt crisis in a lifetime , the largest financial failures and bailouts in history .
Everyone can also agree on the likely causes — the economic blunders of Washington , the financial greed of Wall Street , the big debts and bets by almost everyone .
And no one could dispute the probable consequences — surging unemployment and potentially years of hardship for millions of Americans .
Yet despite this widespread agreement , nearly every authority still tries to persuade you to keep your money in the stock market .
Financial experts on NBC Nightly News tell millions of viewers that , as long as they 've got plenty of years to live and recoup losses , they should continue investing most of their 401k or IRA in stocks .
Suze Orman on Oprah advises millions more to continue socking away their retirement money in stocks regardless of any market decline .
In Time Magazine , the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal and virtually every newspaper in the country , similar advice is liberally dispensed .
Their unwavering message : Do n't sell .
Stick with it .
Buy more .
It 's not a symptom of conspiracy and , in most cases , it 's not a sign of intellectual dishonesty .
The majority of pundits sincerely believe in what they are advising you , and many follow the same strategy with their own money .
But that does not make it good advice .
Consider Dad's tale of the average investor 's woes in America 's First Great Depression , and you 'll understand what I mean :
“ I was a young broker in 1930 , and the advice my senior colleagues gave out used to make me cry inside .
‘ Just hang on to your stocks for the long term and ride out the storm , ' they said .
“ The results were devastating for their clients .
“ If you bought the average stock in 1929 and held on until 1932 , you wound up with about 10 cents on the dollar .
And that 's if you bought the good stocks — the ones that survived .
If you bought the bad stocks — in bankrupt companies — you'd be left with nothing , a big fat zero .
“ Then , even if all of your companies survived , it was n't until 1954 — 25 years later — that you could finally recoup your original investment , provided you could stick it out that long .
“ Unfortunately , most people could n't .
They lost their jobs .
They risked losing their house .
So they were forced to cash in their stocks with huge losses .
For them , the idea of ‘ holding on for the long term ' was a joke , an insult , or both .
They did n't have that choice .
Later , when the market eventually recovered , they never got the chance to recoup their losses . ”
Even if you do n't believe that the late 2000s was comparable to the early 1930s , there is ample reason to exit the stock market .
Just consider these facts and connect the dots :
Fact # 1 . Between 1965 and 1980 , America suffered through a long dead zone punctuated by periodic debt troubles , credit crunches , financial failures , housing market declines , recessions and bear markets .
For a decade and a half , most investors lost money in the stock market .
Fact # 2 .
The financial crisis that has struck America in 2008 is evidently far worse than anything we experienced during that 1965 - 1980 dead zone .
The debt problems are far bigger .
The bankruptcies make earlier episodes look small by comparison .
And the nationwide bust in housing is much deeper than anything experienced in history .
So it 's reasonable to assume that the experience of investors could be at least as bad as , and possibly worse than , that experienced in the 1960s and 1970s .
Fact # 3 .
A decline in the second largest economy of the modern world , Japan , began in 1990 ; has lasted for 18 long years ; has taken the Nikkei Average down 82 % ; and , as of this writing , is still not over .
Now consider this :
The crisis that struck Japan in the early 1990s was ALSO less severe than the global crisis striking us right now .
What About This Time ?
No one knows how far stocks will fall , how long they will stay down , or how soon they will recover .
No one knows how many banks , insurance companies , brokerage firms , or manufacturing corporations will go bankrupt .
No one can say if the government bailouts will make things better , just keep things from getting worse , or cause even more serious troubles .
All we do know with relative certainty is this :
As long we have a financial crisis , recession or depression , the risk of loss is greater than the opportunity for profit — especially in the stock market !
If you 're a gambler , if you do n't mind betting against the odds , and if you have plenty of extra cash to play with , that may be a risk - reward you can overcome with trading acumen and good luck .
But if you want to build a nest egg for your retirement or your kids ' education , if you want to sleep nights during topsy - turvy stock market gyrations , if your net worth has been diminished by real estate losses , if you 're worried about losing some or all of your income in a recession or depression , then staying invested in the stock market during a financial crisis is absolutely , positively nuts !
We are obviously living in risky times .
So why would you want to double the whammy by putting your money in obviously risky investments ?
Yes , I know .
Your broker , your financial planner — even some of your best friends — are cajoling you to stay in the market .
My view :
If they fooled you once , shame on them .
If they fool you again , shame on you !
Certainly , you are well aware of the catastrophic events that have already happened .
You must realize that these events are likely to lead to further economic declines .
And if the economy falls , it should be clear that nearly all of us , yourself included , will be affected in some way .
You also must know by now that the same old assurances from Washington and Wall Street — that “ all is fine , ” that they will soon “ lick the problem , ” that the latest , biggest bailout is “ finally working ” — have been proven wrong over and over again .
You must be able to conclude , without my help or anyone else 's , that if ever there was a time when stock market investing is too risky , this is it .
If your goal is to save money for the future purchase of a home , retire in dignity , give you children and grandchildren educational opportunities or have enough money to cover your long - term care , and you still own stocks or stock market mutual funds , then get your money out of danger before it 's too late !
Start selling !
Naturally , precisely when and how much you should sell will depend on actual market conditions .
But as a rule of thumb …
If the stock market is rallying and up significantly , sell everything .
Just call your broker and say : “ Sell all my stocks at the market . ”
If the stock market is falling and already down sharply , tell your broker to sell half as soon as possible .
Then sell the balance on any rally .
If the market is in a panicked frenzy , overrun by an uncontrollable crowd of sellers and virtually devoid of all buyers , wait .
Do n't sell immediately .
As soon as the panic subsides , then sell half .
And as soon as there 's a decent rally , then sell the balance .
If you own stocks you are unable or unwilling to sell , as an alternative , consider buying hedges , such as inverse ETFs , that can help offset your losses .
And …
If you work with a money manager , ask him about investment programs designed specifically for bear markets , along with their performance track record during both up and down markets .
If it 's solid , you can use a bear market program as a vehicle for either protection or profit .
No matter what approach you use , this is no time for complacency .
Act boldly but prudently .
Then get your money to safety .
Good luck and God bless !

Want to give Barack Obama a piece of your mind about what ’s wrong with the United States government ?
Just go to www.change.gov and click on “ Share Your Ideas . ”
A man named John from Seattle did : “ I am so tired of special interests getting the best of us all . ”
So did Lexington from San Diego : “ I ’d like to see an agenda that focuses on promoting transparency .... ”
The website is the official , online face of the Office of the President Elect .
It gives a first glimpse of how Mr. Obama intends to harness technology to create a cutting - edge , participatory democracy in a similar way he used Internet connectivity to transform campaigning .
The idea is premised on the digital world ’s potential to transform the US into one large cyber town - hall meeting :
Every citizen will ideally have a window into the workings of government and an opportunity to tell elected leaders exactly what they think of it .
It ’s an idealistic notion that will require some concrete changes – from a large investment in upgrading government computers to a change in the rules and regulations that guide government employees .
Most important , it will require a radical transformation of the entrenched culture of secrecy and the dominance of special interests that define how Washington operates .
“ This will be the first president who has an opportunity to use interactive technology in ways we ’ve never seen – it really is remarkable , ” says Gary Bass , executive director of OMB Watch , a nonprofit organization that promotes greater government accountability and transparency in Washington .
“ What was so unique about the Obama campaign [ was ] that interactivity was real .
When people commented on something , they saw things happen .
That ’s what the people are expecting the president to do now . ”
Obama will not be the first online president .
That was Bill Clinton , who set up the White House ’s first website in 1994 and in 1996 ordered all federal agencies to get online as well .
The websites were pretty rudimentary sources of information .
President Bush took that a step further , turning the White House website into a “ repository of all the things the president was doing on that day , ” according to David Almacy , who was the White House ’s Internet director from 2005 to 2007 .
But as Mr. Almacy discovered , much of what the White House could do was constrained by a lack of resources .
He had a staff of six to run the White House ’s Internet operations .
The Obama campaign had 95 people .
Then there are the federal rules and regulations .
For instance , when Mr. Bush went to New Orleans in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina , he urged Americans to log on to RedCross.org .
Almacy decided to put up a link on the White House website .
Within hours , the White House counsel ’s office was directing him to take the link down because it might be perceived as endorsing one organization over another , says Almacy .
There are privacy questions , too .
Many websites use “ cookies , ” electronic calling cards that websites leave on your computer to identify you if you return .
Federal privacy policy discourages their use , saying there should be a “ presumption ” that they ’re not used on federal websites .
But there is a loophole .
Cookies can be used if an agency can demonstrate a compelling need and gets special permission .
The Obama transition team is taking advantage of that .
Change.gov uses cookies and states that in its privacy policy .
“ Obama will probably run into some more rules that are going to need amending , ” says Robert Bluey , director of the Center for Media and Public Policy at the Heritage Foundation .
“ But I think it ’s absolutely great that people will have more opportunity to have a say in government and it ’s pretty evident from change.
gov that ’s the direction that Obama ’s going to take . ”
Obama has set out a clear road map as to how he hopes to accomplish that .
It starts with the appointment of a chief technology officer with cabinet - level powers who will oversee technological operations across the government .
“ Most people from the 20th century think of technology as a separate issue from others like healthcare or energy , but it ’s not just one of many issues [ like one of many slices of a pie ] , it ’s the pan that supports innovation and change for all of the other issues , ” says Andrew Rasiej , copresident of techpresident.com .
“ It ’s essential that the Obama administration put someone in a position who understands that . ”
Federal employees will also have to change how they operate , setting up pilots in citizen participation , which means “ Wikis [ websites where visitors can change the content ] , comment sections , collaborative projects , public review of pending policies , and online dialogues , ” says Mr. Bass .
That may not sit well with some longtime federal employees .
“ It ’s a radical change , ” says Ari Schwartz , vice president of the Center for Democracy and Technology .
“ But it ’s in line with the way our government is supposed to work . ”
Then there ’s the larger question of whether a citizenry that ’s disillusioned with government is ready to get more involved .
The optimists here abound .
“ What ’s been proven through this election process is that there ’s a newly engaged and empowered citizenry that is ready , able , and willing to partner with the Obama administration on rebooting American democracy in a 21st - century model of participation , ” says Mr. Rasiej .
President - elect Barack Obama has picked “ the anti-Obama ” to be his chief of staff , said Barrie McKenna in Canada ’s Globe and Mail .
Rep. Rahm Emanuel , a fellow Chicagoan and former Clinton advisor , is a political fighter whose hard - hitting style earned him the nickname “ Rahmbo . ”
Where Obama exudes “ poise , self - control , and even - temperedness , ” Emanuel is “ prone to angry , profanity - filled outbursts . ”
Former Democratic aide Paul Begala says Emanuel ’s style is “ a cross between a hemorrhoid and a toothache ” — and that ’s coming from a friend .
With Emanuel on staff , the Obama administration is already tilted toward Israel , said Dubai ’s Al - Bayan in an editorial .
“ Emanuel is the son of one of the top terrorists in the Irgun gang , ” a militant Zionist group that “ has the black record of committing the mass slaughters against the Arabs in Palestine before and after its usurpation in 1948 . ”
His father , Israeli citizen Benjamin Emanuel , admitted in a recent interview in Israel ’s Ma’ariv newspaper that Rahm , who speaks Hebrew , would influence the president to be pro-Israel .
“ Why would n’t he ? ” the elder Emanuel said .
“ What is he , an Arab ?
He ’s not going to be mopping floors at the White House . ”
But Israelis can’t be complacent just because Obama has a few Jews on his staff , said Elyakim Haetzni in Israel ’s Yedioth Ahronoth .
After all , Rahm Emanuel was n’t such a great friend to Israel when he was serving under Clinton .
In 1996 , Emanuel actually “ threatened ” then –Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with “ a harsh response from the U.S. administration ” if Netanyahu continued his hard line against the Palestinians .
Palestinians who have met with Obama , meanwhile , report getting a sympathetic response that “ they had n’t heard from any other president . ”
That ’s troubling , and it explains why some Israeli analysts fear that Obama will drop the demand that Palestinians renounce terror as a precondition to negotiations .
Let ’s all “ take a deep breath , ” said Claude Salhani in Egypt ’s Middle East Times .
It ’s too early to tell how Obama will deal with the Israeli - Palestinian issue .
Some Arab journalists have been spewing “ verbal diarrhea , ” accusing Emanuel of being a secret agent for Israeli intelligence .
The truth is , he is loyal to just one entity : the Democratic Party .
As for his fluency in Hebrew , that should bother the Israelis , not us .
During the Wye River negotiations in 1998 , Emanuel “ made members of the Israeli delegation very nervous ” because he told Clinton everything the Israelis were saying among themselves .
It remains to be seen how Obama will approach the Middle East .
But for now , let ’s “ give the next American president and his team the benefit of the doubt . ”
Emacs is just as good for PHP .
Why VIM ?
Why not .
Basic PHP development in VIM is obviously no problem : we have highlighting , we have indenting - but what are the options when we want to get serious ?
Here 's a list of plugins I found especially useful .
Syntax checking checksyntax : provides syntax checking for PHP , ( La ) TeX and Ruby .
Note that you 'll need display_errors set to stderr in php.ini for this to work .
Folding phpfolding :
What it says , and it Just Works .
Documenting
This is a bit more complicated .
First you need to decide on a documenting system .
phpDocumentor and Doxygen seem to be the most widely used .
phpDocumentor is obviously written specifically for PHP , but it feels sluggish - though that 's just my opinion .
Doxygen is originally written for C and C++ , but PHP shares much of it's syntax with them , so that 's a non-issue .
For phpDocumentor there are several plugins .
I found PDV ( PHP Documentor for Vim ) the nicest .
It lets you insert comment blocks with a shortcut , and extracts as much as possible from the definition ( name , visibility , arguments ) .
Same goes for Doxygen .
DoxygenToolkit is ( like Doxygen itself ) written for C/C++/ Java , but it gets things right in PHP most of the time .
Doxygen - via - Doxygen looks promising : it uses Doxygen to actually generate the comments .
Elegant .
I can't comment on quality though , have n't tried it myself ( download an XSLT processor , set up the XSLT file , I 'm tired for that now ) .
Highlight MySQL Serious PHP usually means a database , and some kind of SQL at that - so why not syntax - highlight the SQL code ?
Yeah , I know , it looks funny inside strings , but I like it - YMMV .
One : you need SQL highlighting in sql files ( you most likely already have that ) .
Two : stick the following line somewhere it gets executed ( I put it in ~/.vim/ftplugin/php/custom.vim ) : let php_sql_query = 1
Additional suggestions are welcome .
Not out of courtesy , I genuinely am interested .
Steve 41 oo Reply History is usually recorded from the point of view of the victor .
Are we capable of standing back from this , and recognising objectively a war crime as a war crime , even if it was ' our ' side that committed it ?
Was the deliberate targeting of German civilians a crime , or just another horrific act of war ?
I do n't know ....
I 'm just asking the question , and reaching for my tin hat before the answers come in !

1 Reply War Crime : According to The New Oxford English Dictionary :
" An action carried out during the conduct of a war that violates the accepted international rules of war " .
So who decides what is a war crime and what is n't ?
The victors , of course .
And the victors in the last World War - the Allies - formed the United Nations and decided , retrospectively , that War Crimes had been committed by Nazi Germany , Italy and Japan .
The Nuremburg Trials were the template for future International War Crimes Courts and Tribunals .
I tend to take the simplistic view .
The Luftwaffe allegedly mistakenly dropped bombs on central London which started off the tit - for - tat rounds of civilian / city bombings .
But I have to say that Allied bombing of Germany was aimed primarily at the disruption of industrial ability .
My view is that there would have been no bombing if there had been no war .
What are the accepted international rules of the conduct of the war ?
Death of anyone by any means is unacceptable , but if one is going to conduct a war then the quickest of achieving an end to that war is accpetable WITHIN ONE'S OWN MORAL bounds .
The blame game initiated by Jorge Friedrichs will only stand up if one can forget the horrors of the Death Camps ; the murder of the mentally handicapped , the gyspies , the Poles and the Russians .
Who can say the what the mood of the German people was in the Thirties when Herr Hitler was at his most blood - thirsty .

3 Reply I would say that , by and large , Germany suffered in far smaller proportion to the murderous activities of it's leadership -- a leardership which was followed , until the bitter end , without any significant opposition .
By the way , please do not drag out that hoary old chestnut of Napoleon 's that history is written by the victors .
Were that so , his historical image would be considerably blacker than it is .
I will agree that the initial impression people have of an event is governed by the information which is available to them , and , therefore , the " victors " can control public opinion -- for a while , but not for very long .
As regards specifics of bombing policy , it is important to make distinctions about what goals were pursued .
Our English correspondents may not like this .
Americans attempted ( and largely succeeded , despite the heavy - handed attempt of Anti-war , Vietnam era historians to claim otherwise ) to practice a day - light precision bombing against Germany and Austria .
This cost the United States , in casualties in the air , the equivalent or more than two full infantry divisions .
Since the victors do n't always write history , i'd like to refute the claims made by historians in the late 1960's and early 1970's ( who opposed bombing North Vietnam ) that American bombing in the second world war was ineffective .
Albert Speer , after surveying the bombing damage done at Schweinfurt ( the ball - and roller - bearing center in Germany at the time ) , grew very pessimistic about the likely results if such bombing continued .
He estimated on his first inspection tour that 65 % of Germany 's ball - and roller - bearing production had been lost for at least three months .
He was greatly relieved -- at first -- as the Americans did not immediately renew the attack .
American casualties were very heavy on that raid , and policy makers were considering abandoning the daylight , precision bombing doctrine for the English policy - - night - time area bombing .
Churchill and the RAF 's Harris had decided that factory workers who could not sleep could not work effectively the next day -- that , at least , was the very flimsy fig leaf with which they covered what looks very much to me like revenge bombings against the monsters who had almost destroyed Coventry .
" Arthur Harris and Sons , House Removers " was the grim joke the air crews made about what was an undisguised attack on civilian areas .
Bomber Harris pursued this policy right into the final days of the War .
By contrast , after the Schweinfurt raid , the Americans largely stopped strategic bombing altogether .
They had thought their raid a failure at Schweinfurt , and a limited success at Regensburg , where a Messerschmidt factory was located ( air crews always like bombing fighter factories ) .
Their analyses at the time were faulty , and the attack on the ball - and roller - bearing industry was much more effective .
The Germans eventually dispersed their manufacturing facilities , but the machine tools for that type of precision work are very sensitive , and many that suffered no direct hit were damaged by vibrations , water from fire - fighting , dust from falling masonry .
German weapons of that war were grossly overbuilt -- the " Tiger " and " Panther " tanks were without peer on the battlefield , and they were also slow and expensive to build .
The Germans produced a few thousand of those ; Russians produced more than 100,000 tanks , and the United States produced over 50,000 Sherman tanks alone .
The continued attacks on specific industries by the American daylight raiders had a profound effect .
Gradually , production in all areas ground to a halt -- with insufficient material resources , replacement parts for agricultural machines and systems disappeared .
The railroads were next , and , when things got really bad , submarine production began to slow and then halt , for a lack of necessary parts .
American daylight raiding was greatly enhanced when the P51 Mustang became available .
As Chuck Yaeger once put it : " What the Spitfire could do for 40 minutes , the Mustang could do for eight hours . "
Goering , when asked when he knew the war was over , said when he saw the first Mustang over Berlin .
With adequate escort , daylight raids got through in ever growing numbers of planes , able to put their bomb loads on or very near the targets .
If one simply wants to count any civilian casualties as war crimes , everyone who ever goes to war in the mechanical age will be a war criminal .
Targeted civilian areas are different , and may well qualify .
By that standard , the RAF committed war crimes throughout the war .
They can make the disclaimer that their raids were reprisals , which is rather thin , though .
Two massive " 1000 plane " raids were made against Cologne , and this was definitely a revenge raid -- there were n't sufficient military objectives in the area for that number of bombers to hit when flying in as a single - attack , no matter how the waves of bombers were organized .
The greatest " war crime " in terms of a bombing raid against Germany in the second world war was the bombing of Dresden .
The Germans had tried very hard NOT to make this beautiful city a target .
The Americans and English bombed it to hell , just for spite .
They methodically chose a method which would assure maximum destruction .
First , large incendiary bombs were dropped .
This was followed by " block " busters , to spread the initial fires , and to destroy the water mains which would be needed to fight the fires .
This was followed by lots of small incendiaries to spread fires over a wide area -- and finally , specific pattern - bombing with 500 - and 1000 - pound bombs to start the " fire storms " which had so devasted Hamburg .
Perhaps this raid , and others qualify as war crimes -- the Dresden raid would be the best candidate for this .
But when you 're fighting a fanatical and cruel enemy and your best intelligence assessments tell you the enemy will fight on with all resources ( which they did , as best they were able ) , perspectives change .
It is straining a comparison , but -- when the cops get in a shoot - out with armed criminals who have demonstrated that they will kill , we generally do n't expect them to put their lives on the line while demanding that they do n't shoot anyone too much .
Yes , many operations in the second world war by allied forces might be termed war crimes .
Compare this to what has gone before in history , and our responses were fairly civilized given the horrendous crimes of the opponent .
There is a valid distinction to be made between the actions of an agressor , and a belligerant who seeks to end the agressor 's reign of terror .

Why do you call Jörg Freidrichs book " blame game " ?
( That 's exactly what some Nazis said , when he discovered how many ex-Nazis had worked as judges in Germany or wrote in another how Jewish Germans were kicked out in banks and industry - and by whom . )
Do you think that this was n't done scientific enough ?

1 Reply Alleged guilt for civilian casualties prior to 1948 - 49 .
There is an unfortunate tendency for folks to judge the past by present conditions and values .
It is important that we bear in mind the conditions and accepted values prevalent during the period under discussion .
Were the Romans guilty of war crimes by salting the earth of Carthage , and enslaving the surviving population ?
Prior to the Nuremberg Trials many of the " crimes " that Nazi leaders were convicted of did n't exist in International Law .
Modern technology made possible state murder on such a scale that the International Community was " forced " to impose new standards on what comprises " legitimate means of waging war " .
The horrors of the Nazi ideals " justified " for most of the world 's community application of Ex Post Facto Law to individual Nazi leaders .
The Nuremberg Trials , and the formation of an " effective " United Nations , had important ramifications to how we regard things today .
Prior to 1948 - 49 , the destruction of enemy property and civilians was not a crime .
Quite the contrary , many military strategists accepted the idea that destruction of the enemy population 's moral and will to resist was a key to victory .
The killing potential of fully automatic weapons , chemicals , and modern artillery had been amply demonstrated in the trenches of WWI .
The casualty lists devastated European populations and leaders .
If wars were to continue , the lethality of warfare had to be reduced .
Strong pacifist movements developed in all of the advanced nations , and later contributed to the reluctance to militarily react to German aggression .
The ultimate alternative to war is surrender , and probable extinction of one 's group / culture .
If we are unwilling to fight , then we will perish in the face of actual , or threatened violence .
The Butcher 's Bill for the Great War also strongly influenced those who understood that pacifism is an ineffective response to aggression .
One example is found in Churchill 's preference for an attack against the " soft underbelly " because of his fear that direct attacks across the Channel would result in the same blood costs suffered in the Great War.
Giulio Douhet in his The Command of the Air ( 1921 ) theorized that the massive use of air power against enemy populations would reduce the carnage of future wars by destroying the enemy 's capacity to wage war .
Douhet 's ideas contributed to the development of blitzkrieg , and he was the father of strategic bombing .
Until WWII , there was no opportunity to test the validity of Douhet 's concepts .
Can a war be won by air power alone ?
The initial results obtained during WWII were mixed .
War production could be crippled , logistics disrupted , and the enemy 's command , control , and communications system rendered less effective .
On the other hand , enemy moral ( both civilian and uniformed ) was not adversely affected by strategic bombing .
That is , German attacks against civilian centers did not destroy the British Will to continue the fight .
Neither did the German populace rise to demand surrender after the much more effective air campaign waged by the Allies .
In fact , there is some evidence to support the notion that bombing civilian targets actually stiffened resistence .
It has been argued that the relative failure of the WWII air campaigns to decisively turn the tide of battle was due to technical limitations .
It took an enormous number of aircraft to deliver the bomb loads needed to " destroy " any target .
The cost in money , men and machines , prevented the application of enough force to be decisive .
Accuracy with the bombsights and unguided munitions of the day was notorious .
Of thousands of bombs dropped in a single raid , only a few exploded effectively on target .
Bomb Damage Assessment was , and remains , very problematical .
How does one determine if an industrial plant is out of action for a significant amount of time A small bit of unseen shrapnel may totally disable a piece of artillary , but then again a tube thrown from it 's carriage may be brought back on line with relative ease .
With the advent of nuclear weapons and " modern " delivery systems ( ICBM and long - range bombers ) , proponents of air power were convinced that finally Douhet 's dream could be fulfilled .
The Strategic Air Command was America 's ultimate defense against Soviet aggression , and the Cold War was on in earnest .
The threat of nuclear annihilation kept the world from unrestricted warfare long enough for the industrial might of the West to bankrupt the flawed economic system of Communism .
There are still those who fervently believe that an air campaign , if strong and effectively enough applied , can achieve victory with little or no need for traditional forces .
The smart munitions and advanced delivery systems used in recent operations have caught the imagination of many .
Modern proponents of air power will point out that it is so effective that our enemies are forced to adoped terrorist tactics , rather than to stand against us force on force .
Proponents of air superiority has many supporters who are unwilling to pay the blood - price that every military conflict must exact .
Personally , I think over reliance on air power is dangerous and ultimately ineffective .
We have become a nation that believes in the tooth - fairy , and the essential goodness of our fellow man - even after he as demonstrated his willingness to kill thousands .
Our enemies do not subscribe to the same Rules of Engagement that we do .
The enemy has no compunction against the use of weapons of mass terror and destruction .
We shudder to think that some civilians , or even enemy soldiers , might be injured or die as a result of our efforts to defend Americans and the Free World .
The enemy believes , with some justification , that if we only see a line of what used to be called body bags , we will fold our tents and silently fade away .
I believe that Saddam , and others of his ilk , are wrong about that , but it is that belief that encourages aggression .
The enemy justifies their actions as the only means available for their culture to survive and triumph over the challenges presented by Western materialistic values .
Values accepted by most of the Western world since WWII make defense against a terrorist strategy very difficult .
Notions about what is " right " were very much altered during the Cold War .
The advent of Political Correctness during the 60's has had a profound impact on what Americans regard as acceptable war .
We are criticized when a single " innocent " is killed during an operation against a terrorist cell with the blood of thousands on their hands .
When we guide a missile onto a location where the enemy is plotting the destruction of our way of life .
Is that murder ?
Of course , the enemy would make the same argument .
War is not a tea party , and the definition of what comprises war at the beginning of the 21st century is far different than what existed at the beginning of the 20th , the 19th , and countless other centuries far back into history .
We need to see clearly , the nation and Western values are seriously under attack by a determined enemy who believes that he has nothing to lose and everything to gain .

I am somewhat surprised , as by the definition you posted :
" ... wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages , or devastation not justified by military necessity ... "
is a war crime
As I mentioned , my father was in the RAF .
He was not a war criminal .
Neither in my opinion was ' Bomber ' Harris .
But possibly those in political control , who knew and sanctioned what was going on , were .

War is - any war , at any time - a dirty game with unclear or no rules .
When you look at the development of the " Law of War "
- eg. here :
you 'll notice that the miscellaneous treaties , conventions and agreements always lag behind .
Well , the definition is the " official " from the Nürnberg tribunal .

I really do n't know what constitutes a war crime , nor where responsibilty lies .
Neither do the lawyers and judges or any of us for that matter .

1 Reply Like Walter , I lost some people near and dear to me to Allied bombs .
And we were non-German refugees in the areas that were being bombed .
Some of my earliest childhood memories center on running for shelter when the sirens went off .
Schweinfurt in 1950 , five years after the war ended , was still a ruin .
I remember it well , as it was the next - to - last stop we made in Germany prior to immigrating to the United States .
The last stop was Bremenhaven which had n't suffered too much damage .
It was in Beremenhaven that I saw my first traffic light .
Had never seen one before and had to ask what it was for .
I was 11 years old .
I throughly agree with everything both Asherman and Setanta have said .
I believe the bombing helped the Allies win and , in the long run , that is the important factor .
Dresden is the only fly in the ointment .

1 Reply Thorny issue here ... but the prime objective of war is to destroy your enemy 's will and ability to make war on you .
An enemy 's means of production and related assets are legitimate targets .
Given the state of the art of warfare at the time , it was nescessary in WWII to destroy the city hosting an industrial complex to be assured of destroying the physical asset .
Roughly 50 % of bombs dropped by Allied Strategic Bombers in WWII fell within 5 miles of their intended target ... a pretty large " Circle of Probable Error " , but the best that was achievable with contemporary technology .
Given that national morale is legitimate target , a case may be made even for the horror of Dresden ; the " target " was psychological as opposed to physical .
A constant stream of obviously unstoppable bombers laying waste to a city day and night over a period of some days is a powerful message .
Apart from the fact they were done with single bombs , there is really little to distinguish Dresden 's bombing from those of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Nothing at all distinguishes the bombing of Dresden from the Thousand Plane Raids that gutted Tokyo , Nagoya , and Yokahama in the spring and summer of 1945 .
Though it was the work of two opposing armies over a period of months , the destruction of Stalingrad and the attendant civilian casualties were just as complete and devastating as were the fates of any of the previously mentioned cities and their populations .
The horror of war quite simply is that war is by nature and function absolutely horrible .
It is inexcuseable , indefensible , abhorent , and , tragically , so often unavoidable .
War IS hell .
The precision of today 's conventional weapons makes " Collateral Damage " on the scale of WWII a thing of the past .
There will be errors , accidents , and unintended casualties , of course ; man and all of his making are fallible .
Flattening cities , however , is no longer the way war is fought .
Strategic Nukes , of course , are a different story .
The only realistically conceivable targets for thermonuclear devices are cities .
Therein lies true holocaust , the avoidance of which defines man 's fitness to continue to exist .

A bankrupt theory - - a red herring which was NOT proposed by Darwin .
If you survive , you are fit by definition .
The problem with nukes is that it would not take a " full , thermonuclear exchange " to end the world .
If , say , Pakistan and India had a significantly large nuclear exchange , the resultant environmental & climate damage could end the human race , with the majority being " innocent " in terms of the cause . . .

1 Reply If Adolf Hitler had been captured no doubt he would have been found guilty of war crimes at the Nuremberg Tribunal .
But not all those charged of war crimes were found guilty .
If you examine a war and look for crimes committed during that war , it seems sensible to me to examine all the belligerents .
Would charges of war crimes have stood against Churchill or Stalin or Truman at Nuremberg ?
They might have been found not guilty .
Of course there was no chance of any charges being brought against any of the Allied war leaders .
But if there had been , this issue would have been settled long ago .

2 Reply Funny thing is ... there 's no monument to ' Bomber ' Harris anywhere , nor ( unlike his peers ) did he receive any special commendation / recognition after the war .
A sort of tacit admission that the ' unhousing ' was n't quite cricket .
I 'm not sure that the bombing campaign - especially the British area bombing - had that much of an impact on the course of the war .
I seem to recall production figures showing output rising despite the bombing ; but I 'd have to look 'em up to be sure .
Thanks Setanta for putting paid to the ' victors write the history ' sawhorse .
I find that one almost as irritating as the silly notion that ' violence never solves anything . '

The Federal Communications Commission is asking for public comment on whether to require satellite radio receivers to pick up digital radio signals .
But Rep. Edward Markey ( D - MA ) said the answer should be yes , and he 's not waiting for the FCC to make the call .
Markey 's " Radio All Digital Channel Receiver Act " ( H.R. 7157 ) would mandate that devices designed to receive both the new merged Sirius XM Radio service and terrestrial AM / FM radio be able to receive digital radio too .
" Millions of Americans today rely on local broadcast radio for news , public safety bulletins , sports , weather , traffic and other information , " Markey said in a press statement released Saturday .
" The recent merger of the only two satellite radio providers , XM and Sirius satellite radio , has underscored the importance of ensuring consumer access to a diversity of sources for digital radio content , in particular content originating in their local communities . "
When the FCC gave the OK to the merger of Sirius and XM in August , the two companies committed to an open device pledge — any manufacturer of new receivers for the service can add any additional interfaces it wants to the tuner , e.g. , an Ethernet port , AM / FM reception , and iPod capabilities , among other possibilities .
But the deal did n't include what Ibiquity HD Radio and Clear Channel , one of its biggest investors , asked for : a digital mandate for all satellite radio interoperable receivers that also included AM / FM reception .
In 2002 , the FCC chose Ibiquity 's HD Radio system as the terrestrial radio broadcast service 's sole digital technology .
Although three United States senators weighed in in support of going digital , two big auto manufacturers , both knee - deep in car satellite radio receivers , cried foul .
GM and Toyota called the proposed condition " an unprecedented requirement regulating the choice of entertainment technologies in an automotive environment . "
The Commission is running a Notice of Inquiry on the question to get additional input on the matter .
Markey 's bill is co-sponsored by an interesting and bipartisan bunch of House members , including three staunch Clear Channel supporters , Charles Gonzalez ( D - TX ) , Greg Walden ( R - OR ) , and Lee Terry ( R- NE ) .
In 2006 the trio signed a letter urging the FCC to further relax its limits on ownership of radio stations in big markets , as the Texas - based company has been requesting for years .
Presently , the rules set a maximum of eight stations in big regions .
The statement asked that the limit be raised to 10 in markets with 60 or more stations and 12 for markets with more than 75 .
Almost half a dozen reps signed the request .
Rep. Barbara Lee , Democrat of the East Bay of Northern California , also supports Markey 's bill ( although she did n't have anything to do with that letter ) .
Judging by the 10 individual comments the FCC 's inquiry has garnered so far , most participants think the idea is a dog .
One argued the requirement will make satellite radio receivers too expensive , given current prices for HD radio tuners , and too big as well .
Adding an HD component , the comment noted , will require " adding everything necessary for an FM and AM radio , including tuner and antennas . "
Satellite radio receiver applications " are very compact units , and no manufacturer has yet demonstrated [ a ] compact HD radio receiver . "
This is pretty much the line of reasoning of most of the remarks .
" I respectfully submit that it is well beyond the bounds and abilities of the FCC to design and develop electronic equipment for the 21st century , " another concluded .
Yet another sees sinister motives in the proposal .
" It is not in the consumers best interest , and represents another attempt by the [ National Association of Broadcasters ] and Clear Channel Communications to obtain through legislation what they are unable to produce through their inferior product , " this commenter wrote .
During the FCC 's proceeding on the Sirius / XM merger , the FCC asked Ibiquity about receiver expenses .
The company estimated the cost of HD radio components in most satellite tuners at around $ 12 - $ 15 .
No company or advocacy group has weighed in yet in this proceeding .
The public can offer the FCC feedback on the Inquiry through December 9 .
The docket number is 08 - 172 .
We founded Biotivia because we believed in the power of applied health research and natural ingredients to promote health .
However , we felt let down and turned off by the mainstream vitamin and supplement makers .
From quality concerns , to the obsessions with chasing fads , to the confusing array of products , to outrageous and unsupported claims – we could not find a company that developed innovative products at quality levels we could trust .
So , we started Biotivia based on these five principles :
A financier who made a fortune in the investment business using ideas developed at the University of Chicago has donated $ 300 m ( £ 191 m ) to the graduate business school , which is being renamed in his honour .
It is the largest gift ever to the university , and the largest to any business programme in the world .
The donor is 61 - year - old David G Booth , founder and chief executive of Dimensional Fund Advisors , as well as his wife Suzanne and their two children .
The school will be called the University of Chicago Booth School of Business , or Chicago Booth for short .
The money comes with " no restrictions , no strings attached " , said Booth , who earned an MBA from the school in 1971 .
" I am hoping that others will join me in giving back to this amazing business school . "
The No 1 priority will be recruiting and retaining the most elite and promising scholars .
Dean Edward Snyder , who will administer the funds , vows to be " quite aggressive " in searching for stars .
" There may be a lot of great schools not hiring next year , " he said .
" This is a really good time to push on faculty . "
The school also will use the gift to expand its international presence beyond its present London and Singapore campuses .
Its existing research centres will get more resources , and new faculty groups will be formed to study topics not normally associated with business schools , all projects that appeal to Booth , said Snyder .
" He does n't want to limit us , classify us or direct us , " said Snyder , who also serves as an economics professor at the school .
" He wants us to keep doing what we 're doing . "
The gift wo n't be used to fund routine operating expenses , or reduce published tuition rates for students , although aid will increase , Snyder said .
Booth arrived at the school on Chicago 's south side from his native Kansas 39 years ago as a PhD candidate and research assistant to finance professor Eugene Fama .
The brash and brilliant Fama taught the future mega - donor 's first class at the school - " a life - changing event for me " , Booth recalled .
Fama is famous for the efficient market hypothesis , which says investors should not be able to beat the market , since share prices already reflect all available information .
Booth and partner Rex Sinquefield , another Chicago MBA student , built their Dimensional Funds around Fama 's idea , beginning in 1981 .
" The unifying theme is that markets work , " Fama said .
" I was involved with them from the first day . "
The gift from the Booth Family Trust includes an undisclosed upfront payment , an income stream from shares in the parent company of Dimensional , and a payout if the shares are sold .
Together , those components are valued at $ 300m .
Before Booth 's gift , the largest gift to a business school was $ 105 m given to Stanford University 's Graduate School of Business in 2006 by Phil Knight , founder and chairman of Nike .
Other large gifts to business schools include $ 100 m to the University of Michigan in 2004 from real - estate developer Stephen Ross , $ 85 m to the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 2007 from a combined partnership of 13 alumni and $ 60 m to the Darden School at the University of Virginia from Frank Batten Sr , retired chairman and chief executive of Landmark Communications .

Barley risotto is a comforting one - pot entree that everyone will love !
Update :
This video might explain it better
An idea popped out of Radio 1 Interactive a while ago .
This would be a device that measures ' rock ' - how much the band and the crowd are rocking at a gig - called The Rockterscale .
It would display the amount of rock at the venue and on the web in real - time , maybe even showing it at other gigs and encouraging bands and crowds to out - rock each other .
But , until now , no - one has really tried building it .
But we were due another hardware hacking session so we decided to build the Rockterscale .
Two intensive days later we had these ...
First , we have the Hat of Rock which measures the amount of head thrashing .
Suitable for both fans and the band .
Next , the dance floor measures movement and a force sensor hooked up to an improvised crash barrier at the front measures the crowd pushing up to it .
A webcam mounted on the ceiling measures the overall crowd movement and then there 's the music itself .
Audio processing code measures the loudness of the song and the spread of the frequencies in it - a high value would be a " wall of sound " like effect .
It also does some beat detection .
So we have 6 measurements and an equation ...
Hat +
Floor +
Crush + Crowd + Loud +
Phat = ROCK
Each sensor generates a measure of ' rock ' between 0 and 9 ( what unit of measurement would that be ? ) and then sends the data to the displays .
A separate team were working on the output side and they built a big screen display and a physical scale .
The big screen shows six scales representing the six sensors , with a combined scale at the top - if that reaches 11 then fireworks go off , or something like that .
The Rockterscale logo pulses in time with the beat .
And the physical Rockterscale is built from a guitar - shaped pointer which also uses the combined reading .
When it hits 11 ?
The LED turns on .
\m /
That was it .
But what happens next ?
We had to dismantle it on the day because we were using up a meeting room but it does have real potential for deployment at a gig .
Certainly the video and audio processing could be used , though I 'm not sure how the video code would cope with the lighting conditions .
The rest of the sensors would probably need a bit more work ; to make them robust , reliable and a bit more standalone and I 'm not sure many singers would agree to wear the accelerometer - fitted hat with a USB cable going down their back .
Some technical details for those who are interested ...
First , the sensors .
The hat has a 3 - axis accelerometer mounted in the top which gives an orientation reading in each of the 3 axes , we differentiate these readings to give a movement value .
The cardboard floor mat also has an accelerometer attached and this worked in the same way .
A force sensor is mounted between an improvised barrier and a table and that needs a reasonable amount of pushing to register .
A webcam mounted above the audience measures the amount of movement in the whole image using Processing .
The image is divided up into an 8x6 grid and then the difference between the pixels in each grid square for each frame gives 48 movement values every second ( represented as the blobs in the photo above ) .
The audio processing is based on the aubio C library and measures loudness and spectral spread as well as doing beat detection .
All the sensors were powered through Arduino boards that were hooked up to MacBooks - we did n't have time to make them standalone .
Each sensor produced a stream of readings ( 0 - 9 on the Rockterscale ) up to 10 times per second .
These were sent asynchronously over the local network using Open Sound Control ( OSC ) to a single Processing application doing the presentation work .
The screen display and the guitar - pointer was ( powered by a stepper motor via an Arduino ) were both built with Processing .
Why we do this
As always , we hold these workshops to get people thinking differently , to provide inspiration , as team - building , to get people away from their day job for a bit and to build something which might even be useful .
Previous hacks have included the DABagotchi and Dog Vader .
Britain has been accused of anti-Semitism by a hardline Israeli MP because Britons are to be warned against buying property in settlements in Israeli - occupied Palestinian territories .
An advisory , to be posted on the Foreign Office website , is to refer to settlements in East Jerusalem , the West Bank and the Golan Heights , all areas occupied by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war .
It will warn that future peace deals between Israel and the Palestinians and Israel and Syria could affect property purchases there .
Yuval Steinitz , a hopeful for the post of foreign minister if Benjamin Netanyahu leads the right - wing Likud party to victory in February , advised Britain to abandon the campaign .
Foreign Office officials said that it would include possible steps against newspapers advertising property in the occupied territories .
" This is none of Britain 's business , " said Mr Steinitz , former chairman of the Knesset 's foreign affairs and defence committee .
" When Israel is boycotted one should wonder if there is no implicit anti-Semitism .
Let us see the British government boycott products from China because there is no democracy there before they turn to Israel . "

The rhetoric raised the spectre of a return to the angry disputes between Britain and Israel over settlement construction during Mr Netanyahu 's tenure as prime minister from 1996 to 1999 , especially the building of the Har Homa settlement at Jebal Abu Ghneim in occupied East Jerusalem .
Settlements are considered illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention , which prohibits an occupying power from moving its nationals into the occupied territory .
Last month , an EU campaign was launched for clear labelling to distinguish between goods produced inside Israel , which are exempt from EU tariffs , and those made on Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank , which are not .
Britain says it acting in response to Israel 's failure to uphold a commitment under the Annapolis peace process to freeze settlement building .
" We hear a lot said about settlements being a major obstacle to peace .
We have n't seen action .
Now we are seeing how we can take action on the basis of that political position , " said a Foreign Office spokesman .
THREE years before his death in 1805 , English philosopher William Paley proposed a now - famous thought experiment .
Imagine discovering a watch on the heath : how would you explain its intricate arrangement of parts , its clear design for a purpose ?
Naturally , you ’d conclude that it was built by a watchmaker , not blown together by chance .
By analogy , Paley argued , the natural world is full of designed complexity which must therefore also have a creator : God .
Had Paley been in a position to know about it , he would no doubt have considered a remarkable little device called the bacterial flagellum to be an excellent example of designed complexity .
With its intricate arrangement of interconnecting parts , the flagellum looks no less designed than a watch , and would surely have had Paley reaching for the existence of its “ maker ” .
Modern biology , of course , has no need for omniscient designers .
Evolution – Richard Dawkins ’s blind watchmaker – is all that is needed to explain the origin of complexity in nature .
Even so , latter - day Paleys continue to search for evidence of design in the living world .
The bacterial flagellum has become their cause célèbre – and a focal point in science ’s ongoing struggle against unreason .
The bacterial flagellum is one of the most complex and elegant pieces of biological machinery known .
It is the bacterial world ’s outboard motor , rotating at high speeds to propel bacteria through their watery environments .
It is made up of about 40 proteins that self - assemble into three basic modules – the basal body , hook and filament ( see Diagram ) .
 The flagellum is complex , but is it too complex to have evolved through natural selection ?
Until recently it was surprisingly hard …

( CNN ) -- Venice has suffered its worst flooding in 22 years , leaving some parts of the historic Italian city neck - deep in water , reports said Monday .

Water burst the banks of the coastal city 's famed canals , leaving the landmark Piazza San Marco -- St Mark 's Square -- under almost a meter of water at one point , news agency ANSA reported .
Strong winds pushed waters to a high of 1.56 meters ( 5 feet 2 inches ) at 10:45 a.m. local time , prompting the city government to issue warnings to the public , the agency said .
The flood level began to drop soon afterwards , prompted by a change in the direction of the wind .
Previous highs include 1.58 meters in 1986 and 1.66 meters in 1979 , the news agency said .

Photographs showed people wading through inundated piazzas and waves lapping over waterside cafe tables .
Venice , built around a network of canals and small islands , has for years been trying to tackle the problem of floods that have regularly blighted the city .
In 2007 , the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO warned Venice -- a designated World Heritage Site -- is under threat from rising sea levels caused by climate change .

It said that unless the problem is tackled , Venice could be flooded daily and water levels would permanently rise by 54 centimeters in the city by the year 2100 .

Advertisement A statement purporting to be from the second - in - command of Islamic militant network al - Qaeda has called on Muslims to harm " criminal " America .
In the message , Ayman al - Zawahiri is heard accusing President - elect Barack Obama of betraying his Muslim roots .
He also likens him to a " house slave " - who had chosen to align himself with the " enemies " of Islam .
Mr Obama has said stamping out al - Qaeda " once and for all " will be a top priority during his administration .
On Sunday , he said capturing or killing Osama Bin Laden was " critical " to US security .
He has also promised to bolster the US presence in Afghanistan - a policy that would fail , according to the message .
The US said the message did not signal any increased threat against America .
You were born to a Muslim father , but you chose to stand in the ranks of the enemies of the Muslims , and pray the prayer of the Jews
Al - Qaeda message
This is undoubtedly a message aimed at sustaining anti-American sentiment among Muslims in the face of Barack Obama 's election , says the BBC 's defence correspondent Rob Watson .
But it is a risky approach , our correspondent says .
Barack Obama is hugely popular world - wide and his colour and background make him a much tougher target to attack than President George W Bush in the eyes of a global audience , he says .
' Trespassing crusader ' Zawahiri , an Egyptian by birth , is often referred to as Osama Bin Laden 's right - hand man and the chief ideologue of al - Qaeda .
The audio message , which ran with photographic stills and some video footage , appeared on militant websites .
Mr Obama 's election did not mean that US policy towards the Muslim world had changed , Ayman al - Zawahiri said , according to the 11 - minute message .
Obama wants to " stamp out " al - Qaeda He warned Mr Obama of failure if he followed the policies of the Bush administration .
The change of leadership in the US did not mean that America should be perceived differently , he added .
" America , the criminal , trespassing crusader , continues to be the same as ever , so we must continue to harm it in order for it to come to its senses , " he said .
Zawahiri also criticised Mr Obama - whose father was raised a Muslim - for betraying the Islamic world .
" You were born to a Muslim father , but you chose to stand in the ranks of the enemies of the Muslims , and pray the prayer of the Jews , although you claim to be Christian , in order to climb the rungs of leadership in America , " he said .
Mr Obama was not an " honourable black American " like Malcolm X , he said , but an " abeed al - beit " - a word that translates as house slave but was rendered " house negro " in the message 's English subtitles .
The audio was accompanied by footage of a speech by Malcolm X in which he distinguished between " field negroes " who hated their white masters and " house negroes " who , he said , were loyal to them .
US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack described the message as " more despicable comments from a terrorist " .
Mr Obama visited Israel in July and expressed his " abiding commitment " to its security .
On Sunday , in his first television interview since his 4 November election win , he reiterated his commitment to shift more US troops to bolster the military presence in Afghanistan .
The last message from Zawahiri emerged on 8 September .
He is thought to be in hiding in the Afghan - Pakistan border area .

WASHINGTON 
To the issues that divide the Republican Party , there comes one more .
Some Republicans find humor in the song “ Barack the Magic Negro . ”
Some most definitely do not .
The debate was joined last week after a candidate for party chairman from Tennessee , Chip Saltsman , distributed the parody , which was broadcast on the Rush Limbaugh radio show last year and questions President - elect Barack Obama ’s racial authenticity .
Speaking to The Hill newspaper on Friday , Mr. Saltsman , a longtime Republican operative , described it as a “ light - hearted ” gift that would be received in “ good humor ” by members of the Republican National Committee .
In a party that had big losses this year among minority voters , not everyone took it that way .
“ I am shocked and appalled , ” Mike Duncan , the current party chairman , said in a statement released Saturday .
Mr. Duncan is competing for a second term against Mr. Saltsman and four others .
Dec. 2 , 2008 --
Almost half of women surveyed in a national poll said they had failed to seek health care for themselves or their families over the previous year because the cost was too high .
The annual survey of women 's attitudes and behaviors regarding health care , released today by the National Women 's Health Resource Center ( NWHRC ) , found that women were most likely to put off doctor visits for themselves and least likely to put off doctor visits for their children .
One in four women who said they had skipped needed medical care believed their illnesses lasted longer as a result , and 43 % said they worried more about their health .
Rising health costs appeared to have had a major impact on decisions regarding care :
28 % of women said they put off going to the doctor during an illness for financial reasons .
19 % said they had skipped recommended medical procedures , such as Pap smears or mammograms , because of cost .
18 % said they had taken less than the recommended dosage of a prescription drug in order to make it last longer and 18 % failed to fill some prescriptions .
Only 4 % said they had put off taking their children to the doctor because of the cost .
" With the financial crunch a lot of women are putting off or cutting back on health care for themselves and they are paying a high price , " NWHRC Executive Director Elizabeth Battaglino Cahill , RN , tells WebMD .
" If you are cutting back because money is tight , do n't cut back on health care or health insurance .
Cut something else , because if you do n't take care of yourself you may not be around to take care of your family . "

Fresh off a loss in a battle with Bell Canada Inc. over the throttling of internet connections , small service providers have won a victory that will enable them to offer the same speeds as big phone companies .
The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission on Thursday issued a decision ordering Canada 's big phone companies , including Bell , Telus Corp. , MTS Allstream Inc. , SaskTel and Bell Aliant , to offer the same internet speeds to smaller wholesale customers as they themselves sell on a retail basis .
Under existing CRTC regulations , the big phone companies are required to rent out their networks to smaller service providers , who then sell internet access to their own customers .
The rules boost the number of competitors selling internet access to the public , and thus keep prices down and service levels up .
The regulations , however , have only applied to older infrastructure based in phone companies ' centralized office buildings .
Recently , phone companies have been pushing their networks out of those buildings by putting new equipment into streetside cabinets in an effort to boost their customers ' internet speeds .
Smaller internet service providers have n't had regulated access to those cabinets , however , which means they have been limited to selling slower speeds than those offered by the big phone companies .
In Quebec , for example , Bell has been selling internet connections with download speeds around 16 megabits per second while small ISPs have topped out at less than half that .
Phone company arguments rejected
In its decision , the CRTC rejected arguments by the phone companies that speed parity would discourage them from investing in new infrastructure , and moved to fix the competitive discrepancy .
" Service speed is an important competitive attribute , with rates differing significantly by speed and speed often being a major differentiation point from a marketing standpoint , " the CRTC ruled .
" The commission considers that absent a matching service speed requirement , the ability of competitors that rely on the mandated [ access ] to compete in the retail market would be significantly restricted , which would likely result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition in the retail high - speed internet services market . "
The decision came in response to a CRTC filing by Cybersurf Corp , an independent ISP based in Calgary , in June .
Cybersurf had asked the regulator to force the phone companies to automatically offer matching speeds to small ISPs , a request the CRTC half - granted .
The phone companies will only be required to offer faster speeds to wholesale ISPs when they sell them on a retail basis in a given area .
Smaller ISPs will therefore have to request the faster connections from the phone companies .
Hearings scheduled for this summer
Bell , Telus and the others have 45 days to file with the CRTC the proposed rates they intend to charge the small ISPs for faster services .
The rates will have to represent the actual cost of the service , plus " a reasonable mark - up , " the regulator said .
Small ISPs suffered a setback last month when the CRTC ruled against them and in favour of Bell in a dispute over the connections the company rents them .
Earlier this year , Bell began slowing down certain internet uses of its retail and wholesale customers , which prompted a battle in front of the CRTC .
Bell said it needed to " throttle " internet subscribers who were using peer - to - peer software such as BitTorrent because they were causing congestion on its network .
The small ISPs said Bell was breaking the Telecommunications
Act by interfering with the service it was selling them , but the CRTC last month rejected the argument and allowed the company to continue its throttling practices .
As part of that ruling , however , the CRTC launched a larger inquiry into how much control large network owners such as Bell , Telus , Rogers Communications Inc. and Shaw Communications Inc. , should have over the internet connections they sell to customers .
The inquiry is open to public submissions until February , followed by hearings this summer .
The wait is over .
Brian Burke is set to become the new president and general manager of the Maple Leafs .
With only a few final details to be sorted out , none of which are viewed as deal - breakers , the deal is all but done .
The former Anaheim GM was forwarded a " term sheet " by the Leafs over the past 24 hours , which included acceptable clauses on the length of contract and compensation .
Burke 's deal will include the rest of this season , then a five - year contract that kicks in next season .
He made about $ 1.4 million managing the Ducks , and is expected to see his salary doubled in Toronto .
Cliff Fletcher , who has been acting as Leaf GM since John Ferguson was fired last January , all but confirmed the deal on the FAN 590 morning show today by saying he believes it would be a " great move " for the Leafs to hire the 53 - year - old Burke .
Burke was willing to strike a deal last week , but the Leafs dictated the pace of these negotiations , which slowed towards the end of last week then picked up speed on the weekend .
The only key remaining negotiating point is believed to be the reporting structure of the new regime , whether Burke will report directly to the MLSE board on a regular basis , or to a senior executive like current Leaf president Richard Peddie .
It 's not believed , however , that Burke is particularly worried , having had to " manage up " during his days running the Canucks and Ducks .
There are no other road blocks left that would impede a deal from being cut between the Leafs and Burke .
Theoretically , Burke could have signed a deal Sunday or Monday , but is now committed to stay in the Boston - area with his family through his daughter 's bridal shower on Friday .
That sets the stage for the Leafs to introduce him as their new hockey czar on Saturday , with full coverage allotted to CBC 's Hockey Night in Canada on a nation - wide basis that evening before and during the Leafs ' home game against the Philadelphia Flyers , coincidentally the team for whom Burke once played as a minor - leaguer .
Dave Nonis , the former Vancouver GM , is expected to be announced as a new member of the Leaf front office at the same time as Burke is introduced .
Born in Providence , Rhode Island , Burke will become the first American to be GM of the Leafs , joining his college pal , head coach Ron Wilson .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The National Bureau of Economic Research said Monday that the U.S. has been in a recession since December 2007 , making official what most Americans have already believed about the state of the economy .
The NBER is a private group of leading economists charged with dating the start and end of economic downturns .
It typically takes a long time after the start of a recession to declare its start because of the need to look at final readings of various economic measures .
The NBER said that the deterioration in the labor market throughout 2008 was one key reason why it decided to state that the recession began last year .
Employers have trimmed payrolls by 1.2 million jobs in the first 10 months of this year .
On Friday , economists are predicting the government will report a loss of another 325,000 jobs for November .
The NBER also looks at real personal income , industrial production as well as wholesale and retail sales .
All those measures reached a peak between November 2007 and June 2008 , the NBER said .
In addition , the NBER also considers the gross domestic product , which is the reading most typically associated with a recession in the general public .
Many people erroneously believe that a recession is defined by two consecutive quarters of economic activity declining .
That has yet to take place during this recession .
This downturn longer than most
The NBER did not give any reasons or causes of the recession .
But it is widely accepted that the housing downturn , which started in 2006 , is a primary cause of the broader economic malaise .
The fall of housing prices from peak levels reached earlier this decade cut deeply into home building and home purchases .
This also caused a sharp rise in mortgage foreclosures , which in turn resulted in losses of hundreds of billions of dollars among the nation 's leading banks and a tightening of credit .
The current recession is one of the longest downturns since the Great Depression of the 1930's .
The last two recessions ( 1990 - 1991 and 2001 ) lasted eight months each , and only two of the 10 previous post - Depression downturns lasted as long as a full year , according to the NBER .
In a statement , White House Deputy Press Secretary Tony Fratto said that even though the recession is now official , it is more important to focus on the steps being taken to fix the economy .
" The most important things we can do for the economy right now are to return the financial and credit markets to normal , and to continue to make progress in housing , and that 's where we 'll continue to focus , " he said .
" Addressing these areas will do the most right now to return the economy to growth and job creation . "
President - elect Obama 's transition team did not have an immediate comment on the recession announcement .
But other top Democrats said this is further proof of the need for another economic stimulus package , which Obama has advocated .
" With rising costs of living , rising unemployment , record foreclosures and depleted savings , we must do more to help families make ends meet , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in a statement .
" With the cooperation of our Republican colleagues , we intend to send a plan to the White House as soon as possible following President - elect Obama 's inauguration next month . "
How long will it go ?
Nonetheless , several economists said the real concern is that there is no end in sight for the downturn .
Some suggested that the best case scenario for the economy is that it would reach bottom in the second quarter of 2009 .
And even if that happens , that would still make this recession the longest since the Great Depression .
Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research , said the only good news for the economy is that some of the steps already taken by the government earlier this year could start to spur growth soon .
For example , he said interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve , which started in September 2007 , " should be working their magic any day now . "
In February , Congress passed a $ 170 billion tax rebate meant to stimulate the economy .
But that only boosted GDP during the second quarter .
The financial market and credit crisis worsened during this summer , prompting Congress , the Treasury Department and the Fed to pump trillions of dollars into the economy through a variety of programs , including a $ 700 billion bailout of banks and Wall Street firms and hundreds of billions of lending by the Fed to major companies and lenders .
But Lakshman Achuthan , managing director of Economic Cycle Research Institute , said that at this point , the only solution for the recession is time .
" All the hand waving and real cash that policymakers are throwing at the problem wo n't change the fact we 're stuck in this nasty recession , " he said .
" The ultimate cure of a recession is letting it run its course . "
Achuthan 's research firm tracks weekly leading economic indicators that are supposed to signal a change in direction for the economy four or five months ahead of time .
Those indicators are continuing to fall at a record pace .
Still , he said he's not worried about the current recession turning into a depression , as many Americans fear .
" Even with indicators in a tailspin , this still is only a very severe recession , " he said .
" There 's lots of gloom , but we do n't see doom . "
HEMPSTEAD , New York ( CNN ) --
If the presidential election were held today , the latest update of the CNN Electoral College Map estimates Democratic candidate Barack Obama would win enough electoral votes to capture the White House .
CNN 's new Electoral College Map was released Wednesday .
The new map indicates that Sen. Obama would have 277 electoral votes , with Sen.
John McCain , the Republican candidate , amassing 174 electoral votes ; 87 electoral votes are still up for grabs in several states .
In order to win the presidency , a candidate needs 270 electoral votes .
The new estimate for Obama is a change from CNN's October 7 Electoral College Map , which indicated he would take 264 electoral votes .
Interactive : CNN's new Electoral Map Calculator
Obama picked up 13 electoral votes when Virginia was moved from the category of tossup state to a state that is leaning toward him .
That put him over the 270 electoral - vote threshold needed to win the White House .
" Virginia has n't gone Democratic in 44 years , " said Alan Silverleib , CNN senior political researcher .
" But a number of polls -- including our own -- now show Obama up double digits there .
And , as the map shows , if Obama holds that lead , it may be enough to put him into the White House . "
" Conversely , McCain really can't afford to lose Virginia 's 13 electoral votes .
That state is a key part of the Republican electoral coalition , " Silverleib added .
In a CNN poll of polls released Wednesday evening , Obama is favored to win by 50 percent ; McCain by 43 percent and 8 percent of voters are undecided .
CNN also switched North Dakota from a safe McCain state to one leaning toward McCain , and New Jersey from leaning toward Obama to safe Obama .
Neither of those moves affected the overall electoral vote count in the CNN estimate .

" This is not good news for John McCain .
He 's heading in the wrong direction at a time when he needs to be gaining electoral votes , not losing them .
But he 's been left for dead before and has come roaring back .
This election is not over yet , " said CNN political editor Mark Preston .
The CNN Electoral Map is based on analysis from the CNN Political Unit and takes into account a number of factors , including polling , state voting trends , ad spending patterns , candidate visits and guidance from the campaigns , parties and political strategists .
The list will be updated regularly as the campaign develops over time .
Obama 's advance in traditionally red states has the GOP on the defense .
The McCain - Palin ticket has spent much of the week stumping in states where Obama seems poised for an unexpectedly strong showing .
A new CNN / Time Magazine / Opinion Research Corporation survey in Virginia released Wednesday indicates that Obama holds a 10 - point lead over McCain -- 53 percent to 43 percent among likely voters .
Watch how Virginia is leaning toward Obama in latest poll »
" Obama is winning men and women in Virginia , and is doing well across the state east of the Blue Ridge Mountains , " CNN polling director Keating Holland said .
It 's a similar story in Colorado , a state that has n't voted for a Democrat in the race for the White House in 16 years .
The new poll indicates the Illinois senator holds a four - point edge over McCain , 51 percent to 47 percent .
Watch more on if Colorado could go blue »
And in Georgia , a state that Bush won by 17 points over Kerry four years ago and that has n't voted for the Democrats in a presidential contest in 16 years , the poll suggests only a six - point lead for McCain , 51 percent to 45 percent .
The poll also indicates Obama has a five - point advantage over McCain in Florida , 51 percent to 46 percent .
Twenty - seven electoral votes are up for grabs in Florida .
Bush took the state by five points in the last election .
In Missouri , which Bush won in the past two presidential contests , the new poll suggests it 's basically a dead heat , with McCain holding a one - point advantage over Obama , 49 percent to 48 percent .
" Of course , it 's important to remember that the CNN Electoral Map is a snapshot in time , " Silverleib said .
" We are not predicting an Obama win on Election Day .
We still have 20 days to go , and that 's an eternity in politics . "
CNN 's Ed Hornick and Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report .

Christianity
Christianity 's Origin
Christianity as antiquity .--
When we hear the ancient bells growling on a Sunday morning we ask ourselves :
Is it really possible !
This , for a jew , crucified two thousand years ago , who said he was God 's son ?
The proof of such a claim is lacking .
Certainly the Christian religion is an antiquity projected into our times from remote prehistory ; and the fact that the claim is believed - whereas one is otherwise so strict in examining pretensions - is perhaps the most ancient piece of this heritage .
A god who begets children with a mortal woman ; a sage who bids men work no more , have no more courts , but look for the signs of the impending end of the world ; a justice that accepts the innocent as a vicarious sacrifice ; someone who orders his disciples to drink his blood ; prayers for miraculous interventions ; sins perpetrated against a god , atoned for by a god ; fear of a beyond to which death is the portal ; the form of the cross as a symbol in a time that no longer knows the function and ignominy of the cross -- how ghoulishly all this touches us , as if from the tomb of a primeval past !
Can one believe that such things are still believed ?
from Nietzsche 's Human , all too Human , s.405 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
Christianity was from the beginning , essentially and fundamentally , life 's nausea and disgust with life , merely concealed behind , masked by , dressed up as , faith in " another " or " better " life .
from Nietzsche's
The Birth of Tragedy , p.23 , Walter Kaufmann transl .
Change of Cast . --
As soon as a religion comes to dominate it has as its opponents all those who would have been its first disciples .
from Nietzsche 's Human , all too Human , s.118 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
Blind pupils . --
As long as a man knows very well the strength and weaknesses of his teaching , his art , his religion , its power is still slight .
The pupil and apostle who , blinded by the authority of the master and by the piety he feels toward him , pays no attention to the weaknesses of a teaching , a religion , and soon usually has for that reason more power than the master .
The influence of a man has never yet grown great without his blind pupils .
To help a perception to achieve victory often means merely to unite it with stupidity so intimately that the weight of the latter also enforces the victory of the former .
from Nietzsche 's Human , all too Human , s.122 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
Speaking in a parable .
-- A Jesus Christ was possible only in a Jewish landscape -- I mean one over which the gloomy and sublime thunder cloud of the wrathful Yahweh was brooding continually .
Only here was the rare and sudden piercing of the gruesome and perpetual general day - night by a single ray of the sun experienced as if it were a miracle of " love " and the ray of unmerited " grace . "
Only here could Jesus dream of his rainbow and his ladder to heaven on which God descended to man .
Everywhere else good weather and sunshine were considered the rule and everyday occurrences .
from Nietzsche's The Gay Science , s.137 , Walter Kaufmann transl
The first Christian .
All the world still believes in the authorship of the " Holy Spirit " or is at least still affected by this belief : when one opens the Bible one does so for " edification . " ...
That it also tells the story of one of the most ambitious and obtrusive of souls , of a head as superstitious as it was crafty , the story of the apostle Paul - - who knows this , except a few scholars ?
Without this strange story , however , without the confusions and storms of such a head , such a soul , there would be no Christianity ...
That the ship of Christianity threw overboard a good deal of its Jewish ballast , that it went , and was able to go , among the pagans -- that was due to this one man , a very tortured , very pitiful , very unpleasant man , unpleasant even to himself .
He suffered from a fixed idea -- or more precisely , from a fixed , ever - present , never - resting question : what about the Jewish law ?
and particularly the fulfillment of this law ?
In his youth he had himself wanted to satisfy it , with a ravenous hunger for this highest distinction which the Jews could conceive - this people who were propelled higher than any other people by the imagination of the ethically sublime , and who alone succeeded in creating a holy god together with the idea of sin as a transgression against this holiness .
Paul became the fanatical defender of this god and his law and guardian of his honor ; at the same time , in the struggle against the transgressors and doubters , lying in wait for them , he became increasingly harsh and evilly disposed towards them , and inclined towards the most extreme punishments .
And now he found that -- hot - headed , sensual , melancholy , malignant in his hatred as he was -- he was himself unable to fulfill the law ; indeed , and this seemed strangest to him , his extravagant lust to domineer provoked him continually to transgress the law , and he had to yield to this thorn .
Is it really his " carnal nature " that makes him transgress again and again ?
And not rather , as he himself suspected later , behind it the law itself , which must constantly prove itself unfulfillable and which lures him to transgression with irresistable charm ?
But at that time he did not yet have this way out .
He had much on his conscience - he hints at hostility , murder , magic , idolatry , lewdness , drunkenness , and pleasure in dissolute carousing - and ... moments came when he said to himself :
" It is all in vain ; the torture of the unfulfilled law can not be overcome . " ...
The law was the cross to which he felt himself nailed : how he hated it !
how he searched for some means to annihilate it -- not to fulfill it any more himself !
And finally the saving thought struck him , ...
" It is unreasonable to persecute this Jesus !
Here after all is the way out ; here is the perfect revenge ; here and nowhere else I have and hold the annihilator of the law ! " ...
Until then the ignominious death had seemed to him the chief argument against the Messianic claim of which the new doctrine spoke : but what if it were necessary to get rid of the law ?
The tremendous consequences of this idea , of this solution of the riddle , spin before his eyes ; at one stroke he becomes the happiest man ; the destiny of the Jews -- no , of all men-- seems to him to be tied to this idea , to this second of its sudden illumination ; he has the thought of thoughts , the key of keys , the light of lights ; it is around him that all history must revolve henceforth .
For he is from now on the teacher of the annihilation of the law ...
This is the first Christian , the inventor of Christianity .
Until then there were only a few Jewish sectarians .
from Nietzsche 's Daybreak , s.68 , Walter Kaufmann transl .
The persecutor of God. --
Paul thought up the idea and Calvin rethought it , that for innumerable people damnation has been decreed from eternity , and that this beautiful world plan was instituted to reveal the glory of God : heaven and hell and humanity are thus supposed to exist - to satisfy the vanity of God !
What cruel and insatiable vanity must have flared in the soul of the man who thought this up first , or second .
Paul has remained Saul after all - the persecutor of God .
from Nietzsche's The Wanderer and his Shadow , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
Christianity 's Nature
The everyday Christian . --
If the Christian dogmas of a revengeful God , universal sinfulness , election by divine grace and the danger of eternal damnation were true , it would be a sign of weak - mindedness and lack of character not to become a priest , apostle or hermit and , in fear and trembling , to work solely on one 's own salvation ; it would be senseless to lose sight of ones eternal advantage for the sake of temporal comfort .
If we may assume that these things are at any rate believed true , then the everyday Christian cuts a miserable figure ; he is a man who really cannot count to three , and who precisely on account of his spiritual imbecility does not deserve to be punished so harshly as Christianity promises to punish him .
from Nietzsche 's Human , all too Human , s.116 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
What a crude intellect is good for .--
The Christian church is an encyclopaedia of prehistoric cults and conceptions of the most diverse origin , and that is why it is so capable of proselytizing : it always could , and it can still go wherever it pleases and it always found , and always finds something similar to itself to which it can adapt itself and gradually impose upon it a Christian meaning .
It is not what is Christian in it , but the universal heathen character of its usages , which has favored the spread of this world - religion ; its ideas , rooted in both the Jewish and the Hellenic worlds , have from the first known how to raise themselves above national and racial niceties and exclusiveness as though these were merely prejudices .
One may admire this power of causing the most various elements to coalesce , but one must not forget the contemptible quality that adheres to this power : the astonishing crudeness and self - satisfiedness of the church 's intellect during the time it was in process of formation , which permitted it to accept any food and to digest opposites like pebbles .
from Nietzsche 's Daybreak , s. 70 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
The despairing .--
Christianity possesses the hunters instinct for all those who can by one means or another be brought to despair - of which only a portion of mankind is capable .
It is constantly on their track , it lies in wait for them .
Pascal attempted the experiment of seeing whether , with the aid of the most incisive knowledge , everyone could not be brought to despair : the experiment miscarried , to his twofold despair .
from Nietzsche 's Daybreak , s. 64 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
The compassionate Christian .--
The reverse side of Christian compassion for the suffering of one 's neighbor is a profound suspicion of all the joy of one 's neighbor , of his joy in all that he wants to do and can .
from Nietzsche 's Daybreak , s. 80 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
Doubt as sin .--
Christianity has done its utmost to close the circle and declared even doubt to be sin .
One is supposed to be cast into belief without reason , by a miracle , and from then on to swim in it as in the brightest and least ambiguous of elements : even a glance towards land , even the thought that one perhaps exists for something else as well as swimming , even the slightest impulse of our amphibious nature - is sin !
And notice that all this means that the foundation of belief and all reflection on its origin is likewise excluded as sinful .
What is wanted are blindness and intoxication and an eternal song over the waves in which reason has drowned .
from Nietzsche 's Daybreak , s. 89 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
Other fears , other securities .--
Christianity had brought into life a quite novel and limitless perilousness , and therewith quite novel securities , pleasures , recreations and evaluations of all things .
Our century denies this perilousness , and does so with a good conscience : and yet it continues to drag along with it the old habits of Christian security , Christian enjoyment , recreation , evaluation !
It even drags them into its noblest arts and philosophies !
How worn out and feeble , how insipid and awkward , how arbitrarily fanatical and , above all , how insecure all this must appear , now that the fearful antithesis to it , the omnipresent fear of the Christian for his eternal salvation , has been lost .
from Nietzsche 's Daybreak , s. 57 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
What distinguishes us [ scientists ] from the pious and the believers is not the quality but the quantity of belief and piety ; we are contented with less .
But if the former should challenge us : then be contented and appear to be contented !
- then we might easily reply : ' We are , indeed , not among the least contented .
You , however , if your belief makes you blessed then appear to be blessed !
Your faces have always been more injurious to your belief than our objections have !
If these glad tidings of your Bible were written on your faces , you would not need to insist so obstinately on the authority of that book ...
As things are , however , all your apologies for Christianity have their roots in your lack of Christianity ; with your defence plea you inscribe your own bill of indictment .
from Nietzsche 's Assorted Opinions and Maxims , s. 98 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
Christianity 's Destiny
Historical refutation as the definitive refutation .--
In former times , one sought to prove that there is no God - today one indicates how the belief that there is a God arose and how this belief acquired its weight and importance : a counter - proof that there is no God thereby becomes superfluous . -
When in former times one had refuted the ' proofs of the existence of God ' put forward , there always remained the doubt whether better proofs might not be adduced than those just refuted : in those days atheists did not know how to make a clean sweep .
from Nietzsche 's Daybreak , s. 95 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
But in the end one also has to understand that the needs that religion has satisfied and philosophy is now supposed to satisfy are not immutable ; they can be weakened and exterminated .
Consider , for example , that Christian distress of mind that comes from sighing over ones inner depravity and care for ones salvation - all concepts originating in nothing but errors of reason and deserving , not satisfaction , but obliteration .
from Nietzsche 's Human , all too Human , s.27 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
Destiny of Christianity .
--
Christianity came into existence in order to lighten the heart ; but now it has first to burden the heart so as afterwards to be able to lighten it .
Consequently it shall perish .
from Nietzsche 's Human , all too Human , s.119 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
At the deathbed of Christianity .--
Really unreflective people are now inwardly without Christianity , and the more moderate and reflective people of the intellectual middle class now possess only an adapted , that is to say marvelously simplified Christianity .
A god who in his love arranges everything in a manner that in the end will be best for us ; a god who gives to us and takes from us our virtue and our happiness , so that as a whole all is meet and fit and there is no reason for us to take life sadly , let alone exclaim against it ; in short , resignation and modest demands elevated to godhead - that is the best and most vital thing that still remains of Christianity .
But one should notice that Christianity has thus crossed over into a gentle moralism : it is not so much ' God , freedom and immortality ' that have remained , as benevolence and decency of disposition , and the belief that in the whole universe too benevolence and decency of disposition prevail : it is the euthanasia of Christianity .
from Nietzsche 's Daybreak , s. 92 , R.J. Hollingdale transl .
After Buddha was dead , his shadow was still shown for centuries in a cave - a tremendous , gruesome shadow .
God is dead ; but given the way of men , there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown .
- And we- we still have to vanquish his shadow , too .

Ever since a caveman first clacked two stones together , musicians have relied on instruments — Bobby McFerrin and that guy from Police Academy notwithstanding .
These music creation technologies are disrupting the normal ways in which music has been made in the past .
1. The iPhone
When I saw the first MP3 player ten years ago this month , I expected portable music players to evolve a great deal in the coming decade .
But other than the ability to hold more music and an improved interface , most players released since then have been essentially retreads of those first models .
Not so the iPhone ( and iPod Touch ) .
This device ’s large touch screen , tilt sensors and ability to install applications have already made it a handy device for going beyond music playback into the realm of music creation .
Four Tracks ( $ 10 ) replaces the hardware four track recorders of yore that used to cost hundreds of dollars .
Talk about disruptive technology .
Meanwhile the mood - enhancing Bloom , ZoozBeat pocket music studio , the harder - to - use Noise .io and other apps let people make music wherever they are , for a fraction of the cost of dedicated non-portable hardware .
2. Open - source audio software
One of the great disruptive forces when it comes to software is the open - source movement .
Decentralized teams of programmers with varying amounts of time to commit to a project can produce stable , cheaper applications that compete with proprietary software .
Audacity , a free , open - source audio editor , has been a shining example of open - source software for years — so stable that I used it as the basis for a book of digital music tutorials , and that was over five years ago ; the program has only improved since then .
Now , it has competition from another open - source audio editor called Koblo Studio , which runs on new code ( i.e. not Audacity ) , according to one of its creators , and offers more some advanced features .
The program is free , but users can choose to buy virtual synthesizers , effects and other add - ons .
Not too long ago , entry - level digital audio workstations cost hundreds of dollars , and many still do .
Thanks to open - source developers , anyone can now record , edit and produce music for free .
3. Virtual synthesizers
Before the iPhone let us use virtual instruments on the go , the computer put them in the home studio .
Computers are remarkably well - suited to pretending to be synthesizers .
Because they rely on your computer for processing resources , a display and some of their input mechanisms , virtual synths are far , far cheaper than their real world counterparts while offering the same sounds and , usually , more advanced functionality .
Why buy all the hardware ( keyboard , processor , etc. ) again each time you want a new instrument ?
Virtual synths have allowed a new generation of musicians to discover yesterday ’s vintage equipment and customize their own sounds to a degree not imaginable in the hardware world .
And as with other disruptive technologies , virtual synths do all of this at a far lower price than their hardware ancestors .
4. Portable digital audio recorders
As embarrassing as it is to admit , I think I ’m in love with my Roland - Edirol R-09HR High Resolution WAVE / MP3 Recorder , pictured to the right .
Not only is it perfect for interviews , with an optional tripod that lets me record without picking up table noise , an included wireless remote for altering settings without adding clicks to the recording and a slow playback option for transcribing speech , but it has also allowed me to record live music without distortion .
In the past , I ’ve had to accept a certain level of digital distortion as part of the bargain of recording live audio .
But the R - 09HR has two gain settings that can each be tweaked to 80 different recording levels , so no sound seems too quiet or too loud for my R - 09 HR to pick up .
The built in stereo condenser mics are high - quality enough for my purposes , but the device also accepts an external mic- or line - level source .
Other high - end portables have been able to record loud audio without distorting , but this one ( among other newer models ) saves recordings as WAVs or MP3s on an SD card that my computers see as a plain old disk drive .
Some portable digital audio recorders , the R - 09HR included , can record 24 - bit audio , which allows their use on projects requiring better - than - CD audio quality .
High - end portable recorders are disruptive in two ways : by making it possible to record super clean audio without a computer and by giving more concertgoers a way to sync photos and videos to higher - quality audio taped at shows .
5. Max /MSP
When I set out to make this list , my goal was not to include decades - old technology .
Cycling ’ 74 ’s Max / MSP , a programming interface for sound ( video introduction ) , elbowed its way onto the list nonetheless , because there ’s still nothing like it — well , nothing exactly like it anyway .
Forget about imitating synthesizers or making them portable ; Max / MSP lets you build electronic instruments inside your computer by dragging and dropping objects and connecting them with virtual patch cords .
Ever wonder how people do things like play real music using Guitar Hero controllers or turn a Nintendo Wii controller into a theremin ?
Their secret , nine times out of ten , is Max / MSP .
It ’s not the easiest program to learn , but neither are most other Jedi techniques .
Suggestions ?
Add a comment below ; we ’ll take a look before we update the list .

Informan autoridades que el secretario de Gobernación viajaba en el Lear Jet 45 que la tarde de este martes se desplomó y explotó en las inmediaciones de Periférico y Reforma .
Procedía de San Luis Potosí
El secretario de Gobernación , Juan Camilo Mouriño , y un asesor presidencial de temas de seguridad murieron hoy en la caída de una avioneta , ocurrida en una zona de oficinas de Ciudad de México , según versiones preliminares .
Los funcionarios viajaban en el avión que se estrelló en Periférico , en la ciudad de México , confirmó Max Cortázar , vocero de la Presidencia de la República .
Además , viajaban José Luis Santiago Vasconcelos , funcionario de la Secretaría de Seguridad Pública .
Juan Camilo Mouriño Terrazo presidió la firma del Acuerdo Estatal por la Seguridad , la Justicia y la Legalidad , que tuvo lugar en ese estado y abandonó la entidad a las 17:00 horas .
Cerca de las 19:00 horas se registró la caída de una aeronave en Paseo de la Reforma y Ferrocarril de Cuernavaca .
De inmediato comenzaron a circular versiones de que se trataba de un Lear Jet 45 de la Secretaría de Gobernación con matrícula XC - VMC , información que fue confirmada minutos después .
El Lear Jet 45 ya había registrado fallas mecánicas en 2005 , pues en noviembre de ese año el entonces secretario de Gobernación , Carlos Abascal , canceló un vuelo a la ciudad de Mérida por un problema en la aeronave que impidió su despegue .
Marcelo Ebrard , jefe de gobierno capitalino , informó que hasta el momento se han localizado ocho cadáveres y se registran 40 lesionados por el percance .
Beyond Just War and Pacifism : Jesus ' Nonviolent Way
by Walter Wink
[ Dr Walter Wink is Professor of Biblical Interpretation at Auburn Theological Seminary in
New York City .
Previously , he was a parish minister and taught at Union Theological Seminary
in New York City .
In 1989 - 1990 he was a Peace Fellow at the United States Institute of Peace .
This essay is posted with Dr Wink 's permission . ]

The new reality Jesus proclaimed was nonviolent .
That much is clear , not just from the Sermon on the Mount , but his entire life and teaching and , above all , the way he faced his death .
His was not merely a tactical or pragmatic nonviolence seized upon because nothing else would have worked against the Roman empire 's near monopoly on violence .
Rather , he saw nonviolence as a direct corollary of the nature of God and of the new reality emerging in the world from God .
In a verse quoted more than any other from the New Testament during the church 's first four centuries , Jesus taught that God loves everyone , and values all , even those who make themselves God 's enemies .
We are therefore to do likewise ( Matt. 5:45 ; cf. Luke 6:35 ) .
The Reign of God , the peaceable Kingdom , is ( despite the monarchical terms ) an order in which the inequity , violence , and male supremacy characteristic of dominator societies are
superseded .
Thus nonviolence is not just a means to the Kingdom of God ; it is a quality of the
Kingdom itself .
Those who live nonviolently are already manifesting the transformed reality of the divine order now , even under the conditions of what I call the Domination System .
The idea of nonviolent resistance was not new .
The Hebrew midwives , the Greek tragedians , and Jainism .
Buddhism , Hinduism , Lao - Tzu , and Judaism were all to various degrees conversant with nonviolence as a way of life and , in some cases , even as a tactic of social change .
What was new was the early church 's inference from Jesus ' teaching that nonviolence is the only way , that war itself must be renounced .
The idea of peace and the more general rejection of violence can be found before Christianity and in other cultures , says Peter Brock , but nowhere else do we find practical anti-militarism leading to the refusal of military service .
When , beginning with the emperor Constantine , the Christian church began receiving referential treatment by the empire that it had once so steadfastly opposed , war , which had once seemed so evil , now appeared to many to be a necessity for preserving and propagating the gospel .
Christianity 's weaponless victory over the Roman empire eventuated in the weaponless victory of the empire over the gospel .
No defeat is so well - disguised as victory !
In the year 303 , Diocletian forbade any member of the Roman army to be a Christian .
By the year 416 , no one could be a member of the Roman army unless he was a Christian .
It fell to Augustine ( d. 430 ) to make the accommodation of Christianity to its new status as a privileged religion in support of the state .
Augustine believed , on the basis of Matt. 5:38 - 42 , that Christians had no right to defend themselves from violence .
But he identified a problem which no earlier theologian had faced : what Augustine regarded as the loving obligation to use violence if necessary to defend the innocent against evil .
Drawing on Stoic just war principles , he articulated the position that was to dominate church teaching from that time right up to the present .
Ever since , Christians on the left and on the right , in the East and in the West , have found it exceedingly easy to declare as " just " and divinely ordained any wars their governments desired to wage for purely national interests .
As a consequence , the world regards Christians as among the most warlike factions on the face of the earth .
And little wonder ; two - thirds of the people killed in the last 500 years died at the hands of fellow - Christians in Europe , to say nothing of those whom Christians killed in the course of colonizing the rest of the world .
As Gandhi once quipped , " The only people on earth who do not see Christ and His teachings as nonviolent are Christians . "
The time has come to look again to the rock from which we were hewn .
And the key text remains Jesus ' statement about resisting evil .
38 You have heard that it was said , ' An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . '
39 But I say to you , Do not resist an evildoer .
But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek , turn the other also ; 40 and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat , give your cloak as well ; 41 and if anyone forces you to go one mile , go also the second mile .
42 Give to everyone who begs from you , and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you .
( Matt. 5:38 - 42 NRSV ; see also Luke 6:29 - 30 ) .
Christians have , on the whole , simply ignored this teaching .
It has seemed impractical , masochistic , suicidal -- an invitation to bullies and spouse - batterers to wipe up the floor with their supine Christian victims .
Some who have tried to follow Jesus ' words have understood it to mean non-resistance : let the oppressor perpetrate evil unopposed .
Even scholars have swallowed the eat - humble - pie reading of this text : " It is better to surrender everything and go through life naked than to insist on one 's legal rights , " to cite only one of scores of these commentators from Augustine right up to the present .
Interpreted thus , the passage has become the basis for systematic training in cowardice , as Christians are taught to acquiesce
in evil .
Cowardice is scarcely a term one associates with Jesus .
Either he failed to make himself clear , or we have misunderstood him .
There is plenty of cause to believe the latter .
Jesus is not forbidding self - defense here , only the use of violence .
Nor is he legitimating the abandonment of nonviolence in order to defend the neighbor .
He is rather showing us a way that can be used by individuals or large movements to intervene on behalf of justice for our neighbors -- nonviolently .
The classical interpretation of Matt 5:38 - 42// Luke 6:29 - 30 suggests two , and only two , possibilities for action in the face of evil : fight or flight .
Either we resist evil , or we do not resist it .
Jesus seemingly says that we are not to resist it ; so , it would appear , he commands us to be docile , inert , compliant , to abandon all desire for justice , to allow the oppressor to walk all over us .
" Turn the other cheek " is taken to enjoin becoming a doormat for Jesus , to be trampled without protest .
" Give your undergarment as well " has encouraged people to go limp in the face of injustice and hand over the last thing they own .
" Going the second mile " has been turned
into a platitude meaning nothing more than " extend yourself . "
Rather than encourage the oppressed to counteract their oppressors , these revolutionary statements have been transformed into injunctions to collude in one 's own despoiling .
But that interpretation excluded a third alternative : active nonviolent resistance .
The word translated " resist " is itself problematic ; what translators have failed to note is how frequently anthistemi is used as a military term .
Resistance implies " counteractive aggression , " a response to hostilities initiated by someone else .
Liddell - Scott defines anthistemi as to " set against esp. in battle , withstand . "
Ephesians 6:13 is exemplary of its military usage : " Therefore take the whole armor of God , that you may be able to withstand [ antistenai , literally , to draw up battle ranks against the enemy ] in the evil day , and having done all , to stand [ stenai , literally , to close ranks and continue to fight ] . "
The term is used in the LXX primarily for armed resistance in military encounters ( 44 out of 71 times ) .
Josephus uses anthistemi for violent struggle 15 out of 17 times , Philo 4 out of 10 .
Jesus ' answer is set against the backdrop of the burning question of forcible resistance to Rome .
In that context , " resistance " could have only one meaning : lethal violence .
Stasis , the noun form of stenai , means " a stand , " in the military sense of facing off against an enemy .
By extension it came to mean a " party formed for seditious purposes ; sedition , revolt . "
The NRSV translates stasis in Mark 15:7 as " insurrection " ( so also Luke 23:19 , 25 ) , in Acts 19:40 as " rioting , " and in Acts 23:10 as " violent dissension . "
In short , antistenai means more in Matt. 5:39 a than simply to " stand against " or " resist . "
It means to resist violently , to revolt or rebel , to engage in an insurrection .
Jesus is not encouraging submission to evil ; that would run counter to everything he did and said .
He is , rather , warning against responding to evil in kind by letting the oppressor set the terms of our opposition .
Perhaps most importantly , he cautions us against being made over into the very evil we oppose by adopting its methods and spirit .
He is saying , in effect , Do not mirror evil ; do not become the very thing you hate .
The best translation is the Scholars Version : " Do n't react violently against the one who is evil . "
In the three examples that follow in Matthew , Jesus illustrates what he means .
Turn the Other Cheek
" If anyone strikes you on the right cheek , turn the other also . "
Why the right cheek ?
A blow by the right fist in that right - handed world would land on the left cheek of the opponent .
An open - handed slap would also strike the left cheek .
To hit the right cheek with a fist would require using the left hand , but in that society the left hand was used only for unclean tasks .
Even to gesture with the left hand at Qumran carried the penalty of ten days ' penance .
The only way one could naturally strike the right cheek with the right hand would be with the back of the hand .
We are dealing here with insult , not a fistfight .
The intention is clearly not to injure but to humiliate , to put someone in his or her place .
One normally did not strike a peer thus , and if one did the fine was exorbitant .
The Mishnaic tractate Baba Qamma specifies the various fines for striking an equal : for slugging with a fist , 4 zuz ( a zuz was a day 's wage ) ; for slapping , 200 zuz ; but " if [ he struck him ] with the back of his hand he must pay him 400 zuz . "
But damages for indignity were not paid to slaves who are struck ( 8:1 - 7 ) .
A backhand slap was the usual way of admonishing inferiors .
Masters backhanded slaves ; husbands , wives ; parents , children ; men , women ; Romans , Jews .
We have here a set of unequal relations , in each of which retaliation would be suicidal .
The only normal response would be cowering submission .
Part of the confusion surrounding these sayings arises from the failure to ask who Jesus ' audience was .
In all three of the examples in Matt. 5:39 b - 41 , Jesus ' listeners are not those who strike , initiate lawsuits , or impose forced labor , but their victims ( " If anyone strikes you ... wants to sue you ... forces you to go one mile ... " ) .
There are among his hearers people who were subjected to these very indignities , forced to stifle outrage at their dehumanizing treatment by the hierarchical system of caste and class , race and gender , age and status , and as a result of imperial occupation .
Why then does he counsel these already humiliated people to turn the other cheek ?
Because this action robs the oppressor of the power to humiliate .
The person who turns the other cheek is saying , in effect , " Try again .
Your first blow failed to achieve its intended effect .
I deny you the power to humiliate me .
I am a human being just like you .
Your status does not alter that fact .
You can not demean me . "
Such a response would create enormous difficulties for the striker .
Purely logistically , how would he hit the other cheek now turned to him ?
He cannot backhand it with his right hand ( one only need try this to see the problem ) .
If he hits with a fist , he makes the other his equal , acknowledging him as a peer .
But the point of the back of the hand is to reinforce institutionalized inequality .
Even if the superior orders the person flogged for such " cheeky " behavior ( this is certainly no way to avoid conflict ! ) , the point has been irrevocably made .
He has been given notice that this underling is in fact a human being .
In that world of honor and shaming , he has been rendered impotent to instill shame in a subordinate .
He has been stripped of his power to dehumanize the other .
As Gandhi taught , " The first principle of nonviolent action is that of noncooperation with everything humiliating . "
Give the Undergarment
The second example Jesus gives is set in a court of law .
Someone is being sued for his outer garment .
Who would do that , and under what circumstances ?
The Hebrew Scriptures provide the clues .
When you make your neighbor a loan of any sort , you shall not go into his house to fetch his pledge .
You shall stand outside , and the man to whom you make the loan shall bring the pledge out to you .
And if he is a poor man , you shall not sleep in his pledge ; when the sun goes down , you shall restore to him the pledge that he may sleep in his cloak ( himatio ) and bless you .... You shall not ... take a widow 's garment ( himation ) in pledge .
( Deut . 24:10 - 13 , 17 ; see also Exod .
22:25 -27 ; Amos 2:7-8 ; Ezek.18:5-9 . )
Only the poorest of the poor would have nothing but a garment to give as collateral for a loan .
Jewish law strictly required its return every evening at sunset .
Matthew and Luke disagree whether it is the outer garment ( Luke ) or the undergarment ( Matthew ) that is being seized .
But the Jewish practice of giving the outer garment as a pledge ( it alone would be useful as a blanket for sleeping ) makes it clear that Luke 's order is correct , even though he does not preserve the legal setting .
In all Greek usage , according to Liddell - Scott , himation is " always an outer garment ... worn above the chiton , " whereas the chiton is a " garment worn next to the skin . "
Consistent with this usage , the Greek translation of the Old Testament ( LXX ) reads himation in the passages just cited .
S. Safrai and M. Stern describe normal Jewish dress : an outer garment or cloak of wool and an undergarment or tunic of linen .
To avoid confusion I will simply refer to the " outer garment " and the " undergarment . "
The situation Jesus speaks to is all too familiar to his hearers : the debtor has sunk ever deeper into poverty , the debt cannot be repaid , and his creditor has summoned him to court ( krithenai ) to exact repayment by legal means .
Indebtedness was endemic in first century Palestine .
Jesus ' parables are full of debtors struggling to salvage their lives .
Heavy debt was not , however , a natural calamity that had overtaken the incompetent .
It was the direct consequence of Roman imperial policy .
Emperors had taxed the wealthy so stringently to fund their wars that the rich began seeking non ?
liquid investments to secure their wealth .
Land was best , but it was ancestrally owned and passed down over generations , and no peasant would voluntarily relinquish it .
Exorbitant interest , however , could be used to drive landowners ever deeper into debt .
And debt , coupled with the high taxation required by Herod Antipas to pay Rome tribute , created the economic leverage to pry Galilean peasants loose from their land .
By the time of Jesus we see this process already far advanced : large estates owned by absentee landlords , managed by stewards , and
worked by tenant farmers , day laborers , and slaves .
It is no accident that the first act of the Jewish revolutionaries in 66 C.E. was to burn the Temple treasury , where the record of debts was kept .
It is to this situation that Jesus speaks .
His hearers are the poor ( " if any one would sue you " ) .
They share a rankling hatred for a system that subjects them to humiliation by stripping them of their lands , their goods , finally even their outer garments .
Why then does Jesus counsel them to give over their undergarments as well ?
This would mean stripping off all their clothing and marching out of court stark naked !
Imagine the guffaws this saying must have evoked .
There stands the creditor , covered with shame , the poor debtor 's outer garment in the one hand , his undergarment in the other .
The tables have suddenly been turned on the creditor .
The debtor had no hope of winning the case ; the law was entirely in the creditor 's favor .
But the poor man has transcended this attempt to humiliate him .
He has risen above shame .
At the same time he has registered a stunning protest against the system that created his debt .
He has said in effect , " You want my robe ?
Here , take everything !
Now you 've got all I have except my body .
Is that what you 'll take next ? "
Nakedness was taboo in Judaism , and shame fell less on the naked party than on the person viewing or causing the nakedness ( Gen 9:20 - 27 ) .
By stripping , the debtor has brought the creditor under the same prohibition that led to the curse of Canaan .
And much as Isaiah had " walked naked and barefoot for three years " as a prophetic sign ( Isa. 20:1 - 6 ) , so the debtor parades his nakedness in prophetic protest against a system that has deliberately rendered him destitute .
Imagine him leaving the court , naked : his friends and neighbors , aghast , inquire what happened .
He explains .
They join his growing procession , which now resembles a victory parade .
The entire system by which debtors are oppressed has been publicly unmasked .
The creditor is revealed to be not a legitimate moneylender but a party to the reduction of an entire social class to landlessness , destitution , and abasement .
This unmasking is not simply
punitive , therefore ; it offers the creditor a chance to see , perhaps for the first time in his
life , what his practices cause , and to repent .
The Powers That Be literally stand on their dignity .
Nothing depotentiates them faster than deft lampooning .
By refusing to be awed by their power , the powerless are emboldened to seize the initiative , even where structural change is not immediately possible .
This message , far from being a counsel to perfection unattainable in this life , is a practical , strategic measure for empowering the oppressed , and it is being lived out all over the world today by powerless people ready to take their history into their own hands .
Jesus provides here a hint of how to take on the entire system by unmasking its essential cruelty and burlesquing its pretensions to justice .
Here is a poor man who will no longer be treated as a sponge to be squeezed dry by the rich .
He accepts the laws as they stand , pushes them to absurdity , and reveals them for what they have become .
He strips naked , walks out before his fellows , and leaves this creditor , and the whole economic edifice which he represents , stark naked .
Go the Second Mile
Jesus ' third example , the one about going the second mile , is drawn from the relatively enlightened practice of limiting the amount of forced or impressed labor ( angareia ) that Roman soldiers could levy on subject peoples to a single mile .
The term angareia is probably Persian , and became a loan ? word in Aramaic , Greek and Latin .
Josephus mentions it in reference to the Seleucid ruler , Demetrius who , in order to enlist Jewish support for his bid to be king , promised , among other things , that " the Jews ' beasts of burden shall not be requisitioned ( angareuesthai ) for our army " ( Ant. 13.52 ) .
We are more familiar with its use in the Passion Narrative , where the soldiers " compel " ( angareuousin ) Simon of Cyrene to carry Jesus ' cross ( Mark 15:21// Matt. 27:32 ) .
Such forced service was a constant feature in Palestine from Persian to late Roman times , and whoever was found on the street could be compelled into service .
Most cases of impressment involved the need of the postal service for animals and the need of soldiers for civilians to help carry their packs .
The situation in Matthew is clearly the latter .
It is not a matter of equisitioning animals but people themselves .
This forced labor was a source of bitter resentment by all Roman subjects .
" Angareia is like death , " complains one source .
The sheer frequency , even into the late empire , of legislation proscribing the misuse of the angareia shows how regularly the practice was used and its regulations violated .
An inscription of 49 C.E. from Egypt orders that Roman " soldiers of any degree when passing through the several districts are not to make any requisitions or to employ forced transport ( angareia ) unless they have the prefect 's written authority " -- a rescript clearly made necessary by soldiers abusing their privileges .
Another decree from Egypt from 133-137 C.E. documents this abuse : " Many soldiers without written requisition are travelling about in the country , demanding ships , beasts of burden , and men , beyond anything authorized , sometimes seizing things by force ... to the point of showing abuse and threats to private citizens , the result is that the military is associated with arrogance and injustice . "
In order to minimize resentment in the conquered lands , at least some effort was made by Rome to punish violators of the laws regarding impressment .
The Theodosian Code devotes an entire section to angareia .
Among its ordinances are these :
If any person while making a journey should consider that he may abstract an ox that is not assigned to the public post but dedicated to the plow , he shall be arrested with due force by the rural police ... and he shall be haled before the judge [ normally the governor ] ( 8.5.1 , 315 C.E. ) .
By this interdict
We forbid that any person should deem that they may request packanimals and supplementary posthorses .
But if any person should rashly act so presumptuously , he shall be punished very severely ( 8.5.6 , 354 C.E. , ital. added ) .
When any legion is proceeding to its destination , it shall not hereafter attempt to appropriate more than two posthorses ( angariae ) , and only for the sake of any who are sick ( 8.5.11 , 360 C.E. ) .
Late as these regulations are , they reflect a situation that had changed little since the time of the Persians .
Armies had to be moved through countries with dispatch .
Some legionnaires bought their own slaves to help carry their packs of sixty to eighty ? five pounds ( not including weapons ) .
The majority of the rank and file , however , had to depend on impressed civilians .
There are vivid accounts of whole villages fleeing to avoid being forced to carry soldiers ' baggage , and of richer towns prepared to pay large sums to escape having Roman soldiers billeted on them for winter .
With few exceptions , the commanding general of a legion personally administered justice in serious cases , and all other cases were left to the disciplinary control of his subordinates .
Centurions had almost limitless authority in dealing with routine cases of discipline .
This accounts for the curious fact that there is very little codified military law , and that late .
Roman military historians are agreed , however , that military law changed very little in its essential character throughout the imperial period .
No account survives to us today of the penalties to be meted out to soldiers for forcing a civilian to carry his pack more than the permitted mile , but there are at least hints .
" If in winter quarters , in camp , or on the march , either an officer
or a soldier does injury to a civilian , and does not fully repair the same , he shall pay the damage twofold . "
This is about as mild a penalty , however , as one can find .
Josephus ' comment is surely exaggerated , even if it states the popular impression : Roman military forces " have laws which punish with death not merely desertion of the ranks , but even a slight neglect of duty " ( J.W. 3.102-8 ) .
Between these extremes there was deprivation of pay , a ration of barley instead of wheat , reduction in rank , dishonorable discharge , being forced to camp outside the fortifications , or to stand all day before the general 's tent holding a clod in one 's hands , or to stand barefoot in public places .
But the most frequent punishment by far was flogging .
The frequency with which decrees were issued to curb misuse of the angareia indicates how lax discipline on this point was .
Perhaps the soldier might receive only a rebuke .
But the point is that the soldier does not know what will happen .
It is in this context of Roman military occupation that Jesus speaks .
He does not counsel revolt .
One does not " befriend " the soldier , draw him aside and drive a knife into his ribs .
Jesus was surely aware of the futility of armed insurrection against Roman imperial might ; he certainly did nothing to encourage those whose hatred of Rome was near to flaming into violence .
But why carry his pack a second mile ?
Is this not to rebound to the opposite extreme of aiding and abetting the enemy ?
Not at all .
The question here , as in the two previous instances , is how the oppressed can recover the initiative and assert their human dignity in a situation that cannot for the time being be changed .
The rules are Caesar's , but how one responds to the rules is God's , and Caesar has no power over that .
Imagine then the soldier 's surprise when , at the next mile marker , he reluctantly reaches to assume his pack , and the civilian says , " Oh no , let me carry it another mile . "
Why would he want to do that ?
What is he up to ?
Normally , soldiers have to coerce people to carry their packs , but this Jew does so cheerfully , and will not stop !
Is this a provocation ?
Is he insulting the legionnaire 's strength ?
Being kind ?
Trying to get him disciplined for seeming to violate the rules of impressment ?
Will this civilian file a complaint ?
Create trouble ?
From a situation of servile impressment , the oppressed have once more seized the initiative .
They have taken back the power of choice .
The soldier is thrown off balance by being deprived of the predictability of his victim 's response .
He has never dealt with such a problem before .
Now he has been forced into making a decision for which nothing in his previous experience has prepared him .
If he has enjoyed feeling superior to the vanquished , he will not enjoy it today .
Imagine the situation of a Roman infantryman pleading with a Jew to give back his pack !
The humor of this scene may have escaped us , but it could scarcely have been lost on Jesus ' hearers , who must have been regaled at the prospect of thus discomfiting their oppressors .
Jesus does not encourage Jews to walk a second mile in order to build up merit in heaven , or to exercise a supererogatory piety , or to kill the soldier with kindness .
He is helping an oppressed people find a way to protest and neutralize an onerous practice despised throughout the empire .
He is not giving a non-political message of spiritual world - transcendence .
He is formulating a worldly spirituality in which the people at the bottom of society or under the thumb of imperial power learn to recover their humanity .
One could easily misuse Jesus ' advice vindictively ; that is why it must not be separated from the command to love enemies integrally connected with it in both Matthew and Luke .
But love is not averse to taking the law and using its oppressive momentum to throw the soldier into a region of uncertainty and anxiety where he has never been before .
Such tactics can seldom be repeated .
One can imagine that within days after the incidents that Jesus sought to provoke , the Powers That Be would pass new laws : penalties for nakedness in court , flogging for carrying a pack more than a mile !
One must be creative , improvising new tactics to keep the opponent off balance .
To those whose lifelong pattern has been to cringe before their masters , Jesus offers a way to liberate themselves from servile actions and a servile mentality .
And he asserts that they can do this before there is a revolution .
There is no need to wait until Rome has been defeated , or peasants are landed and slaves freed .
They can begin to behave with dignity and recovered humanity now , even under the unchanged conditions of the old order .
Jesus ' sense of divine immediacy has social implications .
The reign of God is already breaking into the world , and it comes , not as an imposition from on high , but as the leaven slowly causing the dough to rise ( Matt . 13:33//Luke 13:20 -21 ) .
Jesus ' teaching on nonviolence is thus of a piece with his proclamation of the dawning of the reign of God .
In the conditions of first - century Palestine , a political revolution against the Romans could only be catastrophic , as the events of 66 - 73 C.E. would prove .
Jesus does not propose armed revolution .
But he does lay the foundations for a social revolution , as Richard A. Horsley has pointed out .
And a social revolution becomes political when it reaches a critical threshold of acceptance ; this in fact did happen to the Roman empire as the Christian church overcame it from below .
Nor were peasants and slaves in a position to transform the economic system by frontal assault .
But they could begin to act from an already recovered dignity and freedom , and the ultimate consequences of such acts could only be revolutionary .
To that end , Jesus spoke repeatedly of a voluntary remission of debts .
It is entirely appropriate , then , that the saying on debts in Matt .
5:42//Luke 6:30 //Gos. Thom. 95 has been added to this saying - block .
Jesus counsels his hearers not just to practice alms and to lend money , even to bad - risks , but to lend without expecting interest or even the return of the principal .
Such radical egalitarian sharing would be necessary to rescue impoverished Palestinian peasants from their plight ; one need not posit an imminent end of history as the cause for such astonishing generosity .
And yet none of this is new ; Jesus is merely issuing a prophetic summons to Israel to observe the commandments pertaining to the sabbatical year
enshrined in Torah , adapted to a new situation .
Such radical sharing would be necessary in order to restore true community .
For the risky defiance of the Powers that Jesus advocates would inevitably issue in punitive economic sanctions and physical punishment against individuals .
They would need economic support ; Matthew 's " Give to everyone who asks ( aitounti - - not necessarily begs ) of you " may simply refer to this need for mutual sustenance .
Staggering interest and taxes isolated peasants , who went under one by one .
This was a standard tactic of imperial " divide and rule " strategy .
Jesus ' solution was neither utopian nor apocalyptic .
It was simple realism .
Nothing less could halt or reverse the economic decline of Jewish peasants than a complete suspension of usury and debt and a restoration of economic equality through outright grants , a pattern actually mplemented in the earliest Christian community , according to the Book of Acts .
Jesus ' Third Way
Jesus ' alternative to both fight and flight can be graphically presented by a chart :
Jesus ' Third Way Seize the moral initiative
Find a creative alternative to violence
Assert your own humanity and dignity as a person
Meet force with ridicule or humor
Break the cycle of humiliation
Refuse to submit or to accept the inferior position
Expose the injustice of the system
Take control of the power dynamic
Shame the oppressor into repentance
Stand your ground
Make the Powers make decisions for which they are not prepared
Recognize your own power
Be willing to suffer rather than retaliate
Force the oppressor to see you in a new light
Deprive the oppressor of a situation where a show of force is effective
Be willing to undergo the penalty of breaking unjust laws
Die to fear of the old order and its rules
Seek the oppressor 's transformation
Flight Fight
Submission Armed revolt
Passivity Violent rebellion
Withdrawal Direct retaliation
Surrender Revenge
Jesus , in short , abhors both passivity and violence .
The goal is a living - and - learning environment that promotes both school spirit and responsibility to community among an increasingly diverse student body .
" A very small percentage of students see me as a father figure , but I try to discourage that , " says sociologist Tony Brown
who opens his dorm apartment on Friday evenings for rap sessions , using bait like cookies , Wii Tennis and his pet rabbit .
" At move - in , I can't tell you how many parents said to me , ' Oh , good , you 're an adult .
Please take care of my kid !'
But this was sold to us as an academic endeavor , " [ says a professor . ]
Vanderbilt has a $ 1.75 billion capital campaign to turn all the rest of its dorms into neighborhoods where some 5,000 upperclassmen and their professors can live and eat together ... [ Says ] Michael McLendon , who teaches public policy and higher education at Vanderbilt .
" Now we want to make sure their education is social . "
But it 's not just for freshmen , it will also house 10 professors and a " Dean " who will live there .
Yes , some of the professors have families .
Someone will say , " but what 's wrong with that ?
Why not segregate them a little , hell , even coddle them a little , in a highly intellectual environment where they can focus on their studies without the outside distractions ?
" And what would those outside distractions be ?
One year later , those freshman will have theoretically benefited mightily from this experience , and move on to be sophomores .
Why would the next generation of freshman need to be walled off from them ?
Why are sophomores a distraction to freshman ?
Put another way : what possible distraction could sophomores -- older , theoretically wiser -- be that other freshman are not already , but worse ?
What does anyone expect freshman to learn from other freshmen -- and ten professors ?
If you want them to develop , should n't they be living , ideally , with people who can elevate them , or at leastfrom other freshmen ?
Really .
I 'm not really a soldier in the culture wars , but could every one of those words be any less the purpose of a college education ?
One might legitimately ask what possible role in - dorm professors could have .
It 's pretty hard for me to believe that 1500 freshmen are going to skipto go hang out with their ( ten ) professors -- unless their professors are watching But setting kids up in an idyllic environment where they have no responsibilities except their school work and who have ten people acting as " guides " does n't sound much like discouraging being seen as a father figure .
Or do you have another method ?
Tremendous .
Do n't blame the kids outright .
Always blame the parents , always , not because they are " ultimately responsible " but because they are the ones that set this up , a ten dorm extension of The Village .
Maybe the Wii Tennis sent the wrong message .
Maybe the Glass Bead Game would have been better .
It does n't stop with freshmen .
Why , again ?-----
Part 2 here .
( You 're reading it . )
Do n't forget about Diggs , Reddits and donations .
Do n't make me run a pledge drive .
Shopping at Nordstrom in Miami this month , Maria Kakouris indulged herself with a $ 200 pair of satin - and - snakeskin pumps .
Then came a spasm of buyer ’s remorse .
“ Those shoes  they are still in my car with the receipt , ” said Ms. Kakouris , a real estate agent .
“ I ’m thinking , where am I going to wear them ? ”
In less challenging times , Ms. Kakouris might have hung onto the shoes .
But now she is more circumspect .
“ They ’re going right back where they came from , ” she said .
In giving up her splurge , Ms. Kakouris joined a steeply rising number of shoppers who , driven by anxiety over jobs and savings , or an immediate need for cash , are marching back to stores with their purchases .
Consumers are expected to return a record $ 219 billion of merchandise this year , or 8.7 percent of total sales , compared with 7.3 percent in 2007 , according to a survey released Thursday by the National Retail Federation .

An ABC news profile ( 6/20/2007 . )
It has to be seen to be believed .
And it 's 1..2 ...3.. what are we not fighting for ?
Via Kevin Drum comes a piece in the NYT looking at the powderkeg of factional tensions in Mosul .
The Shiite - led government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki is squeezing out Kurdish units of the Iraqi Army from Mosul , sending the national police and army from Baghdad and trying to forge alliances with Sunni Arab hard - liners in the province , who have deep - seated feuds with the Kurdistan Regional Government led by Massoud Barzani .
....
“ It ’s the perfect storm against the old festering background , ” warned Brig .
Gen. Raymond A. Thomas III , who oversees Nineveh and Kirkuk Provinces and the Kurdish region .
Worry is so high that the American military has already settled on a policy that may set a precedent , as the United States slowly withdraws to allow Iraqis to settle their own problems .
If the Kurds and Iraqi government forces fight , the American military will “ step aside , ” General Thomas said , rather than “ have United States servicemen get killed trying to play peacemaker . ”
As one of Drum 's commenters notes :
As I recall it , the program was : ( 1 ) increase troop levels ( 2 ) to reduce the violence to make space for ( 3 ) political reconciliation that will provide the foundation for ( 4 ) a reduction in violence not dependent on American troops ( 5 ) that will enable us to gradually withdraw without having to worry about whether Iraq will blow up again .
We never got past step 2 .
Now the reckoning .
That reckoning will involve violence , in more than one place and between more than just two factions , in the lead up to Iraq 's provincial elections .
The only real question is : how bad will it get ?
I totally understand Brig . Gen Thomas ' wish not to have his people die policing a civil war six years into the U.S. occupation but does n't this blow wide open the conservative talking point , so beloved of both Bush and McCain , that US troops have to stay in Iraq to help prevent such violence ?
Why are we still there ?
Of course , if there 's no new status of forces deal by January Thomas ' plans become moot , since it 's likely US forces would be confined to base anyway .
In fact , they 're using the threat of exactly that to try to strongarm Iraqi into accepting an agreement it is n't happy with .
McClatchy reports :
The U.S. military has warned Iraq that it will shut down military operations and other vital services throughout the country on Jan. 1 if the Iraqi government does n't agree to a new agreement on the status of U.S. forces or a renewed United Nations mandate for the American mission in Iraq .
Many Iraqi politicians view the move as akin to political blackmail , a top Iraqi official told McClatchy Sunday .
In addition to halting all military actions , U.S. forces would cease activities that support Iraq ’s economy , educational sector and other areas _ " everything " _ said Tariq al Hashimi , the country ’s Sunni Muslim vice president .
" I did n’t know the Americans are rendering such wide - scale services . "
Hashimi said that Army Gen. Ray Odierno , the top U.S. military commander in Iraq , listed “ tens ” of areas of potential cutoffs in a three - page letter , and he said the implied threat caught Iraqi leaders by surprise .
But if the US military is planning to stay out of any faction fights anyway , just how much of a threat is that ?

Fans of Aardman Animations , Nick Park , and their most famous characters Wallace and Gromit , rejoice !
A brand - new short film featuring the inventor and his dog is coming this Christmas , at least in the U.K .
It ’s not clear when it ’ll make it to BBC America , or other U.S. television , or DVD , but I have to think pretty soon .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
It ’s called A Matter of Loaf and Death , a title chosen because its original title " Trouble At ’ Mill " was deemed too colloquially British and likely to confuse North American audiences .
In the new 30 - minute film , Wallace and Gromit have started a bakery business called " Top Bun , " a name so perfectly punny one wonders why nobody ’s used it for a real bakery thus far ( at least , I could n’t find one by Googling ) .
Wallace will meet and fall in love with a bread commercial model named Piella Bakewell , while Gromit will evidently form his own romance with Bakewell ’s poodle , named Fluffles ( one wonders if Fluffles , like Gromit , will be silent and mouthless ) .
There ’s a murder mystery to be solved , as someone is apparently killing bakers , and Gromit suspects Ms. Bakewell has something to do with it .
No doubt there will , as usual , be nutty contraptions galore , all sprung from Wallace ’s mind .
If you live in the U.K. , you have the chance to see the new film on the big screen on November 27th in Bristol .
If you ca n’t make it to that , you ’ll have to catch it on BBC One sometime around Christmas ( the exact date and time have yet to be announced ) .
Alas , for those of us ( like me ) who live elsewhere , we shall have to wait even longer , but there ’s no doubt it will make it to us in time ( else why would they have changed the title ? ) .
In the meantime , we can read the production blog on the official website , and keep an eye on the latest news to find out when we can see it for ourselves .
Until then , please do n’t spoil it for us .
Thanks !
The major development , however , has been the encroachment of Sharia law into public life .
Last February , the Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams , declared that British Sharia was " inevitable . "
In fact , instruments for expanding it already exist .
A network of Muslim Arbitration Tribunals ( MATs ) has been set up with Home Office support .
In theory , these bodies are just a form of " alternative dispute resolution " .
They are " unable to deal with criminal offences " , says the MAT website .
Yet it also confirms that they can " assist " the police with domestic violence , sometimes " with a view to reconsidering criminal charges " .

Functional stream libraries let us easily build stream processing pipelines , by composing sequences of simple transformers such as map or filter with producers ( backed by an array , a file , or a generating function ) and consumers ( reducers ) .
The purely applicative approach of building a complex pipeline from simple immutable pieces simplifies programming and reasoning : the assembled pipeline is an executable specification .
To be practical , however , a library has to be efficient : at the very least , it should avoid creating intermediate structures -- especially structures like files and lists whose size grows with the length of the stream .
Even the bounded - size intermediate structures significantly , up to two orders of magnitude , slow down the processing .
Eliminating the intermediate structures is the central problem in stream processing : so - called stream fusion .
Stream fusion has been the subject of intensive research since late 1950's .
By now , the low - hanging fruit in stream processing has been all picked up -- although some of it quite recently , POPL 2017 .
Stream fusion made it to the front page of CACM ( May 2017 ) .
Java 8 Streams and Haskell compilers , among others , have implemented some of the earlier research results .
We have attained a milestone .
What are the further challenges ?
That was the topic of many discussions at the workshop .
Several main questions have come up over and over again :
Push and pull duality , their expressiveness and efficiency
error handling , and , in general , control of stream processing
sparsity of data .
As a tangible outcome , the meeting has identified a set of problems -- challenges -- to help drive and evaluate further research : filterMax , sorted merge , multiple appends , parallel merge .
The report of the meeting discusses them in detail .
The workshop is organized together with Aggelos Biboudis and Martin Odersky .
The Shonan seminar series is sponsored by Japan 's National Institute of Informatics ( NII ) .

At the same time that Christians claim to worship God as an omnipotent , omnipresent , omnibenevolent being , they make him out to be incompetent bumbler .
Or worse .
Simple forgiveness is beyond his capacities .
God must " sacrifice himself to himself to change a rule he made himself ! "
This is not only an absurdity , it is an essential absurdity .
It is present in almost all forms of Christianity , and one can scarcely remove it and remain a Christian in anything but name .
By definition , all Christians worship Christ - in some form - and most worship him as a saviour .
But what , exactly , is he saving us from ?
Though it varies from church to church , no matter what they call it , it 's God himself .
A hell created by God , a world fallen as a result of God 's negligence , a separation from God imposed ... by God .
Christianity certainly is n't the first religion to promote appeasement of its gods , and if it were merely another supernatural protection racket , it would be bad enough .
Unfortunately , it does n't stop there .
Christians elevate appeasement to the realm of " personal relationship " , transforming their religion into a true monstrosity .
This is the type of " relationship " that abused wives have with their husbands , that brainwashed hostages have with their captors .
It is known in clinical circles as Stockholm Syndrome .
Should it come as any surprise that the cries of the church , " The Bride of Christ " sound much like the cries of an abused wife attempting to protect her husband ?
" He must beat me . "
" I deserve it . "
" He has no choice . "
" It 's for my own good . "
These excuses do n't work for human abusers , and they work even less well for God .
For if God is omnipotent , he must have a choice .
And if we are flawed , we are only flawed because that is the way he made us .
( No excuses that we ruined his perfect creation .
A truly perfect creation does not self - destruct . )
If the Christian God does exist - and I see no reason to believe that he does - he 's not worthy of the name .
And that is the ultimate absurdity of Christianity .
The next time some non-thinking , anti-intellectual religious knob head spins that one about all the good that comes from the word of the Lord , ask them to explain a God that would allow this shit …
In a vote of historic proportions yesterday , Senator Barack Obama became President - Elect of the United States of America with a 52 % majority in the popular vote , and more than 349 electoral votes .
Over two years of campaigning was resolved with a record voter turnout , as the Republican candidate John McCain conceded graciously at 11:20 pm eastern last night .
With such a high level of interest and attention , there have been millions of words written and photographs taken of the candidates over the past year .
Here is a collection of some of the best photos of President - Elect Barack Obama over the past several months .

As a physician in Peru , Luis Garcia amassed nine years of medical education and five years of practice , including successful appendectomies , Cesarean deliveries and other surgeries .
Since he immigrated to Southern California four years ago , he has earned a community college degree specializing in geriatrics .
The only work he ’s been able to find , however , has been cat - sitting , dog - walking and elder care .
That ’s because Garcia has n’t yet been able to pass the battery of requirements for a U.S. medical license , including several exams and a residency .
He represents what a recent report calls a massive “ brain waste ” of highly educated and skilled immigrant professionals who potentially could , with a little aid , help ease looming labor shortages in California and nationwide in healthcare , computer sciences and other skilled jobs .
“ I feel lost , ” Garcia said .
“ Sometimes I ’m embarrassed to talk to my family back home and tell them I ’m taking care of dogs .
But I know someday I will be able to do my geriatrics practice , and I know there are people here who need my help . ”

Nationwide , more than 1.3 million college - educated legal immigrants are unemployed or working in unskilled jobs such as dishwashers or taxi drivers , according to the report by the Washington - based Migration Policy Institute .
Nearly one - fourth of them , or 317,000 , live in California .
Professionals from Latin America and Africa fare worse than those from Asia and Europe , the study found .
Two of the biggest barriers are lack of English fluency and non-recognition of foreign academic and professional criteria .
In some cases , for instance , U.S. medical systems require course work typically not required abroad , such as maternity and psychiatric nursing , according to Julie Hughes - Lederer , interim director of the Los Angeles County Regional Health Occupations Resource Center .
Medical licensing exams are also different , such as the use of multiple - choice exams in the United States -- a format regarded as more difficult than the essay exams used in other countries .

“ A lot of this is just technical obstacles they have to get through , ” Hughes - Lederer said .
“ We do n’t have to question their capability to learn and progress .
You know they have the gray matter . ”
Immigrants say shortages of time and money prevent them from pursuing the needed U.S. credentials .
Arsal Awan , 50 , immigrated to the United States in 1985 shortly after earning his law degree in Pakistan .
But he was forced to abandon his professional career ambitions when his father suddenly died and he needed to begin sending money to his family back home .
He worked in a duty - free shop , started a radio show and 15 years ago began driving taxis in L.A. -- a job he still does 12 hours a day despite the back , knee and stomach problems he says it causes him .
“ I always wanted to be in the legal field , but you really have to study a lot , and I never had a chance to go to school ” here , Awan said .
Michael Fix , senior vice president of the Migration Policy Institute , said the need to help immigrant professionals gain the requisite credentials and experience is particularly acute now that the nation faces the impending retirement of 77 million baby boomers , considered the most skilled workforce in history .
In California , for instance , the fastest growing occupations are computer software engineer and registered nurse .

California also faces shortages of health professionals who can speak the language and understand the cultures of the state ’s increasingly diverse population .
Latinos , for instance , make up 35.5 % of California ’s population but only 5.2 % of its physicians and 5.7 % of its registered nurses , according to data compiled by the Welcome Back Initiative , a program primarily funded by the California Endowment and the California Wellness Foundation to help immigrant health professionals overcome barriers to practicing in the state .
Since its inception in 2001 , the program has helped nearly 8,000 foreign healthcare professionals from more than 160 countries by offering courses , training , counseling and other services .
The endowment ’s funding , however , is set to expire this year .
The migration institute report noted that competition for such professionals is heating up , with other countries such as Canada and Australia moving aggressively to attract them with better transition programs .
“ The U.S. historically enjoyed the advantage in picking the best immigrants in the world , ” said Jeanne Batalova , a policy analyst with the institute .
“ But with other countries entering the race for global talent , the U.S. is losing its competitive advantage . ”

The report urged several new measures to help ease the way for immigrant professionals , including more language and workforce training , national coordination of credentialing criteria and three - year transitional visas to allow employers to “ test the waters ” with foreign workers .
The report also suggested an expansion of successful programs such as Welcome Back .
At Welcome Back ’s Southern California center at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut , several immigrants huddled over a plastic arm sheathed in a tattooed covering to learn how to draw blood .
Although all of them had drawn blood countless times in their careers , instructor Xochitl Manriquez was teaching them how to use the latest U.S. technologies .
The class was part of their training to become medical assistants -- work far below their qualifications that would nonetheless get them back into the healthcare field .
The group included physicians from Peru , Mexico and Iran , radiologists from Honduras and nurses from El Salvador .
They related , sometimes tearfully , their experiences of leaving their homes to come here and the difficult times they ’ve had trying to reclaim their professional careers and identities .
Some were pushed out by violence and poverty , others were pulled by the chance to learn advanced U.S. medical techniques .

Marta Martinez , a nurse from Mexico , said she had to lay carpet and sell flowers on the street when she first came to California more than a decade ago .
She said she shelled out $ 850 to a private firm that guaranteed it could help her pass her U.S. licensing exam for nurses , but she failed .
Like several of the professionals , Martinez said her big mistake was taking the exams before she had mastered sufficient English .
Manriquez , licensed as a physician in Mexico , assembled lamps in her uncle ’s factory in her first job in the United States .
She passed the first exams required for a U.S. medical license but abandoned the process after being diagnosed with cancer .
She now teaches in the Welcome Back program and does volunteer surgeries and other medical work in Mexico with two international medical organizations to “ shake my frustration ” of not being able to work as a doctor here .
“ Human beings in the whole world are the same , ” said Fariba Fadaee , an Iranian doctor who passed all of her U.S. medical exams and is now applying for a residency .
“ If we can manage patients in our own country , we can do it here too . ”

( PHOTOS )
We were dumbfounded to seebeing carried on the sidewalks of Manhattan by someone other thanor
We 'll hazard a guess that the gentleman in the photo is an employee of the family who sees to their security .
Two year old Suri is usually hiding under a blanket , shielding her face from view or displaying a look of disgust at the paparazzi .
She seems quite happy in these pics .
Today is Katie 's 30th birthday and she and Suri set off to visit a combination private nursery school and performing arts center .
It looks like the little princess might be expanding her horizons soon .
Katie has been fully immersed in her Broadway play All My Sons and Tom Cruise is in the midst of promoting his latest film Valkyrie .
Cruise was reportedly tied up with his own guest appearances and skipped the Los Angeles premiere of his son's movie Seven Pounds .
Connor Cruise has a role in the film , playing a younger version of Will Smith 's character .

The recent attention paid to a notorious Long Island hate crime in which a group of young whites went in search of Latinos to harm has raised serious questions about the relationship between immigrant - bashing rhetoric and the surge of anti-Latino bias crimes nationally .
And the mainstream purveyors of this rhetoric -- particularly pundits like Bill O'Reilly and Lou Dobbs -- are denying their culpability in the only means available to them :
By distorting the reality of hate crimes themselves .
In O'Reilly 's case , this entailed conflating hate crimes with ordinary ( and completely unrelated ) crimes .
And in Dobbs ' , as we saw on his Monday program , it entails distorting statistics and pretending that he 's never bashed or demonized Latinos on his CNN show :
DOBBS : Advocates of open borders and amnesty accusing border security advocates of fostering a wave of hate , but as usual , those groups led by La Raza and MALDEF were long on rhetoric and absolutely , absolutely devoid of facts or respect for them .
Bill Tucker has our report .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) BILL TUCKER , CNN CORRESPONDENT ( voice - over ) : Being tough on illegal immigration is a bad thing in the eyes of La Raza , a Hispanic special interest group which says it represents the civil rights of all Latino immigrants .
The group blames the murder of Marcello Lucero , an Ecuadorian immigrant on Long Island , New York , on a wave of immigrant hate sparked by local politicians who have called for enforcement of immigration law .
JANET MURGUIA , NATIONAL COUNCIL OF LA RAZA : Steve Levy has taken a notably hard line against immigrants in his county and has been lauded by cable hosts like Lou Dobbs as a folk hero .
TUCKER : The community has shown no tolerance for the crime .
Seven teenagers were quickly arrested and charged with hate crimes ranging from assault to manslaughter in connection with that murder , the leader of the gang being held without bail .
Lucero 's murder though is being used by special interest groups like La Raza and MALDEF to call attention to what they call " a wave of hate crime in America . "
However , just last month the FBI reported a slight decline in hate crimes nationally last year .
The FBI saying there were just over 7,600 hate crimes versus just over 7,700 the year before .
Groups calling for the enforcement of immigration law are furious that La Raza and MALDEF and others equate their position with hate .
DAN STEIN , F.A.I.R. : Their true agenda is to try to stop public discussion about the need to control the borders .
And they are using isolated incidents , tragic incidents , to be sure , but isolated ones , and distorting statistics to try to muzzle important free - speech rights in this country .
TUCKER : Not once in the news conference was the phrase " illegal immigration " used or heard , instead the phrase " immigrant bashing " and " anti-immigrant " were the word choices of the day .
Dobbs and Tucker essentially lie by omission here :
Even though hate crimes have in fact declined overall in the past couple of years , anti-Latino bias crimes have actually increased significantly .
In other words , the statistics actually speak strongly to the fact that Latino - bashing bias crimes are on the rise because those figures run counter to the larger trend of declines in such crimes generally .
[ Heidi Beirich at SPLC's Hatewatch has more on this point . ]
Even more bizarre is Dobbs ' shock and horror of being accused of culpability .
Actually , this can't be a surprise for Dobbs :
He has been called out on this score before , and he has similarly been unable to offer any kind of adequate defense , so he has blustered , snarled , and distorted .
Yet on Monday , he was once again seemingly baffled by the criticism .
As for the claim that the Latino - bashing is something else -- the neutral and completely benign criticism of illegal immigration generally -- we 've known this is nonsense for some time , especially Lou Dobbs ' case .
If Dobbs and cohorts like FAIR ( an SPLC - designated hate group ) really were only concerned about only illegal immigration , then Dobbs needs to explain :
* Why he makes up phony statistics connecting immigration generically with a supposed increase in diseases like leprosy .
*
Why he broadcasts white - supremacist mythology about a Hispanic “ Aztlan ” conspiracy to return the Southwest to Mexico . *
Why he continually claims that Latino immigration is responsible for an increase in crime .
*
Why he once said that this wave of immigration is turning America into “ a third world cesspool ” ( a remark that has since been removed from the CNN website ) .
*
Why he constantly promotes the notion of making English the official U.S. language .
*
Why he regularly refers to this wave of immigration as an “ invasion . ” *
Why he regularly hosts anti-immigrant voices from white - supremacist groups and vigilante scam artists like the Minutemen and yet neglects to explain his guests ' troubling backgrounds .
You also had to love Tucker 's attempt to use the election of Barack Obama as a shield against accusations of racism .
Evidently , because Obama won the presidency , racism and hate crimes no longer are serious problems :
TUCKER : And today 's news conference was not without irony .
While trying to make the argument that a new wave of hate is rising in America , the participants had to admit and acknowledge that the president - elect is a black man who was elected by a majority of Americans , Lou .
So apparently Obama 's election has now absolved America 's racists and their enablers -- people who manifestly did their damnedest to prevent that outcome -- of all their past sins .
I 'll bet Dobbs never thought Obama 's victory would give him yet another reason to feel all smug and warm .
And that 's obviously how he absolves himself from feeling any responsibility for the Latino victims of the crimes he helps inspire .
It has entered political lore as the “ Bradley effect ” -- the supposed tendency of some white voters to lie when asked if they support a black candidate , producing a bubble of support that is n’t really there .
Named for the precipitous defeat in the 1982 California governor ’s race of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley -- after polls suggested his victory -- the effect has led to churning concern among backers of Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign that the lead he holds will vanish come election day .
But the anxiety masks reality : Bradley ’s narrow loss stemmed from a convergence of political difficulties for the mayor , who was then seeking to become the nation ’s first African American governor , and only one of them was his race .
Twenty - six years later , those engaged in that contest still differ on whether there was a Bradley effect .
More to the point for Obama , there is no evidence that one still exists .
A recent study by a Harvard political scientist showed no sign since 1996 of an otherwise unexplained election day drop - off in support for African American candidates for governor or U.S. Senate .

That is not to say that race is not an issue , particularly as Obama seeks to become the first black president .
Exit polls in primary states demonstrated that for many voters , Obama ’s race was a stumbling block .
But those voters were open about their views , suggesting that polls may be roughly accurate .
Joe Trippi , the deputy campaign manager for Bradley in 1982 , thinks voter discomfort with the Democratic mayor ’s race was key to his defeat but that those concerns have eased with time .
“ Whatever doubts race caused 26 years ago , it does n’t create the same level of doubt today , ” Trippi said .
“ Anyone who thinks it ’s zero is kidding themselves , ” he cautioned .
“ But it ’s a hell of a lot closer to zero than it was .
. . .
I just do n’t see this election as being close enough [ for it ] to matter . ”

More than this campaign , the 1982 governor ’s contest was fraught with the issue of race .
It was less than a generation removed from the late - 1960s riots in America ’s cities , including Los Angeles , that sent fearful white voters scrambling for the suburbs .
Bradley , the reserved , patrician mayor , a former police officer and city councilman , was running against George Deukmejian , the state ’s Republican tough - on - crime attorney general and a former state legislator from Long Beach .
On the same ballot was a U.S. Senate race between Pete Wilson , then the GOP mayor of San Diego , and Jerry Brown , then the Democratic governor .
Also on the ballot -- and this would matter more -- was Proposition 15 , a measure that would have imposed statewide handgun registration and a freeze on new handgun sales .
The candidates for governor lined up on opposite sides -- Bradley supported it , Deukmejian opposed it .
Intent on brushing back gun controls , opponents of the measure mounted a massive voter registration drive to draw gun enthusiasts to the polls .
At the same time , Republicans took advantage of a change in state law that allowed any Californian to vote by absentee ballot .
In previous governor ’s races , only those with medical needs or travel plans could vote absentee .
The combination of more conservative gun-backing voters and more ways to get them to vote would help seal Bradley ’s fate .
In some rural , mostly white counties , turnout was up substantially , by 5 % to 10 % , recalled Bob Mulholland , a senior Democratic Party advisor .
Two - thirds more absentee ballots were cast than in the previous governor ’s race , and they were cast mostly by the older white voters who favored Deukmejian .
Advertisement
According to statistics collected at the time , Deukmejian beat Bradley among absentees by more than 113,000 votes .
Bradley won among votes cast on election day by almost 20,000 ballots , but that left a 93,000 - vote margin of victory for Deukmejian .
“ Clearly the Democrats and the Bradley campaign did not take vote - by - mail as seriously as the Republicans did , ” Mulholland said .
The gun vote was key , according to Los Angeles Times exit polls .
Those voting against the gun measure , roughly two - thirds of the voters , voted strongly for Deukmejian .
Those supporting gun control sided strongly with Bradley , but they accounted for only a third of the voters .
But that was not all the bad news for Bradley .
Black voters , expected to demonstrate overwhelming support , instead cast a below - average number of ballots .
That gave more electoral heft to whites , a Times exit poll showed .
Advertisement
Still , it was not the result , but the seeming surprise , that led to suggestions of a Bradley effect .
Times preelection polls showed Bradley ’s 14 - percentage - point lead in September had been cut in half by October , suggesting Deukmejian was gaining ground .
The Times did not survey after that point , about three weeks before the election .
Internal polls by Deukmejian ’s campaign showed that trajectory continuing until election day , when their polls showed the race tied .
But a Field Poll published three days before the election gave Bradley a 7 - percentage - point lead , and surveys of voters leaving the polls showed a strong Bradley edge .
Pollster Mervin Field publicly projected a Bradley victory as the polls closed .
Times exit polls showed a single - digit Bradley victory -- as well as an erroneous lead for Brown in the Senate race .
Some campaign staffers on both sides suggest that polling errors created the impression that voters lied to cover discomfort with Bradley ’s race .
“ It ’s a myth , ” said Steve Merksamer , Deukmejian ’s campaign director and , later , chief of staff .
But , he added , “ it ’s a lot more compelling media narrative to say that there was latent racism . ”
Advertisement
But the notion that voters had lied gained ground when similar slumps occurred in high - profile races by two other black candidates -- David N. Dinkins , running for New York mayor , and L. Douglas Wilder , running for governor of Virginia .
Dan Hopkins , a Harvard political scientist , studied every race involving a black candidate for governor or U.S. Senate from the Wilder year , 1989 , until 2006 .
He concluded that the Bradley effect cost African American candidates 2 or 3 percentage points until the mid-1990s .
Since then , “ we ’ve really found no evidence for a systematic Bradley effect , ” he said .
He pointed particularly to the U.S. Senate race in Tennessee in 2006 , where African American Democrat Harold Ford Jr. was defeated after a heated contest that ended with a racially inflected ad portraying him as a womanizer .
“ If you were going to see a Bradley effect , it would have been there , ” he said .
“ But there was no such effect . ”
Advertisement
Hopkins said the shift occurred at the same time that crime ebbed as a voter concern , and as the nation enacted welfare reform -- taking off the table two issues that had been used to press voter buttons about African American candidates .
Charles Henry , a UC Berkeley professor of African American studies , looked at the 1982 election and declared that race was “ the major factor ” in Bradley ’s loss .
Henry notes that more liberal Democrats running on the same statewide ballot won -- but they were white .
Henry said that the passage of time raised some questions :
Do people no longer lie to pollsters ?
And if the absence of issues like crime and welfare has helped African American candidates , will they be hurt if the issues reemerge ?
And then there is the impact of voters who , unlike the Bradley effect balloters , are openly reluctant to vote for an African American .
“ You can certainly predict that people will vote against Obama because he is black , ” Henry said .
“ I think there will be an anti-Bradley effect ; some will vote for Obama because he is black .
But there ’s no precedent in history for that overcoming the vote against him . ”
Advertisement
In Pennsylvania and Ohio , exit polls this spring showed 1 in 5 Democratic voters felt that the race of the candidate was important in deciding whom to back .
Those who thought race was important went overwhelmingly for Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Frank Gilliam , the dean of the UCLA School of Public Affairs who has studied voting patterns , said one of the frustrating things about the Bradley effect was the difficulty in figuring it out .
“ This is like proving a conspiracy theory :
You ca n’t because it ’s secret , ” said Gilliam , who thinks Obama could lose 2 percentage points to a hidden anti-black vote .
But he also believes that worry about the Bradley effect may overshadow a groundbreaking aspect of this presidential race .

“ There ’s going to be millions of white people who are going to vote for Obama , ” he said , “ and that ’s no small potatoes . ”

December 12th will mark one year to the day since I returned from my 3 month European walkabout .
A trip during which I explored Scotland , England , The Netherlands , Germany , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Austria , Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia Herzegovina , Italy , San Marino , The Vatican and Greece .
While it has been less than a year and I have no right to complain , my feet have been itching for the open road , my eyes dying for new sights and my palate hankering for new tastes and foods .
I still have some great content to share and post on the usual subjects before I leave , but please be advised that for the duration of the trip ( 12/16/08-1/1/09 )
I will be publishing travel journals instead of my typical blog content .
The Research
For the past month I ’ve been scouring the web for deals and information .
New Zealand ’s weather , current currency rate , and beauty put it high on the list .
As did the climate , exchange rate and tango dancing in Argentina .
I even considered Iceland despite the 5 hours of daylight and 35 degree highs … after all how can you beat an opportunity to visit a Scandinavian country whose currency has lost nearly half of its value in the last 5 months ?
A return trip to the Greek islands also received heavy consideration .
As did Costa Rica , Hawaii and Cancun .
So many amazing destinations … each with its own flavor , its own mystery and its own adventure .
One of the most exciting things about travel is how your comfort level changes the more you do it .
As I learn more about the world at large my curiosity and hunger to explore it continues to grow .
The end result is a fairly carefree approach to where I end up .
I know that no matter where I go or what part of the world I explore , I will grow as an individual while experiencing exciting new tastes , adventures and cultures .
The beauty of that approach is it allows me to be significantly more flexible when booking my trip .
To use my upcoming trip as an example ; despite researching possible destinations and airfare for more than a month and a half , it was n’t until 60 minutes before I booked my flight that I knew which country / continent I was going to be traveling to .
30 minutes after that I ’d narrowed the destination down to Barcelona and Madrid and shortly there after my ticket was booked .
There are few sensations like clicking “ submit ” and knowing that you just invested a sizable chunk of money in airfare and have committed to a new adventure .
In its own way it ’s every bit as exciting as a state of the art roller coaster ride and I find it often leaves me with similar butterflies in my stomach .
Unfortunately , the only time I ’m able to get off is between December 16th and the 4th of January .
As a result of the holiday travel , airfare skyrockets during this period – even on international flights .
As it turned out airfare to Argentina was over $ 500 more than a trip to Spain with airfare to New Zealand coming in at $ 800 - $ 1000 more .
Places like Hawaii , Cancun , and Puerto Rico were cheaper , but only by about $ 200 .
By flying out on the 16th ( my earliest possible date ) and being willing to fly home on New Year ’s Day , I was able to find airfare more than $ 200 + dollars cheaper than if I tried to fly back on the 2nd - 4th .
The Resources
I do most of my booking research through Lessno.com and Kayak.com both of which do an excellent job searching multiple carriers and returning quality results .
While both offer a flexible date search the matrix which Lessno generates is the best I ’ve seen on a travel booking site and allows for a much wider date range than Kayak .
On the flip side , with registration , Kayak ’s daily fare monitoring e-mails can be really useful .
I did my actual booking , however , through FlyCheapAbroad.com which is the same service I booked through last year .
The website looked unprofessional and left me a bit nervous , but every time I ’ve used them so far , they have delivered quality service and an unbeatable price .
The flight I ended up booking through them was the exact same flight that came up on Kayak but for more than $ 40 less .
Hopefully they wo n’t disappoint .
For those considering a flight to Hawaii or New Zealand , I discovered that Hawaiian Airlines and Air New Zealand / Qantas all run fantastic specials 1/2 - 2/3 of the lowest prices on Kayak and other search sites .
If you ’re booking far enough in advance , it always pays to double check with the carrier and see what they ’re offering .
With all of the global economic issues the dollar has been skyrocketing and while this may not be incredible for the US economy , it ’s every travelers dream .
The US dollar has gained over 20 % against several major currencies over the last 6 months , and shows no signs of slowing down .
It ’s a great time to travel if you ’ve been lucky enough to avoid the flood of pink slips going out .
The Destination
As mentioned above , I ended up selecting Spain as my destination .
My travel style is backpack / hostel based and takes a very play - it - by - ear approach .
I ’ve booked my ticket so I know my starting and ending destination , but that ’s about the extent of it .
I ’ll be booking a hostel ahead of time in Spain for my first 2 nights and another over Christmas as a precautionary step , but beyond that my trip will be fluid .
While I may end up making it over to Portugal , it ’s more likely that I ’ll be focusing on southern Spain .
16 days should be just about the right amount of time to give southern Spain a somewhat thorough going over .
Similar to the first 2 months of my trip last year I ’ll be traveling on my own and I ’ll use Hostelworld.com , Couchsurfing.com and Hostelbookers to find and book my accommodations .
I ’m eager to re-visit Spain and see it through an adult ’s eyes and perception ( I spent time there when I was 11 back in ’ 95 ) .
I ’m also thrilled to have an opportunity to explore a piece of Europe I skipped over during my last trip .
I ’d love to make it over into southern France but highly doubt I ’ll even make it as far as Barcelona .
One exciting addition to the trip that I did not have with me last year is an ultra portable Flip Camera .
If all goes according to plan I should have the usual travel photos as well as exciting new video to share with you all .
Have tips , suggestions or ideas on where to go / see and stay ?
Please share them in the comments section below !
It ’s time to do a bit of wayfaring !
Announcing Haskell protocol - buffers version 1.2.2
Hi everyone ,
To keep up with protocol - buffers 2.0.3 here is an improved Haskell " hprotoc " version 1.2.2 : http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/protocol-buffers
http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/protocol-buffers-descriptor
http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hprotoc
The darcs repository with all 3 packages is at http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/protocol-buffers2/
These ought to be compatible with the previous version 1.2.1 .
As usual , this code read a " .proto " file which describes message formats and generates Haskell modes to encode and decode corresponding data type to the binary wire format .
Google 's original protocol buffers are at http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/overview.html and generate code for C++ , Python , and Java .
Other languages are listed on the wiki at http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/wiki/OtherLanguages ( including Haskell ) .
The two changes are support for the field - option - like syntax for EnumValueOptions , and adjacent string literals are concatenated .
Note that strings are checked for valid utf8 encoding after concatenation , not individually .
But backslash escape codes are decoded for each individual string , not after concatenation .
If these quirks become problems they can be changed .
The protoc bug fixed in 2.0.3 : > * Fixed bug where .
proto files which use custom options but do n't actually > define them ( i.e. they import another . proto file defining the options ) > had to explicitly import descriptor .
proto . " did not affect hprotoc , which already did the Right Thing™ ( I just tested to be sure ) .
The protoc bug fixed in 2.0.3 : > *
If an input file is a Windows absolute path ( e.g. " C:\foo\bar.proto " ) and > the import path only contains " . " ( or contains " . " but does not contain > the file ) , protoc incorrectly thought that the file was under " . " , because > it thought that the path was relative ( since it did n't start with a slash ) .
>
This has been fixed .
is unlikely to be be present in hprotoc .
But since I never run or test on Windows I make no promises hprotoc is finding the correct relative paths on Windows .

Within the next several months , several of the world ’s biggest lighting companies , including Osram Sylvania and Philips , will introduce LED replacement bulbs to various world markets , including the United States .
While the bulbs will be praised for their energy - saving characteristics and long lives , most consumers will immediately think , “ These things look weird . ”
And they do .
Really weird .
Here ’s an example of one LED substitute for a standard reflector bulb used in many home ceilings .
Those funny fins are a “ heat sink . ”
Because LED light sources generate all their heat through the rear , manufacturers are adding heat sinks to dramatically increase the surface area and let the heat dissipate rapidly .
Without them , the LED fixture would lose its color accuracy and have a dramatically shortened life .
That ’s especially important for these reflector bulb substitutes .
The “ cans ” in which recessed reflector bulbs typically sit in today ’s ceilings were designed for standard incandescent light bulbs , which direct most of their heat forward .
How they will fare with prolonged use of the new generation of bulbs that send heat back up into the ceiling is anyone ’s guess .
Aesthetically , the bulbs ’ odd shape will not be a problem if they are mostly hidden from view , either in the ceiling or under a lampshade .
But what happens with other bulbs that are out in the open , like track lighting ?
A company in Westlake Village , Calif. , is embracing the design drawbacks and turning them into a feature .
Journée Lighting has just started selling track lighting that emphasizes the heat sink .
Journée is marketing seven different colors of its LED - based Lotus Luminaires , from golden yellow to Bordeaux red .
The fixtures look a bit like knockoffs of Ming the Merciless ’s spaceship in the 1930s Flash Gordon serials .
While you might find them a bit over the top , they ’ve already been installed in the Chicago Center for Green Technology and Universal Studios .
Designed for the commercial market , the Luminaires are a bit pricey : each fixture costs around $ 400 .
But prices for LED technology are coming down dramatically .
In February , the company will sell its newest generation , the Pentas , that ups the light output more than 60 percent per watt .
And home versions are coming .
The company has been approached by Costco to design a track lighting kit .
The company ’s goal is to use less expensive manufacturing techniques and sell three fixtures and the track for around $ 200 .
LA Times :
The cutbacks come after Focus , formerly headquartered in California until 1991 , spent a reported half - million dollars to successfully support Proposition 8 in the Golden State , overturning a state court decision to allow same - sex marriages …
It ’s the second time in recent months the influential group that does so much mailing it has its own ZIP code has released workers from its mountainside headquarters in Colorado Springs .
The latest cuts leave the national organization with about 950 employees from a onetime high of some 1,500 .
Published reports in Colorado say that Focus on the Family , the conservative evangelical group founded and headed by Dr. James Dobson , is laying off about 200 of its employees .
More from Pensito Review ( Jon Ponder ) :
Elsa Prince , Mother of Blackwater Founder , Was Fourth Largest Prop 8 Donor
Michigan billionaire Elsa Prince ’s second greatest claim to fame is that she was a founder in 1977 of Focus of the Family , a nonprofit group that , despite its warm and fuzzy name , is in tenor and in practice an anti-gay hate group .
Prince ’s top claim to fame , however , is that she is the mother of Erik Prince , the founder of Blackwater Worldwide , the scandal - plagued BushCo mercenary group that , since 2004 , has been paid at least $ 323 million on a $ 1 billion no - bid government contract .
Blackwater is in the headlines now because six of its mercenaries may be facing charges for the massacre of 17 Iraqi civilians in September 2007 .
Earlier scandals have included the abrupt resignation of State Dept .
Inspector Howard Krongard over Blackwater - related perjury charges , allegations that Blackwater employees were traitorously recruiting U.S. troops in the war zone and that and Blackwater security shot a dog belonging to the New York Times Baghdad bureau .
In August , Elsa Prince made two donations that totaled $ 450,000 to Proposition 8 , the California initiative that narrowly passed on Nov. 4 , and will amend the state constitution to revoke the right of gay people to marry , if it is not overturned by the California Supreme Court .
Around the same time , Focus on the Family reportedly donated over $ 439,000 to the anti-gay cause .
In October , just months after Prince and Focus on the Family donated a combined $ 889,000 to the California hate initiative , Focus on the Family announced it would lay off or reassign 46 of 1,300 employees .
Now it says there will be more layoffs due to restructuring of its distribution arm .
It ’s a dead cinch the families of the dozens of employees who are about to be fired would have preferred that the nearly $ 900,000 donated to Prop 8 by Prince and their bosses had gone toward salaries .

Doctor wins protection from family who kidnapped her and forced her to marry
The doctor kidnapped by her family and forced into an arranged marriage was today given legal protection from them .
After hearing the full , terrifying details of Dr Humayra Abedin 's ordeal , Mr Justice Coleridge granted a series of injunctions to protect her from her own parents .
The trainee GP returned to Britain on Tuesday after spending four months held captive by her parents in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka .
Dr Humayra Abedin : Injunctions were issued against her family which ban them from ' pestering or threatening ' her or trying to remove her from Britain
Dr Abedin , a Muslim , had moved from Bangladesh to Britain in 2002 .
She set up home in the East End and started going out with a 44 - year - old Hindu man .
It was this romance with a non-Muslim man that prompted her parents to act .
In August this year , having been told her mother was gravely ill , Dr Abedin travelled back to her home country - but it became clear she had been lured back under false pretences .
Dr Abedin was in court today as her barrister Hassan Khan described how she was locked in a room in her parents ' home and had her passport confiscated .
Four or five guards stopped her from leaving .
Forced to take sleeping tablets , Dr Abedin was kept captive at home for a month before being taken by force to a private psychiatric hospital .
Mr Khan said : ' Dr Abedin 's hands were tied behind her back and her head was covered with a cloth .
She was screaming for assistance and shouting loudly .
' She was then physically manhandled into an ambulance and was gagged by a person placing their hands over her mouth to the extent that she believed she would suffocate because she could not breathe . '
At the clinic where she was held for three months she was told she was ' mentally unstable ' and was injected with anti-psychotic drugs .
On November 14 Dr Abedin was taken out of the hospital and forced to marry Dr Khondokar Mohammad Abdul Jalal .
Dr Abedin was only able to escape after she got a message to friends in England who alerted a women 's charity in Bangladesh .
Mr Justice Coleridge issued injunctions against Dr Abedin 's husband , her father Mohammad Joynal Abedin , her mother Begum Sofia Kamal and a paternal uncle which ban them from ' pestering or threatening ' her or trying to remove her from Britain .
The judge described forced marriage as ' a complete aberration of the whole concept of marriage in a civilised society ' .
Dr Abedin is expected to apply for her forced marriage to be officially annulled .
Speaking outside court , she said does not want her parents to be prosecuted as she still loves them .

When all the berries are added , cover the vessel , remove from the fire , put into a warm place and let stand , closely covered , for 3 hours , or until the mass has cooled down to the surrounding temperature , then strain off through flannel , being careful not to crush the berries .
Prepare a sufficient number of pint bottles by filling them with warm water , putting them into a kettle of the same and heating them to boiling , then rapidly emptying and draining as quickly as possible .
Into these pour the hot juice , cork and seal the bottles as rapidly as possible .
Juice thus prepared retains all the aroma and flavor of the fresh berry , and if carefully corked and sealed up will retain its properties a year .
Strawberry Essence
Strawberries , fresh .. 16 ounces Angelica ( California ) 6 fluidounces Brandy ( California ) .
6 ounces
Alcohol ............ 8 ounces
Water , quantity sufficient .
Mash the berries to a pulp in a mortar or bowl , and transfer to a flask , along with the Angelica , brandy , alcohol , and about 8 ounces of water .
Let macerate overnight , then distil off until 32 ounces have passed over .
Color strawberry red .
The addition of a little essence of vanilla and a hint of lemon improves this essence .
Next up may be Sarah Palin , who is said to be worth nearly $ 7 million if she can place her thoughts between covers .
Publishers : with all the grim news of layoffs and staff cuts at the venerable houses of American letters , can we set some ground rules for these hard times ?
Anyone who abuses the English language on such a regular basis should not be paid to put words in print .
Here ’s Palin ’s response , after Matt Lauer asked her when she knew the election was lost :
“ I had great faith that , you know , perhaps when that voter entered that voting booth and closed that curtain that what would kick in for them was , perhaps , a bold step that would have to be taken in casting a vote for us , but having to put a lot of faith in that commitment we tried to articulate that we were the true change agent that would progress this nation . ”
I have no idea what she said in that thicket of words .
Most of the writers I know work every day , in obscurity and close to poverty , trying to say one thing well and true .
Day in , day out , they labor to find their voice , to learn their trade , to understand nuance and pace .
And then , facing a sea of rejections , they hear about something like Barbara Bush ’s dog getting a book deal .
Writing is hard , even for the best wordsmiths .
Ernest Hemingway said the most frightening thing he ever encountered was “ a blank sheet of paper . ”
And Winston Churchill called the act of writing a book “ a horrible , exhaustive struggle , like a long bout of painful illness . ”
When I heard J.T.P. had a book , I thought of that Chris Farley skit from “ Saturday Night Live . ”
He ’s a motivational counselor , trying to keep some slacker youths from living in a van down by the river , just like him .
One kid tells him he wants to write .
An Ecuadorean immigrant who was brutally beaten with a bottle and baseball bat last week by men said to be shouting anti-gay and anti-Hispanic slurs has died , a family spokesman said on Saturday night .

Mr. Sucuzhanay ’s family had kept him on life support in anticipation of his mother ’s arrival , but on Friday , his heart stopped .

Senator Barack Obama greets Representative Rahm Emanuel at the Illinois Delegation party at a restaurant in Boston on the eve of the Democratic National Convention 2004 .
( Tom Williams )
Emanuel is Obama ’s first high - level appointment and it ’s one likely to disappoint those who hoped the president - elect would break with the George W. Bush Administration ’s pro-Israel policies .
White House Chief of Staff is often considered the most powerful office in the executive branch , next to the president .
Obama has offered Emanuel the position according to Democratic party sources cited by media including Reuters and The New York Times .
While Emanuel is expected to accept the post , that had not been confirmed by Wednesday evening the day after the election .
Rahm Emanuel was born in Chicago , Illinois in 1959 , the son of Benjamin Emanuel , a pediatrician who helped smuggle weapons to the Irgun , the Zionist militia of former Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin , in the 1940s .
The Irgun carried out numerous terrorist attacks on Palestinian civilians including the bombing of Jerusalem ’s King David Hotel in 1946 .
Emanuel continued his father ’s tradition of active support for Israel ; during the 1991 Gulf War he volunteered to help maintain Israeli army vehicles near the Lebanon border when southern Lebanon was still occupied by Israeli forces .
As White House political director in the first Clinton administration , Emanuel orchestrated the famous 1993 signing ceremony of the “ Declaration of Principles ” between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin .
Emanuel was elected to Congress representing a north Chicago district in 2002 and he is credited with a key role in delivering a Democratic majority in the 2006 mid-term elections .
He has been a prominent supporter of neoliberal economic policies on free trade and welfare reform .
One of the most influential politicians and fundraisers in his party , Emanuel accompanied Obama to a meeting of AIPAC ’s executive board just after the Illinois senator had addressed the pro-Israel lobby ’s conference last June .
In Congress , Emanuel has been a consistent and vocal pro-Israel hardliner , sometimes more so than President Bush .
In June 2003 , for example , he signed a letter criticizing Bush for being insufficiently supportive of Israel .
“ We were deeply dismayed to hear your criticism of Israel for fighting acts of terror , ” Emanuel , along with 33 other Democrats wrote to Bush .
The letter said that Israel ’s policy of assassinating Palestinian political leaders “ was clearly justified as an application of Israel ’s right to self - defense ” ( “ Pelosi supports Israel ’s attacks on Hamas group , ” San Francisco Chronicle , 14 June 2003 ) .
In July 2006 , Emanuel was one of several members who called for the cancellation of a speech to Congress by visiting Iraqi prime minister Nouri al - Maliki because al - Maliki had criticized Israel ’s bombing of Lebanon .
Emanuel called the Lebanese and Palestinian governments “ totalitarian entities with militias and terrorists acting as democracies ” in a 19 July 2006 speech supporting a House resolution backing Israel ’s bombing of both countries that caused thousands of civilian victims .
Emanuel has sometimes posed as a defender of Palestinian lives , though never from the constant Israeli violence that is responsible for the vast majority of deaths and injuries .
On 14 June 2007 he wrote to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice “ on behalf of students in the Gaza Strip whose future is threatened by the ongoing fighting there ” which he blamed on “ the violence and militancy of their elders . ”
In fact , the fighting between members of Hamas and Fatah , which claimed dozens of lives , was the result of a failed scheme by US - backed militias to violently overthrow the elected Hamas - led national unity government .
Emanuel ’s letter urged Rice “ to work with allies in the region , such as Egypt and Jordan , to either find a secure location in Gaza for these students , or to transport them to a neighboring country where they can study and take their exams in peace . ”
Palestinians often view such proposals as a pretext to permanently “ transfer ” them from their country , as many Israeli leaders have threatened .
Emanuel has never said anything in support of millions of Palestinian children whose education has been disrupted by Israeli occupation , closures and blockades .
Emanuel has also used his position to explicitly push Israel ’s interests in normalizing relations with Arab states and isolating Hamas .
In 2006 he initiated a letter to President Bush opposing United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) - based Dubai Ports World ’s attempt to buy the management business of six US seaports .
The letter , signed by dozens of other lawmakers , stated that “ The UAE has pledged to provide financial support to the Hamas - led government of the Palestinian Authority and openly participates in the Arab League boycott against Israel . ”
It argued that allowing the deal to go through “ not only could place the safety and security of US ports at risk , but enhance the ability of the UAE to bolster the Hamas regime and its efforts to promote terrorism and violence against Israel ” ( “ Dems Tie Israel , Ports , ” Forward , 10 March 2006 ) .
Ira Forman , executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council , told Fox News that picking Emanuel is “ just another indication that despite the attempts to imply that Obama would somehow appoint the wrong person or listen to the wrong people when it comes to the US - Israel relationship … that was never true . ”
Over the course of the campaign , Obama publicly distanced himself from friends and advisers suspected or accused of having “ pro-Palestinian ” sympathies .
There are no early indications of a more balanced course .

A UK based Christian charity today has launched a new version of the Christmas nativity scene with a difference .
The traditional nativity set has been updated by the Amos Trust with a modern day touch by including the Israeli Separation wall .
This traditional olive wood nativity scene , made by local craftsmen in Bethlehem , now includes the Israeli Separation wall , which surrounds the little town .
Today the wise men would not be able to make it into Bethlehem , the Amos Trust points out , as they would be turned away at the security gate and refused an entry permit .
The £ 50 deluxe edition comes with a removable Separation wall - in case there 's progress in the Middle East peace talks
Part of the trust 's work is with partner projects in Gaza , on the West Bank in Bethlehem , and in Israel where it works closely with Jewish , Muslim and Christian peacemakers .
Canon Garth Hewitt , director of Amos Trust and guild vicar of All Hallows on the Wall , London said : " Most people do n't realise how cut off Bethlehem is now and how difficult life is for the people living there .
We are selling these nativity scenes in the hope that people will give a thought to those living in the little town this Christmas . "
The olive wood craftsmen previously sold their work to tourists , but with the massive fall in visitors and current political climate , they have been forced to diversify and to rely on exporting their work overseas to make a living .
The Christmas nativity scene is available in two sizes from Amos Trust , info@amostrust.org

Gyms use it , broadband providers use it , DVD rental schemes use it , subways use it …
Now it ’s time for taxis to adopt a flat - rate charge .
Swiss start - up Taxmobil is planning to offer unlimited taxi use for a EUR 48 monthly fee .
Customers will be able to buy a Taxmobil card online or from sales points around the city , and can call for a car to pick them up at whatever time they choose , travelling to any destination in the city .
If two strangers are travelling in the same direction , Taxmobil may combine their journeys .
The key to Taxmobil ’s strategy is the fact that it does n’t own the cars it uses .
Instead , it buys the time of idle taxis that are already out and about , creating a service that ’s affordable and convenient for customers , and could decrease congestion and parking problems if city dwellers trade in their cars for a Taxmobil card .
Böblingen in Southern Germany is likely to be the first town offering the service , starting early 2009 , with other towns across Europe to follow .
Travel is only permitted within a city , although members will be able to catch a taxi in other participating cities , too .
As well as expanding the service ’s reach , Taxmobil will soon be extending its package options by complementing its standard EUR 48 subscription with cards for businesses and families .
Discounts and member benefits will be made possible with the cards in future , too .
While public transport and bicycles are usually pitched as the green alternative to car ownership , there ’s something to be said for adding affordable taxis to the mix , offering people the option of individual door - to - door transport around the clock .
How the system will work on rainy days , and whether EUR 48 / month will leave any room for a profit , remains to be seen .
One to watch !

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan on Tuesday launched a voluntary carbon market based on companies ’ pledged emissions cuts and hopes thousands of firms will sign up to what could become a forerunner of a mandatory cap - and - trade scheme .

The scheme , once it ’s up and running by next year , is expected to be the nation ’s broadest emissions market .
But some said the scheme still fell short of what Japan needed to make deep emissions cuts and could backfire .
The trial over - the - counter market is aimed at accelerating further cuts in the private sector via new technologies to save energy and reduce or remove emissions from the atmosphere , Environment Minister Tetsuo Saito told reporters .
“ It ’s based on a voluntary ( cap ) because we ’d like to see as many companies as possible joining in as we start .
But we ’re aiming to make it a cap - and - trade scheme eventually , ” he said .
“ We ’re hoping to accept applications from thousands or even tens of thousands of companies , ranging from big companies to medium to small ones as well as mainstay companies in each region , ” he added .
Japan , the world ’s fifth - largest greenhouse gas emitter , has been reluctant to impose a mandatory cap on companies ’ emissions because of past efforts by industry to clean up and become more efficient .
Japan is one of the world ’s most energy - efficient countries .
But like all rich nations , it has come under increasing pressure from developing nations to pledge deeper cuts to its emissions as part of a broader U.N. - led fight against climate change .
ABOVE ITS TARGET
Japan is obliged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent in 2008 - 2012 from the 1990 levels under the U.N. ’s Kyoto Protocol climate pact .
But as of 2006 , Japan ’s emissions were 6 percent above 1990 levels .
In the trial market , a target can limit either the total volume of CO2 a company emits or the amount of CO2 per unit of production .
The latter would allow emissions to rise along with economic growth as long as energy efficiency improves , one factor overshadowing the efficiency of the scheme .
Another risk is that caps based on an industrial sector could restrain individual companies ’ efforts to take advantage of carbon pricing .
“ To make a trial meaningful one , it should be able to help a company to make its own tactics and decide its own strategy for business management , ” said Tadashi Otsuka , professor of law at Waseda University , a member of a government climate panel .
A present , each industrial sector under the powerful industry body Keidanren voluntarily sets a target to meet over the five years until 2012 .
But electric power and steel companies , Japan ’s two top emitters , have resisted mandatory targets as well as emissions trading akin to that already in place in the European Union .
“ It ’s a step forward , albeit a minor one , ” said Naoyuki Yamagishi , head of climate change program at WWF Japan , said of the trial scheme .
But he said it fails to address two key issues if the government were to try to implement deeper cuts --- how to set absolute volume caps on different industrial sectors and how to allocate them to each company .
“ There is risk that insufficient results from an insufficient trial market would make people consider any scheme is useless , ” Yamagishi said .
OPEN FOR APPLICATIONS
The government starts accepting applications on Tuesday for the trial scheme and the closing date is December 12 , 2008 for companies to set a voluntary emission cut target for the year to March 2009 .
No pricing details have been announced .
Actual trading is to start at any time after the government approves applicants ’ targets .
More participants are likely to join late next year because authorities are due to verify companies ’ emissions in the first Kyoto year by mid-October .
Japan is only one of 37 industrialized nations bound under Kyoto to meet emissions curbs from 2008 to 2012 , when the pact ’s first phase ends .
The Japanese government and big corporates have been active in buying U.N. carbon offsets called CERs to try to help the nation meet its Kyoto target .
The government has also been buying large amounts of a cheaper Kyoto offset called AAUs from former Soviet bloc countries .
But many of these emissions are less directly linked to verifiable emissions reductions projects in Eastern Europe and are therefore less credible .
Japan ’s existing , and much smaller voluntary scheme , called J-VETS , offers small companies subsidies to become more energy efficient .
But the scheme is ending a piloting role because the government is cutting subsidies it pays only once for a company .

Franklin Roosevelt biographer Conrad Black has a new article championing the 32nd president , and defending the man ’s legacy against a number of critiques that have emerged since his time in office .
This article comes at a time when many are demanding “ another New Deal ” and a resurgence in Rooseveltian governance in general .
An interesting facet here is that while most of these paeans to FDR have come from the progressive and center left , a few years back , it was the right calling for the current president to be more FDR - like , in matters of war in particular .
Conservative talk show hosts could be heard nostalgically celebrating the U.S. strategic bombings of World War II , complaining that President Bush was unwilling to drop even more explosives upon the Iraqi people .
It was also a conservative who penned a book defending one of FDR ’s most conspicuous programs , one not revered so much on the left these days , Japanese Internment .
But now the myth is that the conservatives and Republicans in this country have cast away the New Deal government created by Roosevelt , and cashed it in for “ laissez - faire . ”
The federal government in America is huge , the largest in absolute terms in world history , probably , especially given its reach over the world and wealth consumed at home .
Yet Bush ’s $ 3 trillion state is allegedly a mark of “ anti- government bias ” on the right .
Almost all the prominent and powerful Republicans have been New Dealers .
Ronald Reagan , the supposed paragon of modern conservatism , was a New Dealer and never did anything to undo FDR ’s legacy .
Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole both paid tribute to this great leader , who , as the story goes , did so much to pull Americans out of the Great Depression .
That the Depression , in terms of lowered standards of living , poor quality and availability of consumer goods for the masses , did not truly end until after FDR died never seems to complicate the standard narrative .
For a Depression to last so long , unlike the unknown Panic of 1819 or sharp recession of 1920 - 21 , should be a signal that perhaps FDR ’s programs were not all that successful .
Every other American recession was a flash in the pan by comparison .
Interestingly , Black blames Herbert Hoover for his “ higher taxes and tariffs , ” thus rejecting the common myth that Hoover was a laissez - faire president who did nothing in response to the Depression .
But he credits FDR ’s many policies for bringing about recovery .
One thing that seems to have made Black believe FDR needs defending : “ It has been alleged by some supply - side economic purists that he actually prolonged the Depression in the United States . ”
Perhaps he is referring to the UCLA economists who have recently concluded that FDR ’s policies “ prolonged the Depression by seven years ” :
After scrutinizing Roosevelt ’s record for four years , Harold L. Cole and Lee E. Ohanian conclude in a new study that New Deal policies signed into law 71 years ago thwarted economic recovery for seven long years . ”
Why the Great Depression lasted so long has always been a great mystery , and because we never really knew the reason , we have always worried whether we would have another 10 - to 15 - year economic slump , ” said Ohanian , vice chair of UCLA ’s Department of Economics .
“ We found that a relapse is n’t likely unless lawmakers gum up a recovery with ill - conceived stimulus policies . ”
The economists conclude that recovery would have come sooner , if not for the New Deal , particularly the National Recovery Administration , which forced businesses to cartelize , and pro-labor legislation .
Yet this basic theory is not entirely new , nor one adopted merely by “ supply - side purists . ”
More than sixty years ago , progressive liberal muckraker John Flynn took FDR to task in his journalistic treatment The Roosevelt Myth .
This included a wonderful attack on the clumsy and counterproductive National Recovery Administration , modeled largely after Mussolini ’s policies in Italy :
[ Mussolini ] organized each trade or industrial group or professional group into a state - supervised trade association .
He called it a corporative .
These corporatives operated under state supervision and could plan production , quality , prices , distribution , labor standards , etc .
The NRA provided that in America each industry should be organized into a federally supervised trade association .
It was not called a corporative .
It was called a Code Authority .
But it was essentially the same thing .
These code authorities could regulate production , quantities , qualities , prices , distribution methods , etc. , under the supervision of the NRA .
This was fascism .
The anti-trust laws forbade such organizations .
Roosevelt had denounced Hoover for not enforcing these laws sufficiently .
Now he suspended them and compelled men to combine .
Before this monstrosity was finally ruled unconstitutional in Schechter v. U.S. , it was a plague of corporatism that imprisoned people for charging too little ( landing tailors in jail for pressing pants too cheaply ) and smashed economic liberty in a hundred other ways .
Clarence Darrow was called upon to investigate the program in an independent commission and called it “ harmful , monopolistic , oppressive , grotesque , invasive , fictitious , ghastly , anomalous , preposterous , irresponsible , savage , wolfish . ”
Another major feature of FDR ’s New Deal was the Agricultural Adjustment Act , which sought to keep agricultural prices up through the mass destruction of crops and livestock .
It worked in keeping prices up , but at a time when Americans were starving , this was perhaps not the most sensible or humane approach .
Thankfully , it too was ruled unconstitutional .
After that FDR responded with his infamous “ Court - packing scheme ” and the Supremes became obedient .
Robert Higgs , also not a supply - sider so far as I know , has demonstrated other ways , in much greater detail , that FDR in fact prolonged the Depression .
First , it bears mentioning that Higgs pointed out years ago that FDR ’s ideas were not even that original , but were largely reincarnations of Woodrow Wilson ’s wartime economic policies , except at peace .
But where FDR lacked in originality , he compensated for in destructiveness .
For one thing , Roosevelt ’s constant assaults on the free market , without any sort of consistency or predictability about them , led to what Higgs calls “ regime uncertainty , ” a situation in which investors felt very uneasy about investing in projects , making recovery that much slower .
Ultimately , FDR ’s defenders rely on two statistics more than any other argument , and Black is no exception : “ Unemployment declined from about 33 per cent when Roosevelt entered office to half of 1 per cent when he died in office 12 years later ( and had been at that point for 41/ 2 years , since several months before Pearl Harbor ) .
The average per capita income doubled under Roosevelt . . . . ”
As for unemployment , if the decline began before the war , it might have something to do with “ the first peacetime draft in the midst of the 1940 election campaign ” that Black proudly lumps together with FDR ’s “ Fourth New Deal . ”
Higgs has shown how important conscription was to the reduction in unemployment .
Being killed in the trenches is not actually good for the soldier ’s economy , as I once heard someone remark .
As for per capita income , or national income for that matter , this is also quite deceptive .
I have heard many scholars concede the New Deal did not bring America out of the Depression ; World War II did .
But again , as Higgs has argued persuasively , the rise in national income in nominal dollars did not correspond to better economic conditions for the average American .
With the government spending so much – about 40 % of the economy — on the war effort , a staggering amount of American labor and production was being devoted to destruction — bombs , bullets , uniforms , warplanes , the Manhattan Project , and the like .
Meanwhile , during the war , new automobiles and appliances were not available ; sugar and butter were rationed and scarce ; good clothing was hard to obtain .
People worked harder for less .
And if GDP really told the whole picture , then how to account for the fact that 1946 saw “ the largest single - year drop of income in American history ” ?
No one talks about the Depression or crash of 1946 .
Americans became more prosperous that year :
The USA had less money in nominal dollars , but it diverted much less wealth to unproductive uses .
Two more quibbles about the Black article : First , yes , some might exaggerate the extent to which “ Roosevelt had been swindled by Stalin at Yalta into handing over Eastern Europe to the USSR . ”
Given the way things were going , much of that would have happened anyway .
But FDR does indeed come off as naive about Stalin in many conventional accounts .
He should have been familiar with Stalin ’s ruthlessness throughout the 1930s , when he murdered millions , as well as in the war ( the USSR aggression against Poland was no more excusable than Hitler ’s ) .
Yet he believed that Stalin did n’t “ want anything but security for his country . ”
Roosevelt thought if he gave “ him everything I possibly can and ask for nothing in return , noblesse oblige , he wo n’t try to annex anything and will work with me for a world of democracy and peace . ”
His adoration of “ Uncle Joe , ” as he called the Soviet dictator , did not subside even as Stalin annexed , along with half of Poland , Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia .
And although Yalta was far from the only factor in Stalin ’s conquest of Eastern Europe , it was there that FDR secretly agreed to Operation Keelhaul , an unspeakably murderous repatriation program whereby hundreds of thousands , perhaps millions of refugees from the USSR were rounded up , forced back to Stalin , and enslaved and killed .
My second quibble :
It is true that FDR , unlike the Republicans before him , was anti-prohibition .
Indeed , he was nearly a libertarian compared to Hoover across the board .
( In 1932 , he championed lower taxes , lower spending , liquidation , sound money , lower tariffs , a smaller bureaucracy , less war and freer markets .
The Democratic platform of that year was also much more laissez - faire than that of the GOP , blasting the latter for its big - government policies .
Ayn Rand and other small - government advocates voted for FDR for that reason . )
But it is perhaps an exaggeration to say that FDR “ repealed Prohibition of alcoholic beverages ( wrenching one of America ’s largest industries out of the hands of the underworld ) . ”
He did modify the Volstead Act , allowing beer with 3.2 % alcohol .
But federal prohibition did n’t really end until the 21st Amendment was passed by the state legislatures , the culmination of years of activism .
It would have likely happened without him .
And , for what it ’s worth to the civil libertarians on the left , four years later he signed into law the effective federal prohibition of marijuana , ushering in the federal drug war .
It is funny that FDR is so universally beloved on left and right .
He imposed counterproductive economic fascism , destroyed food while people starved , imposed gun control and drug control at the federal level , created Fannie Mae ( which has continued to cause economic troubles ) , had plans to round up rightwing and leftwing activists without due process , drafted ( enslaved ) ten million Americans into the military , waged total war on civilians , brought nuclear weaponry into the world , stuck tens of thousands of U.S. citizens into concentration camps , set up a censorship office , palled around with Stalin , turned away exiled Jews back to the Nazis , was deceitful in foreign affairs , and did not actually bring America out of the Depression , in terms of economic well - being for the American people .
We do n’t need another one of him .
His despotic spirit is seen plenty enough in the leaders of both political parties now .

The billionaire Saudi prince , who invested in Citicorp in 1991 when it was in financial straits , said he would raise his stake from 4 per cent to 5 per cent .
At Citi ’s current market value of just over $ 25bn , the new investment would cost about $ 350m .
The 26.4 per cent fall in the shares , which closed at $ 4.71 in New York , prompted Citi ’s directors and executives to look at strategic options , includes selling part or whole of the company .
A $ 350 m vote of confidence from Saudi prince Al - Waleed Bin Talal could not halt the rapid decline in the fortunes of Citigroup yesterday , with fears mounting that what was once the world ’s biggest bank will lack adequate capital to withstand the billions of dollars of losses expected in the months to come .
The £ 236 m investment came before the market opened yesterday , and reversed the nose - dive in the ailing bank ’s share price for only 20 minutes before the sellers returned .
It had been hoped that the boost in sentiment from Al - Waleed ’s vote of confidence would end a two - year selloff that has wiped more than $ 200 bn from Citigroup ’s market value .
But as quickly as the share price had improved , it declined again .
At one point it plunged by more than 25 % to less than $ 4 , its lowest since 1994 .
By the close on Wall Street it was off by more than 26 % at $ 4.71 , giving the bank a puny market value of $ 25bn .
In January 2007 , Citigroup shares were worth more than $ 54 each and the company was valued at more than $ 250bn .

The unprecedented share drop is the bank ’s eighth decline in the past nine trading days , and could spell further trouble for Citigroup .
Most big institutional investors are barred from owning stocks worth less than $ 5 a share ; they do not have to sell out immediately , but must start selling at the end of the quarter if there is no sign of improvement .
The bank is lobbying hard in Washington for further curbs on short - selling , as it blames the practice for its rapid share price decline .
Short - selling is a practice that involves betting on share prices going down rather than up .
The bank has become a lightning conductor for bad news in the financial sector , but a growing number of analysts are worried that its declining market value will leave it vulnerable to future loan losses .
Al - Waleed increased his stake in Citigroup from about 4 % to 5 % .
He tried valiantly to convince the market the bank was in better shape than the share price implied – in a statement released at 9 am in New York , he described Citigroup ’s shares “ dramatically undervalued ” and expressed “ full and complete support to its management ” , including the embattled chief executive , Vikram Pandit .
The Saudi has long been the biggest investor in Citigroup and has a close relationship with Sandy Weill , the bank ’s founder and former chief executive .
His stake in the bank was reduced in 2007 and again earlier this year as the bank raised more than $ 50bn in new capital from sovereign wealth funds and other investors .
Some analysts note that Al - Waleed ’s opinion no longer carries as much weight as it once did .
In 1991 he became one of the world ’s five richest people and was described as the Warren Buffett of the Middle East by Time magazine .
This year Al - Waleed ’s Riyadh - based Kingdom Holding Company has slumped 63 % in value , wiping out $ 13bn .
On Monday , Pandit announced 52,000 lay - offs in the biggest round of banking job cuts in Wall Street history .
Far from reversing the decline , the announcement seemed to force the stock lower still .
Citigroup ’s decline has been so steep this week that many in the market have begun to speculate it will need a further cash injection from the US government on top of the $ 25 bn it received only weeks ago .
Sources close to Citigroup scotched the rumour , though , saying the bank had no plan to ask for more help from the treasury at this stage .
Citigroup is not alone in suffering at the hands of the market .
The entire US financial sector has been in negative territory for much of the week .
The S&P index of financial shares tumbled 10.5 % yesterday , with JP Morgan Chase off 17.9 % at $ 23.38 by the close .
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy did it again .
Meeting in Moscow on Thursday , Mr. Berlusconi told President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia that President - elect Barack Obama “ has all the qualities to get along well with you : he ’s young , handsome and suntanned , so I think you can develop a good working relationship . ”
Italy ’s leading daily , Corriere della Sera , ran a video of the scene .
The leader of the center - left opposition , Walter Veltroni , said Mr. Berlusconi ’s remarks “ seriously damage the image and dignity of our country on the international scene , ” Corriere della Sera reported .
Mr. Veltroni — who has been called the Obama of Italy , except that he lost the election –­ added that such “ cabaret one - liners ” showed a “ lack of respect ” unworthy of a statesman .
He called on Mr. Berlusconi “ to offer official apologies . ”
But Mr. Berlusconi said the remark had been all in fun :
“ Are there really people who do n’t understand it was a cute thing to say ? ” he said , according to Corriere .
Adding : “ God save us from imbeciles .
How can you take such a great compliment negatively ? ”
If a recent show of work from the New York University Interactive Telecommunications Program ( ITP ) is any indication , the student - artists there are having way more fun than anyone in graduate school should .
From hacking a piano to mix and dispense cocktails to rigging a Twitter - powered mobile of birds , students married tech to whimsy for their 2008 winter show .
ITP , which bills itself as a " hi - tech fun house , " is a two - year graduate program in alternative media , in which students design games , build musical instruments and create works of interactive art .
Take a peek at some of the highlights of the projects exhibited at last week 's winter extravaganza in a photo slide show .
Franken camp less bullish on chance of Senate intervention Nick Juliano
Published : Monday December 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : Search for missing ballots suspended Before last week 's Georgia run -off election squashed Democrats ' hopes of a 60 - vote majority in the Senate , Al Franken 's campaign made no secret about the fact they were mulling asking the Senate to step in if things did n't go their way in the Minnesota recount .
Now that Republicans are guaranteed a filibuster - worthy caucus , the chances for a Democratic intervention have dimmed , and Franken 's campaign is taking a few steps back from their previous outlook .
Franken attorney Marc Elias , speaking to reporters on a conference call Monday , said his previous assertion that the campaign may appeal to the Senate to appeal for inclusion of some disputed absentee ballots was simply a " paraphrasing " of options that had been laid out by a state judge .
" We 've said consistently , " he said , " we 're taking this one step at a time . "
With Democrat Jim Martin losing in Georgia last week , some observers suggest that moderate Senate Democrats will prevent an intervention without the tantalizing prospect of a filibuster - proof majority spurring them into action .
Ballot search suspended Meanwhile , officials have suspended a search for an envelope containing 133 ballots that has gone missing from a Minneapolis precinct since Election Day .
Earlier Monday , the Franken campaign urged state officials to invalidate a recount in the affected precinct if the ballots were not found .
A city spokesman told the Associated Press that officials handed a state canvassing board two sets of results from the affected precinct , one of the recounted ballots and another from Election Day , when the 133 were included .
The board meets Friday .
Elias said he would " urge " the board to use the Election Night count from that heavily Democratic precinct in the state 's final tally .
While searching for the missing envelope over the weekend , Minneapolis officials discovered 12 overseas military absentee ballots ; Elias said those ballots should be included in the count .
Developments in the Minnesota recount , where Franken is attempting to oust Republican Sen. Norm Coleman , were fairly mundane , otherwise .
The Franken campaign is dropping its challenge of approximately 425 ballots and urging the inclusion of a dozen absentee ballots officials in Minneapolis discovered over the weekend .
Officials in many Minnesota counties on Monday began sorting rejected absentee ballots into several piles , separating those that were rejected for four legitimate reasons described in state law from a " fifth pile " of ballots whose reason for rejection was improper or unclear .
The Franken campaign hopes to have this fifth pile of votes included in the recount .
Election officials in Minnesota have completed a hand recount of more than 2.4 million ballots cast in the race between Democrat Franken and Republican Sen. Norm Coleman .
Franken campaign attorney Marc Elias told reporters Monday he was optimistic that the 133 missing Minneapolis ballots would be found , although he did for the first time entertain the possibility they would not turn up .
Elias said some counties were not separating their absentee ballots into five piles , as a state canvassing board has requested .
He did not identify the scofflaw counties or discuss possible legal recourse to force compliance with the separation requests .

WASHINGTON —
The rugby practice field at Hyde Leadership Public Charter School bears little resemblance to the manicured lawns of the English boarding school where the sport was born .
It is more brown than green , and sirens sometimes drown out the shouts of players .
Then there are the occasional interruptions , like when play was briefly halted during a recent practice as a man darted about wildly on a nearby street , calling football plays and evading imaginary tacklers .
But this patch of mud and grass is more than the home of what is believed to be the nation ’s first all - African - American high school rugby team .
It is also where a growing number of students have been exposed to a sport they once knew nothing about and to parts of society that once seemed closed to them .
Hyde players have a hard time explaining rugby to friends who do not attend their school and who do not know much about the sport .
Others say things like , “ You ’re crazy , that ’s a white person ’s sport , ” said Lawrenn Lee , a senior on the team .
One parent , Clifford Lancaster , recalled his reaction when his son Salim announced he was going to play : “ My eyes got this big .
I said , ‘ That ’s a wild sport . ’ ”
The man most responsible for all of this is Tal Bayer , 38 .
After several unfulfilling years in finance , Bayer became the first teacher hired when Hyde opened in 1999 .
He said he rejected his mother ’s admonition that becoming a teacher would leave him “ broke and miserable . ”
After a recent practice , Bayer smiled and said , “ I am broke but far from miserable . ”

It is hardly unusual for an incoming president to extend his hand to members of the opposing party .
( Mr. Obama is spending a good bit of time , aides said , studying the approach of President Abraham Lincoln . )
What is far more difficult , though , is sustaining the radiance of the bipartisan honeymoon , a difficulty President Bush encountered eight years ago after early signs of goodwill to Senator Edward M. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , in their pursuit of an education overhaul .
Mr. Obama ’s challenge is no different  it is perhaps even more acute  as he works to straddle the partisan divide that has grown deeper over the last eight years .
Advisers said he was well aware of the balancing act awaiting him , particularly as he worked to avoid disappointing or angering Democrats on the left , a constituency that was vital to his winning the party ’s nomination .
“ Even though the majorities are big , the challenges are of such a magnitude that we ’re all inheriting , it ’s going to require bipartisanship to solve , ” Mr. Emanuel said in an interview after completing a round of meetings with Congressional Republicans .
“ We ’re not lip - synching bipartisanship here . ”
Mr. Emanuel , who was formerly the No. 4 Democrat in the House and helped expand the party ’s majority in Congress , signaled to Republicans that the president - elect wanted to work alongside them .
He handed out his personal cellphone number , urging them to call at any hour if they needed to reach him , and he asked them to submit their ideas for the economic recovery plan and other issues of potential agreement .
Even when they were in the majority , Republicans were often frustrated with the Bush administration ’s lack of outreach to Congress .
They said Mr. Emanuel ’s arrival on Capitol Hill less than three weeks after the election  though no breakthroughs were made on issues  sent a good preliminary message .
KARACHI – Reporting from Peshawar  hub of Pakistan ’s tribal areas , currently the focus of a pincer movement between the Pakistan army and the United States - led forces in neighboring Afghanistan  has become a highly risky affair .
“ I still ca n’t believe that I ’m alive and talking to you , ” said 34 - year old Sami Yusufzai , reporter for the US - based Newsweek magazine , who survived a kidnap attempt by unknown gunmen in Peshawar ’s upscale Hayatabad area on Nov 14 .
Yusufzai and Motoki Yotsukura , the Pakistan bureau chief of the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun were returning from interviewing insurgents when they were intercepted by the gunmen .
When they drove by , their attackers opened fire , injuring Yotsukura in the leg while Yusufzai was hit several times at close range .
“ They aimed at my chest but the bullet hit my arm instead .
It remains nestled there as it ’s too deep to be disturbed , ” said Yusufzai , speaking with IPS over telephone from his hospital bed in Peshawar .
After the US began launching cross - border missile strikes from Afghanistan against Taliban and al - Qaeda militants holed up into Pakistan ’s tribal areas about two months ago , backed by a Pakistan army offensive into the areas , journalists in Peshawar have become targets .
Yusfazai said his life is still in danger .
“ I ’m scared they [ the attackers ] will come after me , now that they know I am alive . ”
He is also losing sleep because “ I ’m worried for the safety of my family . ”
This was not the first time Yusufzai had been attacked by militants or threatened .
“ Only three days prior to this , I got a call telling me to prepare my kaffan ( unstitched white cloth used as a shroud ) . ”
Challenging the news reports that say that he and his Japanese colleague ventured into the tribal belt without first obtaining permission from the interior ministry , Yusufzai said : “ These are a pack of lies , concocted by the police .
We never ventured out of the Hayatabad area . ”
However , Rahimullah Yusufzai , resident editor of daily
The News and an expert on the Taliban insists the two were there illegally thereby violating the law barring foreigners from visiting the tribal area without proper authorization .
Yusufzai is an Afghan national who has been in Pakistan since he was six .
“ We have two different versions here but all our reporters are saying the two were returning from the tribal area of Shahkas in Khyber Agency , adjacent to Hayatabad when they were fired at .
Obviously , Sami would not own up to that as entering tribal areas is illegal for foreigners .
This could land him in trouble and prompt the Pakistan government to expel him , ” Rahimullah said .
Ron Moreau , who is Newsweek ‘s Southeast Asia correspondent said : “ They did not venture into the tribal area .
But if they had official permission and had entered the area it would have been a worthless reporting exercise as it would have prevented any interesting interviews , ” said Moreau referring to the practice of law enforcers accompanying reporters as escorts .
Moreau who has reported from the tribal areas and done extensive conflict reporting confessed to being “ frightened at times , ” but said he was willing to take risks which “ come with the job . ”
“ Journalists in the region have long warned about the lack of security and the threats they face from all sides  Taliban and al - Qaeda fighters , drug lords , gun runners , criminal gangs , and even the Pakistani government .
For journalists , as for all others in Peshawar , this is a situation going from bad to worse , ” stated Bob Dietz of the Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) .
On Nov. 8 , Qari Mohammad Shoaib , a reporter for the Azadi and Khabar Kar newspapers , was shot dead by security forces in Mingora in the northwestern Swat valley .
And on Nov. 11 Khadija Abdul Qahar , a Canadian formerly known as Beverly Giesbrecht , who publishes a web - based magazine , Jihad Unspun was reportedly abducted along with her translator and guide , both Pakistani nationals .
The group was said to be traveling to the town of Miramshah in the North Waziristan area when they were stopped and abducted by a group of armed men .
Jihad Unspun has the stated objective of presenting uncensored reporting of the United States ’ “ war on terrorism ” and its articles are often highly critical of US foreign policy and military interventions .
However , it is also suspected to be a front for the US Central Intelligence Agency set up to monitor traffic from Internet users who support the al - Qaeda .
“ Every attack that takes place against journalists anywhere , is likely to hamper others to venture into these areas for fear of their lives , ” said Massoud Ansari , political correspondent for the popular Pakistani monthly , Herald , responding to the attack on Yusufzai and Yotsukura .
“ Foreign journalists indeed would now be coming to Peshawar in fewer numbers .
The writ of the government is quite weak all over the area .
Most journalists feel insecure even in Peshawar , ” said Rahimullah .
“ It [ attack on Yusufzai and Yotsukura ] will make local stringers and fixers feel nervous , ” admitted Moreau .
“ It does show that no one is safe , even those reporters who have a professional relationship with militants . ”
Moreau also said that for many correspondents of foreign publications , Peshawar is , for the time being , off limits .
“ My hunch is that the attack was largely aimed at kidnapping the Japanese journalist for ransom .
To get to him they tried to kill Sami , ” said Moreau .
“ Militants are a varied lot .
Some join for Islam , religious ideology , for a job , for power , for revenge in order to avenge a friend ’s or relative ’s death , or out of criminal intent , ” Moreau said .
But covering war and conflict also means you take sides , said Ansari , who is also the Pakistan correspondent for the Britain - based Sunday Telegraph .
“ You always join one party in the conflict and get the information across by joining them or going along with them . ”
“ Most of these groups accuse the western media of being biased with the result that they are not willing to give you access , ” said Ansari .
“ The state actors such as the sitting government as well as the army also hold a grudge against the media and do not allow them “ free access . ”
All these problems , said Ansari , make it difficult and perilous to cover the region in a transparent manner .
Ansari also pointed out that there has emerged a “ whole lot of criminal groups who are involved in kidnappings , further complicating the situation . ”
Victorian police are defending the actions of officers who shot dead a 15 - year - old boy in Melbourne 's inner -east last night .
Police used capsicum spray unsuccessfully and fired a warning shot into the ground before three officers shot the boy in the chest in the suburb of Northcote .
The 15 - year - old was armed with knives believed to have been stolen from a local shop .
Police say his family had earlier stopped him from taking knives from the family home .
Assistant Commissioner Tim Cartwright says officers acted correctly and rejected claims that they were trigger happy .
It is not known how many shots hit the boy .
" When you step through the events and look at the investigation we 've conducted today the members have done everything they can , " he said .
" They 've tried to talk him down , they 've deployed OC foam , they 've backed off .
" At the end of the day one of our member 's lives was at risk from what we can tell , three members have then seen fit to defend that member and open fire . "
Julian Burnside QC , the immediate past president of Liberty Victoria , says the incident is a sad reminder of the old days of Victoria Police being too heavy - handed with guns .
" I must say , it 's a very upsetting story , you 've got a 15 - year - old kid acting badly , he 's got some knives , and you 've got three policemen with pistols , " he said .
" It does n't sound like a fair match , to bring him down in a hail of bullets seems like an over - reaction .
" There may be more to it , we do n't know yet , but I really do wonder why ... just one policeman might not have shot at his arm or shot at his leg .
" But for three police men to open fire and kill a boy who 's just got a couple of knives , looks like an over - reaction . "
The Police Association 's Greg Davies says the officers acted appropriately , but he says the shooting shows that police need more options when confronted with violence .
" The Police Association for a number of years has been calling for the issue of Tasers as a non-lethal alternative option , " he said .
" We can't say whether Tasers would have been used or could have been used in last night 's incident , but clearly it would have at least provided another option . "
Witnesses
Witness Hariet Stewart says she was in the car park and saw the boy before he was shot .
" There was a kid , and he had two big cleaver knives .
He screamed - he did this kind of big roar - and I turned around and he was walking kind of angrily along with these two knives so I hid behind a tree , " she said .
" I then heard the police rushing over and then I heard what was probably about seven or eight gunshots . "
Ms Stewart says she thought the teenager may have been on drugs .
" My suspicion was that he looked like he was on ice , he looked really angry and also really irrational , which is why I hid , " she said .
" I think it 's awful , especially with what 's happened in Athens , police killing people , there 's just no excuse .
" It was terrifying , but he was just a kid , and I think it 's outrageous . "
Another witness , George Markopoulos , says he was across the road when he heard two warning shots .
" After that , I heard about four shots being fired and a few people screaming , " he said .
" I went over to the area , and they told me someone had been shot . "
Mr Markopoulos lives in the area , and says it is a normally a peaceful place .
" At the skate park you do get young kids playing around , graffiti , do all sorts of things , but not to the point like this where someone 's running around with knives and getting shot , " he said .
Father Peter Norden from the Victorian Criminal Justice Coalition wants an independent investigation into the fatal shooting .
The Coalition represents more than 50 legal , academic and community service organisations involved with the criminal justice system .
Father Norden is warning against a " closed shop " investigation by police , to justify the use of deadly force .
" The use of capsicum spray and a violent confrontation is often the worst possible response to a young person displaying emotional or psychiatric symptoms , " he said .
" The Victorian community calls for a more sophisticated response in dealing with disturbed individuals , particularly very young people .
" Community agencies working with disturbed young people deal with serious incidents of this kind every evening , without resorting to a violent response . "
Homicide detectives and Ethical Standards police are investigating the shooting .

TOKYO – The Japanese economy will shrink this fiscal year and will manage only flat growth the following year , the government said Friday , underlining looming fears about a global recession .
The Cabinet Office lowered its forecast for the nation 's gross domestic product — the value of goods and services — for the fiscal year through March 2009 to a 0.8 percent contraction .
In July , it had expected 1.3 percent growth .
It expects growth to stay flat during the fiscal year ending March 2010 .
The gloomy outlook shows that Japan 's export - dependent economy , already driven into recession by fallout from the U.S. financial crisis and ensuing global slump , is in for more pain .
Major corporations like Toyota Motor Corp. and Sony Corp. are slashing their earnings estimates and cutting work forces .
Nagayuki Yamagishi , strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Co. in Tokyo , said the government 's projection was too optimistic .
" Economies around the world are contracting and so Japan 's economy is clearly going to contract , " he said .
Earlier this month , the government said Japan fell deeper into recession in the third quarter than first thought , shrinking at an annual pace of 1.8 percent .
In 2001 , the Cabinet Office projected zero growth for the fiscal year ending March 2003 .
But the economy grew 1.1 percent that fiscal year , according to the government .
The government said exports will continue to slow and corporate investment will decline in coming months .
Such negatives will only be somewhat offset by a moderate recovery in consumer spending and housing investment , helped by a government stimulus package announced earlier this month , the Cabinet Office said .
Last week , Japan announced a 23 trillion yen ( $ 258 billion ) spending package to jump start growth , including measures to encourage employment and dole out cash payments to people .
Also Friday , the government said the jobless rate will worsen to 4.7 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2010 , from 4.2 percent projected for the fiscal year ending March 2009 .
It had previously expected the unemployment rate to stand at 3.8 percent for the current fiscal year .

That was a joke .
As layoffs mount amid the slowing economy , some employers are cutting costs without axing jobs .
Hypertherm Inc. has never laid off a permanent employee in its 40 - year history .
A 20 % downturn in sales in recent months led the closely held maker of metal - cutting equipment to eliminate overtime , cut temporary staff and delay a facility expansion , says Chief Executive Dick Couch .
Managers ...
They baled out of the bail - out , but the money will still have to come from us .
It always has .
by George Monbiot – journalist , author , academic and environmental and political activist
According to Senator Jim Bunning , the proposal to purchase $ 700bn of dodgy debt by the US government “ is financial socialism , it is un-American ” ( 1 ) .
The economics professor Nouriel Roubini calls George Bush , Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke “ a troika of Bolsheviks who turned the USA into the United Socialist State Republic of America ” ( 2 ) .
Bill Perkins , the venture capitalist who took out an advertisement in the New York Times attacking the deal , calls it “ trickle - down communism ” ( 3 ) .
They are wrong .
The banking subsidies Congress rejected last night are as American as apple pie and obesity .
The sums demanded by Bush and Paulson might be unprecedented , but there is nothing new about the principle : corporate welfare is a consistent feature of advanced capitalism .
Only one thing has changed : Congress has been forced to confront its contradictions .
One of the best studies of corporate welfare in the United States is published by my old enemies at the Cato Institute .
Its report , by Stephen Slivinski , estimates that in 2006 the federal government spent $ 92bn subsidising business ( 4 ) .
Much of it went to major corporations like Boeing , IBM and General Electric .
The biggest money crop – $ 21bn – is harvested by Big Farmer .
Slivinski shows that the richest 10 % of subsidised farmers took 66 % of the pay - outs .
Every few years Congress or the administration promises to stop this swindle , then hands even more state money to agribusiness .
The Farm Bill passed by Congress in May guarantees farmers a minimum of 90 % of the income they ’ve received over the past two years , which happen to be among the most profitable they ’ve ever had ( 5 ) .
The middlemen do even better , especially the companies spreading starvation by turning maize into ethanol , which are guzzling billions of dollars ’ worth of tax credits .
Slivinski shows how the federal government ’s Advanced Technology Program , which was supposed to support the development of technologies that are “ pre-competitive ” or “ high risk ” has instead been captured by big businesses flogging proven products .
Since 1991 , companies like IBM , General Electric , Dow Chemical , Caterpillar , Ford , DuPont , General Motors , Chevron and Monsanto have extracted hundreds of millions from this programme .
Big business is also underwritten by the Export - Import Bank : in 2006 , for example , Boeing alone received four and half billion in loan guarantees ( 6 ) .
The government runs something called the “ Foreign Military Financing Program ” which gives money to other countries to purchase weaponry from US corporations .
It doles out grants to airports for building new runways and to fishing companies to help them wipe out endangered stocks .
But the Cato Institute ’s report has exposed only part of the corporate welfare scandal .
A new paper by the US Institute for Policy Studies shows that , through a series of cunning tax and accounting loopholes , the US spends $ 20 bn a year subsidising executive pay ( 7 ) .
By disguising their professional fees as capital gains rather than income , for example , the managers of hedge funds and private equity companies pay lower rates of tax than the people who clean their offices .
A year ago , the House of Representatives tried to close this loophole , but the bill was blocked in the Senate after a lobbying campaign by some of the richest men in America .
Another report , by a group called Good Jobs First , reveals that Wal - Mart has received at least $ 1bn of public money ( 8 ) .
Over 90 % of its distribution centres and many of its retail outlets have been subsidised by county and local governments .
They give the chain free land , they pay for the roads , water and sewerage required to make that land usable , and they grant it property tax breaks and subsidies ( called tax increment financing ) originally intended to regenerate depressed communities .
Sometimes state governments give the firm straight cash as well : in Virginia , for example , Wal - Mart ’s distribution centres receive handouts from the Governor ’s Opportunity Fund .
Corporate welfare is arguably the core business of some government departments .
Many of the Pentagon ’s programmes deliver benefits only to its contractors .
Ballistic missile defence , for example , which has no obvious strategic purpose and which is unlikely ever to work , has already cost the US between $ 120bn and $ 150 bn .
The Department of Defense wants another $ 62bn for the next five years ( 9 ) .
The US is unique among major donors in insisting that the food it offers in aid is produced on its own soil , rather than in the regions it is meant to be helping .
USAID used to boast on its website that “ the principal beneficiary of America ’s foreign assistance programs has always been the United States .
Close to 80 percent of the US Agency for International Development ’s contracts and grants go directly to American firms . ” ( 10 ) There is not and has never been a free market in the United States .
Why not ?
Because the Congressmen and women now railing against financial socialism depend for their re-election on the companies they subsidise .
The legal bribes paid by these businesses deliver two short - term benefits .
The first is that they prevent proper regulation , which allows them to make spectacular profits and to generate disasters of the kind that Congress is now confronting .
The second is that public money which should be used to help the poorest and weakest is instead diverted into the pockets of the rich .
A report published last week by the advocacy group Common Cause shows how bankers and brokers stopped legislators from banning unsustainable lending ( 11 ) .
Over the past financial year , the big banks spent $ 49 m on lobbying and $ 7 m in direct campaign contributions .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have spent $ 180 m in lobbying and campaign finance over the past eight years .
Much of this money was thrown at members of the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee .
Whenever congressmen tried to rein in the banks and mortgage lenders they were blocked by the banks ’ money .
Dick Durbin ’s 2005 amendment seeking to stop predatory mortgage lending , for example , was defeated in the Senate by 58 to 40 .
The former representative Jim Leach proposed re-regulating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Their lobbyists , he recalls , managed in “ less than 48 hours to orchestrate both parties ’ leadership ” to crush his amendments ( 12 ) .
The money these firms spend buys the socialisation of financial risk .
The $ 700 bn the government was looking for is just one of the public costs of its repeated failure to regulate .
Even now the lobbying power of the banks is making itself felt : on Saturday the Democrats watered down their demand that the money earned by executives of the companies the government is rescuing be capped ( 13 ) .
Campaign finance is the best investment a corporation can make .
You give a million dollars to the right man and reap a billion dollars ’ worth of state protection , tax breaks and subsidies .
When the same thing happens in Africa we call it corruption .
European governments are no better .
The free market economics they proclaim are a con : they intervene repeatedly on behalf of the rich , while leaving everyone else to fend for themselves .
Just as in the United States , the bosses of farm companies , oil drillers , supermarkets and banks capture the funds extracted by government from the pockets of people much poorer than themselves .
Taxpayers everywhere should be asking the same question : why the hell should we be supporting them ?

Long and exhausting road to compromise .
Financial Times .
My little spat with with Rauchway regarding unemployment during the Great Depression draws in Paul Krugman .
Krugman does n’t respond to any of my arguments but he does give us the old line that fiscal policy did n’t fail during the Great Depression it was n’t tried .
Now , you might say that the incomplete recovery shows that “ pump - priming ” , Keynesian fiscal policy does n’t work .
Except that the New Deal did n’t pursue Keynesian policies .
Properly measured , that is , by using the cyclically adjusted deficit , fiscal policy was only modestly expansionary , at least compared with the depth of the slump .
Here ’s the Cary Brown estimates , from Brad DeLong …
Net stimulus of around 3 percent of GDP – not much , when you ’ve got a 42 percent output gap .
Now there is actually a lot of truth to this but the way in which Krugman , Rauchway , DeLong and others present this point is esoteric and likely to mislead even many economists .
What Krugman seems to be saying is that the government did n’t spend enough during the thirties ( Rauchway , who also cites Cary Brown , says directly " there was never enough spending to achieve the desired effect . " )
Yet federal spending during this time increased tremendously .
So what is really going on ?
The answer is actually quite simple .
During the Great Depression federal expenditures increased tremendously but so did taxes .
Thus , the reason spending was not stimulative was not that spending was n’t tried it ’s that taxes were also raised to prohibitive levels .
But do n’t take my word for it .
Read Cary Brown ( JSTOR ) whom Krugman , Rauchway , DeLong all cite but none of whom quote at length .
Here is Brown :
The primary failure of fiscal policy to be expansive in this period is attributable to the sharp increases in tax structures enacted at all levels of government .
Total government purchases of goods and services expanded virtually every year , with federal expansion especially marked in 1933 and 1934 .
[ But ] the federal Revenue Act of 1932 virtually doubled full employment tax yields … … the highly deflationary impact of this tax law has not been fully appreciated …
The Revenue Act of 1932 pushed up rates virtually across the board , but notably on the lower and middle income groups … .
Personal income tax exemptions were slashed , the normal - tax as well as surtax rates were sharply raised , and the earned - income credit equal to 25 percent of taxes on low income was repealed .
Less drastic changes were made in the corporate income tax , but its rate was raised slightly and a $ 3000 exemption eliminated .
Estates tax rates were pushed up , exemptions sharply reduced , and a gift tax was provided .
Congress toyed with a manufacturers ’ sales tax , but finally rejected it in favor of a broad new list of excise taxes and substantially higher rates for old ones … .
The Revenue Act of 1932 was followed by many further tax increases ( e.g. Brown notes " … social security taxes began in 1937 to exert a pronounced effect … " ) many of them , under pressure from the Huey Long wing , designed to " Share our Wealth . "
Here is a graph of the highest marginal income tax rate which went from 25 % to 79 % between 1929 and 1940 and here is a graph of the lowest marginal income tax rate which ( from a low base ) increased by a factor of 10 .
( Hat tip to Carpe Diem ) .
Thus , an accurate portrayal of fiscal policy during the Great Depression – entirely consistent with Krugman – is that we had much greater spending , much greater taxes and not much economic stimulus .
And if supporters of the New Deal argue that fiscal policy was only " modestly expansionary " then it ’s quite reasonable to think that once we take into account the supply side effect of taxes and the increase in regime uncertainty then the net effect might even have been contractionary .

Buggy series is one of bigger personal projects .
I started to work on it in January 2008 .
It was shortly after I ’ve seen Mad Max trilogy again .
I love those fallout vehicles in the movie and I remember like I loved them when I was just a kid so I ’ve decided to make at least my own one .
I spent on it parts of my free time ( about two to three weeks ) during 4 months .
Well , let ’s be honest and say that there is no big deep point in just a create heavy high detailed buggy in desert environment .
I did n’t want to end up this project just like a car on the plane so I ’ve tried to push myself a bit and make it a little bit more interesting .
I decided to build up several different environments to make this project some kind of skill presentation for fancy car renderings but using old rusty mad fallout buggy .
I started with the desert environment , then I played with forest river , then snowfield and rocky field with shipwreck was the last one .
Final renders are 6.000 pixels width and my plan is to print them out on A2 and put it on the wall in the room of my son when he grow up a little .
So it is also kind of present for my 10 months old son Adam .
If you like just one of them It ’s my pleasure !
Here you can see them all on one page or just scroll down and click on them one by one .

Obama : McCain as ' Robin attacking Batman '
In Albuquerque , before a massive crowd , Obama moves away from the ( politically incorrect ? )
Lone Ranger and Tonto analogy to a new one : " It ’s like Robin getting mad at Batman , " he says of McCain 's recent efforts to distance himself from Bush .
A fire marshall puts the crowd at at least 45,000 , many times that at McCain 's roughly 1,000 - person event a couple of miles away this morning .
Obama , meanwhile , is playing it safe and avoiding the press , with the sole exception of a correspondent from " Extra ! " who asked about his grandmother 's health , his reaction to the Jennifer Hudson 's family tragedy , and why Latinos should vote for him .
( My pace of blogging is up a bit for a weekend because I 'm on the road , and because we 're in the home stretch . )

TEL AVIV , Israel ( CNN ) --
Keep your shoes and belts on : Waiting in long airport security lines to pass through metal detectors may soon be a thing of the past .
Airport security checkpoints may become opportunities for screeners to study passengers ' intentions .
Security experts say focus is shifting from analyzing the content of carry - ons to analyzing the content of passengers ' intentions and emotions .
" We are seeing a needed paradigm shift when it comes to security , " says Omer Laviv , CEO of ATHENA GS3 , an Israeli - based security company .
" This ' brain - fingerprinting , ' or technology which checks for behavioral intent , is much more developed than we think . "
Nowhere is the need for cutting - edge security more acute than Israel , which faces constant security threats .
For this reason , Israel has become a leader in developing security technology .
Several Israeli - based technology companies are developing detection systems that pick up signs of emotional strain , a psychological red flag that a passenger may intend to commit an act of terror .
Speedier and less intrusive than metal detectors , these systems may eventually restore some efficiency to the airplane boarding process .
One firm , WeCU ( pronounced " We See You " )
Technologies , employs a combination of infra-red technology , remote sensors and imagers , and flashing of subliminal images , such as a photo of Osama bin Laden .
Developers say the combination of these technologies can detect a person 's reaction to certain stimuli by reading body temperature , heart rate and respiration , signals a terrorist unwittingly emits before he plans to commit an attack .
With these technologies , the emphasis is on speed and seamlessness .
Ehud Givon , CEO of WeCU , envisions a day when a passenger can breeze through a security checkpoint in 20 to 30 seconds .
Although traditional security profiling can discriminate by race and religion , security experts say behavioral profiling is more fair , more effective and less expensive .
WeCU has received grants from the Transportation Security Administration within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , which hopes to implement a system to pinpoint internal threats such as airline employees intending terrorist acts .
Once these technologies are in place , a passenger may pass through a security screening without realizing it .
For example , passengers could use an automated check - in system or gaze at a screen with departures information without realizing they 've just been exposed to the words " Islamic jihad " written in Arabic .
These stimuli , explains Givon , will intrinsically elicit some sort of biometric response -- whether the passenger knows it or not -- that can be picked up by WeCU 's strategically placed sensors .
" I believe that we introduce a new layer in security , " Givon says .
" This is something that could n't be done in the past : finding the connection between a certain individual and the intent to harm . "
The Orwellian - sounding startup has gone further to develop a system that detects a passenger 's behavioral intentions by scanning their every step , literally .
While walking around certain parts of the airport terminal , a passenger may not realize he has stepped on a " smart carpet " filled with hidden biometric sensors .
The technology is still under development , says Givon , who believes it will be strong enough to pick up biometric information from a footstep .
If a passenger is wearing heavy hiking boots , for example , WeCU will rely on biometric sensors combined with video and thermal biometric imaging to detect malicious intent .
Another option from WeCU is a " smart seat , " or cushion full of hidden biometric sensors that could provide a more detailed read on someone sitting in an airport waiting area , Givon says .
While the technology sound like something from a James Bond flick or even " A Clockwork Orange , " Givon insists that passengers will not find the techniques intrusive .
" We do n't want you to feel that you are being interrogated , " he says .
Givon is negotiating contracts with airports worldwide and believes his company 's technology may be implemented as soon as 2010 .
Nemesysco , another Israeli - based technology company , believes the key to a person 's emotions and intentions lies in their voice .
The company 's patented LVA , or Layered Voice Analysis , technology can pick up verbal cues from a passenger who may pose a threat .
Unlike a polygraph test , which checks for lies , Nemesysco 's systems work as an " emotion detector , " says Nemesysco CEO Amir Liberman .
In other words , it 's not what passengers say , but how they say it .
Nemesysco's devices use a series of patented signal - processing algorithms that can differentiate between a " normal " voice and a " ' stressed " voice .
If emotional stress is detected , officials can determine if the passenger should be taken aside for further questioning .
The system works on the premise that all voices have a certain frequency , and any deviation of that baseline frequency can indicate stress .
Liberman says it takes approximately five to 10 seconds for their system to capture a " normal " voice in casual conversation , which establishes a baseline .
Their system then measures changes from the baseline voice that signify an increase in stress , excitement , anticipation , hesitation or other emotions that can indicate a potential terrorism threat .
A computer processes the voice patterns and then flashes words such as " high risk , " " medium risk , " " excited " and " highly stressed . "
Through his system , Liberman says , he " can see what 's going on in your brain . "
Versions of Nemesysco's system already have been successfully tested at Moscow Domodedovo International Airport , where officials used it to target criminals and drug traffickers .
A version was recently implemented at another major international airport which Liberman declined to identify .
Layered Voice Analysis also has been used to test for insurance fraud and on the TV program " Big Brother Australia . "
Layered Voice Analysis has limitations , including the inability to trace the vocal patterns of a person with a speech impediment .
But the system is more effective than current security measures , claims Liberman , who believes a terrorist currently can pass through airport security with explosive material " that can take down any plane . "
In fact , many experts express little confidence in the current state of airport security .
Philip Baum , London - based editor of Aviation Security International magazine , says would - be terrorists could easily slip through security checkpoints , even with new regulations that check for liquids .
" The archaic system of an X - ray machine and metal detector cannot pick up other potential threats posed by passengers , " Baum says .
" I can have a ceramic weapon or chemical weapons and walk through an archway metal detector and it wo n't be picked up .
Yet we have huge faith in these metal detectors that can only pick up one substance . "
Laviv , whose consulting firm focuses on securing mass transportation systems , is equally skeptical .
" It is possible today to hijack an aircraft using only five or six able - bodied passengers who are well - trained in Kung Fu fighting , " he says .
" There is no technology in place in airports to detect a threat like that .
" The question is , should our desire be to look for each and every threat agent , rather than focus our efforts on identifying the [ violent ] intention of the passenger ? "

What is SEO ?
SEO is a fundamental part of search engine marketing ( SEM ) .
It requires constant updating and continuous attention of the website content for solid , long - term effective results .
' Natural ' Search Engine Optimization ( SEO ) is the practice of guiding the design and development of a website so that it will naturally attract visitors by winning top rankings on the major search engines for selected search key word phrases .
It is common that search engine rankings go up and down all the time .
Many webmasters are unsure what they have to do to keep their web sites at the top of the search engine result pages .
There are two main factors that influence the rankings of your web pages .
This typically includes :
O On Page Optimization
O Off Page Optimization
What is on page Optimization ?
The term On Page Optimization refers to just that : optimization that is done directly on a specific webpage to achieve better search engine rankings .
This could mean on the visible parts of the page ( what the viewer or customer can see ) or in the code or invisible parts of the page .
This is all done directly on the .html ‘ file ’ or ‘ page ’ which is the reason for the name On Page Optimization .
( OR )
On - page optimization refers to factors that have an effect on your Web site or Web page listing in natural search results .
These factors are controlled by you or by coding on your page .
Examples of on - page optimization include actual HTML code , meta tags , keyword placement and keyword density , etc .
What is off Page Optimization ?
Off - Page optimization refers to the ranking factors that are usually out of your control .
The most important off - Page factor is the links to your web site .
Link Buildings are part of Off Page Optimization .
Search engines use these two main factors to determine the rankings of your web pages .
SEO Process is a combination of on page and off page optimization in which off page optimization is most crucial to rank a website on major search engines .
It helps to achieve , maintain and improve the ranking by chasing down major competitive keywords .

What is Link Building ?
In terms of traffic building , organic search engine rankings and internet sales , link building is one of the most important aspects of search engine optimization .
Link popularity or building simply refers to the mechanism of securing text links pointed at your website and strategic landing pages in order to increase rankings .
This is often referred to as Off Page Optimization .
Currently , link building - developing quality relevant one way links ( also known as backlinks or inbound links ) - to your website is one of the most important factors in SEO and achieving high rankings in the search engines .
The different types of links are , but not limited to :
- One way link building - Convincing any given website to link back to you by various methods are including Directory Submission , Article writing and content distribution and publication and Web 2.0 - social bookmarking and blog / forum links .
- Two way link building ( Reciprocal linking ) - you link to me from a page in your website , and I will link back .
- Three way link building - Three Way Link Building helps you build links while avoid reciprocal link building and other types of penalties resulting from it .
They way it works is that you give Website ( A ) a link to Website ( B ) .
Website ( B ) gives a link to Website ( C ) .
Website ( C ) then gives a link to Website ( A ) .
In the end , ( C ) websites have links to each other , and yet none of them are reciprocal .
Three waylinks are a subset of reciprocal links .
- Paid links - links secured on any given webpage by monthly or yearly payment .

Research shows that advertisers receive the highest ROI from pay - for - placement search when compared to e-mail , banners and other forms of online advertising .
PPC advertising offers you an excellent solution to drive traffic to your website almost immediately .
Another great benefit of Pay - Per - Click advertising is its advantage of being easily tracked so you can tell that campaign A just made $ 5,000 of profit whereas campaing B did not earn you anything .
Although many PPC providers exist , Google AdWords , Yahoo !
Search Marketing , and Microsoft AdCenter are the three largest network operators , and all three operate under a bid - based model .
Cost per click ( CPC ) , varies depending on the search engine and the level of competition for a particular keyword .
Cost per click ( CPC ) is the amount of money an advertiser pays search engines and other Internet publishers for a single click on its advertisement that brings one visitor to its website .
Adwords : Name of the Google pay per click program .

Star Axis is both an Earth / Sky sculpture and a naked eye observatory .
Presently under construction atop a small mesa where the Sangre de Cristo mountains meet the eastern plains — 80 miles from Santa Fe , New Mexico — the work is now nearing completion .
Here the powerful spirit of the land gives one the feeling of standing at the boundary between earth and sky .
At its outside dimensions , Star Axis will be 11 stories high and a tenth of a mile across .
The work allows the viewer to walk through layers of celestial time , making directly visible the 26,000 year cycle in the earth 's changing alignment with the stars .
— Charles Ross Charles
Ross is a sculptor .
His work - in - process , Star Axis , is , literally , cosmic in scope and as such is perhaps incomprehensible to some , an aphrodisiac or intoxication to others !
The name , Star Axis , refers to the axis upon which our Earth rotates and to a phenomenon called precession ( more about that later ) .
The concept behind Star Axis originates from two celestial phenomena and a cosmic cycle which has existed for thousands of years .
First , despite the common assumption that the Earth 's axis points directly at Polaris , the alignment is not exact .
This misalignment causes Polaris to appear to move in a tiny arc .
Second , the Earth 's spin in space is not stable , but wobbles like a top in a great 26,000 year cycle .
Astronomers call this cycle precession .
The slow wobble gradually shifts the Earth 's axis toward and then away from Polaris .
As the axis points to other regions in the sky , Polaris turns around the pole in ever - widening circles of sky , eventually relinquishing its place as the North Star .
Each of these circles can be seen as a celestial marker in human history .
The movement is so slow that the changing relationship of Polaris to the Earth appears invisible to casual observations .
Star Axis makes the wobble visible .
At the center of the Star Axis site , an inverted cone has been carved deep into the capstone and lined with rock masonry .
Within this cone a stainless steel tunnel will rise eleven stories and be placed exactly parallel to the Earth 's axis .
The tunnel focuses on the celestial pole in order to sight and frame the motions of Polaris .
Inside the tunnel , stairs rise to the top of the sculpture , emerging above the mesa through a granite pyramid whose shape is derived from the seasonal angles of the Sun .
Visitors will enter the tunnel from the bottom of the cone and walk up the stairs in perfect alignment with the Earth 's axis and its outward extension to the stars .
Wherever one stands within the tunnel , the circle of the sky framed by the opening precisely represents Polaris ' orbit for a particular period of history .
Because precession is a cyclical process , any observation made within the tunnel represents a view of the past , as well as the future .
Dates engraved in each stair identify the years .
Thus , the visitor can stand in the orbit of Polaris as it existed for Nefertiti , or for Confucius , or for Leonardo da Vinci or as it was in the Stone Age and will be again 13,000 years in the future .
The initial image in the tunnel represents the present .
However , when the participant reaches the top of the shaft , the view simulates the largest arc Polaris makes in both 11,000 BC and 15,000 AD !
To find the right setting for Star Axis , in 1971 I began an intensive four - year search throughout the Southwest .
In addition to the technical requirements , there was another more mysterious quality needed that I could not describe at the time .
Somehow , I kept returning to the mesas of New Mexico .
Later , I realized that the powerful spirit of this land gave me a feeling of standing on the boundary between Earth and Sky .
Here both elements have equal weight and you can see the curvature of the Earth as you look out to the ocean of light that plays across the plains .
Only an hour and a half from Santa Fe , Star Axis is also at the boundary between civilization and wilderness .
The site is isolated , yet readily accessible .
A pristine landscape surrounded by large ranches where the dark night 's sky lets you see the outline of the Milky Way .
One does not have to reject the modern world to remember one 's being in the stars .
I have been working on this project for 22 years .
In some ways , it had to take this much time because each element of Star Axis — every shape , every measure , every angle — was first discovered in the stars and then brought down into the land .
Star geometry anchored in earth and rock .
It 's continually evolving .
Star Axis has to feel as if it has grown from the Earth — that it is not imposed , but found in place .
Construction progress from day - to - day , or year - to - year , may seem slow .
The magnificence of the Star Axis landscape distracts viewers so that progress is difficult to comprehend .
Consequently , the developments at the site can be " seen " most clearly in photographs .
The slow process of building and documenting the construction of Star Axis mirrors the slow evolution of Polaris ' precession .
Star Axis provides a place of heightened focus where we can experience the movement of the Universe in relation to ourselves .
It suggests a time when Art , Science and the spiritual are joined again in a creative vision of the Cosmos .
Partial funding for the project has come from the New Mexico Arts Division , Santa Fe Council for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts in addition to private foundations and numerous individual contributors .
Completion of the " star tunnel " will require approximately $ 200,000 ; completion of the entire Star Axis project will require nearly $ 800,000 .
How You Can be Involved in Star Axis Elements of Star Axis can be " purchased , " or underwritten .
Each stair in the magnificent Star Tunnel , which leads one through the 26,000 - year celestial cycle , can be underwritten or sponsored for $ 10,000 .
Visiting Star Axis Star Axis is still under construction and generally closed to the public .
During the summer months we occasionally invite visitors to the site , but we cannot guarantee that we can accomodate all visitors .
If you are interested in seeing the site please e-mail info@staraxis.org .
When visiting we request a $ 50 per person donation .
Donations for Star Axis are being received by the College of Santa Fe , a nonprofit educational organization ( 501c3 ) .
We also ask that you give plenty of advance notice and that you be flexible regarding the exact time and day you would like to visit .
When Star Axis is complete it will be open to the public by reservation .

Many Nepalese children live in children 's homes and refuges
The international pressure group Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) has accused police in Nepal of torturing children .
The New York - based group said it had received credible claims of more than 200 cases of torture or abuse .
Methods included sticking sharp objects under the toenails and beating the soles of the feet , the group says .
Police deny that children are still being harmed , but a spokesman said a number of officers had been punished for past abuses .
' Committing crimes '
HRW said most of the children involved were suspected of minor crimes or were living on the streets .
It said children had been hit on the thighs , upper arms , backs of hands , backs and the soles of feet with bamboo sticks and plastic pipes .
" The Nepali police have a duty to protect children and to prevent crime , " said Bede Sheppard , the group 's Asia researcher .
" Instead , by torturing children in custody they are committing crimes against those they are supposed to be protecting . "
She said that sometimes the torture was inflicted to extract confessions from the children and at other times it appeared to be carried out " purely for the entertainment of the official " .
The youngest alleged victim was a 13 - year - old .
HRW said that despite widespread accounts of abuse , no police officer or government official had ever been prosecuted .
It said that the maximum punishment was a fine and one year in prison .
A foreign ministry spokesman joined the police in rejecting the allegations .
" The report is wrong and baseless , " Nabin Kumar Ghimire told the AFP news agency .
" If there has been any manhandling , torture or abuse of children in police custody , offenders will face justice , " the official said .
Congressman Robin Hayes , a Republican from North Carolina , has echoed the sentiments of Congresswoman Michele Bachmann who , only a couple days ago called for investigations into whether certain liberal members of Congress were ‘ anti-American ’ .
His stunning comment , made before what he described as the largest gathering for John McCain in North Carolina , was “ liberals hate real Americans that work and achieve and believe in God . ”
Rep .
Hayes , a wealthy owner of a pantyhose factory , said not minutes before “ make sure we do n’t say something stupid , make sure we do n’t say something we do n’t mean . ”
In other words , Congressman Hayes either does n’t understand the statement was stupid , or he is indeed so stupid as to think his statement was intelligent .
His think , rural , southern accent lends a wonderful atmosphere to this bit of far right wing hyperbolic , hate filled rhetoric .
It seems the Republican party has become more honest with the American people as to how they view America .
It ’s not one of acceptance , or democracy , or a melting pot , or a place where freedoms are sacred , but rather they seem to view America as only residing in the hearts of those that unfailingly vote for Republican candidates .
That seems to be what they think is America .
I have news for them , America is no such place .
We have not toiled and striven , fought wars and sacrificed family members for your vision of America , Congressman .
These actions and accomplishments have been undertaken for freedom , liberty , and the hope of never having an oppressive regime siphon these noble ideals from our minds .
The Republicans do n’t agree , apparently –they seem to be proposing just that .
A regime that only honors those that believe in their god , that only protects those that support them , and only cares only to put forward the values of their America–where hatred is good , and investigating anyone who is suspected of disagreeing with them is needed .
That is tyranny , it is not democracy .
That is a reversion back to Joe McCarthy , or , if they succeed where he failed , Joseph Stalin .
Here is proof of Congressman Hayes saying the disgusting words of hate and division :

An Anaheim police officer chasing burglary suspects shot and killed an innocent 20 - year - old man who heard a commotion and emerged from his house early Tuesday holding what authorities said was either a broomstick or a shower rod .
The officer encountered Julian Alexander on his front lawn and shot him twice in the chest about 1:30 a.m .
“ This is a very tragic situation , ” Anaheim Police Chief John Welter said at a news conference .
“ Julian Alexander was innocent of anything that was going on in the neighborhood at that time . ”
Paramedics treated Alexander at the scene in the 300 block of North Muller Street before taking him to a hospital , where he was pronounced dead .

Alexander ’s wife and mother - in - law said he went outside , believing that he heard possible intruders .
The women heard two gunshots and tried to run outside but were stopped by an officer .
From their window , they saw Alexander on the ground , handcuffed and bleeding .
“ He was a good kid , trying to protect his house , ” said Michelle Mooney , his mother - in - law .
“ And the police , instead of asking questions , they just shot first .
Somebody has to be held responsible for this . ”
The officer who shot Alexander was not identified and was placed on leave .
The shooting is being investigated by the Anaheim Police Department ’s office of independent review and the Orange County district attorney ’s office .
Relatives said police refused to let them see Alexander at UCI Medical Center .
Twenty - five family members met with Chief Welter throughout the day .

The shooting “ hit my family like a ton of bricks , ” said Henry Parks , a cousin of Alexander ’s wife .
“ I understand there has to be an investigation .
But it was apparent very early that Julian was innocent , and I would have expected the family would have been treated with gentler hands . ”
Alexander was married last week , and his wife , Renee , 19 , is expecting a baby girl in December , his family said .
He was a graduate of Notre Dame High School in Riverside , where he played football , and as a student worked in the commissary at March Air Reserve Base .
Alexander also volunteered as an usher and did charity work at his church , Willie Holmes Ministries in Fullerton , where his wife also is a volunteer .

Family and friends gathered to remember Alexander on the back patio of his home .
In front , they placed a board with pictures of him and his wife while balloons and flowers marked the spot where he was shot .
Most of the photos showed the tall , stocky man embracing his wife and smiling or making funny faces with her .
“ Julian , he ’s very caring and protective , ” said his father , Jerry Alexander , who drove to Anaheim from San Luis Obispo when he heard the news .
“ That ’s what he was doing .
He was protecting his family . ”

The investment group that had made its partners fabulously rich in private equity suddenly fancied some of the public 's cash .
Co-founder Stephen Schwarzman trousered half a billion dollars from the sale .
He was one of the smartest guys in the boom .
On day one , the shares closed at $ 35 .
Today , they are $ 5.50 .
The debt upon which the vast majority of private - equity deals depended has dried up .
It was , as Time magazine observed : " A classic case of selling at the top to the suckers , which would be us . "
( CNN ) --
The number of people worldwide without access to a toilet -- no public restroom , no outhouse , no latrine , no smallest room -- is a whopping 2.6 billion .
That 's four out of ten people .
The bucket toilet is the only thing on offer for millions of black South Africans .

According to the World Toilet Organization , 2.2 million people , predominantly children , die every year from diarrhea -- more than from malaria , from AIDS , from TB .
That number dwarfs any casualties related to violent conflict .
These figures are intrinsically related .
The underestimation of fecal contamination is staggering , sobering -- and unfortunately , silencing .
Singaporean social - entrepreneur Jack Sim founded the non-profit World Toilet Organization ( " the other WTO " ) in 2001 , as a support network for all existing organizations .
It now includes 151 members from 53 countries , which meet once a year to network , discuss sanitation issues and work together toward " eliminating the toilet taboo and delivering sustainable sanitation . "
Goal number one : Making sanitation speakable .
" What we do n't discuss , we can't improve , " insists Sim .
This year , the World Toilet Summit & Expo 2008 was held from November 4 - 6 in Macau under the theme " Driving Sustainable Sanitation through Market - Based Initiatives . "
Indeed , not only is sanitation a good idea , it 's a good investment .
Biosolids can be composted into fertilizer , sewage can be processed into methane biogas , and even simple latrines in India are producing compost and fertilizer .
" Globally , if universal sanitation were achieved by 2015 , it would cost $ 95 billion , but it would save $ 660 billion , " writes Rose George in her newly released book " The Big Necessity . "
Real - world examples follow : " When Peru had a cholera outbreak in 1991 , it cost $ 1 billion to contain but could have been prevented with $ 100 million of better sanitation measures . "
Or even more alarming : " Pakistan , for example , spends 47 times more on its military budget than on water and sanitation , though it loses 120,000 people to diarrhea a year . "
So while 2.6 billion people have no toilet , how many millions of us simply " flush and forget " ?
Eco-sanitation , or the problem of dealing efficiently and ecologically with sewer systems , wastewater , treatment and purification , is no less a serious one .
In the UK alone , the sewage system emits some 28.8 million tons of carbon dioxide a year .
As sewers become overloaded with urban development , drought strikes various regions of the earth , and potable water becomes increasingly scarce , even the flush toilet is now put into question .
Today , those who care are looking at innovative toilet and waste - disposal solutions from India , China and other parts of the developing world , where attitudes and habits are still evolving and open to change .
Do n't forget , World Toilet Day is November 19 .

The Army needs to add at least 30,000 active - duty soldiers to its ranks to fulfill its responsibilities around the world without becoming stretched dangerously thin , senior Army officials warn .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ You ca n’t do what we ’ve been tasked to do with the number of people we have , ” Undersecretary of the Army Nelson Ford said in an interview last week .
“ You can see a point where it ’s going to be very difficult to cope . ”
Already , the Army lacks a strategic reserve of brigades trained and ready for major combat , officials said , and units being deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan are receiving new soldiers at the last minute , meaning they have insufficient time to train together before crossing into the war zone .
But the demand for soldiers extends beyond those countries , with the Pentagon creating new missions that require troops trained in cyber - warfare , homeland defense , intelligence - gathering and other areas , Ford said .
“ We have five to 10 new missions , and we are already stretched now . ”
The Army is currently on track to grow to 547,000 active - duty soldiers next year , up from 482,000 before the war .
But Ford and other Army officials say that , with rising demand for ground troops for Afghanistan and other contingencies , the increase is insufficient .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
The world has lost almost one - fifth of its coral reefs according a new report released by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) .
Coral reefs could be wiped out in 30 - 40 years according to a new report .
Compiled by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network , the report has brought together the work of researchers from 15 countries with data stretching back 20 years .
It 's not just climate change -- which raises ocean temperatures and increases seawater acidification -- which is damaging reefs .
In some parts of the world overfishing , pollution and invasive species are proving equally harmful .
Scientists are warning that reef destruction will have alarming consequences for around 500 million people who rely on coral reefs for their livelihood .
Left unchecked , remaining reefs could be completely wiped out by 2050 , the report says .
Professor Olof Linden from the World Maritime University in Malmo , Sweden , told CNN : " We see a great and imminent threat of more reefs being lost . "
Speaking from the U.N. Climate Conference in Poznan , Poland , Professor Linden said that the 19 percent figure is an average .
" For many developing countries like Sri Lanka and countries in East Africa the percentage of damage is much worse .
Sometimes three times as high in some places , " he said .
" In these areas we have local effects like dynamite fishing and other destructive fishing techniques combined the threat of coral mining , unmanaged tourism and all kinds of pollution from agriculture . "
But overall the biggest threat to reef survival is climate change .
" The most destructive climate event to impact the coral reefs so far , " said Linden , " was the 1998 El Nino which caused major coral bleaching and disrupted ecosystems all over the planet . "
iReport.com :
What little things are you doing to save the planet ?
Scientists say reefs have recovered somewhat from those bleaching events .
But the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 , coupled with coral disease and human effects , have slowed their recuperation .
Coral reefs not only provide an income and food for those who live near them , but are also effective natural barriers against storm surges .
Despite the report 's pessimism , researchers see some encouraging signs .
Forty - five percent of the world 's reefs are currently in good health and the hope remains that damaged reefs can recover and adjust to the changing conditions .
" We must focus on helping corals to adapt to climate change and on diverting people away from destructive practices such as overfishing , " Linden said .

Paul Warburg was the inspiration for the Little Orphan Annie caricature called " Daddy Warbucks " .
It is said that at one point , he had control of 1 /4 of the world 's wealth .
Warburg handled the financial affairs of the Rothschilds as senior partner in Kuhn - Loeb & Company , which was one of the giant investment firms in New York .

Milk was gunned down by Dan White , who had served on the board with Milk and Feinstein .
White , an Irish Catholic former policeman and Vietnam vet , opposed Milk ’s equal rights initiatives for gays .
He resigned and immediately wanted his seat back , a move Milk helped persuade the mayor , George Moscone , to reject .
White climbed through a City Hall basement window with a loaded gun and shot down Moscone and then Milk .
( In the infamous “ Twinkie defense , ” White argued that junk food had left him stressed out . )
I asked Senator Feinstein , who became mayor after the tragedy , if she would see the movie .
“ It ’s very painful for me , ” she replied .
“ It took me seven years before I could sit in George Moscone ’s chair .
It took me a long time to talk about it .
I was only recently able to talk about it . ”
This month , gays who supported Barack Obama had the bittersweet experience of seeing some of the black and Latino voters who surged to the polls to vote Democratic also vote for Proposition 8 , which turned gay “ I dos ” into “ You can ’ts . ”
About 20,000 gay couples had exchanged vows before Prop 8 passed , backed by a coalition that included Mormon and Catholic opponents .
Now that donor information can be found on the Internet , gay activists have called for boycotts of anyone who contributed to the law ’s passing , from businesses small ( El Coyote restaurant in L.A. , where Sharon Tate had her last meal and Fabio and George Clooney nearly came to blows ) to large ( Utah ski resorts and Park City , Utah , theaters where Sundance movies are shown ) .

It ’s so intrinsic to the Constitution that you cannot remove it by a vote of the people . ”
Margaret Low Smith , vice president of National Public Radio , said NPR would remove “ The Infinite Mind ” from its satellite radio service next week , the earliest date possible .
Ms. Smith said that had NPR been aware of Dr. Goodwin ’s financial interests , it would not have broadcast the program .
Sarah Alspach , a spokeswoman for GlaxoSmithKline , said , “ We continue to believe that healthcare professionals are responsible for making disclosures to their employers and other entities , in this case National Public Radio and its listeners . ”
“ The Infinite Mind ” has won more than 60 journalism awards over 10 years and bills itself as “ public radio ’s most honored and listened to health and science program . ”
It has more than one million listeners in more than 300 radio markets .
Mr. Lichtenstein said that the last original program was broadcast in October , that reruns have been running since and that “ the show is going off the air . ”

The program has received major underwriting from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation , both of which have policies requiring grantees to disclose and manage conflicts of interest .
Mr. Grassley wrote letters to both agencies asking whether disclosure rules were followed for the grants .
Spokesmen for both agencies said they were cooperating with the investigation .
Mr. Grassley is systematically asking some of the nation ’s leading researchers and doctors to provide their conflict - of - interest disclosures , and he is comparing those documents with records of actual payments from drug companies .
The records often conflict , sometimes starkly .
In October , Mr. Grassley revealed that Dr. Charles B. Nemeroff of Emory University , an influential psychiatric researcher , earned more than $ 2.8 million in consulting arrangements with drugmakers from 2000 to 2007 , failed to report at least $ 1.2 million of that income to his university and violated federal research rules .
As a result , the National Institutes of Health suspended a $ 9.3 million research grant to Emory , and Dr. Nemeroff gave up his chairmanship of Emory ’s psychiatry department .
The Answers Are Out There
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
DIGG THIS
The answers for our nation ’s current woes are out there .
They may be a bit difficult to find , and challenging to implement , but they are there .
The immediate challenges that are being discussed today are :
To immediately implement a complete overhaul the nation ’s currency , banking , investment practices and regulations .
To produce low - cost energy ; reduce or eliminate pollution from fossil - powered energy plants .
To reduce dependency upon foreign oil imports by increasing the efficiency of gasoline - powered vehicles .
To reduce the cost of healthcare and to make health insurance affordable for all .
To create meaningful and substantial jobs for Americans .
First , with respect to the entire list above , libertarians would say that government needs to get out of the way and the bad parts of government need to be allowed to crash and burn , just like a forest fire purges old dead growth and brings about renewal .
Can anyone argue this now that America has destroyed itself from within better than any foreign enemy could imagine ?
Americans have a growing state of uneasiness as they see ahead to massive unemployment , crime , even hunger .
While the absence of government would likely bring anarchy and lawlessness , the current government appears to be spurring on just such a state of chaos .
It ’s obvious that the American people , schooled about the Constitution and the importance of limited government , in reality beg for more government to solve their problems .
Large industries lobby for federal control , using government guidelines and regulations to impede true competition and to mandate use of their products ( e.g. , vaccines ) and to rub out competitors ( e.g. , onerous requirements for underground fuel storage tanks which wiped out independent gas stations ) .
True competition in the marketplace often does n’t exist .
Point A : Banking and currency reform
In respect to point A , it is obvious that the fraudulent system of making fiat money and fractional banking must come to a halt , but it has continued to impoverish the American people for decades just as the Midianites ruined the Israelites long ago ( Bible , book of Judges 6 ) .
Where to look for a model of economic and currency reform ?
The Mises Institute serves as the think tank for financial reform , with books on Austrian economics by Rothbard and others as models .
A curriculum needs to be developed for American young people , possibly starting in grade school forward to college , to learn about money , its origins , banking , etc .
Funds need to be directed toward the writing of such a curriculum to be offered to schools .
Even college professors do n’t know where our money comes from .
Most professors should attend this class .
Online courses need to be offered .
Why wait for the school systems to implement such a course into their offerings which will likely be opposed by many forces ?
The blackballing of Austrian economics needs to stop .
It needs to be instilled into the American mindset .
Had Ron Paul been elected to the Presidency , the Mises Institute would have provided the direction for true reform of American government , including pulling the plug on most of it .
The printing of fiat money ( printed at the whim of government ) , backed by nothing but the full faith and credit of government , which is defined by its ability to just print more paper money to cover for its debts , must stop .
The idea of gold - backed currency has been advocated by many for years .
Mussolini printed Italian liras to fund WWII .
The Italians threw this worthless paper money into the streets of Rome like it was confetti when the war ended .
America is close to this same scenario now .
The idea that banks can just make money out of thin air by multiplying its cash reserves by 10 - fold , to create more money to loan , is sheer folly .
When a bank loans out $ 100,000 based on $ 10,000 of reserves , it created $ 90,000 of new money .
But it did n’t put new money into circulation to cover for the cost of the interest payments .
Eventually , a society using this type of banking system is playing musical chairs .
Somebody wo n’t be able to sit down in a chair when the music stops because there is n’t enough money in circulation to cover for the interest payments .
That is what is happening now .
Point B : Energy
With respect to point B , the nation is at a crisis point in regards to energy .
Go to China where industry there cannot obtain electricity more than three days a week .
This could be America soon .
The US is locked in a war between those who demand clean energy vs affordable energy .
Coal is polluting , obviously evidenced in China where mucky skies make it difficult to breathe .
The idea of President - elect Obama to subsidize wind power is misdirected , since there would never be any incentive to develop energy at a cost equal to or lower than coal .
Subsidized power just raises taxes .
Furthermore , wind power is not practical as constant winds of 11 — 13 miles an hour are needed for minimal energy production ( that ’s enough wind to unfurl a flag on a pole ) , and there is no current way to store this energy so it can be used during less windy times .
Even if more power can be generated , the nation ’s electric power transmission lines are not capable of delivering more power .
These transmission lines heat up and droop , causing them to touch trees which results in short outs , power outages , and even forest fires ( recent Orange County , California fires ) .
About 8 — 9 % of the electric power now generated from power plants is lost during transmission , which is about $ 30 billion of lost power in economic terms .
Enter private enterprise , not government .
New power cable technology ( Mercury Cable & Energy , Dana Point , CA ) is about to be introduced that almost eliminates power line loss , can transmit more than double the amount of power without line droop or heat induction .
The entire 350,000 miles of power transmission lines in the US could be replaced within 3 years , without expansion of the environment footprint ( it is strung on existing power lines and poles ) , and be completely self - funding ( costs ~ $ 80 billion to install , saves $ 30 billion a year ) .
The bonus : stringing new transmission lines would yield ~ 48,000 megawatts of newly available power without having to burn more fossil fuel , and would eliminate the need for ~ 97 new power plants .
Environmentalists should be pleased .
Will the Obama Administration make room for private enterprise to enter the scene , or is it over - committed to wind power generation ?
Point C : Dependency upon foreign oil
Within respect to C , about 70 % of fossil fuels are employed to power automobiles and trucks .
What is desperately needed has already been invented , and by none other than US car manufacturers .
It ’s just not available to US consumers because the federal government does n’t embrace diesel - powered vehicles .
The objection has been air pollution , which has now been conquered with new technology .
Ford Motors has a new 65 - mile - per - gallon diesel car that seats 5 people and is affordable .
It is going to be sold in Europe , but not America .
Such an automobile would cause oil - producing companies to shake in their boots .
If Detroit auto makers are bailed out of their financial crisis , will there be a demand to produce these cars and bring them to the US ?
Will the US government eliminate its burdensome tax on diesel fuel ?
This opportunity is in President - elect Obama ’s court .
His bully pulpit can bring about this change , simply by letting American free enterprise go to work , unhindered , and let it compete against the best foreign imports .
It has been estimated that vehicles that get 33 mpg would reduce America ’s oil demand by 500,000 barrels of oil per day in 2015 and 2.1 million barrels of oil per day by 2025 .
Just think of a 65 - mile - per - gallon car .
Think of the billions of dollars that would n’t be spent for gasoline that would be freed up to spur on the economy .
The air would be cleaner too .
Point D : healthcare reform
With respect to D , there is no way any developed country , especially one facing a growing population of retirees , can avert financial collapse of its healthcare system without improving the healthspan of its citizens .
The incidence of disease needs to decline .
Age - related disease needs to be slowed .
Japan does this by its traditional diet , characterized by less meat and dairy products , not by prescribing more medicines and performing more treatment .
The fodder Americans are being fed is breeding the diabesity epidemic .
Food producers like Americans to overeat .
Government subsidizes the cheap less - nutrient - dense foods and high - fructose sugars .
More health insurance just increases demand for care , more doctoring , more treatments , more hospitalizations .
Prevention is anathema to doctors .
All that the incoming Administration has promised is to introduce a program that ensures doctors and hospitals get paid for providing care to the uninsured ( many who can afford to buy private health insurance , but elect not to ) .
The lesser advantaged are now waiting for their free healthcare card so they can run to the doctor .
And there are n’t enough primary care doctors to meet the increased demand for care .
Government here ca n’t see that it needs to promote self - care .
If it does realize this , it will never get through the food , pharmaceutical , hospital , doctor - dominated National Institutes of Health , Food & Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control .
The American healthcare industrial complex has penetrated every area of healthcare with an agenda to over - vaccinate and over - medicate every citizen .
In reality , America does not have a health care system , it has a disease care system , and a medical factory line that practices little prevention and promotes more and more disease .
Once people enter the clutches of the health care system , the search for disease begins with mammograms , colonoscopies , stool tests , blood tests , CT scans , and the like , but no routine testing is performed for vitamin C , vitamin D , folic acid , vitamin B12 , red-cell magnesium , or essential oils .
Instead , drugs are prescribed that actually induce nutritional deficiencies , ensuring more chronic disease .
American free enterprise needs to step up to the plate and offer courses in self - care , education in the use of natural antibiotics , over - the - counter pain relievers , antidepressants , artery cleansers , even home cancer cures .
( Some which have been aired here at the Lew Rockwell website :
If President - elect Barack Obama wants change , he can set an example here and shun the trappings of modern health care unless it is absolutely needed and set an example by giving up his tobacco habit , and starting to take vitamin and mineral supplements , and advising the public to do the same .
Point E : employment
This article just described an invigoration of American free enterprise that would unleash millions of enterprising and hard - working Americans to rebuild America .
About 25 % of the American work force is now employed by government .
Fixing the employment problem by creating a national police force , federally funding more programs that build dependence upon more and more taxes , is folly .
This is the feather - bedding that America used to criticize Russia of practicing .
When government manipulates the job market it often creates phony , meaningless jobs .
Money has n’t fixed inner-city schooling or made Americans any healthier .
It wo n’t fix the job market either because you end up with the few paying more taxes to support jobs for the masses .
Then any cutback in taxes means people must be dismissed from their jobs .
It ’s a vicious circle .
Let private enterprise hire a minority woman with four kids to feed .
Then she is not forever on the back of the taxpayers .
Finally , one reason why you see the Lew Rockwell website take a strong position against war - making is that it economically burdens the country .
Someone has said that for a country that is n’t at war , the unemployment rate is about 25 % .
The ancient Egyptians at least figured a way around this , and employed their slave classes to build temples and pyramids .
But these again were meaningless jobs .
But at least war was averted .
War is the politicians ’ way to cover for a bad economy .
It has been employed by leaders since time immemorial .
The Germans in the 1930s were ready for more bread lines when Hitler drummed up nationalism and the need to conquer other lands .
The warmonger unites the masses in fervent nation pride , temporarily giving the masses jobs , but distracting from the real tasks of government .
Americans hear of military cutbacks as if troops in the field will be at greater risk .
The federal government hides the fact that ~ 51 % of the annual federal budget goes toward making war .
This produces a false economy , making weapons , jeeps , war vehicles , army boots .
Then the economy depends upon endless war for endless employment .
The war budget is robbing America ’s future .
Whatever Medicare and Social Security have promised ( there will be a $ 75 trillion shortfall in these programs as the Baby Boomers enter their retirement years ) , military spending has taken away .
Our children ’s future has been taken away .
The phony wars ( can you recall a recent war the US really needed to enter ? ) , and the fabrications for war ( weapons of mass destruction ) will continue as long as Americans are gullible to fake villains ( Osama ’s , Al Qaeda ’s ) and contrived war triggering events ( Pearl Harbor , 9 - 11 ) , and willingness to work for , and die for , the war establishment that President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned Americans about .
Yes , there will be lots of temporary unemployment as troops come home from the war fronts , but there is a lot of work to do at home .
America must shed its dependence upon war to fix its economy , and to cover for the lack of proper governance by its leaders .
Our tired and worn out republic needs more than a tire change .
It needs to re-invent itself in the traditions that founded the country , freedom from over - taxation , limited government , right to defend ourselves , the Judeo - Christian work ethic , freedom of worship without a state religion , free enterprise , and the right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - The U.S. plan for the emerging field of nanotechnology lacks vision , fails to assess risk and leaves the industry vulnerable to public mistrust , the National Research Council said in a report released on Wednesday .
A fullerene or " buckyball " molecule with noble gas trapped inside is shown in this undated artist concept handout image .

The report found serious gaps in the government ’s plan for determining if there are risks posed by nanomaterials and called for an effective national plan for identifying and managing potential risks .
Nanotechnology , the design and manipulation of materials thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair , has been hailed as a way to make strong , lightweight materials , better cosmetics and even tastier food .
But scientists are only starting to look at the impact such tiny objects may have .
Some studies suggest nano - sized objects may have different effects in the body than larger ones .
“ The current plan catalogs nano - risk research across several federal agencies , but it does not present an overarching research strategy needed to gain public acceptance and realize the promise of nanotechnology , ” said David Eaton , chairman of the council ’s committee that produced the report and a public health expert at the University of Washington in Seattle .
Currently , more than 600 products involving nanomaterials are already on the market .
Most are health and beauty products , but many researchers are working on ways to use the materials for medical therapies , food additives and electronics .
The committee said the current U.S. strategy , developed by the National Nanotechnology Initiative , did not provide for adequate research to ensure the safety of workers , consumers and the environment from unexpected and possibly toxic properties of these materials .
LACKING VISION
The report said the plan lacked vision , clear objectives , a comprehensive assessment of the state of the science , and a “ road map that describes how research progress will be measured and the estimated resources required to conduct such research . ”
Rep. Bart Gordon , chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Science and Technology , said he shared many concerns raised by the report and intended to reintroduce a bill to bolster research efforts in the next Congress .
David Rejeski , director of the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies , an advocacy group , said the report echoed calls by industry and congressional leaders for a revamped research plan for nanotechnology .
“ The administration ’s delay has hurt investor and consumer confidence , ” Rejeski said in a statement .
“ It has gambled with public health and safety . ”
German chemicals group BASF joined DuPont , the American Chemical Council and other industry groups in support of the National Research Council ’s findings .
Raymond David , North American manager of toxicology for BASF , said there has been “ an explosion ” of scientific studies exploring the risks of nanotechnology but the research has suffered from a lack of coordination .
He said the European Union had a framework for identifying specific safety issues to be addressed .
“ In the United States , we have not done that , ” he said .
The National Research Council is one of the National Academy of Sciences , an independent organization that guides the government on medical , scientific and engineering policy .
For better or worse , Aaron Heilman is no longer a New York Met .
And , according to Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports , all we have to show for it is J.J. Putz :
Putz is a big addition and fresh face for the Mets bullpen .
He gives the Mets a strong reliever and backup plan for the closer 's role .
And the pressure of a comeback from an injury - ridden 2008 is less since Putz will initially serve as a set - up man , not a closer .
BUT ... did the Mets pay too much ?
Heilman 's value was pennies on the dollar and his former # 1 draft pick potential has long since been exhausted .
Joe Smith was a right - handed specialist reliever and , although effective , is replaceable .
Mike Carp was n't exactly making Carlos Delgado quiver in fear for his job security .
No huge losses there .
Endy ... do n't let anyone tell you that Jeremy Reed is a replacement for Chavez in the outfield .
He 's not .
His defense does n't come anywhere close .
The bats are a push ( they both wo n't blow you away with their offense ) , but that 's a downgrade on the Mets part .
At the end of Wednesday , the Mets have a closer and a reliever who can get batters on both sides of the plate out .
It 's felt like forever since I 've been able to say that .
Win , win .
Keep it up , Minaya .
A highway superintendent from a town in Westchester turned down a $ 25,000 pay raise because he did n’t feel right taking the money in this terrible economy .
Eric DiBartolo , 47 , of Yorktown , said that his conscience would n’t let him take the boost to his own bottom line when so many people around the area are suffering financially .
“ I took a deep breath and said , ‘ Is it really the right message for me to send ?
With things so tough , with people losing their jobs , I ’m taking $ 25,000 ? ’ ” he told The Post .
“ So I made the decision . ”
DiBartolo , a Yorktown native , was last year given a salary of $ 125,000 after town officials decided to expand his duties to include not just the maintenance of the roadways but of the town ’s parks and public buildings , too .
He said that under his deal for the new executive position , he was promised a raise up to $ 150,000 if he did a good job .
In the last year , he managed to streamline operations , saving Yorktown nearly $ 1 million .
That performance earned him the money , but he decided things had changed in the past year .
“ I reached out to the supervisor and said , ‘ I ’m not going to take it , ’ ” he said .
“ As much as I could use the money , I ’m just not going to take it , just because of the message it sends , ” he added .
“ That $ 25,000 may be able to save somebody ’s job from a layoff next year . ”
After DiBartolo ’s move , the town ’s supervisor and clerk and four board members also agreed to turn down 3 percent pay raises they were due .
According to The Journal News , this saved the town another $ 8,000 .
“ It ’s not about the money , ” Councilman Lou Campisi said .
“ It ’s a message that we want to send out to the people to say , ‘ Look , we understand what people are going through . ’ ”
A local Yorktown tax watchdog hailed the decision .
“ I think Eric is doing a good job and could probably use the money , ” Ed Ciffone , of the United Taxpayers of Yorktown , told the paper .
“ He saved us a lot of money . ”
DiBartolo said some people were incredulous .
“ Some people said , ‘ You ’re crazy .
Take the money . ’
But I think I ’m just doing the right thing for the right reason , and I believe it comes back to you . ”
The married DiBartolo , who has no kids but does have a dog , said he has not caught any flack at home for his decision .
“ My dog is perfectly happy with it , and my wife supports what I do , ” he said .

A combination of hype , release across multiple platforms , and , of course , a good game has led to a very successful launch for Fallout 3 .
Bethesda has announced that the game has shipped a total of 4.7 million units across the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , and PC .
Assuming those units all result in sales , that 's a haul of $ 300 million at retail .
The game launched across various territories at the end of October , though it still has yet to launch in Japan and will not be available in India .
Fallout 3 has also seen a significant leap in sales compared to Bethesda 's last game , The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion .
In fact , the first - week sales of Fallout were 57 percent higher then those of Oblivion .
What 's most impressive is that Fallout was able to be so successful in spite of a number of complications with both ratings systems and piracy .
Now we 'll just wait and see if Bethesda 's next game can continue this forward momentum .
BUTCH : The outlaw's mum emigrated from Tyneside
The notorious robber ’s links to Newcastle were unearthed by local researcher Mike Bell , who since seeing the film Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid as a teenager , has devoted his time to studying his hero .
After travelling the Americas on the trail of the leader of the Hole In The Wall Gang , he was astonished to learn that Cassidy ’s mother was born in Brandling Village , Jesmond , Newcastle .
Mike said : “ When I found out that Butch Cassidy ’s mum was a Geordie , I was gobsmacked .
“ I have travelled from Utah to Argentina , looking for information about him .
“ All the time the house where his mother once lived was around the corner . ”
Mike , who is West Midlands area director for the Learning and Skills Council , made the discovery when the 1851 census was released online in 2006 .
But he wanted to wait until 2008 – the 100th anniversary of Butch Cassidy ’s death in a shoot - out in November 1908 , in the Bolivian village of San Vicente – to make his origins known .
Butch was born Robert Leroy Parker , in Utah , in 1866 .
His parents were Maximilian Parker and Ann Sinclair Gillies , born in Newcastle in 1849 .
Ann was the daughter of Robert Gillies and Jane Sinclair , both from Stirlingshire .
The 1851 census shows the Gillies family living in Brandling Village , Jesmond .
There were three Gillies children – eldest boy John who was born in Scotland , Ann and her younger brother , Daniel , who was also born in Newcastle about 1850 .
The family may have lived on Tyneside for nearly 10 years , but by 1856 they were on their way to New York .
From there they made their way to Utah , where Ann met Maximilian .
Their first son , Robert ( Butch ) was born the year after they married .
Researcher Mike , 52 , first became hooked on Butch Cassidy after watching the 1969 film starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford .
Mike said : “ I knew nothing about Butch Cassidy and I started to read about him .
“ Over the next 30 years , it became something of an obsession and I have travelled to North and South America .
“ I visited the cabin in Utah where Butch was born and I followed parts of the cowboy trail from Canada to Mexico , and Argentina . ”
So what is it about Butch Cassidy that made him stand out ?
Mike , who now lives with his wife and seven - year - old daughter in Birmingham , said : “ Butch is described by those who knew him as a nice guy .

The Easiest Way To Create Amazing Online Invitations !
Curious just how easy it is ?
Click the button below to find out !
The United States calls itself the land of the free , but you ’d never know it from looking at our justice system .
In fact , even a cursory review of the direction of our dollars will make any reasonable person wonder what this nation ’s goals are for incarceration .
To resolve our great economic , environmental , and psychological woes – to shake out systemic ecological ills – will take an empowered , educated nation .
I do n’t know if the question is “ Can Obama do it ? ” so much as “ Will we remember that we can ? ”
Like many of you , I ’m very hopeful that we can draw upon our strengths and work together to implement meaningful changes in the coming months and years – before it ’s too late .
The prison system is yet another illustrative example of why we must rethink our priorities .
For every U.S. dollar spent on higher education , 60 cents are spent on corrections .
We have the highest number of prisoners per capita ( 1 in 140 ) , and the absolute highest number of people behind bars in the world ( over 2 million people ) .
With over 2 million Americans in jail or prison , we ’re half a million ahead of China , whose population is quadruple ours .
Supersize it !
Not exactly # 1 .
For being the most prosperous country in the world , education spending in the United States ranks a paltry # 38 in the entire world , lagging far behind Jamaica , Denmark and Cuba … which holds the top spot .
Yes , Cuba .
And who are these heinous criminals anyway ?
One fifth of prisoners are locked up for non-violent personal drug charges .
Incarceration is frequently for marijuana or painkiller use ; if that seems arbitrary , you ’re not alone in being confused .
( We do n’t seem to learn from our mistakes , however .
Remember Prohibition ? )
It costs between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000 per person , per year to keep someone behind bars , and about $ 65,000 for senior citizens .
You could easily send a few deserving kids to state college for that much money .
You can bet someone is making money off of this : our government contracts management of prisons to private corporations .
Corporations need to turn a profit , and the more prisoners they have , the more money they ’ll get .
It ’s big business .
It only makes sense that prisoners receiving education behind bars are less likely to return to a life of crime upon release .
Why not spend more on education in the first place ?
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure .
We have some big choices to make as a country : it ’s clear that education can help to prevent an individual from entering a life of crime .
It ’s also clear that non-violent drug charges have imprisoned a great many Americans at high taxpayer cost , and the War On Drugs has long been considered a failure .
What is the real purpose of prisons anyway : containment , rehabilitation or profit ?
Editor ’s note :
What are your thoughts regarding this information ?
What changes would you like to see enacted ?
At EcoSalon , we believe that living green is part and parcel of a larger cause : one that champions ecological wellness in its full meaning , seeking to integrate all the different aspects of life into a sustainable , thriving whole .
Last weekend ’s shopping trip , tomorrow ’s dinner , today ’s interactions with others – “ going green ” is just one function of being in balance .
Ecological sustainability requires that we always seek to examine purpose .
And that ’s why , when we learn information like this , we believe it is vital to bring it into the conversation .

In my last post on F# I mentioned thatcaused a space leak , and that the programmer should have written .
I also proposed that monadic statements should work more like in F# where non -unit return values can't be ignored .
Various people seemed to misunderstand both points , so I thought I 'd elaborate .
First , I should clarify what I understand as a space leak .
A space leak is not a memory leak in the C sense .
A space leak is when a computation retains more live memory than necessary for some period of time .
One sign of a possible space leak is that lots of memory is retained by garbage collection .
Comparingandon the following program : Thevariant has a maximum heap residency of 2Kb , while thevariant has 226Kb .
Given an input list of length , the residency ofis , whileisThe exact reasons for the space leak are quite detailed , and I 'm not going to attempt to cover them .
My intuition is that the return list is wrapped in the IO monad , and therefore can't be deallocated until the IO action finishes .
In summary , unless you are going to use the end result of a monadic map , always useIn the above example it would be nice if the compiler had complained .
You generated a value , but you did n't use it .
Fortunately , it is a very easy fix - change the type of monadic bindto .
Now , if a monadic statement generates a value that is n't , you get a type error .
The above examples withwould be rejected by the type checker .
But what if we really wanted to call ?
There are two options .
The first is to bind the result , for example .
The second option , which F# favours , is , with the auxiliary .
I prefer the second option , as it clearly states that you want to ignore the result of a computation .
You could even write a rule
TBLISI , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Russian forces launched an airstrike against a military airfield near the Tbilisi International Airport early Sunday , despite international calls for Russia to stand down from the escalating conflict , Georgian officials told CNN .
The attack near the Georgian capital city came after a day of intense fighting in the former Soviet republic , with dozens of Russian warplanes bombing civilian and military targets in Georgia on Saturday .
As many as 2,000 people had been killed in the capital of separatist Georgian province South Ossetia , according to a Russian ambassador .
" The city of Tskhinvali no longer exists .
There is nothing left .
It was wiped out by the Georgian military , " the Russian news agency Interfax said , quoting the Russian ambassador to Georgia , Vyacheslav Kovalenko .
Tskhinvali residents who survived the bombardment by hiding in basements and later fled the city estimated that hundreds of civilians had died .
They said bodies were everywhere , according to The Associated Press .
CNN could not independently confirm any death tolls , which varied greatly depending on the source .
Alexander Lomaia , secretary of Georgia 's National Security Council , said dozens of Georgian troops had lost their lives .
Watch Georgian minister describe fighting in South Ossetia »
" Our losses are mounting ... as many as 40 military servicemen killed and over 100 wounded , " he said .
" The losses are also mounting among civilian population in the cities . "
Lomaia said Georgian troops in Tskhinvali were engaged in fierce ground battles on Saturday with Russian troops , whom he said were engaged in a full - scale military operation .
The operation included tanks , armored vehicles , heavy artillery , soldiers and paratroopers , Lomaia said .
Military aircraft were crossing the Georgian border about every 15 minutes , he said , hitting civilian , economic and military targets .
He said that at least 50 military jets were being used .

" Frankly , we have not expected the Russian invaders to hit our residential buildings , to hit our peaceful cities , to hit our peaceful citizens , " he said .
He said he could n't confirm whether Georgia 's capital , Tbilisi , had been hit .
" From the legal point of view , our actions are absolutely justified and legitimate , " Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in Vladikavkaz , the capital of the Russian region of North Ossetia .
" Moreover , they are necessary . "
He arrived in the region that borders South Ossetia on Saturday night .
Putin 's press secretary told Interfax that the premier was concerned about the flood of refugees arriving in Russia from South Ossetia .
Russian officials said that more than 30,000 refugees have left South Ossetia and crossed into Russia over the past two days , Interfax reported .
" The actions of the Georgian authorities in South Ossetia are a crime , of course , primarily a crime against their own people , " Putin said .
" This aggression led to numerous casualties , among civilians in particular , and virtually caused a real humanitarian catastrophe .
And that is already a crime against the Ossetian people , " he said .
" At the same time I would like to stress that Georgia has always been greatly respected in Russia and Georgians regarded as brotherly people , " the premier said .
Russians struck several major targets Saturday , including the Black Sea port of Poti , an airport , a major pipeline and a military base and train station in Senaki in western Georgia , Lomaia said .
Georgian officials said that a center housing civilians had also been hit .
Eight Georgians died in the port town , Georgian officials said .
The Kodori Gorge in upper Abkhazia -- a second breakaway province in Georgia -- was also bombarded by at least 12 Russian jets , Lomaia said .
Georgia 's public television station reported a second round of bombings in Abkhazia at just before 11:30 p.m .
Military bases at Vaziani and Marneuli also came under attack , the British Foreign Office said , and Russian aircraft bombed the Georgian town of Gori , about 35 miles northwest of Tbilisi , Georgian officials said .
An Associated Press reporter who visited Gori shortly after the Russian airstrikes Saturday saw several apartment buildings in ruins , some still on fire , and scores of dead bodies and bloodied civilians .
The elderly , women and children were among the victims .
A Russian naval fleet was anchored in the Black Sea port of Ochamchire in Abkhazia province , Lomaia added .
" We have managed to down 10 Russian jets , and one of the pilots has been captured alive and is being treated in a military hospital , " Lomaia said .
" We have also destroyed up to 30 Russian tanks and heavy military [ vehicles ] . "
The situation in South Ossetia escalated rapidly from Thursday night , when Georgia said it had launched an operation into the region after its unilateral cease - fire was met with artillery fire from separatists that killed 10 people , including peacekeepers and civilians .
It accused Russia of backing the separatists .
Russian tanks began rolling into Georgia on Thursday night .
On Saturday , the Georgian parliament approved President Mikhail Saakashvili 's request to impose a " state of war " for 15 days , officials said .
The order is not a formal declaration of war and stops short of declaring martial law , according to Georgian officials .
It gives Saakashvili powers he would not ordinarily have , such as issuing curfews , restricting the movement of people or limiting commercial activities , those officials said .
Saakashvili asked Western leaders to pressure Russia to agree to an immediate cease - fire .
" We are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers , which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences , " Saakashvili said Saturday afternoon .
U.S. President Bush , speaking from Beijing , China , called for an immediate halt to the violence , a stand - down by all troops and an end to the Russian bombings .
He urged the sides to return to " the status quo of August the 6th . "
Watch Bush express concerns over situation »
" The attacks are occurring in regions of Georgia far from the zone of conflict in South Ossetia .
They mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis , " Bush said in a statement while attending the Olympic Games , according to The Associated Press .
Bush spoke Saturday evening to Saakashvili and Russian President Medvedev , a White House spokesman said .
The war , Saakashvili said , " is not about South Ossetia .
It has never been in the first place .
It is about destroying a small democratic nation aspiring to live in peace , freedom and liberty . "
" This unprovoked , long - time - ago - planned invasion and aggression must stop , " he said .
It was unclear which side controlled Tskhinvali on Saturday .
The Georgians said fighting raged , but the Russians said they had " liberated " the city .
" Battalion task forces have fully liberated Tskhinvali of Georgian armed forces and started pushing Georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces , " General Vladimir Boldyrev , commander of the Russian Ground Forces , told Interfax .
Colonel - General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry , said that Georgians had shot down two Russian aircraft , contradicting Georgian claims .
Georgia , a pro-Western ally of the United States , is intent on asserting its authority over South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Both have strong Russian - backed separatist movements .
Inside South Ossetia , civilians have been without water , electricity and basic services for more than a day , said Maia Kardava , a Red Cross spokeswoman in Tbilisi .
She said the Red Cross was unable to reach colleagues based in Tskhinvali because their phones had lost power and they were huddled in bomb shelters .

The original version of “ The Day the Earth Stood Still ” is to this day considered a science - fiction classic ; it is both a compelling tale of alien invasion that bypasses the genre ’s conventions and a timely call for more circumspect use of nuclear warheads ( and the rhetoric they inspire ) .
The good news is that you can pick up that version of the movie in stores today .
The bad news is that the entirely unnecessary and unremarkable remake hits theaters today .
U.S. military freaks out , shooting him after he exits his spherical spacecraft ; a team of doctors and scientists must nurse him back to health .
One of those scientists is John Cleese .
You could do worse than using the ex-Monty Python funnyman as the symbol for all that ’s good about human society , but why waste one of the world ’s foremost dry wits as a straight - man professor ?
He does n’t have to smash a dead parrot over his head , but please , give him something funny with which to work .
Mr. Cleese is n’t the only miscast actor in this movie ; Anakin Skywalker in “ The Phantom Menace ”
He is precocious , annoying and whiny ; this is a major step backward for the young actor , who was quite good in “ Pursuit of Happyness . ”
Mr. Reeves , on the other hand , is perfectly cast .
Blank , semirobotic stare ?
Check .
Flat , monotone vocal inflections ?
Check .
Awkward head cocks as he processes information ?
Check .
He was born to play the part of an alien in human skin .
The message of “ The Day the Earth Stood Still ” is vaguely insidious when it ’s not downright idiotic .
In the original , an advanced alien race came to tell humanity to stop testing nuclear weapons because the radiation was escaping the atmosphere and harming far - away civilizations .
This makes sense ; Klaatu ’s actions could be interpreted as a form of self - defense .
In the remake , however , Klaatu is little more than some sort of intergalactic bureaucrat , traveling the galaxy to planets ( like Earth ) that can sustain life and deciding whether the dominant species ( like humanity ) can be trusted not to destroy it .
He ’s the neocon of the environmentalist set , pre-emptively eliminating threats to the environment before they can cause too much damage .
Or some such nonsense .
Saving the Earth , however , appears to entail shutting down or destroying man ’s capacity to produce energy :
This is the insidious part .
If Klaatu and the environmentalists really want to stop wars , making energy ( and , as a result , food ) impossible to produce will do little to achieve that end .
Millions ( if not billions ) would die as a result of the famine wars that followed Klaatu ’s visit .
Poverty would be rampant , disease would spread , and despair would follow .
But hey , they stopped all that nasty polluting , right ?

The Department of Justice ( DOJ ) should cut off outreach efforts with organizations linked to the Muslim Brotherhood or other Islamist extremist groups , a report from a ranking Senate subcommittee member recommends .
" Justice Denied : Waste & Mismanagement at the Department of Justice , " is an 86 - page report issued in October by the office of U.S. Sen .
Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) , the ranking Republican on the Senate Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management , Government Information , Federal Services , and International Security .
The report generated attention for its criticism of the millions of dollars spent annually to send DOJ officials on junkets in luxury resorts such as Palm Springs , Cal. and Hawaii .
And it noted that law enforcement officials routinely advise Hollywood producers in television and film projects without seeking compensation for their agencies .
But just as important is its detailing of DOJ outreach with questionable Islamist organizations , including two which are unindicted co-conspirators in a major Hamas support investigation .
Those efforts should stop , the report said :
" It is the legal right and obligation of DOJ to bar , withhold or rescind funding for or collaboration with any entities that do not advance the mission of the Department , which is the security and stability of the United States , including its culture , its people , and its form of government . "
In a letter contained in the report , Coburn said the investigation was not meant to target DOJ employees , but rather to identify problems for Department leaders to address :
" This report highlights numerous instances of millions of taxpayer dollars thrown at duplicative programs marred by waste , abuse , and lack of accountability .
If this problem is ignored , the safety of our nation will be placed further in serious peril as we continue to spend recklessly without demanding results , while failing to support programs with demonstrated and effective outcomes . "
Coburn has been focused on issues of Islamist outreach .
In July , he and Arizona U.S. Sen .
Jon Kyl wrote to Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice , asking that State set a deadline for cutting off funding to organizations with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood .
The letter also asked that procedures be created to prevent future funding of such groups .
In 2007 , Coburn pushed an amendment to the FY 2008 Commerce , Justice and Science Appropriations bill which barred DOJ from underwriting any conferences with organizations identified " as an unindicted co-conspirator by the federal government in any criminal prosecution . "
The Senate passed the provision but when the Senate and House of Representatives met to create one final bill , it was taken out .
The Coburn report on DOJ singles out the Islamic Society of North America ( ISNA ) and the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) .
Both are unindicted co-conspirators in the Hamas support trial of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development ( HLF ) and five former officials .
CAIR and ISNA appear in prosecution exhibits involving the Palestine Committee , a group created by the Muslim Brotherhood to help Hamas .
CAIR actually is listed as a committee member , as are the group 's co-founders Nihad Awad and Omar Ahmad .
ISNA is listed among friendly organizations .
The report notes what it calls an " alarming " agenda for the Muslim Brotherhood in the U.S.
It was written by another Palestine Committee member , Mohamed Akram , in 1991 in a document called " the General Strategic Goal for the Group In North America . "
In the memo , Akram defined the group 's role in America as " a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘ sabotaging ' its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God 's religion is made victorious over all other religions . "
CAIR officials appear in other exhibits , adding to the concern , the report said :
" According to court documents , CAIR chairman Omar Ahmad mediated a financial dispute involving the HLF over funding for Hamas founder Sheik Jamil Hamami .
CAIR was co-founded by Rafeeq Jaber who was also the president of the American Muslim Society , a group listed in the aforementioned Muslim Brotherhood memorandum to carry out the ' civilization jihad ' against the U.S. Despite these concerns , DOJ has funded and supported CAIR on a number of occasions ... "
DOJ 's involvement with ISNA was deeper , including its 2007 co-sponsorship of ISNA 's national convention .
DOJ participated over the objections of some of its own lawyers , the report said .
The Labor Day weekend gathering came just a few months after the release of the HLF unindicted co-conspirator list that includes ISNA .
DOJ has declined to disclose how much the sponsorship cost .
It does acknowledge having staff present at informational booths at past ISNA conventions .
It cited an e-mail from Susana Lorenzo - Giguere , acting deputy chief of DOJ's Voting Rights Division , who touted the event as " an important outreach opportunity , and a chance to reach a community that is at once very much discriminated against , and very wary of the national government and its willingness to protect them . "
Participating in the convention represented " a great step forward to break through those barriers .
And Chicago is lovely this time of year , " Lorenzo - Giguere wrote .
But the report notes DOJ officials put themselves in an awkward position in participating in a convention in which one session was entitled " Ending U.S. Sponsored Torture : A Concern for All People of Faith : "
" The Justice Department is responsible for enforcing the federal law against torture and for signing off on the legality and constitutionality of interrogation techniques , and yet the Department sponsored an event that was accusing the U.S. of having an official government policy of abuse and ‘ sponsored torture . ' "
The report notes that DOJ stayed away from ISNA 's 2008 convention .
DOJ has not responded to the recommendations concerning Islamist outreach efforts .

The souped - up , tricked - out Super CC " Eco Performance " concept Volkswagen brought to the big SEMA auto trade show this year highlights the automaker 's commitment to sleek , understated design , but what 's really cool is it 's more powerful and more fuel efficient than the production car it 's based on .
While the turbocharged CC Eco is n’t quite ready to be smogged and registered , everything from its design to its drivetrain to its fuel economy – as high as 27 mpg around town in " eco mode " – screams “ road ready , ” and we 're ready to put one in the Autopia Fantasy Garage .
More details and pix ...
Volkswagen started with a box - stock CC and tweaked the body with black chrome accents , different bumpers , an aluminum spoiler and 20 - inch wheels to give the CC Eco the look of a whole new machine .
Having kept the bodywork understated , the gearheads at VW 's So - Cal design center went nuts under the hood .
They gave the 2.0 - liter TSI engine an APR Stage 3
turbocharger system with three performance modes – performance , GT
and eco — and a stainless - steel APR exhaust system .
The mods provide an impressive 311 horsepower and 313 pound - feet of torque in performance mode .
Eco mode is good for 222 horsepower and 236 pound - feet while still returning 33 mpg on the highway and 27 mpg in the city .
That 's up from the stock 2.0 - liter turbo's 197 horsepower and 28/19 mpg fuel economy .
The CC Eco gets 14 - inch Brembo brakes with big honkin ' calipers and cross - drilled rotors to rein in the ponies .
No show car worth the name rides on a stock suspension , so VW slapped some H&R coilovers on the Eco .
No doubt the folks at the VW
Design Center had a ball testing the car before sending it to Vegas for the show .
We ’re glad to see that VW tricking out its production rides .
Now if we could just get it to bring us that sweet plug - in hybrid it is working on ...
Photos by Volkswagen .
We have no idea why VW did n't release any photos of the engine or suspension .
But there you have it .
UNDER FIRE : Former MP Ron Davies
Town hall bosses said that the term suggested a “ false sense of unity ” and could upset those from Scotland , Wales and Ireland as well as members of ethnic minorities .
The document warns about using the word “ British ” alongside other offensive terms such as “ negro ” , “ spastic ” and “ half - caste ” .
The advice , presented to 9,000 staff at Caerphilly Council in South Wales , is contained in a training booklet about equality offering tips on communicating with the public .
Critics have blasted the idea as completely unacceptable .
Welsh rugby legend Gareth Edwards said : “ This is political correctness gone absolutely mad .
“ I ’m very proud to be Welsh and if anybody asks me where I ’m from , I ’ll say Wales .
It is utter nonsense to ban staff from using the word British .
Lance Corporal Connick
“ But I ’m also British and I ’ve played for the British Lions and I ’m very proud of that as well .
I have no issue with being called British . ”
Falklands veteran Simon Weston , who was born in Caerphilly , said : “ I am proud to call myself a British Welshman .
“ I just do not know what is going on with Caerphilly Council but guidelines like this are simply ludicrous .
Since when was calling someone British offensive ?
We are British , that is the simple fact of the matter and whatever is done to try to break us up we have survived .
“ Welsh soldiers , no matter what regiment they are in , are members of the British Army and they are very proud of that fact . ”
Falklands hero Denzil Connick , 51 , who lives within the council ’s jurisdiction , blasted the ban as “ utter nonsense ” .
Lance Corporal Connick , who lost a leg in the conflict , said : “ I always refer to myself as Welsh - British .
I have my Welsh heritage but I am proud to be British .
“ It is utter nonsense to ban staff from using the word British . ” Philip Davies , Tory MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire , said he could not understand what was to be gained from such an initiative .
He added : “ The term British is a unifying term not a divisive one and we ought to be promoting the idea of everybody feeling British rather than looking for reasons to drive us apart . ”
Mr Davies said he thought that the council ’s “ priority ought to be improving services and keeping council tax bills down ” .
The guide was compiled by the independent Valleys Race Equality Council directed by shamed former Caerphilly MP Ron Davies .
The book said that “ many Scots , Welsh and Irish resist being called British ” .
It added that people from ethnic minorities should be called “ British Asians ” or “ Chinese British ” .
Mr Davies , who resigned from his post as Secretary of State for Wales in 1998 after being mugged at a notorious gay cruising spot on Clapham Common , south London , defended the leaflet .
“ It ’s just for information , there ’s no advice or instruction , ” said Mr Davies , who is an Independent cabinet member on the council .
“ Of this council ’s employees , 3,900 describe themselves as white British , whereas 5,400 describe themselves as white Welsh .
So this information is very much in accordance with the way that people in Caerphilly identify themselves . ”
WASHINGTON : The United States and India face tactics bordering on blackmail from a militarized Pakistan - where civilian control is still very dodgy - as they coordinate efforts to eliminate terrorism in the region , according to analysts and officials on both sides .
In what is turning out to be an elaborate chess game in the region , Islamabad on Saturday made its " Afghan move " to counter the US - India pincer , telling Washington that it will have to withdraw some 100,000 Pakistani troops posted on its western borders to fight the al - Qaida - Taliban and move them east to the Indian front if New Delhi makes any aggressive moves .
In Washington , Pakistan 's ambassador to the US Hussain Haqqani said there is no movement of Pakistani troops right now , but if India makes any aggressive moves , " Pakistan will have no choice but to take appropriate measures . "
Stripped of complexities , Pakistan is conveying the following message to the US :
If you do n't get India to back down , Pakistan will stop cooperating with US in the war against terror .
Consequently , this also means Pakistan will use US dependence on its cooperation to wage a low - grade , asymmetric , terrorism - backed war against India .
Pakistan 's withdrawal of troops from the Afghan front would obviously undermine the US / Nato battle in Afghanistan and allow breathing space for Taliban and al - Qaida .
It would also ratchet up confrontation with India , which is at low ebb right now because Islamabad has been forced to engage on its western front and this minimizes Pakistan - backed infiltration into Kashmir , allowing India to tackle the insurgency in the state .
In fact , some experts surmise that the terror strike on Mumbai may have been aimed at precisely this - taking the pressure off Pakistan on its Afghan front , where it is getting a battering from US predators and causing a civilian uprising on its border , and allowing Islamabad to return to its traditional hostile posture against India on its eastern front .
The US - India - Pakistan tangle was the subject of intense debate among analysts on Sunday talk shows , with some analysts like former CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin expressing apprehension that al - Qaida could be achieving its objective of getting some relief through such proxy attacks .
Vexed US officials have been in constant communication with their Indian counterparts to deal with the complex situation arising from what both sides privately agree has become a chaotic country dominated by rogue elements from its military and intelligence services .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has been speaking with India 's External Affairs Minister regularly to get a sense of India 's mood and moves , worried that any overtly aggressive response by New Delhi will undermine US effort in Afghanistan .
President Bush and President - elect Barack Obama have also spoken to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to show US support , but also to moderate Indian response .
Both Washington and New Delhi are starting to realise that the Pakistani military still calls the shots in Islamabad behind the civilian fa��ade , officials here concede privately .
The weakness of Pakistan 's civilian leadership was fully exposed on Saturday when the country���s army chief once again overruled a civilian government decision - this time to send the Director General of its spy agency ISI to India to coordinate the investigation into the latest terror attack on Mumbai .
Pakistan���s President Asif Ali Zardari explained it away saying there was a miscommunication and Islamabad only meant to send a ' ' Director ' ' and not Director - General , at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh���s request .
But no one was fooled by the ' ' clarification ' ' -- the reversal of the earlier decision came after a midnight meeting Pakistan���s Army Chief Pervez Kiyani , a former ISI chief himself , had with Zardari and Prime Minister Gilani .
Pakistan���s threat about troop withdrawals from the Afghan front also followed the Zardari - Kiyani - Gilani meeting , leaving little doubt about the real power center in Islamabad despite the recent return to democratic rule .
The situation is made even more complex by the transition process in the US where President Bush is winding down from the White House and President - elect Obama is readying to take charge .
Both sides have made the Pakistan problem a top priority as they coordinate response , tactics , and communication relating to developments in the region .
The latest attacks on Mumbai also threatens to torpedo Obama 's stated objective of promoting good ties between New Delhi and Islamabad , so that Pakistan can focus its energy on the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan that are controlled by Islamic extremists .
But hardliners in Pakistan 's military and strategic circles , who resent what they see as the country 's civilian government doing Washington 's bidding and fighting what they argue is a US war , are against this .
The terror strike on Mumbai evidently has several objectives - one of them being to cause a rift between Washington and New Delhi and damage US - India ties .
While Pakistan 's fledgling civilian government has made all the right moves and noises about cooperation with India , officials here reckon it is being continuously undermined by the hard - line military whose importance , and lavish funding , depends on keeping up a hostile posture against India .
Even in the political sphere , Pakistan 's continued existence as a single entity is premised on enmity with India , the glue which keeps the country together .
Some Pakistanis have suggested in recent months that take away animosity against India , then Pakistan 's founding itself becomes questionable .
Already , many Pakistanis are starting to question the relevance of a country where more people are killed in intra-religious warfare between Shias and Sunnis than in Hindu - Muslim communal riots in India .
Two of Pakistan 's four territories are wracked by insurgencies , and the intelligence community 's reading is that resurrecting the hostile posture against India is one way the hard - line elements in Pakistan hope to contain this domestic conflagration .
While Pakistan is playing its one desperate Afghan card , both India and US can separately bring Pakistan to its knees in no time .
The US and its allies are dependent on Pakistan for supplies to its troops in Afghanistan , but they can also plug the economic plug on the country and cause it to collapse in no time .
India controls Pakistan 's lifeline and jugular with river waters that originate in India and flow into Pakistan .
But punishing Pakistan with this levers would also throw the country into absolute chaos and bring extremists elements to the fore leading to a Somalia kind of situation -- with nuclear weapons in the mix .
This is the fear that Pakistan is exploiting to stay afloat and stave off sanctions from the west and punishment from India .
The solution , analysts say , is to get Pakistan 's civilian leadership to exert control over its hard - line military and intelligence which functions on its own existential agenda .
This is easier said than done .
America 's foremost strategic guru Henry Kissinger told Fareed Zakaria 's GPS program on CNN , which devoted an entire hour to the crisis , that Pakistan 's civilian government had made good statements vis - �� - vis ties with India , " but its capacity to implement them is questionable . "
Terrorism in India - when do we say ' enough is enough ' ?
There 's a saying in The Industry : You 've gotta pay the rent .
( See : Actor # 1 : " How was it working on Big Daddy 3 ? " Actor # 2 : " You 've gotta pay the rent ! " )
Whether it's a $ 40,000 monthly mortgage on a Mulholland Drive mansion or your half of the $ 1,200 studio above that dodgy noodle shop , nothing keeps a roof over your head except cold hard cash .
For a particular brand of celeb -- typically the ones who can't urinate in public without hitting a paparazzo -- side gigs are the easiest way to pad their bank accounts .
Whereas you may scrounge for pocket change by offering to paint your neighbor 's beach house or enduring a two - hour focus group on whole - grain snack crackers , American celebrities can simply hop private jets to foreign lands and film 30 - second ads for six - figure paychecks .
( But seriously -- they 're just like you ! )
The worst part ?
That we , the American TV watching population , the ones who actually catapulted them to fame , the ones whose kind of creepy fan dedication weblogs made them so attractive to international coffee purveyors and exotic liquor distributors in the first place , never get to see these commercials .
Until now .
So thank you , Internet .
Carve another notch in your belt of justice .

IF you have not get to imaginary numbers , your teacher is probably going to tell you :
You can't take a square root of a negative number , therefore , there is n't an answer .
BUT
If you have learned or about to learn imaginary numbers , there is an " imaginary answer " to the question .
As I learned in pre-calculus , i= √ - 1 ( square root of negative one ) therefore is the answer could be simplfy as " " √ 2* i " " or " " i√2 "
Bid to Save GM , Chrysler Loans Dies in Senate Late effort fails to get a deal through the Senate .
Bill killed by 52 - 35 vote .
Dec. 12 , 2008  -- U.S. Senators killed an effort to rescue Detroit automakers Thursday night after a last - ditch attempt to renegotiate the deal died .
The package was doomed on a 52 - 35 procedural vote , well short of the 60 votes needed to bring the bill to the floor for passage .
" To all those within the sound of my voice :
We have tried very , very hard to legislate for the automobile industry , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , said on the Senate floor before the vote .
" I am very sorry we have not been able to find a conclusion . "
Reid 's comments came after a night of negotiations involving Sen. Bob Corker , R - Tenn. , who wanted to revise the existing rescue deal to force pay cuts on union workers by demanding that General Motors and Chrysler pay back $ 14 billion in proposed government loans if they failed to slash labor costs a specified amount by March 31 .
Corker met with fellow Republicans Thursday evening after talks with Democrats , and soon afterward , Reid made his announcement on the Senate floor .
" I dread looking at Wall Street tomorrow , " Reid said .
" It 's not going to be a pleasant sight . "
The White House quickly released a statement of regret after the failed Senate vote .
" It 's disappointing that Congress failed to act tonight , " deputy spokesman Tony Fratto said .
" We think the legislation we negotiated provided an opportunity to use funds already appropriated for automakers , and presented the best chance to avoid a disorderly bankruptcy while ensuring taxpayer funds only go to firms whose stakeholders were prepared to make difficult decisions to become viable .
We will evaluate our options in light of the breakdown in Congress . "
GM issued a statement expressing disappointment .
" We will assess all of our options to continue our restructuring and to obtain the means to weather the current economic crisis . "
Chrysler also released a statement saying it would : " continue to pursue a workable solution to help ensure the future viability of the company . "
In the end , Reid was among the 35 voting against the Senate 's shell bill -- but only for procedural reasons , officials said .
After the 11:09 p.m. ET vote , he urged the White House to use the part of a $ 700 billion economic rescue package already approved by Congress to help keep the auto industry afloat .
Democrats blamed Republicans for the bill 's failure , but Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , suggested many Republicans genuinely could n't stomach the terms of the deal .
" The administration negotiated in good faith with the Democratic majority a proposal that was simply unacceptable to the vast majority of our side because we thought it , frankly , would n't work , " McConnell said .
Failed Last - Ditch Negotiations
The Senate appeared unlikely early Thursday to pass the bill to provide a $ 14 billion emergency loan to the U.S. auto industry , even though the bill easily passed in the House Wednesday night .
But hopes of a deal rose as lawmakers continued to negotiate toward a compromise .
There has been vocal Republican opposition to any bailout for Detroit , but there were at least a dozen Republican senators who were thought to be possibilities to support a revised bill for the emergency loans .
Among them are several who are retiring , including Nebraska 's Chuck Hagel , Virginia 's John Warner , Alaska 's Ted Stevens and New Mexico 's Pete Domenici .
" This is not the time to let these companies go bankrupt , " Domenici told ABC News .
" We would just be compounding our economic problems . "
Reid held talks with Corker Thursday on crafting a new compromise .
Corker , who has been steadfastly opposed to the bill drafted by congressional Democrats and the White House , has a lot of credibility among Republicans on the issue .
" I am at the negotiating table , " Corker told ABC News at one point Thursday .
" We are working on a great solution , and I think there is a great possibility that we can make it work . "
But as staffers in the bipartisan negotiations worked to hash out the new auto bailout language , Corker called a late - night Republican conference meeting to pitch the as - yet unwritten and as - yet - unagreed - to plan .
Republicans seen going into the meeting included auto bailout supporters , like Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio , those on the fence like Domenici , and those opposed to a bailout , including Sen .
Tom Coburn , R - Okla .
This afternoon , several Senate Democrats confirmed that negotiations were under way on the new compromise , and said the talks were a serious , late - in - the - game effort to get a deal that would have enough votes to pass the Senate .
If the Senate had changed the legislation , the House , which adjourned Wednesday night , would have been called back into session to reconcile the differences .
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was reluctant to call the House back to start over again .
" The House passed bipartisan , compromise legislation that protects taxpayers , does not weaken environmental standards and places tough accountability measures on the industry to help ensure their long term viability and competitiveness , " said Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami .
" The Senate should take up this legislation , which was negotiated in good faith and has the best prospects for enactment , and the House has no plans to return at this time . "
Corker 's Proposed Compromise
The Corker - proposed compromise would have required the auto companies to reduce company debt by two - thirds and to negotiate a new labor deal that would make labor costs for the American automobile companies -- wages , benefits and pension plan expenditures -- the same as labor costs for foreign companies that operate plants in the United States .
Estimates are that U.S. workers cost about $ 70 per vehicle to the $ 45 that foreign workers cost .
This is already a goal of the Detroit companies , but they are trying to phase in cuts by 2011 .
Under Corker 's proposal , Chrysler and GM would get $ 14 billion in loans up front , but would have to give the money back if the changes were not implemented by March 31 .
In addition to meeting with Democratic leaders and Republicans , Corker also met today with United Auto Worker representatives and talked to executives at GM , Chrysler and Ford .
Earlier , McConnell announced on the Senate floor that he would oppose the earlier bipartisan auto rescue package backed by Democrats and the White House , and instead backed a proposal for a pre-packaged bankruptcy being pushed by Corker .
" A lot of struggling Americans are wondering where their bailout is , " said McConnell , arguing that , at some point , the bailouts have to stop , and that the Wall Street bailout he supported was for the entire economy and not just one industry .
McConnell 's announcement came at the same time that President - elect Barack Obama was speaking in Chicago , saying , " we cannot simply stand by and watch this industry collapse . "
Obama said that " doing so would lead to a devastating ripple effect throughout our economy . "
He said the government should provide a short - term loan and said he hopes an agreement can be reached this week on Capitol Hill .
" I understand people 's anger and frustration at the situation our auto companies find themselves in today , " Obama said .
" I raised concerns about the health of our auto industry a year and a half ago , when I spoke to industry leaders in Detroit .
I urged them to act quickly to adopt new technologies and a new business approach that would help them stay competitive in these changing times . "
The White House , too , promised to work with Republicans and Democrats to pass legislation to aid automakers , despite mounting criticism from GOP senators who said they would not support the plan as it stood .
" The president and others are reaching out to senators today , listening to their concerns , listening to their questions , trying to answer their questions as best we can , making the case for why this legislation is the most effective and appropriate approach to help the auto companies become viable for the long term , " White House press secretary Dana Perino said .
Some Dems Voice Bailout Concerns
Republicans have been vocal about their hang - ups with the bill throughout the week , but more recently some Democrats , including Sen .
Tom Harkin of Iowa , Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California , were also wavering .
To get the 60 votes necessary to end debate and vote for passage , the bill likely would have needed the support of at least 10 Republicans , probably more .
Missouri's Sen. Kit Bond , one of the few Republicans who had supported a bailout , said the version passed in the House " fails " to force needed reforms on the auto companies .
" While I am fighting to save Missouri auto jobs , Congress is just putting off the inevitable unless we force the companies to reform fundamentally , which this latest plan fails to do and is why I am offering changes to make it work , " Bond said in a statement .
Sen. David Vitter , R - La. , condemned the White House 's approach to provide money before the carmakers prove they have workable plans for restructuring .
Others object to the idea that a government - appointed " car czar " would know how to fix the industry and say the money will simply be wasted with no real changes being made .
" Americans are not stupid , " said Sen. Jim Demint , R - S.C.
" They know this bailout is only a temporary solution . "
" The public does n't like it , " McConnell said .
" And in our line of work , that 's important . "
As Republicans lashed out at specific elements of the package , the White House came out in its defense Wednesday , saying in a statement that the legislation developed with congressional Democrats to rescue automakers is an " effective and responsible approach " that will " ensure the necessary restructuring occurs . "
Congressional Democrats drafted the latest text of the measure Wednesday after coming to an agreement with the White House on the language .
" This gets us to the 20 - yard line , but getting over the goal line will take a major effort , " said Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , Tuesday night .
" We will need the personal involvement of President Bush and President - elect Obama . "
For the measure to pass in the House , Pelosi caved on several major points .
According to her aides , she now feels the House bill is a " take it or leave it " proposition to the Senate .
The bill , first sent to the White House Monday , would provide Chrysler and General Motors with a short - term infusion in low - interest loans to stay afloat in the months ahead .
It also would call on Bush to select one or more people within the executive branch to authorize , disperse and oversee a loan for the auto industry .
The car czar would have the power to reshape the industry and negotiate deals among auto companies , unions , creditors and suppliers .
The designee also could force car companies into Chapter 11 bankruptcy if they do n't have a viability plan by March 31 .
" They either have a long - term plan that 's viable , or we get our money back , " White House deputy chief of staff for policy Joel Kaplan , who is leading White House negotiations on the bailout , said today .
" And if we call our money back , which is required under this bill , then those firms are not going to be able to survive . "
Threat of Bankruptcy Looms Over Carmakers
General Motors , Chrysler and Ford have repeatedly made their case to lawmakers and U.S. taxpayers to explain why they need a loan .
GM CEO Rick Wagoner told lawmakers last week that , without an infusion of $ 4 billion in taxpayer loans before the end of the year , the company would go bankrupt .
Negotiators have decided that Ford , not in immediate need of a loan , will not receive funding at this point .

When Fox President of Entertainment Kevin Reilly first heard Joss Whedon 's pitch for " Dollhouse , " his new show , he was so taken that he later described it to an L.A .
Times reporter this way :
" He had me at ' hello , ' " Reilly said .
" I was kinda drunk with the surprise of it all .
He laid out the whole concept but I think it was one of those things where I heard every other word of it . "
Reilly no longer appears to be in a love - drunk daze about the much - anticipated project , because Fox announced that " Dollhouse " will premiere in one of the worst time slots in all of television -- Fridays at 9 p.m. , beginning Feb. 13 .
The news was posted immediately on Whedoneque , a Joss Whedon fan site , and prompted an outcry .
" It 's ' Firefly ' all over again ! " posted one worried fanboy or fangirl .
( Whedon's " Firefly " was also given a Friday night graveyard shift in Fall 2002 . )
Behind the scenes , " Dollhouse " has had its share of ups and downs in its short life .
Whedon shut down production in September for 2 1/ 2 weeks to rewrite scripts and wound up shooting the pilot again .
But Whedon recently mused on his website about how happy he was with the results and that he and the network were finally in a good place about what they both want from the series .
On Thursday , it became obvious that the problems persist .
Production on the seventh episode , which is supposed to begin Monday , is being delayed at least a day because the script was in such bad shape , according to a source who requested anonymity .
The script for the sixth episode also had big problems , causing production delays that left the cast and crew very frustrated , the source said .
Whedon , who directed the first episode , is hardly seen on set these days , focusing all of his attention to writing .
The show stars Eliza Dushku and centers on a group of people who are imprinted with the personalities and abilities they need to carry out specific missions .
After they carry out their duties , their memories are wiped clean and they live together like children in Dollhouse , a futuristic dormatory and lab .
" We have yet to gain any momentum , " the inside source said .
" The network wants to tone things , and Joss is trying to figure out how to give them that and still do the show he wants to do . "
Sounds like deja vu for Whedon .
The " Buffy the Vampire Slayer " and " Angel " creator vowed to never work with Fox again after experiencing creative issues with Fox over " Firefly , " his canceled TV show that led to " Serenity , " the movie , after success on DVD .

While the digital camera market does n’t usually produce blockbusters like last year ’s Wii gaming console , Mr. Hart of Best Buy offered a prediction on one potential breakout product : the Flip videocamera from Pure Digital Technologies .
This type of device , which can record high - definition video yet is small enough to fit in a pants pocket , appeals to teenagers and college students who communicate via YouTube , he said .

Black Friday came about a month early for computer shoppers this holiday season .
Leave it to Wal - Mart to jump the gun , sort of .
Just two days after Halloween , the discount chain put up for sale , for one day only , a $ 298 laptop , the Compaq CQ50 - 139WM .
And it was n’t a slouch in specs : a single - core Intel Celeron M processor running at 2 gigahertz , with 2 gigabytes of DDR2 RAM and 160 - gigabyte hard drive .
For computer shoppers , we could say let the games begin after Thanksgiving  except they ’ve begun .
With the economy roiling , there are dire predictions for PC retailers this holiday season , as consumers retreat from nonessential purchases .
A survey by the NPD Group , a market research company , showed that 26 percent of consumers plan to spend less this holiday .
That said , those who have budgeted for a laptop or desktop machine ( NPD says nearly a quarter of their respondents are planning just that ) might find that they can afford more machine than they expect .
“ It ’s a great time to buy a notebook computer , with tremendous prices across the board , ” says Bob O’Donnell , an analyst with IDC , a research firm .
“ It ’s particularly good because we do n’t see any major changes coming in notebooks until next year , when Windows 7 comes out , ” he said , referring to the successor to Windows Vista .
“ We ’ve seen that notebooks , like cellphones , have become critical to own , ” he said .
“ You do n’t share a cellphone , people do n’t want to share their notebooks . ”
While it ’s not news that manufacturers make marketing plans months ahead of time , it ’s notable that Dell has introduced a number of new laptop and desktop models in the last couple of weeks to capitalize on the season .
Look for online deals on even these machines as Christmas approaches .
The exception in the cut -rate arena will be , as usual , Apple .
The company , gaining ground in computer market share this year , jump - started its Christmas push in October with a new range of MacBook and MacBook Pro portables , adding features ( and a trim new shape and lighter weight ) but maintaining prices in the $ 1,300 to $ 2,500 range .
Macs do n’t go on sale , even on Black Fridays .

Editor 's note : Ron Paul is a Republican congressman from Texas who ran for his party 's nomination for president this year .
He served in Congress in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was elected again to Congress in 1996 , serving continuously since then .
Rep. Paul is a member of the House Financial Services Committee .
Ron Paul says the nation is off track and Republicans have to rediscover their core beliefs .
( CNN ) --
The questions now being asked are :
Where to go from here and who's to blame for the downfall of the Republican Party ?
Too bad the concern for the future of the Republican Party had not been seriously addressed in the year 2000 when the Republicans gained control of the House , Senate , and the Presidency .
Now , in light of the election , many are asking : What is the future of the Republican Party ?
But that is the wrong question .
The proper question should be :
Where is our country heading ?
There 's no doubt that a large majority of Americans believe we 're on the wrong track .
That 's why the candidate demanding " change " won the election .
It mattered not that the change offered was no change at all , only a change in the engineer of a runaway train .
Once it 's figured out what is fundamentally wrong with our political and economic system , solutions can be offered .
If the Republican Party can grasp hold of the policy changes needed , then the party can be rebuilt .
In the rise and fall of the recent Republican reign of power these past decades , the goal of the party had grown to be only that of gaining and maintaining power -- with total sacrifice of the original Republican belief in shrinking the size of government .
Most Republicans endorsed this view in order to achieve victories at the polls .
Limiting government power and size with less spending and a balanced budget as the goal used to be a " traditional " Republican value .
This is what Goldwater and Reagan talked about .
That is what the Contract with America stood for .
The opportunity finally came in 2000 to do something about the cancerous growth of government .
This clear message led to the Republican success at the polls .
Once the Republicans were in power , though , the promises faded , and all policies were directed at maintaining or increasing power by trying to whittle away at Democratic strength by acting like big-spending Democrats .
The Republican Congress never once stood up against the Bush / Rove machine that demanded support for unconstitutional wars , attacks on civil liberties here at home , and an economic policy based on more spending , more debt , and more inflation -- while constantly preaching the flawed doctrine that deficits do n't matter as long as taxes are n't raised .
But what the Republican leadership did n't realize was that ALL spending is a tax on middle - class Americans through price inflation and that eventually the inevitable consequence is paying for the extravagance with a financial crisis .
Party leaders concentrated only on political tricks in order to maintain power and neglected the limited - government principles on which they were elected .
The only solution for this is for Republicans to once again reassess their core beliefs and show how the country ( not the party ) can be put back on the right track .
The problem , though , is regaining credibility .
After eight years of perpetual ( and unnecessary and unconstitutional ) war , persistent and expanded attacks on our privacy , runaway deficits , and now nationalization of the financial system , Republicans are going to have a tough time regaining the confidence of the American people .
But that 's what must be done .
Otherwise , Republicans can only mimic Democrats and hope for an isolated victory here and there .
And that 's just more of the same that brought on the disintegration of the party .
Since the new alignment of political power offers no real change , we will remain on the same track without even a pretense of slowing the growth of government .
With the new administration we can expect things to go from bad to worse .
Opportunity abounds for anyone who can present the case for common sense in fiscal affairs , for protection of civil liberties here at home , and avoiding the senseless foreign entanglements which have bogged us down for decades and contributed so significantly to our fiscal and budgetary crisis .
During the debates in the Republican Presidential primary , even though I am a 10 - term sitting Representative Member of Congress , I was challenged more than once on my Republican credentials .
The fact that I was repeatedly asked how I could be a Republican when I was talking a different language than the other candidates answers the question of how the Republican Party can slip so far so fast .
My rhetorical answer at the time was simple :
Why should one be excluded from the Republican Party for believing and always voting for :
• Limited government power
• A balanced budget
• Personal liberty
• Strict adherence to the Constitution
• Sound money
• A strong defense while avoiding all undeclared wars
• No nation - building and no policing the world
How can a party that still pretends to be the party of limited government distance itself outright from these views and expect to maintain credibility ?
Since the credibility of the Republican Party has now been lost , how can it regain credibility without embracing these views , or at least showing respect for them ?
I concluded my answer by simply stating the Republican Party had lost its way and must reassess its values .
And that is what needs to be done in a hurry .
But it might just take a new crop of leaders to regain the credibility needed to redirect the Party .
It certainly wo n't be done overnight .
It took a long time to come out of the wilderness after 40 years of Democratic rule for the Republican Party to take charge .
Today though , time moves more quickly .
Opportunities will arise .
The one thing for certain is that in the next four years we will not see the Republic restored .
Instead the need for it will be greater than ever .
The problems are easily understood and the answers are not that difficult .
Abusing the rule of law and ignoring the Constitution can be reversed .
If the Republican Party can grasp hold of the needed reforms , it can lead the way and regain its credibility .
If power is sought for power 's sake alone , the Party will never be able to wrench away the power of the opposition .
In the past two years , I found that when the young people heard the message of liberty , they overwhelmingly responded favorably , fully realizing the failure of the status quo and the need to once again endorse a system of self reliance , personal responsibility , sound money , and a non-interventionist foreign policy while rejecting the cradle - to - grave nanny state all based on the rule of law and the Constitution .
To ignore the political struggle and only " hope for the best " is pure folly .
The march toward a dictatorial powerful state is now in double time .
All those who care -- and especially those who understand the stakes involved -- have an ominous responsibility to energetically get involved in the battle of survival for a free and prosperous America .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ron Paul .

Ikea has been accused of condoning cruelty to animals by selling salami made from Santa 's four - legged sleigh - pullers , reindeer .
Unlike a traditional reindeer hunt , modern ranchers buzz over the animals in helicopters , herd them with snowmobiles and truck them hundreds of miles , causing them mental and physical stress .
Around 70 per cent of Swedish reindeer slaughtered are calves , which means they die without seeing snow , claims the animal welfare group Viva !.
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ikea sells 130g of reindeer salami for £ 1.75 and 100g of reindeer slices for £ 2.25 in its Swedish food hall , which features other national dishes such as rye bread , meatballs , and almond cake .
Viva ! , a vegetarian campaign group based in Bristol , said : " We are calling on the company to withdraw sales of the meat , due to the cruel exploitation these wild animals suffer at the hands of hunters . "
Viva ! has already persuaded supermarkets not to stock kangaroo and other exotic meats which can be reared and killed in ways that would be illegal in the UK .
In a letter to Ikea , it cited evidence from a study by Uppsala University in Sweden in 2005 that found reindeer hunting caused " considerable physical and mental stress " .
In a paper , Claes Rehbinder and Jann Hau , of the Department of Neuroscience , wrote : " The increasing stress associated with herding , corralling , and physical restraint of less and less tame animals results in lesions and elevated blood cortisol concentrations . "
Viva !
campaigns manager , Justin Kerswell , said : " We are very concerned about the exploitation of wild animals for meat .
As well as being chased from the land and air , once they are caught , their misery does n't end there .
In Sweden , some reindeer face a gruelling journey of up to 1,000 km to the slaughterhouse where they face anything but a humane end .
" More than 70 per cent of reindeer slaughtered for meat are calves that have grazed during the summer , which means they never even get to see snow . "
He added : " We urge the company to set an ethical example of goodwill by dropping the sale of reindeer meat , instead of supporting an industry spreading pain and suffering , not happiness this Christmas . "
Ikea , which has 17 stores in the UK , denied it was cruel , saying it strove to meet animal welfare standards .
In a statement , it said : " Modern equipment such as snowmobiles , motorcycles and helicopters are used because of the large size of the reindeer herding area ( half the size of Sweden ) , which makes gathering the animals more difficult .
The vehicles keep the reindeer safe from predators .
" In terms of transporting reindeer to the abattoir , our supplier follows the same law applying to all other domestic animals in Sweden which sets maximum transport time and breaks , access to water and so on . "
The statement said the claim that 70 per cent of the animals were calves was " a national figure for Sweden " and not specific to Ikea .
Reindeer meat is popular in the Scandinavian countries , where favourite dishes include reindeer meatballs and reindeer sausage .
There 's one key feature missing from the iPhone and every other browser - equipped handset : Firefox .
Fortunately , Mozilla has confirmed that the first alpha version of Firefox mobile will be available in the coming weeks .
Mozilla CEO
John Lilly told the San Jose Mercury that his company has been working toward an open - platform mobile browser similar to the current desktop version of Firefox .
" We want to make sure that the Web on mobile is more like the Web than what the mobile industry offers today , which is closed , separate networks and not a very good information - getting experience for the user , " Lilly said .
" The first thing is to bring Firefox to mobile devices .
We ’re working on that , and we ’ll see some alphas in a few weeks . "
This sounds quite exciting .
Think about how much Firefox add - ons would enhance your mobile browsing experience .
What 'd be really cool is a touchscreen version of All - in - One Gestures , which allows you to program custom mouse gestures to execute commands such as spell check , switching windows , opening a new tab and so on .
What do you got for us , Firefox ?
We 'll have to wait and see in the coming weeks .

" Staging " the U.S. Economy ( September 2 , 2008 )
Before we begin . . .
The goal here at OTM.com is make sense of the many forces at work in the U.S. and global economies -- and that includes the " soft " cultural forces for which there are few meaningful metrics .
In other words , a chart can illustrate some metric of change , but it does not locate the causal factors , which are often obscure to those of us in " real time " / the present and to those with little grasp of history .
It is extraordinarily easy to fall victim to subtle efforts to " frame the debate " and massage the context of what is presented to us as " information " and " facts . "
We must constantly recall that " information " is not " knowledge . "
Thus the goal here at OTM.com is to probe deeply precisely where the Mainstream Media is silent -- large cultural / economic changes which have been obscured by either the stunning superficiality of the MSM and / or the subtle desire to avoid anything which might challenge what I call the The 3P Economy ( Propaganda , Pandering , Posturing ) .
The " con " that is the 3PE requires " marks " -- people who willingly fall for the con via greed , a desire to avoid work / sacrifice and a childish preference for denial .
So the vast majority of us are complicit in the 3P economy in some way : borrowing more than was sensible , consuming more than we needed , letting the protest fall silently from our lips , voting for the same old representation , demanding little truth , and allowing ourselves to be distracted with iPods , hours of TV , trumped - up ideology wars , etc .
Some of the blogosphere seeks to render us victims of conspiracies over which we have no power .
Yes , conspiracies of all sorts do exist -- for what is conspiracy but collusion which must remain secret to function -- but a complacent mark to go along with the con is still required .
The idea here at OTM.com is to refuse the easy mantle of " victim " and stop falling for the con .
I 'm making two small changes to the format : I will try to add readers ' comments about each entry the following day , and then respond briefly to your comments .
I am also posting a brief selection from my catalog of novels , so that you can decide for yourself if it 's amateurish plonk or better - than - you - guessed entertainment .
You know how realtors " stage " a house to sell it to some unwary fool : a piano is placed over the cracked , sagging foundation ( true story ) , wide curtains cover the windows which have been painted shut ( true story ) , artful paintings and high - class books are set around to suggest the previous owners just returned from Majorca or Kyoto , and that you too will be an upper - crust worthy once you buy , buy , buy .
( Fake scent of fresh bread in the oven is optional . )
The entire U.S. economy is as " staged " as the phoniest , most wretchedly obvious attempt to mask a home 's true problems .
Let 's refresh our memories of how the informal but nonetheless very real Ministry of Propaganda plies its trade :
Before you scoff too heartily , consider this :
And a wry look at the reality of life for the dwindling number of reporters in MSM newspapers :
Let 's run through how the MOP manipulates how we " frame the debate " .
1 . " The only measure of economic growth is GDP . " ( Statistical Lies , Government Division )
And magically , GDP never goes down -- so ergo , all those empty storefronts and that heating oil bill that doubled -- those do n't mean squat , Jack , take it from us : the " reality " is the economy is just fine and you 're whining because , well , you 're a whiner .
For a super - rare flash of truth in an MSM financial magazine , check out this " opinion " piece ( note it could n't be placed in the main news section -- that would have been scary ) : Welcome to the Frozen Economy ( BusinessWeek ) 2 . " Housing has bottomed " .
( Statistical Lies , Private Division )
Do ya reckon some folks are desperate to make you believe that the housing bubble bust is done , and now is the perfect , ideal time to jump in and BUY BUY BUY that first , second or third home / " investment property " ?
Heh .
The first step of skepticism is to ask who benefits and who loses if this is in fact a con .
In the real world , the same old cons are still working : lie on your mortgage app and a sleazy broker will get you the loan ( and score the fat commission ) so you can stop paying your old $ 5 K / month mortgage and buy a new house for only $ 2 K / month : read on : the Housing Bubble Blog .
3 . " I will give you a $ 1,000 tax break , create 5 million new jobs , stand up to Big Oil , etc. " ( Big Lie , election - cycle rinse / wash ) .
The high season of pandering has begun .
Candidates are proclaiming right and left that they will " stand up to Big Oil " .
Nice , but since " Big Oil " only controls 13 % of global oil supply , then exactly how does standing up to a faltering , marginalized 13 % slice of global oil accomplish anything of value ?
Pander , Baby -- the sky 's the limit -- they fall for it every time .
" Compassionate conservatism " -- barf .
" Yes we can " -- barf .
Grab a $ 5 billion slice of " Big Oil 's " obscene profits -- great , you 've just reduced the Federal Deficit for the year by 1 % .
Amidst all these pandering giveaways -- where is the money coming from to pay for it all ?
Hmm , never a mention of that , is there ?
I know , I know , tax everyone who makes more than $ 250 K / year -- and that magically creates $ 500 Billion ?
Pandering requires an audience too drugged or complacent to ask the hard questions , and so far the MSM and American public are playing right along .
Just pander to me , baby , and I 'll vote for you , because I want to believe that simplistic giveaway will really change my life for the better .
Heh .
4 . " All this innuendo is defamatory and false - - our institution is fiscally sound . "
( Honorary Ken Lay Awards to the Management of Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , et al. )
Posturing is the new American Perfection of Lying .
Accused of taking steroids ?
Go on the attack , accuse everyone who doubts you of racism , character assassination , and so on , until you 're busted , and then " clear the air " with a tearful confession and that good ole American tradition , the Plea for Forgiveness .
Uh , right .
Are we supposed to forget your wild , flaming accusations and unshakeable statements of your innocence and purity ?
Sports can easily be dismissed as circus and bread , but when leaders of global financial institutions stand up and posture , then there are consequences .
The poor dumb marks who actually believed the lies held on and were ruined , while the " smart money " recognized a last desperate con and sold sold sold .
The sad truth is that virtually nothing in the U.S. economy or media is believable .
It is all spin , con , posturing , pandering , from the phony statistical " proof " that everything is just fine to the " calls for change " ( no change in the borrow - and - spend deficit ) and the phony electioneering pandering to " bases . "
Was it ever any different ?
Well , the manner in which the government cherrypicks " data " has certainly been massaged over the past decades , and ever since Reagan was declared the " Teflon president " we have seen a public willingness to believe what we want to believe as opposed to a healthy skepticism .
So yes , there are still plenty of marks and ever - more lobbyists and well - paid spinmeisters .
But the con seems to have deepened , and now engages virtually all the influential players ( see chart above ) .
Is it a conscious economywide con ?
The collusion need n't be spoken out loud , for the fear does n't even need to be voiced or addressed : do n't rock the boat or you may be out of a job / commission / contract .
Thus it is fear of the inevitable coming collapse which powers the players to maintain the con .
Sure , one reporter 's skepticism can be printed on page A - 13 , but his / her voice is easily drowned out with hundreds of breathless stories on the candidate 's piccadillos or pronouncements , sports scores , iPod sales ( up , you see , the economy is still booming , and Apple 's going to $ 200 / share ) and the rest of the purposeful noise which passes for " news . "
If we stop buying the con , the con man / woman has to move on or ( gasp ) try an honest living .
New Readers Journal comments : 16 thought - provoking new commentaries for your reading pleasure .
New Book Notes :
My new " little book of big ideas , " Weblogs & New Media : Marketing in Crisis is now available on amazon.com for $ 10.99 .
Here is a review of the book : Charles Hugh Smith 's " Weblogs & New Media : Marketing in Crisis " is one of the most important business analyses I have ever read .
It is the first to squarely face converging global crises from a business perspective : peak oil , climate change , resource depletion , and the junction of key social cycles will radically alter the business landscape in coming decades .
As an entrepreneur I have been retooling my own business to meet these head on , but have felt hamstrung by marketing 's insistence upon positivity even to absurdity and denial .
" Weblogs & New Media " helped immensely by providing the conceptual framework I needed to move forward .
Within this framework I can begin formulating strategy appropriate for the new global zeitgeist -- namely , trust as the new currency du jour .
Moreover , Smith offers insights for building this trust via digital resources that business currently misunderstands and misuses , a criticism that will be familiar to Seth Godin fans but which has implications far beyond traditional marketing goals .
" Weblogs & New Media " is essential reading for any entrepreneur who refuses to drink the business media kool - aid , and who wishes his or her business to remain viable even in times of crisis .
An excerpt from Claire 's Great Adventure :
All three gazed up at the black bulk of the two freighters , both of which were illuminated by only a few dim bulbs struck on the superstructure .
There was no sight of a crew , and Claire wondered if they were out on the town .
One ship rode high in the water , suggesting its cargo had been emptied , while the smaller one rode low , suggesting it had already taken on cargo .
Of the two ships , the smaller one seemed older , perhaps simply because it was smaller ; in the quiet darkness , they seemed like ghost ships .
Claire knew most cargo was carried by massive container ships the size of luxury liners , and she wondered what such old ships even transported anymore .
May seemed confused , and Claire pulled her toward the smaller freighter , stage - whispering urgently , " Hit the redial and then listen . "
Aunt May did as instructed , and again the faint ring of a phone sounded seconds after she 'd redialed .
This time , they could distinctly hear it emanating from the smaller freighter .
" He 's on board that ship , " Claire whispered .
" Let 's go . "
" Are you crazy ? " Camden hissed .
" We have no idea what 's up there . "
" Afraid of some rats ? " Claire responded gamely .
" There 's no crew around . "
" You do n't know that , " May said .
" Maybe they 're asleep .
Now let 's not do anything rash . "
" I can't believe you two , " Claire whispered harshly .
" We know Giddings ' phone is up there , and so maybe he is , too .
He may need our help , and we 're holding back like scaredycats . "
" And what happens if he 's not alone ? "
May demanded .
Thinking aloud , Claire said , " We go in real quiet - like , and just look around .
If we spot anyone other than Mr. Giddings , then we come back here and call the Police . "
" How do we know what this Giddings looks like ? "
Camden asked , and Claire exhaled in frustration .
" I have no idea , but he probably wo n't look like a sailor .
Look , you two stay here and I 'll go . "
It was far braver sounding than Claire felt , but she prayed that Camden would grudgingly accompany her .
There was no gangplank up to the deck , only a series of large steel handles welded to the side of the ship ; a platform had been brought close the hull to bring the handles within reach of someone on the dock .
Though the ship was much smaller than its container - ship brethren , its sides loomed high above the dock .
" I have a confession to make , " May whispered guiltily .
" I really cannot stand heights especially in the dark . "
" That 's OK , " Claire said .
" We need someone on the dock anyway to watch our backpacks .
Now when I get to the deck , I 'll signal you to call Gidding 's phone again . "
Turning to Camden , she whispered , " Get your phone , and then let 's go . "
" Who said I 'm going ? " " Just wait for me at the top , " Claire said .
" A lookout .
There 's nothing hard about that . "
" Other than falling off and being crippled for life , " Camden retorted .
" OK , " Claire said resignedly .
" Just wait at the bottom . "
Camden wordlessly agreed to this reduced duty , and the two girls crept forward to the chain - link security fence .
Though topped with menacing barbed wire , the fence ended at the dock 's edge ; the lower edge of one section was visibly loose , and though she hated smudging her new yellow dress , Claire dropped to the ground and wriggled beneath the bent chain links .
Dusting herself off , she awaited Camden , who gamely dropped to the wooden planks and began squeezing under the fence .
Claire heard the sound of fabric tearing , and a quiet oath ; one of the wires had snagged Camden 's blouse .
Claire bent down to help her locate the snareone of the sleeves was tornand as Claire released it Camden whispered harshly , " You owe me a new blouse . "
" I 'll buy you two new ones , " Claire whispered .
" By the time this is over , it 'll be three , " Camden hissed , and then squirmed free of the fence .
Stealthily approaching the ship , Claire realized the oversized welded handles were actually far apart ; clambering up the side was going to be a lot harder than climbing a jungle gym back home .
Gripping the first bar of cold steel , Claire felt the rust on the underside of the handle , and hoped the rusty ladder rungs would n't break off beneath her weight .
" This guy is THE leading visionary on reality .
He routinely discusses things which no one else has talked about , yet , turn out to be quite relevant months later . "

Lieberman
From the Hartford Courant :
“ Senate Democrats will decide by secret ballot Tuesday whether to take away Sen. Joe Lieberman ’s chairmanship of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee — a post from which he oversees U.S. security issues , as well as the operations of a wide segment of the federal government . ”
To my mind , the crucial issue here is whether or not Lieberman has done a good job as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs .
If a good chair had done what he did — if , say , Henry Waxman had unaccountably spent the summer and fall campaigning against Democratic nominees for President and the Senate — I ’d be torn .
But Lieberman has not been a good chair :
“ A Senate hearing Friday took aim at former Halliburton subsidiary KBR , whose contract work was blamed by witnesses for the electrocution of up to 13 Americans .
But the heated hearing also offered ammunition against another frequent target of the left : Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Joseph Lieberman , I - Conn .
The hearing was held by the Democratic Policy Committee — the seventh DPC has held on profiteering and waste in Iraq since Democrats regained control of Congress in 2006 .
Senate Democrats began the hearings in 2004 to highlight what they called a failure by the Republican - led Senate to oversee war spending .
That the partisan panel continues despite Democratic control of the chamber strikes some lawmakers , aides and watchdog groups as a sign of Lieberman ’s failure to aggressively oversee the Bush administration .
“ The reason the DPC is doing this is because Lieberman is n’t , ” said Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington .
“ I think it would just kill him to say anything negative about the Bush administration , ” Sloan said .
Democratic Policy Committee Chairman Byron Dorgan , D - N.D. , said he is “ not critical of anyone ” but called the DPC hearings “ the only way for Americans to hear about these issues . ” ”
Lieberman , whose committee is responsible for investigating government , declined to hold hearings on the response to Katrina , saying he did n’t want to “ play gotcha ” .
Likewise , he did n’t want to investigate Blackwater or other Iraq contractors .
As far as the oversight part of his committee chairmanship , he was missing in action .
Oversight matters .
It mattered during the Bush administration , and it will matter during an Obama administration .
( Naturally , I ’d be happier if Obama simply never made any mistakes , but I ’m not counting on it , and so I want to have a backup plan . )
Since Lieberman has shown no signs of wanting to exercise this function , he should not chair the committee responsible for it .
Democrats should not be agonizing over this choice ; they should be delighted that they have an excuse to remove a dysfunctional chair from an important committee .
There are two more reasons to remove Lieberman from this position .
First , suppose Lieberman did decide to get serious about investigating the Obama administration .
Given both his complete failure to exercise oversight over the Bush administration and his opposition to Obama ’s candidacy , it would be very hard to have confidence in his fairness , and very easy for liberals to dismiss anything he said against an Obama administration .
And this matters : precisely because I want Obama to be held accountable for any mistakes he makes , I want to make sure that whoever runs this committee is actually fair and credible .
I think that one lesson we can draw from the Republicans ’ time in control of the Congress is that you do your party , your President , and your country no favors at all by supporting them blindly .
I therefore think that it would be a huge mistake to put someone whose impartiality is open to serious question in charge of this committee .
Second , Lieberman lent his name to The Third Jihad : Radical Islam ’s Vision For America . , a paranoid film about Islamists ’ attempt to destroy America from within .
From its ‘ About ’ page :
“ There ’s a war going on and the major battles take place right here in America .
It ’s a hidden war against the freedom and values we all take for granted .
The enemy is taking advantage of our country ’s democratic process , and using it to further its own aims .
Most people , busy with their daily struggles do n’t even realize there ’s a war .
And that ’s just the way the Radical Islamists would like things to remain .
The Third Jihad is the ground breaking film that reveals the truth .
It exposes the destructive aims of Radical Islam and its mounting threat for America and the world .
It covers all the major players – the radical extremists and the leaders trying to stop them .
The Third Jihad will update you on the most urgent issue of our time in ways you ca n’t find in the media . ”
I ’ve watched the clips available on the film ’s web page .
They are full of alarmist accusations against a lot of Muslims and Muslim groups , backed up by things that it would be a real stretch to call “ evidence ” .
I therefore agree with Adam Serwer on this one : if Lieberman believes this stuff , he is incapable of telling the difference between ordinary Muslims and terrorists .
And that should be an absolute disqualification for a chair of the committee that oversees homeland security , since both our security and the rights of American Muslims depend on our getting this distinction right .
I would not support naming someone who had lent his name to the Council of Conservative Citizens to a committee that oversaw the enforcement of civil rights law .
I would not put Lt. Gen. Boykin ( “ I knew that my God was a real god , and his was an idol ” ) in charge of a committee on religious toleration .
This case does not seem to me to be appreciably different , and so I think the same principles apply .
Even though the movie wo n't be out until February 13th , you can stroll down virtual Madison Avenue on Bluefly and browse the trailer , check out photos , and anticipate some of the cool features coming soon ... including the ability to shop Rebecca 's ( Isla Fisher ) closet .

The new turtle species is a missing link between land and water - based turtles
The earliest turtles known to live in water have been discovered on a Scottish island .
The 164 million - year - old reptile fossils were found on a beach in southern Skye , off the UK 's west coast .
The new species forms a missing link between ancient terrestrial turtles and their modern , aquatic descendants .
The discovery of Eileanchelys waldmani , which translates as " the turtle from the island " , is reported in the Royal Society journals .
The turtles were found embedded in a block of rock at the bay of Cladach a 'Ghlinne , on the Strathaird peninsula .
It contained four well - preserved turtle skeletons , and the remnants of at least two others .
The team uncovered four remarkably well preserved turtle skeletons Missing links Together , these are the most complete Middle Jurassic turtles described to date .
The historic specimens are now being housed in the National Museums Scotland , Edinburgh .
They were uncovered by a team from London 's Natural History Museum and University College London ( UCL ) .
" Why did turtles enter the water ?
We have no idea .
It 's a mystery - like asking why cetaceans went back into the sea , " said Jérémy Anquetin , of the department of palaeontology at the Natural History Museum .
" Little by little , we are filling the gaps .
" Now , we know for sure that there were aquatic turtles around 164 million years ago .
" Eileanchelys may represent the earliest known aquatic turtle .
" It is part of a new revision we are having about turtle evolution . "
The Isle of Skye looked very different 164 million years ago
The new species helps bridge a 65 million - year gap in the story - between the terrestrial " basal " turtles , from the late Triassic , and the aquatic " crown - group " turtles of the late Jurassic .
The former were " heavy - built " land - dwellers , with skulls which were " more reptilian " , says Mr Anquetin .
The latter were lighter , and closer in appearance to the aquatic , freshwater turtles we know today .
I am blown away that the team was able to recover such extraordinary material
Walter Joyce , Yale University
What happened in between was a mystery , until very recently .
In the last two years , fossils of three new turtle species , all dating to to the Middle Jurassic , have been discovered in Russia , Argentina , and now Scotland .
" The Scottish fossils are the most complete of them all " , says Anquetin .
" They tell us a lot about how the primitive ' stem turtles ' diversified into the varied forms we see today . "
So what would these " missing links " have looked like ?
Certainly nothing like the marine turtles which are occasionally seen on the Skye coastline today .
The rocks at Cladach a 'Ghlinne hold many ancient aquatic fossil specimens
On the outside , E. waldmani would resemble a modern freshwater turtle - " like the ones you can buy in the pet shop " , says Mr Anquetin .
Head first " The differences are on the inside - in the cranial anatomy .
They are small differences but very important .
There is no other turtle like this one . "
The fossils have now been recognised as a new species , named Eileanchelys to incorporate " Eilean " , the Gaelic word for " island " .
" I liked the idea of giving it a name in Gaelic , " explains Anquetin .
" So I tried to find words that sound good in Gaelic and Latin .
" I chose ' Eilean ' , so the whole name means ' the turtle from the island ' . "
However , the turtles would have lived in a land unrecognisable from the rugged , wind - battered coastlines of modern day Skye .
In the Middle Jurassic , the land mass was much further south , basking in a warm , sub -tropical climate .
The fossils were discovered on the rugged shores of Skye's Strathaird peninsula
The turtles probably lived in a landscape of shallow lagoons and freshwater lakes , according to the authors .
Their claims are founded on the geology of the rocks in which the turtle fossils were found - alternating mudstones , shales and occasional limestone horizons - sediments which were laid down in closed water systems .
Other aquatic species , such as sharks and salamanders , were found alongside the turtle fossils .
But remains of terrestrial vertebrates , such as lizards and dinosaurs , were " exceptionally rare " .
" If [ we accept all this evidence ] , E. waldmani plausibly represents the first aquatic turtles . "
The remains are " spectacular in preservation " .
Their findings are reported in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B : Biological Sciences .
" This new turtle is very exciting " , said Dr Walter Joyce , an expert in turtle evolution , formerly of the Peabody Museum of Natural History , Yale University .
" Keep in mind that a 65 million year gap used to exist in the fossil record between the oldest known turtles from the Late Triassic and basically modern turtles in the Late Jurassic .
Jigsaw puzzle " The new turtle is really quite spectacular in preservation , considering that several complete skeletons are preserved , instead of the usual scrap that has to be pieced together .
" The find confirms that basal turtles were a global phenomenon .
It also confirms my research that the split into the primary groups that we see today did not occur until later than originally thought .
" Finally , although it is really difficult to assess the ecological habitat preferences of turtles , the authors make a compelling case that by this stage in evolution turtles had started moving into aquatic habitats . "
He added : " I am blown away that the team was able to recover such extraordinary material from the icy cold shores of Scotland , an area generally not known for its turtle fossils ! "

Wind power is one of the fastest growing forms of alternative energy in the world .
More and more , wind power mills are seen in the countryside , in large wind farms and for the most part , away from city life .
But a new form of wind power is now designed to work in an urban environment .
From Tanorexia –addiction to tannings– to the bizarre addiction to eat dirt , TV show My Strange Addiction has n’t covered all .
Meet some more of the strangest addictions ever .
1 Tanorexia : addiction to Tannings
Tanorexia is an unhealthy dependence on tanning ; the name comes because of its similarities to both substance addictions and body image disorders , such as anorexia .
There is some evidence that UV tanning dependence may have biological underpinnings like other addictions , such as the production of endorphins as in the ‘ runner ’s high , but since tanning dependence is such a new concept , treatments are still being studied .
2 CrackBerry : addiction to BlackBerry
Hearing a “ phantom ring ” ( or experiencing a phantom vibration ) and constantly checking e-mail are signs of BlackBerry addiction .
Experts say e-mail and text messages may feed the ego because they make people feel important .
Treatment for CrackBerry or similar addictions ( such as an Internet or e-mail obsession ) involves , evidently , interrupting the pattern .
3 Addiction to Cosmetic Surgery
Patients who do not have an addiction to plastic surgery are satisfied when they leave ; addicts think just one more procedure — and then another , and another , and another — will make them look perfect .
This addiction can be the result of Body Dysmorphic Disorder , which is an unhealthy preoccupation with physical appearance or a specific body part .
A famous addict is millionaire Jocelyn Wildenstein , who spent over $ 4,000,000 on cosmetic surgery over the years .
The exact cause or causes of BDD is unknown , but most clinicians believe it to be a complex combination of biological , psychological and environmental factors .
4 Pagophagia : addiction to Ice
Pagophagia is an obsessive need to chew on ice .
Scientific research shows Pagophagia can be a sign of low iron in the blood .
The addition of B vitamins can help increase red blood cell production , and vitamin C can aid in the absorption of iron .
5 Addiction to Funerals
This is so unique , it does n’t even have a name .
Brazilan man Luis Squarisi suffers what he calls an addiction to funerals .
The 42 - year - old man from Batatais , has attended every single funeral in his town for the past 20 years and has quit his job to be able to feed his addiction .
” What set me off was my father ’s death in 1983 .
The first thing I do every morning is to turn on the radio to find out if anyone has died , if I do n’t hear it on the radio I call the hospitals and the local funeral home ” , said the man .
A spokesperson for local funeral home , São Vicente , said : “ We dont want him to go to therapy , everyone expects to see him at the funerals . ”
6 Geophagy : addiction to Dirt
The extraordinary practice of earth eating is well documented by medical and anthropology journals and classified as “ pica ” or “ geophagy ” .
While not being considered a social norm in Western society , the custom is quite common among primitive or economically depressed peoples , and also animals , to augment a scanty or mineral - deficient diet .
However , the practice is most often confined to people suffering from chronic mental illness and commonly labeled as “ nutters ” .
In contrast , in the slums of Haiti , people make and eat mud pies on a daily basis , with the earth being mixed with water and sieved through a cheesecloth to remove inedible stones .
The batter is then formed into pancakes and fried , selling in the local markets at five for a dime .
Fortunately these are not approved for the export market , yet , but keep an eye on the Tesco ’s Finest shelves .
The picture shows Baobao , an 18 - year - old girl from Inner Mongolia , who recently became world famous after eating dirt for 11 years !
7 Teeth Whitening Addiction
Looks like some people can stop whitening their teeth , so much that it ’s being considered a new addiction .
Since bleaching is easy and effective , people can really get hooked .
Two possible side effects of this addiction are tooth sensitivity and gum irritation .
According to a report , in the US alone , people spent almost $ 1.4 billion on tooth whitening products and procedures in 2006 .
Since at least the 15th Century , farmers in Morocco 's Rif Mountains have been growing marijuana , which they typically process into hashish .
For decades , Moroccan hash has been a mainstay of European marijuana markets .
In recent years , production reached a peak of 135,000 hectares in 2003 before declining to about 60,000 hectares this year and last in the face of aggressive government efforts to eradicate crops and break up trafficking organizations .
Moroccan hashish field
But while the half - decade of harsh repression has led to ever - larger seizure numbers , it has also led to ever - larger arrest figures and stoked resentment in traditional marijuana growing regions .
Efforts to reduce cultivation through alternative development programs have proven only partial successful , and now the debate over what to do about marijuana production has broken out into the public sphere .
On Wednesday , December 3 , Moroccan Television 's second station , 2 M , broadcast a live debate on possible approaches to cannabis cultivation called " Cannabis and Hashish : What Approach To Take ? "
Participating in the discussion were Khalid Zerouali , executive director of migration and customs ; Chakib Al Khayari , president of the Association for Human Rights in the Rif region , Professor Mohamed Hmamouchi , director of the National Institute of Medicinal Plants ; Hamid El Farouki , director of development at the Agency for Promotion and Development of the Northern Region ; and researcher Abderrahman Merzouki .
According to a report on the debate made available by the European Coalition for Just and Effective Drug Policies ( ENCOD ) , the panelists discussed three questions :
To what degree have alternative development projects been able to support the populations in replacing their illicit traditions ?
Is it possible to direct the cultivation of cannabis towards therapeutic and industrial uses and , in a general way , towards an alternative economy in these regions ?
What is the role of regional and international cooperation in this domain ?
While government ministers Zerouli and El Farouki called eradication programs a success , citing a 55 % reduction in cultivation since 2003 , human rights advocate Al Khayari characterized that figure as " not realistic . "
He said new marijuana fields that had not been counted had sprung up in various regions .
Merzouki supported this opinion , and denounced human rights violations against farmers whose fields were eradicated .
The law enforcement approach should immediately be replaced by a social approach , he said .
Al Khayari added that alternative development projects tried for the past quarter - century have had some successes , but have not managed to blunt marijuana production .
Part of the problem , he said , is that such products are limited .
Another part of the problem was that the project designers and managers have not taken into consideration the economic problems and cultural traditions of marijuana cultivation areas .
According to Al Khayari , cannabis cultivation in the Rif predates the arrival of the Arabs .
Even the porters of the Koran pray to Allah to protect their sacred plant , he noted .
Professor Hmamouchi insisted that lack of basic infrastructure in some producing regions , a result of the traditional marginalization of the Rif , were a fundamental impediment to alternative development programs .
Hmamouchi proposed a larger investment in the National Initiative for Human Development to develop new projects that could help the producing regions .
As the debate wound down , human rights advocate Al Khayari proposed legalizing marijuana as the only practical solution for the traditional producing regions , a view that was seconded by Hmamouchi .
Legalization should come within a framework that would regulate cultivation and allow for medicinal and industrial ( hemp ) cultivation , said Al Khayari .
Even Customs Minister Zerouli agreed that it was a provocative idea for the historical producing regions .
He said he would discuss the notion in a more profound way with the participation of civil society as a means of reducing illicit drug trafficking .
Meanwhile , cultivation continues , as do eradication and arrests .
And some 800,000 Moroccans derive at least part of their income from it .
Yahoo said Monday evening that Jerry Yang , its chief executive , would step down from that role after the company finds a replacement .
Mr. Yang , a co-founder of Yahoo , assumed control of the company a year and a half ago from Terry Semel , a Hollywood studio boss that he hand - picked for the job .
His tenure has been a tumultuous period during which Yahoo rejected a $ 47.5 billion takeover offer from Microsoft and failed to cement an advertising partnership with Google .
The Microsoft offer was worth $ 33 a share — more than three times Yahoo ’s closing price of $ 10.63 on Monday .
The stock was up more than 4 percent in after - hours trading .
Mr. Yang , 40 , helped turn Yahoo from an early directory of Web sites into a sprawling Internet giant that is used by nearly 500 million people .
But shareholders have been asking whether Mr. Yang was the right man to run the company , which last month cut its sales forecast and announced plans to lay off workers .
“ It ’s definitely a positive from a shareholder perspective , ” Ross Sandler , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets , said of Mr. Yang ’s departure .
“ Jerry has done less than a stellar job since taking the reins from Terry Semel last year , not just completely botching the Microsoft deal , but with poor execution and multiple company restructurings that have done little to restore confidence for any of Yahoo ’s shareholders , employees or customers . ”
Mr. Sandler also raised the possibility that Mr. Yang ’s departure could rekindle interest at Microsoft in an acquisition .
Steve Ballmer , Microsoft ’s chief executive , has complained that Mr. Yang had no interest in the deal .
A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment .
Yahoo said in a statement that Mr. Yang would return to his earlier role as “ Chief Yahoo , ” a corporate visionary role , and remain on the company ’s board .
He will work with independent directors and Roy J. Bostock , the chairman , in the search for a new chief executive .
Yahoo has also hired the executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles .
“ Having set Yahoo on a new , more open path , the time is right for me to transition the C.E.O. role and our global talent to a new leader , ” Mr. Yang said in the statement .
“ All of you know that I have always , and will always bleed purple , ” he wrote in a separate memo to his staff , referring to Yahoo ’s corporate color .
A Yahoo spokesman described the decision as “ mutual ” and “ in progress for a while . ”
“ Jerry and the board have had an ongoing dialogue about succession timing , and we all agree that now is the right time to make the transition to a new C.E.O. who can take the company to the next level , ” Mr. Bostock said .
“ We are deeply grateful to Jerry for his many contributions as C.E.O. over the past 18 months , and we are pleased that he plans to stay actively involved at Yahoo as a key executive and member of the board . ”
Yahoo said it would look for possible replacements inside and outside the company .
Potential candidates include Susan Decker , Yahoo ’s current president ; Dan Rosensweig , the former chief operating officer of Yahoo who is now a principal at the investment firm Quadrangle Group ; and Jonathan Miller , the former chief executive of AOL .
Mr. Yang took over Yahoo in June 2007 and , in the following months , attempted to develop a plan to help Yahoo compete against Google , the dominant company in search and online advertising .
He made several major cuts in the staff .
On Oct. 21 , Yahoo announced it would lay off at least 10 percent of its 15,000 employees and said that its third - quarter net income fell 64 percent .
His most trying period began in February , when Microsoft made an unsolicited bid for the company .
Mr. Yang initially refused Microsoft ’s bid even though it was a 62 percent premium to its share price at the time .
In the following months of negotiations , he showed some willingness to sell the company , but at a price that was much higher than Microsoft was willing to go .
Microsoft rescinded its offer in May .
Mr. Yang then struck an advertising deal with Google that was supposed to bring Yahoo $ 250 million to $ 450 million in additional cash flow in the first year .
Google would deliver ads next to some of Yahoo ’s search results and on some of its Web sites in the United States and Canada .
Under pressure from regulators over antitrust concerns , Google backed out of the advertising deal earlier this month .
Many analysts and investors have suggested that without the deal , Yahoo would be forced to consider one of two options : a deal with Microsoft or a merger with AOL .
Yahoo and AOL , whose business has declined in recent months , have discussed a merger for months .

style= ” width : 285 px ; height : 285 p x” Democrats ’ plans to investigate Bush administration may be blocked
By Charlie Savage
Thursday , November 13 , 2008
Copyright Â© 2008 The International Herald Tribune
WASHINGTON : When a congressional committee subpoenaed Harry Truman in 1953 , nearly a year after he left office , he made a startling claim :
Even though he was no longer president , the Constitution still empowered him to block subpoenas .
” If the doctrine of separation of powers and the independence of the presidency is to have any validity at all , it must be equally applicable to a president after his term of office has expired , ” Truman wrote to the committee .
Congress backed down , establishing a precedent suggesting that former presidents wield lingering powers to keep certain doings of their administration secret .
Now , as congressional Democrats prepare to move forward with investigations of the Bush administration , they wonder whether that claim may be invoked again .
“ The Bush administration overstepped in its exertion of executive privilege , and may very well try to continue to shield information from the American people after it leaves office , ” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse , Democrat of Rhode Island , who sits on two committees , Judiciary and Intelligence , that are examining Bush policies .
Topics of open investigations include the harsh interrogation of detainees , the prosecution of former Governor Don Siegelman of Alabama , secret legal memorandums from the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel and the role of the former White House aides Karl Rove and Harriet Miers in the firing of federal prosecutors .
Bush has used his executive powers to block congressional requests for executive branch documents and testimony from former aides .
But investigators hope that President - elect Barack Obama ’s administration will open the filing cabinets and withdraw assertions of executive privilege that Bush officials have invoked to keep from testifying .
“ I intend to ensure that our outstanding subpoenas and document requests relating to the U.S. attorneys matter are enforced , ” said Representative John Conyers , Democrat of Michigan , the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee .
“ I am hopeful that progress can be made with the coming of the new administration . ”
In addition , two advocacy groups , the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights First , have prepared detailed reports for the new administration calling for criminal investigations into alleged abuses of detainees .
It is not clear , though , how Obama will handle such requests .
Legal specialists said the pressure to investigate the Bush years would raise tough political and legal questions .
Because every president eventually leaves office , incoming chief executives have an incentive to quash investigations into their predecessor ’s tenure .
Bush used executive privilege for the first time in 2001 , to block a subpoena by congressional Republicans investigating the Clinton administration .
Obama has expressed worries about too many investigations .
In April , he told The Philadelphia Daily News that people needed to distinguish “ between really dumb policies and policies that rise to the level of criminal activity . ”
“ If crimes have been committed , they should be investigated , ” Obama said , but added , “ I would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of Republicans as a partisan witch hunt , because I think we ’ve got too many problems we ’ve got to solve . ”
But even if his administration rejects the calls for investigations , Obama cannot control what the courts or Congress do .
Several lawsuits are seeking information about Bush policies , including an Islamic charity ’s claim that it was illegally spied on by Bush ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
And congressional Democrats say that they are determined to pursue their investigations – and that they expect career officials to disclose other issues after the Bush administration leaves .
“ We could spend the entire next four years investigating the Bush years , ” Whitehouse said .
But if Obama decides to release information about his predecessor ’s tenure , Bush could try to invoke executive privilege by filing a lawsuit , said Peter Shane , a law professor at Ohio State University .
In that case , an injunction would probably be sought ordering the Obama administration not to release the Bush administration ’s papers or enjoining Bush ’s former aides from testifying .
The dispute would be likely to go to the Supreme Court , Shane said .
The idea that former presidents may possess residual constitutional powers to keep information secret traces back to Truman .
In November 1953 , the House Un-American Activities Committee subpoenaed Truman to testify about why he had named a man suspected of being a Communist to the International Monetary Fund .
Truman decided not to comply and asked his lawyer , Samuel Rosenman , for help .
But there was little time for research .
Edward Cramer , then an associate at Rosenman ’s law firm , recalled being summoned to the boss ’s office at 6 p.m. and told to come up with something .
The next morning , he helped dictate Truman ’s letter telling the committee that Truman did not have to testify – or even appear at the hearing .
“ I think , legally , we were wrong ” about whether Truman had to show up , Cramer , now 83 , said in an interview .
But the committee did not call the former president ’s bluff .
It dropped the matter , and Truman ’s hastily devised legal claim became a historical precedent .
In 1973 , President Richard Nixon cited Truman ’s letter when he refused to testify or give documents to the committee investigating the Watergate scandal .
Recalled Cramer , “ Nixon used it , and we said , ‘ Oh , Jesus , what have we done ? ” ‘
The first judicial backing for the idea that former presidents possess such executive privileges came in 1977 , as part of a Supreme Court ruling in a case over who controlled Nixon ’s White House files .
The decision suggested that Nixon might be able to block the release of papers in the future .
But it offered few details , and Nixon never sought to do so .
WHAT LIEBERMAN FINDS ‘ UNACCEPTABLE ’….
As political theater goes , the exploits of Joe Lieberman really are odd .
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) has reached out to Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) about the prospect of joining the Republican conference , but Lieberman is still bargaining with Democratic leaders to keep his chairmanship , according to Senate aides in both parties .
“ Senator Lieberman ’s preference is to stay in the caucus , but he ’s going to keep all his options open , ” a Lieberman aide said .
“ McConnell has reached out to him and at this stage his position is he wants to remain in the caucus but losing the chairmanship is unacceptable . ”
A Republican Senate aide said Friday morning that there was little McConnell could offer in terms of high ranking committee slots , which is why Lieberman is resisting overtures from the Republican side .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , according to multiple reports and sources , has no intention of allowing Lieberman to stay on as chairman of Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs .
A Lieberman aide told the Politico that “ essentially what transpired is that Senator Reid talked about taking away his position perhaps for another position and Sen. Lieberman indicated that was unacceptable . ”
“ Unacceptable “ ?
Look , Reid is offering Lieberman a very sweet deal .
By some counts , much too sweet .
Lieberman betrayed the Democratic Party and broke his word to his own Democratic constituents .
Reid is nevertheless willing to a ) let him stay in the Democratic caucus ; b ) keep his seniority ; and c ) give him the chairmanship of something else .
That , by any reasonable measure , is ridiculously gracious of Reid .
It ’s certainly more generosity than Lieberman deserves or has earned .
And yet , Lieberman thinks that ’s “ unacceptable . ”
What possible incentive could Reid and Senate Democrats have to offer Lieberman an even better deal ?
The message is , or at least should be , surprisingly straightforward : “ If you do n’t like the generous offer , join the minority party . ”
It must drive Lieberman crazy , but the fact remains that Democrats do n’t really need him .
He has no leverage .
Or , put another way , what Lieberman finds “ unacceptable ” is of no consequence .
What are those crazy Danes up to ?

SAN FRANCISCO 
The online classifieds company Craigslist said Thursday that it had reached an agreement with 40 state attorneys general and agreed to tame its notoriously unruly “ erotic services ” listings .
Prostitutes and sex - oriented businesses have long used that section of Craigslist to advertise their services .
Early this year , the attorney general of Connecticut , Richard Blumenthal , representing 40 states , sent a letter to Craigslist demanding that it purge the site of such material and better enforce its own rules against illegal activity , including prostitution .
The two sides began a series of conversations about what Craigslist could do to prevent such ads .
“ They identified ads that were crossing the line , ” said Jim Buckmaster , chief executive of Craigslist .
“ We looked at those ads , we saw their point , and we resolved to see what we could do to get that stuff off the site . ”
Talk about a heavyweight champ .
Wow .
The new Mike Tyson , making an appearance at the Video Game Awards on Sunday night , looks a lot like the old Al Roker .
The Brooklyn - born fighter once rightly known as the Baddest Man on the Planet now looks more like the happiest guy at the all - you - can - eat buffet .
So complete is Tyson 's transformation that the mind races with questions .
How many ears does a guy have to chomp on to get that size ?
Did Iron
Mike actually follow through on his promise to eat Lennox Lewis ' children ?
Where is Buster Douglas ?
Because if he 's not accounted for , we know the first place authorities should look .
Sadly , it 's just the latest low in the slow motion downward spiral that is the once fearsome fighter 's life .
Since retirement , Tyson has struggled with bankruptcy , drug addiction , arrests and a host of personal problems .
" My whole life has been a waste - I 've been a failure , " the former champ told USA Today in 2005 .
" I 'm really embarrassed with myself and my life .
I want to be a missionary .
I think I could do that while keeping my dignity without letting people know they chased me out of the country .
I want to get this part of my life over as soon as possible . "
C'mon , champ , everybody knows :
You can't eat yourself to happiness .
Mike Will Eat Your Children

The problem with HD is that is n't not just about resolution but bitrate as well .
It 's easy to get 720 p at a bitrate of 2000 kbps , but in no way is that going to look anywhere near as crisp as the source itself .
This is where you also get companies like Apple and Microsoft peddling their high - resolution content as " HD " , even though it really pales in comparison to Bluray / HD - DVD .
I 'm thinking there needs to be some objective test for determining whether some 720 p passes the muster of actually calling itself HD .
And this really needs to include things like macroblocking , looking at degree of blurriness , etc. before we really get to the bottom of this .

This is the hot new trend of late October : openly racist white people for Obama !
It began with random tales of canvassers talking to voters who plainly said they were " voting for nigger . "
Now , this kind of amazing photo of a home in Indiana with an Obama sign and a Confederate Flag has been making the rounds in the Tumblrverse .
There are more illustrative anecdotes below !
Politico's Ben Smith wrote a story rounding up the stories of voters who " would n't want a mixed race marriage " for their children but are still voting for Obama .
It featured this awesome Paul Begala quote :
" If you go to a white neighborhood in the suburbs and ask them , ‘ How would you feel about a large black man kicking your door in , ' they would say , ‘ That does n't sound good to me , ' " said Democratic political consultant Paul Begala .
" But if you say , ' Your house is on fire , and the firefighter happens to be black , ' it 's a different situation . "
Does Paul ask this question of people regularly ?
He must be a great dinner companion .
For further evidence of racist support of Obama , consider the working - class white Philly neighborhood of Fishtown — where the anecdote linked up top hails from .
The Philadelphia City Paper has a whole feature on the community , and their totally unrepentant casual tribal racism , and their willingness to vote for Barack Obama :
Consider Patrick McGowan , a union carpenter whom I met at Murph 's bar on Girard , just a block down from the Fishtown for Obama office .
McGowan said he was voting for Obama .
" Everyone 's voting for him , " he said .
Would race be an obstacle ?
" Not at all - not for anybody who 's a working man paying taxes , " he assured , adding : " First of all , he 's not all black .
And maybe if a black person gets in there to be president , it'll keep all the crybabies from crying discrimination . "
Sure , buddy .
Thanks for voting !
Chicago Sun-Times columnist Neil Steinberg has an amusing / scary column today on why racists should vote for Obama .
What you want is Obama to become president .
That would make all your dire predictions seem prescient ( that means " knowing the future " ) .
The fear that makes a person embrace Nazi ideology in the first place will be ramped up exponentially ( that means " fast " ) .
And what would Obama do as president ?
He would make decisions , some good , but others bad , and think how those bad decisions will reverberate among people such as yourselves .
They would be evidence , not of the missteps of one politician , but a blanket indictment of the entire Black Race .
Think of it .
The Thing You Fear Most , sitting in the Oval Office , greeting visitors , greeting Girl Scouts , for the love of God !
Think about it .
Posing for photographs with young , tender Girl Scouts , shaking their small white hands , asking them about cookie sales . . .
Think of what that would do for recruitment .
It would n't just be you and your buddy Hrolf taking videos of each other brandishing your dad 's hunting rifle in menacing poses .
You could have real meetings , attract actual followers .
The plan for world domination that you so laboriously wrote out in 11th grade detention would come to fruition at last !
Obviously , you want Obama elected — the nation will soon realize what it has done , the pendulum will swing the other way — your way .
At long last !
Ausgerechnet jetzt !
Ha ha ... ha ?
But before you get too excited over people voting their economic self - interest over their racial prejudices , just remember that Joe the Plumber has a record deal , so America is still doomed .
Just looking at these actual book covers , I now feel like my childhood was somehow tainted … who knew the Berenstain Bears were evangelical Christians ?
The books are selling quite well , with over 100,000 copies sold since their release on September 30th .
Mike Berenstain , who has authored the Berenstain books with his mother Jan ( his father Stan passed away in 2005 ) , said the family has had an interest in doing faith - based books for some time .
“ For many years , we ’ve received requests from folks from traditional , religious families who liked the values in our books , ” he said .
These fans wanted additional titles that were more specifically religious .
A couple of years after the authors moved their frontlist general - market publishing exclusively to HarperCollins in 2005 , the idea for the faith - based books became reality through Harper ’s Zonderkidz subsidiary .
( Original publisher Random House continues to sell backlist titles . )
Eight more religiously - themed books are in the works as part of the “ Berenstain Bears Living Lights ” series .

Can we please see more of Thom Hartmann on the cable news networks ?
Good for David Shuster for bringing him on while filling in for Keith Olbermann on Countdown .
They discuss the Republicans absolute hatred for unions and the labor movement and their reasons for wanting to destroy it .
Thom also has a suggestion for the Obama administration to get the economy back on track .
Read Alexander Hamilton 's Report on Manufactures from 1791 which Thom has posted at his site .
Hartmann : David what he needs to do immediately is read Alexander Hamilton 's 1791 report to Congress on manufactures .
Hamilton laid out this six step plan to build an industrial economy in the United States and we followed it .
We , Congress actually put into place in 1792 and it stood until Ronald Reagan came along and started deconstructing this , followed by George Herbert Walker Bush , Bill Clinton and George Bush now and the legislatures , mostly pushed by the Republicans taking this thing apart .
You could argue some of this started with Taft - Hartley .
But basically the founders laid this thing out .
They had it figured out and it worked .
We built the biggest industrial infrastructure and industrial economy in the world .
For more than half a century , Rajo Devi and her husband dreamt of having a child .
Such was the desperation of her husband for an heir that 10 years into their marriage , he even married Mrs Devi 's sister in an effort to produce offspring .
Even that odd , unlikely measure failed to pay off and he and his wife ( or wives ) gradually accepted they would live their lives without children .
Then last year , with both aged about 70 and married for 55 years , Mrs Devi and her husband , Bala Ram , learnt through neighbours of a news story about a 58 - year - old woman who had given birth to twins after in vitro fertilisation treatment .
They decided they too would do the same .
That was nine months ago .

Now Mrs Devi has become what her doctor believes is the world 's oldest mother .
Late last month , she gave birth to her first child .
Delivered by Caesarean section on 28 November , the little girl and her proud mother are said to be in good health .
On the telephone from her home in northern Haryana state , Mrs Devi told reporters : " I 'm happy .
The baby is doing well . "
But however happy Mrs Devi and her husband may be with their daughter , the event will trigger fresh debate about the wisdom of giving birth at such an advanced age .
Is it good for the parents , is it good for the child ?
Is there a different standard applied to elderly mothers as opposed to creaking fathers ?
It will also focus fresh attention on regulations in India , to where a growing number of couples have turned for in vitro fertilisation treatment because of the lax laws controlling such matters .
Dr Anurag Bishnoi of the so - called National Fertility Centre , a private facility in the town of Hisar , said that Mrs Devi and her husband , a farmer , came into the clinic for treatment .
The embryo transfer was performed on 19 April .
Mr Bishnoi told The Times of India : " More than 15 per cent of the Indian population is facing infertility problems .
There are 200 IVF centres in the country and general awareness is
growing among couples .
IVF has revolutionised the way we look at infertility .
Infertility is no longer a social taboo or a divine curse .
It can be treated scientifically . "
It is impossible to confirm whether Mrs Devi is the oldest woman to have given birth because , typically enough in rural India , she has no birth certificate .
She told doctors that she believed she was about 70 and her husband said he believes he is 72 .
In 2006 , Carmela Bousada of Spain , became what was believed to be the oldest new mother when she had twin boys at age 66 .
Before that , Adriana Iliescu , of Romania , gave birth to a girl in 2005 .
Ms Bousada was 130 days older than Ms Iliescu .
Asked whether the septuagenarians were prepared to raise a new baby , one relative replied : " They should not worry about bringing up their daughter ; we have a joint family and there are countless people to take care of her . "
The M51 SLBM is the French Navy 's future submarine launched ballistic missile , designed to replace the M45 SLBM ( In French terminology the MSBS - Mer-Sol - Balistique - Stratégique “ Sea- ground - Strategic ballistic ” ) .
Each missile carries six independently targetable TN 75 thermonuclear warheads .
The three - stage engine of the M51 is directly derived from the propellant boosters of Ariane 5 .
The missiles are a compromise over the M5 SLBM design , which is to have a range of 11,000 km ( 6,200 miles ) and carry 10 TNO MIRV of the new generation ( Tête Nucléaire Océanique , “ Oceanic nuclear warhead ” ) .
The M51 will enter service in 2010 .
Flight tests
The M51 performed its first flight test ( unarmed ) on the 9 November 2006 from the French missile flight test centre in Biscarrosse ( Landes ) .
The target was reached twenty minutes later , in the north - west of the Atlantic Ocean . [ 1] A second successful test was carried out on the 21 June 2007

" I 've been dreaming about astronomy since my childhood ... so this was a childhood dream come true . "
His dream would capture three planets as it turned out .
Seeing the planets ?
That took a bit more work .
And while there have been " exoplanet " sightings reported in the literature – another is reported in this same Science edition – Marois says his images are the clearest and definitely the first to show a distant solar system .
" So for sure having direct observations is a very big thing . "
Mr. Obama was an adviser to Mr. Blagojevich ’s first campaign for governor , in 2002 , and endorsed him again in 2006 , even though by that time questions had been raised about the possible selling of state jobs .
Mr. Obama has also credited one of Mr. Blagojevich ’s closest confidants , Antoin Rezko , a businessman who was convicted of corruption charges this year , with helping him get his own start in politics .
Image State Senator Emil Jones Jr. , a mentor of Mr. Obama .
Credit ... Associated Press
Mr. Rezko was among the first to contribute to Mr. Obama ’s earliest State Senate race , in 1995 , and later became a major fund - raiser for his campaign for the United States Senate .
Mr. Rezko was known around Chicago as a collector of politicians , and he did not hesitate to make the most of his high - level contacts .
The New York Times reported last year that when he was entertaining Middle Eastern financiers at a Four Seasons hotel in Chicago , he arranged for Mr. Blagojevich and Mr. Obama to drop by , separately and on different occasions , to impress his guests .
Mr. Rezko derived his political influence mainly from his close relationship with Mr. Blagojevich , who relied on him to recommend loyal campaign contributors for state appointments to boards and commissions , according to the complaint unsealed on Tuesday .
But as Mr. Rezko ’s legal troubles escalated , Illinois politicians who had previously found him useful , including Mr. Obama , disavowed him and started returning his campaign donations .
Mr. Obama ’s relationship with Mr. Blagojevich was not much better when he made the decision to call Mr. Jones in September about the stalled ethics bill .
For Mr. Obama , the move marked an unusual return to Illinois politics , turf from which he had studiously worked to distance himself throughout the presidential race .
At the time , one week before the first presidential debate of the general election campaign , Republicans were trying to tarnish him in the eyes of voters by attempting to link him to Chicago ’s history of corrupt politics .
Mr. Obama used leverage that he had seldom employed  publicly , anyway  and strongly urged Mr. Jones to bypass Mr. Blagojevich and approve the ethics bill , banning the so - called pay - for - play system of influence peddling in Illinois .
When asked at the time how Mr. Obama had come to be involved , Mr. Jones replied , “ He ’s a friend . ”
When the Illinois Senate passed the measure by 55 to 0 on Sept. 22 , with Mr. Jones reversing his position , Mr. Obama praised the move as one creating “ a tougher ethics law that will reduce the influence of money over our state ’s political process . ”
Mr. Obama ’s intervention deepened a rift between him and Mr. Blagojevich that had been growing for some time .
When Mr. Blagojevich left Congress in 2002 , he talked openly about the notion of running for president one day .
After he was elected governor , and after Senator John Kerry lost the presidential race in 2004 , he began eyeing a potential run in 2008 .
When it comes to greetings during the Winter Shopping Spree vaguely associated with the 25th of December , I guess I 'm hopelessly old - fashioned .
I say " Merry Christmas . "
Some will think me too retro .
Too bad .
I 'm like Linus from the " Peanuts " cartoons .
The birth of Christ is the reason for the season .
But if someone offers a " Happy Hanukkah " or " Merry Kwanzaa " -- even those timid souls with their safely corporate " Happy holidays " -- I thank them .
They 're being kind .
Yet the other day I was watching TV , and saw something astounding : a commercial for the Illinois Lottery , aimed at getting people to buy lottery tickets as gifts .
It 's sung to the much - beloved Christmas hymn " Joy to the World , " which you 'll hear in just about every church on Christmas Eve .
Here are the new lyrics , as approved by the Illinois political bureaucrats :
Joy to that guy / who took away your futon
And the man who shampooed and conditioned
Your carpets
And the lady who constructed / Your amazing cat tower
Plus the butcher who sliced your beef paper thin
And the neighbor who rocks out softly after ten .
On screen , the carpet - cleaner guy kneels on a rug .
He 's happy .
The cat 's mistress is happy .
The rocking neighbor ( who whispers while singing ) is so old , he probably remembers when Black Sabbath played the Amphitheatre .
He 's happy .
The happy butcher slices the beef paper thin , so you can save on food costs and use the savings to buy him even more lottery tickets .
Then comes a revealing voice - over that speaks directly to the heart of The Chicago Way and invokes one of the pillars of Illinois politics :
Cash kickbacks .
" Joy someone with holiday scratch - offs from the Illinois Lottery , " says a narrator .
" Who knows ?
They might joy you back . "
That 's a kickback .
You joy me , I joy you .
Is n't that what contractors call it when they 're caught on FBI surveillance tape bringing " joy " to politicians ?
One famous Chicago politician stored his " joy " in the freezer , right next to the rib-eyes and the lobster tails .
A Sun-Times story applauded the commercial , from the ad agency Energy BBDO and directed by a fellow named Aaron Ruell .
As a piece of directing , as a technical matter , it 's clean work .
I suppose they could have made a commercial using a secular Santa song , or something about drunken elves throwing snowballs and guzzling mulled wine .
No one would care , except lawyers for the Snowman & Elf Collective .
And no political bureaucrat would ever risk being condemned as insensitive by elves .
Slapping Christianity , though , is another matter .
The hymn " Joy to the World " was written in 1719 by Englishman Isaac Watts .
Many of you know how it begins :
Joy to the world !
The Lord is come !
Let earth receive her King ;
Let every heart prepare Him room ,
And Heaven and nature sing ,
And Heaven and nature sing
No reference to carpets , beef or cash kickbacks .
The responsibility of turning the hymn into a lottery commercial belongs to state government , because bureaucrats approved it and took your money and paid the ad agency .
Using a well - known song about Christ to sell lottery tickets on the backs of happy cats and beef was so amazing that we called Brian Hamer , director of the Illinois Department of Revenue , certain that he'd want to take all the credit .
His secretary said he 'd call back .
He did n't .
Later Susan Hofer , spokeswoman for Hamer , said he would n't comment .
After a day or two of calls , the Illinois political bureaucrats decided in their wisdom that lottery superintendent Jodie Winnett should take full credit , and they said she approved the ad , according to lottery spokesman Tracy Owens .
But Winnett was n't available for comment , either .
" We have gotten a lot of positive feedback , " Owens said , mentioning that article in the Sun - Times business section .
But is n't the song about Christ ?
" That is not the connection we were going for , " Owens said .
" This is a song that is in the public domain .
It 's about bringing joy into people 's lives .
That 's the theme we were going for .
Buying a lottery ticket is a way to thank someone for the little things they did throughout the year .
It ( the commercial ) talks about bringing joy to people , and that 's what the lottery was about .
" The words were changed up because , " Owens said , " we did not want people to be offended . "
That must be why the lottery used a deeply religious song and made a joke out of it to sell tickets .
So they would n't offend .
What joy .
I 'll bet you can't wait for the commercials for those new state video poker machines .
They 'll need a new song to bring joy .
What song will they use ?
How about " Silent Night " or " Ave Maria " ?

And I thought the reason people bought consoles was to avoid dealing with the hardware nitty - gritty .
Xbox 360 Revision CPU GPU eDRAM Xenon / Zephyr 90nm 90nm 90nm Falcon / Opus 65 nm 80 nm 80 nm Jasper 65 nm 65 nm 80nm
First let 's get the codenames right .
The first Xbox 360 was released in 2005 and used a motherboard codenamed Xenon .
The Xenon platform featured a 90nm Xenon CPU ( clever naming there ) , a 90nm Xenos GPU and a 90nm eDRAM .
Microsoft added HDMI support to Xenon and called it Zephyr , the big three chips were still all 90nm designs .
From top to bottom : Jasper ( Arcade so no chrome on the DVD drive ) , Xenon , Falcon , Xenon .
Can you tell them apart ?
I 'll show you how .
In 2007 the 2nd generation Xbox 360 came out , codenamed Falcon .
Falcon featured a 65nm CPU , 80nm GPU and 80nm eDRAM .
Falcon came with HDMI by default , but Microsoft eventually made a revision without HDMI called Opus ( opus we built a console that fails a lot !
sorry , could n't resist ) .
Finally , after much speculation , the 3rd generation Xbox 360 started popping up in stores right around the holiday buying season and it's called Jasper .
Jasper keeps the same 65 nm CPU from Falcon / Opus , but shrinks the GPU down to 65nm as well .
The eDRAM remains at 80nm .
When Xenon came out , we bought one and took it apart .
The same for Falcon , and naturally , the same for Jasper .
The stakes are a lot higher with Jasper however ; this may very well be the Xbox 360 to get , not only is it a lot cooler and cheaper for Microsoft to manufacture , but it may finally solve the 360's biggest issue to date .
A Cure for the Red Ring of Death ?
The infamous Red Ring of Death ( RRoD ) has plagued Microsoft since the launch of the Xbox 360 .
The symptoms are pretty simple : you go to turn on your console and three of the four lights in a circle on your Xbox 360 turn red .
I 've personally had it happen to two consoles and every single one of my friends who has owned a 360 for longer than a year has had to send it in at least once .
By no means is this the largest sample size , but it 's a problem that impacts enough Xbox 360 owners for it to be a real issue .
While Microsoft has yet to publicly state the root cause of the problem , we finally have a Microsoft that 's willing to admit that its consoles had an unacceptably high rate of failure in the field .
The Microsoft solution was to extend all Xbox 360 warranties for the RRoD to 3 years , a solution that managed to help most users but not all .
No one ever got to the bottom of what caused the RRoD .
Many suspected that it was the lead - free solder balls between the CPU and / or GPU and the motherboard losing contact .
The clamps that Microsoft used to attach the heatsinks to the CPU and GPU put a lot of pressure on the chips ; it 's possible that the combination of the lead - free solder , a lot of heat from the GPU , inadequate cooling and the heatsink clamps resulted in the RRoD .
The CPU and / or GPU would get very hot , the solder would either begin to melt or otherwise dislodge , resulting in a bad connection and an irrecoverable failure .
That 's where the infamous " towel trick " came into play , wrap your console in a towel so its internals heat up a lot and potentially reseat the misbehaving solder balls .
The glue between the GPU and the motherboard started appearing with the Falcon revision
With the Falcon revision Microsoft seemed to admit to this as being a problem by putting glue between the CPU / GPU and the motherboard itself , presumably to keep the chips in place should the solder weaken .
We all suspected that Falcon might reduce the likelihood of the RRoD because shrinking the CPU down to 65nm and the GPU down to 80nm would reduce power consumption , thermal output and hopefully put less stress on the solder balls - if that was indeed the problem .
Unfortunately with Falcon Microsoft did n't appear to eliminate RRoD , although anecdotally it seemed to have gotten better .
How About Some Wild Speculation ?
This year NVIDIA fell victim to its own set of GPU failures resulting in a smaller - scale replacement strategy than what Microsoft had to implement with the Xbox 360 .
The NVIDIA GPU problem was well documented by Charlie over at The Inquirer , but in short the issue here was the solder bumps between the GPU die and the GPU package substrate ( whereas the problem I just finished explaining is between the GPU package substrate and the motherboard itself ) .
The anatomy of a GPU , the Falcon Xbox 360 addressed a failure in the solder balls , but perhaps the problem resides in the bumps between the die and substrate ?
Traditionally GPUs had used high - lead bumps between the GPU die and the chip package , these bumps can carry a lot of current but are quite rigid , and rigid materials tend to break in a high stress environment .
Unlike the bumps between the GPU package and a motherboard ( or video card PCB ) , the solder bumps between a GPU die and the GPU package are connecting two different materials , each with its own rate of thermal expansion .
The GPU die itself gets hotter much quicker than the GPU package , which puts additional stress on the bumps themselves .
The type of stress also mattered , while simply maintaining high temperatures for a period of time provided one sort of stress , power cycling the GPUs provided a different one entirely - one that eventually resulted in these bumps , and the GPU as a whole , failing .
The GPU failures ended up being most pronounced in notebooks because of the usage model .
With notebooks the number of times you turn them on and off in a day is much greater than a desktop , which puts a unique type of thermal stress on the aforementioned solder bumps , causing the sorts of failures that plagued NVIDIA GPUs .
In 2005 , ATI switched from high - lead bumps ( 90 % lead , 10 % tin ) to eutectic bumps ( 37 % lead , 63 % tin ) .
These eutectic bumps can't carry as much current as high - lead bumps , they have a lower melting point but most importantly , they are not as rigid as high - lead bumps .
So in those high stress situations caused by many power cycles , they do n't crack , and thus you do n't get the same GPU failure rates in notebooks as you do with NVIDIA hardware .
What does all of this have to do with the Xbox 360 and its RRoD problems ?
Although ATI made the switch to eutectic bumps with its GPUs in 2005 , Microsoft was in charge of manufacturing the Xenos GPU and it was still built with high - lead bumps , just like the failed NVIDIA GPUs .
Granted NVIDIA 's GPUs back in 2005 and 2006 did n't have these problems , but the Microsoft Xenos design was a bit ahead of its time .
It is possible , although difficult to prove given the lack of publicly available documentation , that a similar problem to what plagued NVIDIA 's GPUs also plagued the Xbox 360's GPU .
If this is indeed true , then it would mean that the RRoD failures would be caused by the number of power cycles ( number of times you turn the box on and off ) and not just heat alone .
It 's a temperature and materials problem , one that ( if true ) would eventually affect all consoles .
It would also mean that in order to solve the problem Microsoft would have to switch to eutectic bumps , similar to what ATI did back in 2005 , which would require fairly major changes to the GPU in order to fix .
ATI 's eutectic designs actually required an additional metal layer , meaning a new spin of the silicon , something that would have to be reserved for a fairly major GPU change .
With Falcon , the GPU definitely got smaller - the new die was around 85 % the size of the old die .
I surmised that the slight reduction in die size corresponded to either a further optimized GPU design ( it 's possible to get more area - efficient at the same process node ) or a half - node shrink to 80 nm ; the latter seemed most likely .
If Falcon truly only brought a move to 80nm , chances are that Microsoft did n't have enough time to truly re-work the design to include a move to eutectic bumps , they would most likely save that for the transition to 65nm .
Which brings us to Jasper today , a noticeably smaller GPU die thanks to the move to 65nm and a potentially complete fix to the dreaded RRoD .
There are a lot of assumptions being made here and it's just as likely that none of this is correct , but given that Falcon and its glue - supported substrates did n't solve RRoD I 'm wondering if part of the problem was actually not correctable without a significant redesign of the GPU , something I 'm guessing had to happen with the move to 65nm anyways .
It took about a year for RRoD to really hit a critical mass with Xenon and it's only now been about a year for Falcon , so only time will tell if Jasper owners suffer the same fate .
One thing is for sure , if it 's a GPU design flaw , then Jasper was Microsoft 's chance to correct it .
And if it 's a heat issue , Jasper should reduce the likelihood as well .
Who knows , after three years of production you may finally be able to buy an Xbox 360 that wo n't die on you .
Fearing taunts and disapproval , they kept their love hidden for nearly two years .
But with the Nov. 4 election looming , Christopher Lewis and Cody Horton resolved to take a leap of faith .
Following in the footsteps of generations of adventurers and romantics , the shy young couple from Ohio announced they were heading west to marry and begin a new life in California .
They put on dark suits and exchanged vows on an unseasonably balmy afternoon in late October , before family , friends and the wide Pacific Ocean .
Wanting to give back to the state that recognized his union , Lewis took a job as a physician ’s assistant at a community health center in Tehachapi , southeast of Bakersfield , caring for migrant farm workers .
But by the time they had packed up their apartment in Ohio and returned to California , voters had approved a change to the state Constitution that put their marriage in doubt .
Before they moved here , the self - effacing couple had never even seen a demonstration , much less protested themselves .
But two days after the election , they drove two hours into Los Angeles and nervously joined the throngs marching in protest against Proposition 8 .
The next night , they were back on the streets in Long Beach .
The night after , in Silver Lake , then Westwood and downtown L.A .

“ It just hurt so bad ; it ’s all we could think of doing , ” Lewis said .
“ It ’s all we have left . ”
They are pessimistic that the California Supreme Court will overturn the ban , despite the high - profile appeals by top politicians , including state Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown .
“ I did send a wedding picture to the chief justice and wrote a note on the back of it asking him to share it , ” Lewis said .
“ Hopefully , if they see enough faces , they will realize that their decisions make a huge difference . ”
Lewis , 24 , and Horton , 20 , found each other online during one lonely Christmas vacation in 2006 .
Horton was in his last year of high school in Middletown , Ohio .
Lewis was studying to become a physician ’s assistant at Kettering College of Medical Arts , a Seventh - day Adventist school in nearby Dayton .

“ It was awful , ” Lewis said .
“ We had to take religion classes , and they teach being gay is wrong . ”
He started searching MySpace pages for anyone listing themselves as gay in the Dayton area .
A song posted on Horton ’s page ( Say Anything ’s “ Slowly , Through a Vector ” ) caught Lewis ’ attention , and he left Horton a message .
They chatted online , then agreed to meet at a club .
Later , they went to the home of Horton ’s grandmother , who was out of town .
They put on a movie , and Horton put his head on Lewis ’ shoulder .
It felt right , Lewis said .
“ We felt like we fit in each other ’s arms . ”
At first they met in hotel rooms .
“ Where else could we go to hug or hold hands ? ” Lewis said .

After Horton graduated from high school , they found jobs so they could afford an apartment together .
But they continued to hide their relationship from most people .
More than once , passing motorists shouted abusive comments as they walked down the street together .
Some real estate agents refused to show them single - bedroom apartments .
Earlier this year , Lewis bought the nicest ring he could afford -- white gold with three tiny diamonds -- drove Horton to a park and proposed .
They hugged and cried .
But they could not make the union official .
The only state at the time that performed same - sex marriages was Massachusetts , which requires a couple ’s home state to recognize such unions .
But in May , the California Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to ban same - sex marriage , a decision that did not have the same limits as Massachusetts ’ law .
Lewis and Horton , thinking there was no rush , began considering a California wedding .
In September , realizing that Proposition 8 might pass , they went online to book a Long Beach restaurant and find an officiant .

Horton ’s father did not realize his son was gay until the invitation arrived .
Horton ’s stepmother tried to persuade him to attend the ceremony ; she said he walked away and would n’t look at the card .
He later apologized to Horton for missing the big day and awkwardly wished his son well .
Lewis has been estranged from his father for years and did not bother to invite him .
But both mothers and Horton ’s grandmother flew to California for the Oct. 26 wedding .
The day itself passed in a blur .
But leading up to it , the thought of standing on a public beach , in front of people they had lied to for years , filled them with dread .
For days , they had practiced the perfect wedding kiss : long enough for photos , but not too sloppy .
In the end , they managed only a quick peck .
Yet for all the awkwardness , it was a day they treasure .
“ In a lifetime we both spent with no support for any of our relationships . . . it is so great to stand up in front of your friends and family , the state of California and the Pacific Ocean , and have somebody recognize it , appreciate it and celebrate it , ” Lewis said .
“ That ’s a huge deal for people like us . ”
Advertisement
Back in Ohio they packed up and began the drive west .
The first four days were like a honeymoon .
But Nov. 4 found them at a hotel in Flagstaff , Ariz . , watching election returns .
Lewis slept fitfully , waking up twice to check on Proposition 8 .
By 7 a.m. , it was clear it had passed .
“ It was the end of our last hope , ” Lewis said .
Horton was asleep , so Lewis slipped into the bathroom to cry .
He then called his mother from the car .
“ They just took away my marriage , ” he wept .
His mother ’s advice was to fight .
They abandoned plans to visit the Grand Canyon and drove straight to Tehachapi , a rural community known for its apple orchards , wind turbines and maximum security prison .
They pulled into a bleak apartment complex and collected their keys .
Advertisement
The magnitude of what they had done fully set in only when they got their Internet connected and looked up how their neighbors in Kern County had voted .
Just over 75 % voted in favor of Proposition 8 .
“ It is not an accepting environment , ” Lewis said .
They spent the night under a comforter on the oatmeal - colored carpet .
The next day , they spread sheets of yellow cardboard on the floor and started writing : “ Marriage license : $ 70 .
Wedding ceremony : $ 1,000 .
Plane tickets for family and friends : $ 2,700 .
Our wedding : priceless . ”
“ It ’s liberating to take everything you feel every day and put it on a poster , ” Horton said , “ and hold it up and say , ‘ I do n’t care who sees it . ’ ”

Unthinkable even a few months ago , Lewis now has organized a protest himself .
When he found out that the American Academy of Physician Assistants , a professional association to which he belongs , planned to hold its annual conference at San Diego hotels owned by the Manchester Financial Group -- which donated $ 125,000 to help pass Proposition 8 -- he sent letters to senior officials at the academy , asking them to reconsider , and posted messages on Internet forums , urging colleagues to do the same .
All he could think of was how much money the conference would bring the hotels .
“ It just kind of pushed me over the edge , ” he said .
“ Somebody has to put their neck on the line , and I was willing to do it , I guess , this time . ”

The Russian - designed Ilyusian IL76 Water - Bomber plane has the capacity to carry 16,000 gallons of water , able to put out a fire the size of 10 football fields lined up end to end , in fifteen seconds .
This is over TWICE the biggest US plane used for the job and most planes used for wild fire fighting in the US are much , much smaller and drop chemicals , not water .
Another big payday for the oil and chemical companies - and the bureaucrats and Congressmen who get pay offs from them .

Chalk one up for the wild .
Bear Grylls -- the snake eating bad - ass from Discovery 's " Man vs. Wild " -- just busted up his shoulder during an Antarctic expedition .
The seriousness of the injury is still unknown , as the former member of British Special Ops awaits an official medical evaluation .
CNN 's headline Ticker , a bottom - of - the - screen fixture since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , passed away before dawn Monday at the age of 7 .
Once seen as a cutting - edge way of conveying headlines by some and as an annoyance by others , tickers have become ubiquitous throughout television in the last decade .
CNN's was buried alive in the clutter it helped create and was a casualty of the network 's first major overhaul of its on - screen graphics since 2004 .
The CNN Ticker is survived by a cousin , identified as the Flipper by CNN Senior Vice President of Current Programming Bart Feder .
Cleaner , clearer and more stylish , the Flipper took over after the Ticker was taken off life support Monday at 5 a.m. , Chicago time .
" We wanted to get through the election and then bring [ the Flipper ] out , " Feder said .
" Our sense is that the way people watch cable news , they 're there to get information , so we wanted to give more information without making the screen more cluttered . "
While the Ticker steadily scrolled headlines of wildly varying importance from the right side to the left in what 's known as a crawl along the bottom of the screen , the newly promoted Flipper presents information one item at a time , spilling from the lower left side and remaining static long enough to be read as an entire phrase .
" Rather than deliver it in a crawl , which we found increasingly difficult to follow and read , we do it with one story at a time … so it 's a little easier , " Feder said of the Flipper 's Twitter - esque missives .
CNN 's Headline News , which has always been busier graphics - wise than big sister CNN , also has given up its ticker in favor of a relative of the Flipper , although its version flips up instead of rolling out .
CNN International has been using a flipper for almost three years .
Some may eulogize the CNN Ticker , but it was never universally beloved — even in its heyday , even within CNN .
" It 's a distraction for me as a viewer , " Jim Walton , president of CNN Worldwide , told critics in 2003 .
" I , personally , am not a fan of the Ticker on the bottom of the screen . … [ But ] we commissioned a lot of research , and it was overwhelmingly positive to keep the Ticker on . "
With the death of the CNN Ticker , the network will place a small box with its logo in the lower right corner , which can include market trends , program information and other data .
The horizontal banner that had been above the crawling headlines , amplifying what was going on in the video above , was retired with the Ticker 's demise in favor of a simple label .
The Flipper will switch periodically between the sort of headlines previously found in the Ticker ( presented as white text on a black background ) and information concerning what 's being covered on the rest of the screen ( as black text on white background ) .
Red will indicate an ongoing story .
Yellow will indicate breaking news .
" We did n't do it with bright colors .
We did it in black and white .
It 's very clean .
It 's very legible , " Feder said .
" Part of the goal is to give more information specific to the story that people are watching , again without cluttering up the screen .
By losing the Ticker , we gain more screen space . "
The CNN Ticker 's funeral will be private .
Information on a possible memorial service will not be found crawling along the bottom of the screen .

The Scoville Scale was created in 1912 by a man named Wilbur L. Scoville and was designed to measure the hotness from chili peppers or sauces derived from chilli peppers .
Scientifically , the Scoville scale is used to measure the level of capsaicin found in a pepper .
Capsaicin is the chemical compound that provides us as humans with the hot sensation .
The Scoville test is done by diluting a pepper in sugar water .
Whatever the Scoville rating of a pepper , that is the ratio of how many times the pepper needs to be diluted before the heat sensation is no longer noticeable to the human tongue .
An examplewould be Jalapeno peppers ; Jalapeno peppers range from 2500 - 5000 Scoville Units , which means for one part Jalapeno pepper , you would need 2500 - 5000 parts sugar water in order for the spiciness to be unnoticeable .
The following list contains chili peppers as well as a selection of popular brand name hot sauces accompanied by their Scoville rating .
So Rush Limbaugh , Bill O’Reilly , and Karl Rove all claim that the financial crisis was a liberal conspiracy , generated either by evil mastermind Chuck Schumer or by wily journalists .
Why does such stuff flourish ?
Probably because there is no punishment for it — as long as you ’re on the right , and I mean right , side .
Let Michael
Moore point out , entirely correctly , the close ties between the Saudis and the Bush family , and he ’s blasted as a crazy conspiracy theorist .
On the other hand , let Donald Luskin suggest , in 2004 , that George Soros is planning to engineer a financial crisis to defeat Bush , and he gets to publish front - page articles in the Washington Post Outlook section declaring that there is n’t a recession .

Any thoughts on the duplicate notification problem ?
( ie , message comes in both the stock sms app and k9 trigger notifications )
From : brad
2008-12-08 05:50 pm ( UTC )
There 's two issues : duplicate notifications and duplicate SMSes .
Notifications is easy to fix : just change the settings in either app to disable them .
( have n't confirmed , but should work )
Duplicate SMSes will require me to update it : currently both SMS apps are reacting to incoming SMSes and writing it to the database , so it 's going into the database twice .

I thought of disabling the settings in the stock app , but it disables the notification in both .
Here 's hoping for a mainstream push From : brad

Hello ,
I just found this from a topic on the G1 forums .
Do you have to do anything after you put the .apk file on your SD card ?
Or is it just automatic ?
I made sure to check the box that allows 3rd party apps .
I 'm not sure how to do this sort of stuff , but if it speeds up message threads and SMS , I 'm all for it !

I 'd just wait for the next system update .
One of the most remarkable Christmas - es happened not far from here .
In the First Worldwar trenches near Ypres ( Ieper ) in West - Flanders , where warring troops had dug themselves in .
With water often coming up to their waist , dug in mud and cold , the first Christmas of the War of the Trenches , was to be nothing but misery .
Until a small miracle happened .
From a letter by Rifleman Graham Williams :
" I was standing on the firestep , gazing out towards the German line and thinking what a very different sort of Christmas Eve this was from any I had experienced in the past ...
There had been no shooting from either side since the sniper 's shot that morning , which had killed a very popular young soldier in our company named Bassingham .
But this was not at all unusual .
Then suddenly , lights began to appear along the German parapet , which were evidently Christmas trees , adorned with lighted candles , which burnt steadily in the still frosty air !
Other sentries had , of course , seen the same thing , and quickly awoke those on duty , asleep in the shelters , to " come and see this thing , which had come to pass " .
Then our opponents began to sing " Stille Nacht , Heilige Nacht " .
This was actually the first time I heard this carol , which was not then so popular in this country as it has since become .
They finished their carol and we thought that we ought to retaliate in some way , so we sang " The First Nowell " .
And when we finished , they all began clapping ; and then they struck up another favourite of theirs " O Tannenbaum " .
And so it went on .
First the Germans would sing one of their carols and then we would sing one of ours , until we started up " O Come All Ye Faithful " the Germans immediately joined in singing the same hymn to the Latin words " Adeste Fidelis " .
And I thought , well , this is really a most extraordinary thing - two nations both singing the same carol in the middle of a war . "
Both British and German warring parties , shooting to kill a few hours before , but softened by memories of loved ones , later met in no - men 's land .
It was one of the rare truces in a vicious war , as can be read in this letter by Henry Williamson .
They say we are products of our environments , but Obama , the sojourner , seems to go through various situations without being overly touched by them .
Over the past two years , he has been the subject of nearly unparalleled public worship , but far from getting drunk on it , he has become less grandiloquent as the campaign has gone along .
When Bill Clinton campaigned , he tried to seduce his audiences .
But at Obama rallies , the candidate is the wooed not the wooer .
He does n’t seem to need the audience ’s love .
But they need his .
The audiences hunger for his affection , while he is calm , appreciative and didactic .
He does n’t have F.D.R. ’s joyful nature or Reagan ’s happy outlook , but he is analytical .
That ’s why this William Ayers business does n’t stick .
He may be liberal , but he is never wild .
His family is bourgeois .
His instinct is to flee the revolutionary gesture in favor of the six - point plan .
This was not evident back in the “ fierce urgency of now ” days , but it is now .
And it is easy to sketch out a scenario in which he could be a great president .
He would be untroubled by self - destructive demons or indiscipline .
With that cool manner , he would see reality unfiltered .
He could gather  already has gathered  some of the smartest minds in public policy , and , untroubled by intellectual insecurity , he could give them free rein .
Though he is young , it is easy to imagine him at the cabinet table , leading a subtle discussion of some long - term problem .
Of course , it ’s also easy to imagine a scenario in which he is not an island of rationality in a sea of tumult , but simply an island .
New presidents are often amazed by how much they are disobeyed , by how often passive - aggressiveness frustrates their plans .
It could be that Obama will be an observer , not a leader .
Rather than throwing himself passionately into his causes , he will stand back .
Congressional leaders , put off by his supposed intellectual superiority , will just go their own way .
Lost in his own nuance , he will be passive and ineffectual .
Lack of passion will produce lack of courage .
The Obama greatness will give way to the Obama anti-climax .
We can each guess how the story ends .
But over the past two years , Obama has clearly worn well with voters .
Far from a celebrity fad , he is self - contained , self - controlled and maybe even a little dull .
Lest the White House be revving up its shredders in anticipation of George W. Bush 's departure , a group of top Democratic senators have asked the president 's attorney to cough up a plan to preserve " key documents belonging to the American people " — and any legal theories the executive branch may harbor about their discretion to destroy records without approval of the White House archivist .
The letter is signed by Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) , Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , John D. Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , and Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , high - ranking members of the Senate 's Judiciary and Intelligence Committees .
It cites the Presidential Records Act , passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal to ensure the preservation of significant documents revealing the logic behind important national security decisions .
The senators seem especially concerned about documents in the safekeeping of Vice President Dick Cheney : the letter alludes to revelations in investigative reporter Barton Gellman 's recent book Angler : The Cheney Vice - Presidency that crucial presidential orders related to warrantless surveillance by the National Security Agency were kept in Cheney 's personal safe .
Cheney has claimed that the Office of the Vice President is technically part of the legislative branch under the Constitution , and therefore exempt from some record keeping requirements that apply to the executive branch .
Last week , a federal court sided with watchdog groups seeking retrieval of millions of lost White House e-mails .
DD District Court Judge Henry Kennedy turned down administration requests to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive at George Washington University .
A White House spokesman called the leak of the senators ' letter " a partisan attack by Senate Democrats . "
The Associated Press says that Senate sources acknowledge there 's no evidence that the White House is destroying evidence .
German anti-fascist hackers have broken into the secure forum server of one of the world 's largest neo -Nazi groups , Blood & Honour , and copied more than 30,000 pieces of data .
Blood & Honour , founded back in 1987 in the UK by Ian Stuart Donaldson , leader of the notorious skinhead band Skrewdriver , has been banned in Germany since 2000 .
The Spanish division was closed in 2005 after the arrest of many of its main leaders .
Last week , members of Daten - Antifa managed to break the access codes of the forum and copied roughly 800 MB of data , including information that was only available to members .
In a statement the hackers said that the databases of the server was accessed in a " laboriously prepared cloak - and - dagger operation " which involved a " house search " .
The data , published online in a special zipformat , includes the IP addressses of 31,948 registrered users and information about at least 500 ( possibly even 1,200 ) German neo-Nazis .
German authorities had previously suspected B&H was used by members of the German neo -Nazi scene .
" Some people in the far - right extremist scene are going to get very nervous , " Günther Hoffmann from the Center for Democratic Culture told the Frankfurter Rundschau .
However , police may not be able to do anything with the information , because the data was gathered illegally . ®
Yesterday , Amazon finally released the Content Delivery Network ( CDN ) they had been promising for several months .
They 're calling it CloudFront , and so far it seems to be living up to expectations .
It 's dead simple to set up if you 're already using S3 to store your content .
Both Bucket Explorer and S3 fox have already integrated CloudFront support , so you do n't even need to write any new code .
Just configure a few settings , switch the CNAME records in your DNS , and suddenly your content is serving a lot faster .
How much faster ?
Lots .
Here are my numbers for serving a one pixel .gif file to my development machine here in the North of England ( I 've given URLs that are guaranteed to point to the right places , even after my CNAME changes propagate ) :
Amazon S3 : , ~0s download time
CloudFront : , ~0s download time
S3 performance is all over the map .
As expected .
Amazon never intended S3 to be used as a direct web host , so it 's no surprise that it performs like a big dumb file storage system .
CloudFront , however , is amazingly well tuned .
That 46 ms time remained constant within 2 ms every single time I loaded that file .
In other words , CloudFront is so much faster and more consistent that there is simply no reason not to use it for all your S3 content hosting starting today .
Vending Oddities : Used Schoolgirl Panties
There is no place like Japan when it comes to vending machine weirdness .
You can get a whole slew of weird , but common , items like umbrellas , rice , beer , tobacco , eggs , and even porn , on any given street through the land of the rising sun .
However , in some darker and more obscure side streets of Japan , you can find vending machines selling things that even the Japanese find weird and strange .
One such vending machine that is found through out Japan is the “ Used Schoolgirl Panties ” vending machine .
As the image shows , machines would carry used panties with a picture of the schoolgirl who supposedly had worn them before giving them up to be sold .
Used schoolgirl panties are so popular , that even stores illegally sell them .
As you can see in the below hidden camera investigation , schoolgirls can come into stores like this one and they are paid for the underwear they are currently wearing .
In fact the The Japanese government has identified the sale of used schoolgirl panties as such a problem they actually outlawed the sale or purchase of used schoolgirl panties anywhere , including vending machines .
A commercial was also made to help deter men from buying used schoolgirl panties by suggesting that the panties might not have even been worn by schoolgirls at all .

Prometheus Demonstrates Solar - Powered Electric Motorcycle
September 30th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
This past weekend , Prometheus Solar founder Jim Corning demonstrated his proof - of - concept electric motorcycle at the Santa Monica AltCar Expo .
The motorcycle is a reconstructed Ninja 250 that uses four solar panels which provide 800 watts of power .
The panels are n’t actually attached to the bike .
Instead , they are left out in the sun and connected to the bike ’s 4.6 kW Thundersky lithium - ion phosphate batteries for power storage .
The front wheel cover and extended back keep the motorcycle upright and aerodynamic .
And the bike is n’t exactly slow —
Corning ’s motorcycle can go up to 70 MPH and has a range of 50 miles .
Corning currently has no plans to sell the bike , but perhaps interest in the prototype will persuade him to look into mass production .

The fight against climate warming has an unexpected ally in mushrooms growing in dry spruce forests covering Alaska , Canada , Scandinavia and other northern regions , a new UC Irvine study finds .
When soil in these forests is warmed , fungi that feed on dead plant material dry out and produce significantly less climate - warming carbon dioxide than fungi in cooler , wetter soil .
This came as a surprise to scientists , who expected warmer soil to emit larger amounts of carbon dioxide because extreme cold is believed to slow down the process by which fungi convert soil carbon into carbon dioxide .
Knowing how forests cycle carbon is crucial to accurately predicting global climate warming , which in turn guides public policy to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
This is especially important in northern forests , which contain an estimated 30 percent of the Earth 's soil carbon , equivalent to the amount of atmospheric carbon .
" We do n't get a vicious cycle of warming in dry , boreal forests .
Instead , we get the reverse , where warming actually prevents further warming from occurring , " said Steven Allison , ecology and evolutionary biology assistant professor and lead author of the study .
" The Earth 's natural processes could give us some time to implement responsible policies to counteract warming globally . "
Soils in the far north contain a lot of carbon from dead grasses , trees and shrubs .
Like humans , fungi and bacteria in soil use plant carbon as a food source and convert it into carbon dioxide .
Allison and his colleague , Kathleen Treseder , sought to find out what happens to carbon dioxide levels when boreal forest soil not containing permafrost is warmed .
About one - third of the world 's boreal forests do not contain permafrost , which is mostly located in Alaska , Canada , Western Siberia and Northern Europe .

Global warming is expected to hit northern latitudes hardest , raising temperatures between 5 and 7 degrees Celsius by the year 2100 .
The scientists conducted their experiment in a spruce forest near Fairbanks , Alaska .
They built small greenhouses and identified similar unheated plots nearby to serve as controls .
Both plots received equal amounts of water .
In mid-May when growing season began , air and soil temperatures were the same in greenhouses and control plots .
When greenhouses were closed , air temperature rose about 5 degrees Celsius , and soil temperature rose about 1 degree .
The scientists took measurements in the greenhouses and unheated plots and found that by growing season 's end in mid-August , soil in warmed greenhouses produced about half as much carbon dioxide as soil in cooler control plots .
A soil analysis found that about half as much active fungi were present in experimental greenhouse samples compared with samples from the controls .
When fungi dry out , they either die or become inactive and stop producing carbon dioxide , the scientists said .
" It 's fortuitous for humans that the fungi are negatively affected by this warming , " said Treseder , ecology and evolutionary biology associate professor .
" It 's not so great for the fungi , but might help offset a little bit of the carbon dioxide we are putting directly into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels . "
This study appears online Nov. 3 in the journal Global Change Biology .
This work was supported by the National Science Foundation , the U.S. Department of Energy , and a NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship .
The painting dates back to the 1450s The Archbishop of Westminster has urged the National Gallery to give up a Renaissance masterpiece , calling it " a work of faith " rather than art .
Cardinal Cormac Murphy - O'Connor says that The Baptism of Christ , painted by Piero della Francesca in the 1450s should be in Westminster Cathedral .
" It is a mistake to treat it as a work of art , it is a work of faith and piety , " he said .
The painting has been in the gallery 's collection since 1861 .
" I would like to see this painting taken down from the walls of the National Gallery and placed in a Catholic church in London , " the Cardinal said in a lecture for the Royal Fine Art Commission Trust .
' Catholic treasure ' " It is an expression of the Church 's life and a way into prayer .
I will willingly offer Westminster Cathedral as the new home for this painting , it should be restored to a religious setting .
The Cardinal promised the director of the National Gallery that the church would " cherish this Catholic treasure " .
The artwork , which is painted on poplar , is so delicate that its preservation is ensured by constant gallery care with temperature , humidity and light levels all controlled .
The painting has not been moved from the gallery since World War II , when it was evacuated to Wales during the Blitz .
It is too delicate to be loaned to other institutions
The National Gallery has said that visitors were welcome to pray in front of the painting where it hangs in the Salisbury Wing .
' Different levels ' Luke Syson , the National Gallery 's curator of Italian paintings from the period said : " The National Gallery is a place for learning about pictures , but also for appreciating them on many different levels .
" For some , Piero 's Baptism is a masterly artistic exercise in perspective and mathematical composition .
For others , these aspects are intimately linked with Piero 's ability to set the protagonists of the Christian story into a rigorously , even miraculously described universe . "
" By seeing the picture at the National Gallery , in an especially secluded room which evokes a chapel setting , visitors can experience this masterpiece in any number of ways , according to their beliefs or , indeed , lack of beliefs , " he added .
The painting was bought by the National Gallery in 1861 from the Camaldolese Abbey , now cathedral , at Borgo Sansepolcro , the artist 's native town in Italy .
It it thought it was probably painted as part of a larger ensemble or as an altarpiece in its own right in a chapel dedicated to the Baptist .

All that 's needed now , is a program which replaces the correct parts of the stream - files with the entries from the conversion table
Edit :
The conversion table that is generated by the newest version of the debugger coincides with the values from the comparison file in posting
Edit 2 : I figured out three of the four remaining unknown bytes of an entry in the conversion table .
Also I figured out the indexing .
Code :
The first indexing value in the table is : 0x9900A .
The first entry is : 4A 1A A0 53 64 B1 AA 2D 40 8E 4A 4D EF 4B 6B E5 ( 0x9900A+0x1AA ) * 0xC0 + 0x64 = 0x72D4764 // offset in the big file where the first 5 bytes are put to ( 0x9900A+0x1AA+0x053 ) * 0xC0 + 0xB1 = 0x72D85F1 // offset in the big file where the second 5 bytes are put to -----
The second indexing value in the table is : 0x99C85 .
The second entry is : 8 F 20 C0 11 AA 98 B6 F7 76 EC CB 7E 61 A3 C6 C1 ( 0x99C85+0x20C ) * 0xC0 + 0xAA = 0x736ED6A // offset in the big file where the third 5 bytes are put to ( 0x99C85+0x20C+0x011 ) * 0xC0 + 0x98 = 0x736FA18 // offset in the big file where the fourth 5 bytes are put to
I do n't know the meaning of the first 8 bits of the entries yet ( checksum over the other 15 bytes ? ) .
Anyway , it is now possible to code a program which takes a conversion table as input and then goes through a list of .m2ts files , repairing them .
The debugger is now automatically XORing the entries from the correct segment of the conversion table with the current segment key whenever an event 0x220 is finished .
Also it will now take the total number of segments from the conversion table and then invoke event 0x220 as often as necessary , until the complete table is decrypted .
Once you press ' run ' now , it will run until the conversion table is completely decrypted .
The table is only dumped once , when the last event 0x220 was finished .
The whole process takes around 30 seconds on my machine .

The conversion table that is generated by the newest version of the debugger coincides with the values from the comparison file in posting # 282 Edit 2 : I figured out three of the four remaining unknown bytes of an entry in the conversion table .
Also I figured out the indexing .
So , the whole big file is cut down in blocks of 0xC0 bytes .
The indexing value points to a section of around 0x300 of these small blocks .
Bits 9 - 20 of the entry select one of the first ~ 0x26D of these blocks .
Bits 21 - 32 select one of the remaining blocks .
The sum of both numbers usually is around 0x1 FF except for some cases where the first number is bigger than 0x200 .
Finally bytes 5 and 6 give the exact position inside the selected blocks .

Yugo Art
So I was in Washington , DC , with Dennis after the Federal Webmasters Workshop in July 1995 , and we checked out Union Station , and happened upon this cool display of Yugo Art .
It was the product of an assignment to an art class at the School of Visual Arts in NYC , wherein they were asked to take a Yugo and transform it into something else .
The professor in charge of the class was Kevin O'Callaghan .
" Given this Yugo automobile as a point of departure , give it a new life other than the one it was intended to have " .
The results were pretty amazing ...
This other site has fewer pictures than mine , but it is more nicely done and some of the photos are better .
It also has more details about the exhibition and the assignment itself .
Here 's an article about the exhibit from the Washington Post .
Other Yugo Art
Mickey Schutzenhofer from Staunton , IL , sent me email and said his grandfather Al Sirko turned his Yugo into Porky the Pig , and would I post a picture of it on my site ?
I figure , sure , why not ?

In another sign of the economy ’s toll on the nation ’s health care system , some hospitals say they are seeing fewer paying patients  even as greater numbers of people are showing up at emergency rooms unable to pay their bills .
While the full effects of the downturn are likely to become more evident in coming months as more people lose their jobs and their insurance coverage , some hospitals say they are already experiencing a fall - off in patient admissions .
Some patients with insurance seem to be deferring treatments like knee replacements , hernia repairs and weight - loss surgeries  the kind of procedures that are among the most lucrative to hospitals .
Just as consumers are hesitant to make any sort of big financial decision right now , some patients may feel too financially insecure to take time off work or spend what could be thousands of dollars in out - of - pocket expenses for elective treatments .
The possibility of putting off an expensive surgery or other major procedure has now become a frequent topic of conversation with patients , said Dr. Ted Epperly , a family practice doctor in Boise , Idaho , who also serves as president of the American Academy of Family Physicians .
For some patients , he said , it is a matter of choosing between such fundamental needs as food and gas and their medical care .
“ They wait , ” he said .
In anticipation of Vista 's new hardware requirements — a truckload of RAM — major RAM suppliers like Hynix and Samsung basically doubled their production .
Vista 's anemic sales and the economy hosed them , but it 's good for you .

Every maker has a huge oversupply of RAM — Hynix has raised capacity by 159 percent , Inotera by 112 percent , Elpida by 103 percent and Samsung by 86 percent — that they 're struggling to offload .
They 're all planning huge production cuts for next year , but in the meantime , a massive supply with less - than - soaring demand means that RAM , for the time being , is cheap .
If you 're thinking about upgrading your computer , now 's the time to get RAM .
Check out the prices on Newegg — for desktop memory , it 's ridiculous .
It 's even possible , finally , to pick up 4GB of the usually pricey DDR3 - 1066 RAM for the new MacBooks for under $ 100 , where it was about $ 120 on the low end when the MacBooks came out just a couple months ago .

Blagojevich ( v. )
To sell public office for a profit .
( n. ) .
Corruption of a particularly blatant and stupid sort .
synonym Venality .
President John Adams warned of blagojeviching in his inaugural address :
“ The existence of such a government as ours for any length of time is a full proof of a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body of the people .
And what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind ?
If national pride is ever justifiable or excusable it is when it springs , not from power or riches , grandeur or glory , but from conviction of national innocence , information , and benevolence .
“ In the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free , fair , virtuous , and independent elections .
If an election is to be determined by a majority of a single vote , and that can be procured by a party through artifice or corruption , the Government may be the choice of a party for its own ends , not of the nation for the national good .
If that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces , by fraud or violence , by terror , intrigue , or venality , the Government may not be the choice of the American people , but of foreign nations .
It may be foreign nations who govern us , and not we , the people , who govern ourselves ; and candid men will acknowledge that in such cases choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance . ”

Puget Sound Business Journal : Just months after his Microsoft farewell , Bill Gates is quietly creating a new company — complete with high - tech office space , a cryptic name and even its own trademark , according to TechFlash , a new technology news website launched by the Puget Sound Business Journal .
Public documents describe the new Gates entity — bgC3 LLC — as a “ think tank . ”
It ’s housed within a Kirkland office that the Microsoft co-founder established on his own after leaving his day - to - day executive role at the company this summer .
Is this Bill Gates ’ next big business ?
A Gates insider gives an emphatic no — saying it ’s not a commercial venture but rather a vehicle to coordinate the software mogul ’s work on his business and philanthropic endeavors .
However , bgC3 will also oversee Gates ’ personal pursuit of breakthrough ideas in science and technology .
The insider said the goal is n’t necessarily to create new companies , although ideas could be passed along to Microsoft Corp. ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , or others .
And , here 's the weird backstory :
... State records show that the company , originally called Carillon Holdings , was established in March 2008 .
It formally changed its name to bgC3 in early July , 10 days after Gates left his full - time job at the company he built into an industry giant .
He remains Microsoft ’s chairman and continues to work part - time on projects .
Federal trademark filings provide more clues – describing bgC3 as a think tank , under a generic trademark classification that corresponds broadly to areas including “ scientific and technological services , ” “ industrial analysis and research , ” and “ design and development of computer hardware and software . ”
New Times first reported two weeks ago that the speed cameras being placed abundantly throughout town by the Arizona Department of Public Safety were being " vandalized " with -- gasp -- Post - It notes .
Scofflaw activists hope placing the sticky notes on camera lenses will bring attention to their cause and allow at least a few speeding motorists to escape citations .
An Arizona Republic article states the protesters have also been spraying the cameras with Silly String .
In the United Kingdom , anti-photo - enforcement protesters use something a bit stronger : Fire .
In Essex County , England , vandals have destroyed eight cameras just since May .
But the vandalism appears part of a larger sabotage effort plaguing the country for the last few years .
Motorists Against Detection , a British group against speed cameras , runs a Web site that features numerous pictures of torched photo enforcement equipment .
The site claims one camera was blown up with dynamite , and its home page shows what appears to be a vandal using a metal - cutting tool to chop down a camera pole .
A YouTube video shows one of the U.K. cameras being set alight .
In the Czech Republic , meanwhile , an angry citizen recently took a pick axe to one speed camera ( at right ) .
Though local state troopers warn that Silly String and Post - It obstructions on cameras wo n't be tolerated , they -- and taxpayers -- should be thankful the activists ' vandalism is n't all that serious .

Many environmentalists seem to think that their movement is cool , new , original , and thought - provoking .
They think that their " modern " ideas were invented by their widely promoted icons .
It is hard to believe that they think so but some of them probably do .
Well , the reality is very different .
Similar ideas have been around for centuries and their incorporation within the modern industrial society began roughly seven decades ago .
Let me begin with the following quote :
" We recognize that separating humanity from nature , from the whole of life , leads to humankind 's own destruction and to the death of nations .
Only through a re-integration of humanity into the whole of nature can our people be made stronger .
That is the fundamental point of the biological tasks of our age .
Humankind alone is no longer the focus of thought , but rather life as a whole ...
This striving toward connectedness with the totality of life , with nature itself , a nature into which we are born , this is the deepest meaning and the true essence of ******** ********* thought . "
Beautiful , is n't it ?
You may ask who wrote these sentences .
Was it Jared Diamond in 2005 ?
Or was it Al Gore in 1992 ?
Or Rachel Carson in 1962 ?
Or Alexander Ač in 2007 ?
No , someone else was the author .
It was Prof Ernst Lehmann , a leading German biologist .
You may also want to know that he was the leading biologist of the Nazi regime and the asterisks above replaced the words " National Socialist " .
The words were written as early as in 1934 and I borrowed them from Peter Staudenmaier 's insightful essay , Fascist Ecology : The " Green Wing " of the Nazi Party and its Historical Antecedents .
In Staudenmaier 's text , you will see that the Nazis were centuries ahead of the contemporary environmentalists in their own discipline .
Of course , we 're not talking about one biologist here .
Like Rajendra Pachauri , Adolf Hitler was an avid vegetarian .
His beloved German shepherd dogs had to become vegetarians , too . ;-)
Organic farming in the Nazi Germany flourished and the country was the world 's leader in this activity .
SS leader Heinrich Himmler had his own organic farm and used the herbs to treat his favorite troops ( Hitler preferred homeopathy to achieve the same goal ) .
The national parks in Germany were expanding , especially in the " sacred forests " .
Medical experiments on animals were banned by Hitler himself .
Unfortunately , the Jewish children were exempt .
Incidentally , the previous two sentences are not unrelated .
One of the most important Nazis ' problems with the Jews was that the Jews were promoting the alienation of man from nature : they were " anti-natural " .
What a sin !
We know quite many ideologues who criticize the " alienation " ( and its proponents ) even today : these ideologues usually no longer use the word " Jews " for the " anti-natural " people .
You should also notice , as someone has quipped , that people who want to treat animals like humans also want to treat humans like animals - because these two assertions are logically equivalent .
Himmler , the regime 's chief mass murderer , was actually a strict animal rights advocate , too .
He considered shooting birds or animals as " pure murder " and waxed lyrical about the ancient Germanic " respect for animals " that they may have borrowed from Buddhism .
Himmler was impressed by the ancient Germans who put rats on trial and gave them a chance to improve their behavior .
:-)
The main person who prevented Hitler from imposing much more radical environmentalist regulations may have been Goering who liked fishing and shooting .
Nevertheless , even Goering had to be politically " correct " in the 1930s so he assured Prussia that the years of maltreatment of animals under the democracy were over and anyone who flouted the Nazis ' concern for animal rights would be imprisoned .
Oh , he was so nice - almost as politically " correct " as Heidi Cullen .
At this moment , many green hearts among the readers must feel very jealous but let me assure you that you first have to take over the military , police , and courts , and only later , you will be able to do the " great " things that your predecessors did in the 1930s .
Hitler needed to abolish trade unions at the very beginning of his reign but there was one ban that was even more urgent and occurred earlier : in 1933 , he passed the Enabling Act that regulated cooking of lobsters ( this great friend of Nature hated their screams when tossed into boiling water ) .
A few years later , hunting with dogs ( and on horseback ) was banned , too .
Another activity that kills many people - and that some of the " deniers " tried to justify - is second - hand smoking , right ?
Well , Adolf Hitler cared about it , too .
In 1943 , smoking was prohibited in the NSDAP offices .
It was banned in streetcars in 1944 .
However , the great regulator realized that the ban in the Wehrmacht could weaken his military power so it was always allowed to smoke in their military offices .
Now , let me emphasize that the contemporary environmentalists have n't done the same set of bad things as Adolf Hitler and his comrades .
On the other hand , it is equally important to notice that the contemporary greens also have n't invented any ideas or views that would be really new .
Everything has been around for quite some time .
What many of these people share with Adolf Hitler - and all fundamentalists in the world - is the identification of their own views with the " perfect morality " .
This " perfect morality " must be imposed upon other people , too .
This attitude to ethics is always dangerous .
And it may become extremely dangerous if the proponents of the ideology are given the right opportunities .
In his book , The Green and the Brown : a History of Conservation in Nazi Germany , Frank Uekoetter analyzes many aspects of the tight symbiosis between the Nazi and the green movements .
He also considers the ordinary greens in Nazi Germany to be opportunists .
Well , many of them have surely been opportunists and there are thousands of opportunists in the contemporary green movement , too .
But you should n't forget that for the opportunists to exist and benefit , there must also be an opportunity .
The desire of a regime , the Nazi regime in this case , to regulate human life and to prescribe everyone his or her values and behavior is an excellent opportunity for everyone whose basic goal can be described in the same words .
So it was not really a coincidence that the most environmentalist major regime in the world 's history so far was the Nazi regime .
If Adolf Hitler had avoided the war and the mass murder , if he had died in peace , and if the green movement began to contaminate the society in the late 20th century anyway , Adolf Hitler would surely be viewed as one of the classics of the environmentalist movement .
Unfortunately , he has also done other things which is why most contemporary greens are going to pretend that they have almost nothing to do with him , even though 90 + percent of their ideology has really been plagiarized .
And that 's the memo .
First , the reasons I do n't think that RealPlayer has much effect on actual piracy .
Yes , if a pirate has uploaded your favorite song to YouTube , you can save a copy of the video file to hear the song over and over , but you can do the same thing on YouTube itself as long as you 're connected to the Internet .
The anonymous network exec in the Variety article points out that RealPlayer " allows you to own [ content ] forever on your hard drive , even if the Web site that distributed that content illegally has taken it down in because we 've complained . "
But regardless of what complaints they 've been sending , almost all popular songs are currently available for listening on YouTube so that anyone with a Net connection can get them on demand , and that 's a separate issue , with or without RealPlayer .
So then it becomes a question of whether RealPlayer enables the user to do more interesting things with the song or video , like take it with them on an iPod.
RealPlayer only lets you save YouTube videos as an FLV file .
But as long as doing things like playing an FLV file on an iPod requires an outside hack , that option is only available to people who are resourceful enough to go out and find tools like that ( admittedly not a very high bar , but too hard for many people ) .
So , suppose you define a " resourceful " person as someone smart enough to figure out how to convert an FLV file into an iPod-viewable format .
Then there are two possibilities : ( a ) either a person is not that " resourceful " , in which case if they want content to take with them , they 'll still have to get it through legitimate channels like the iTunes store , or ( b ) if the person is " resourceful " , they would have known about tools for ripping YouTube videos to MP3 , long before RealPlayer 11 came out ( in fact , most sites that come up in a search for " flv to mp3 converter " are just rippers specifically for YouTube ) .
In either case , RealPlayer 's ability to save FLV files has no impact on the market for the song .
I have n't talked about some outlier cases where RealPlayer could perhaps help a novice user avoid paying for content ( if a novice pirate did n't know enough to download a movie from a BitTorrent network , they could perhaps save up enough interesting videos from YouTube for a long plane ride where they wo n't have Internet access ) .
But there 's an easy way to get a verdict on RealPlayer 's impact on piracy :
How much have you heard teenagers talking about it ?
You heard teens through the years buzzing about Napster , KaZaA , and BitTorrent , but ... RealPlayer ?
The cliche among teenagers today is to go " find something on YouTube " , but " and then grab it with RealPlayer " has yet to prove useful enough to enter the vernacular .
Similarly , RealPlayer can be used to rip streams from Pandora , but it 's just hard enough to do it that most people are likely to give up .
Before going into details , I should say that I 'm against anyone trying to circumvent paying for music .
Most of the time when you read that on the Web , it carries this nudge - wink subtext right before the author launches into a detailed description about how , exactly , to circumvent paying for music .
But I really do believe that there is a vast untapped potential of unwritten good music out there , and that it could be tapped if there were only lower barriers of entry for musicians , better channels to distribute music to users , and a guarantee that users would pay instead of stealing it -- all of which is helped by services like Pandora .
On the other hand , I also believe that if a copying scheme can be circumvented , and especially if it can be circumvented in a way that 's fairly easy to discover , there 's no point in keeping it secret :
We might as well push things forward by acknowledging that the scheme is beatable , and deciding what to do about it .
The outing commences : if you save a stream from Pandora , RealPlayer will give you an error if you try to play the stream back from your RealPlayer library .
But if you find the " mp4 " file in your RealPlayer downloads , you can play it in WinAmp .
However , the file as saved will not play in Windows Media Player , iTunes , or RealPlayer itself .
Plus , since Pandora does not let you pick which song you want to listen to on demand , your stream might contain all the songs that you had to skip past to get the one you wanted , and you 'd have to find a utility to edit the mp4 file to get rid of that cruft at the beginnig .
At some point , the effort probably exceeds the dollar you 'd have to pay to get the song on iTunes ( or , if you 're a pirate , the effort to find it on a p2 p network ) .
Again , the " teenager buzz test " is instructive .
You do hear kids these days talking about listening to songs on Pandora , but not about ripping them with RealPlayer .
Where I think RealPlayer will make the most difference in the long run is in its political and legal impact , by legitimizing stream - ripping as something that " real " companies , so to speak , are allowed to do .
In 2006 , Google sent a cease - and - desist letter to TechCrunch for hosting a tool that lets users save YouTube videos to their hard drives .
Michael Arrington of TechCrunch blogged at the time , " I am likely to remove the tool to preserve my relationship with the company [ Google / YouTube ] " , but the tool is still up , and I do n't know whether it was ever taken down at all ( TechCrunch did not respond to an inquiry ) .
Today , there are more YouTube rippers than ever , several of them even running AdSense ads .
( I 'm not sure if that 's within Google 's rules , but I mentioned those sites while e-mailing back and forth with Google for this article , and they 're all still running AdSense ads a week later . )
Certainly Google would look pretty silly trying to force TechCrunch to take their ripper down today , now that Google itself is distributing RealPlayer as part of the Google Pack .
RealNetworks could argue that the main difference between RealPlayer 11 , and the Streambox Ripper that they sued to have outlawed in 2001 , was that the Streambox Ripper ignored the " do not copy " flag present in some RealAudio and RealVideo streams , and thus violated the Digital Millenium Copyright Act.
RealNetworks says the do - not - copy flag is no longer used , having been supplanted by more sophisticated Digital Rights Management , and RealPlayer 11 will honor any DRM - protected streams and refuse to save them .
But how much difference is there between " ignoring " the do - not - copy flag and " ignoring " the Terms of Service for sites like YouTube ( which the program may not be aware of , but which its makers certainly are ) ?
We 've all heard about the First Amendment implications of DeCSS code , the code for decrypting the copy - protection scheme on DVDs , being outlawed in the U.S.
But the Streambox case set the bar for " violating the DMCA " considerably lower -- the Streambox Ripper did n't actively decrypt anything , it just ignored a flag set in the streaming media .
What are the implications if " ignoring " a flag counts as " breaking " copy protection ?
Suppose Behemoth Corp releases Version 1 of some media format , and I release a third - party player that plays Version 1 .
Then Behemoth Corp releases the specs for Version 2 of the format , which is similar enough that it works in Version 1 players , except Version 2 now contains a " do - not - copy " flag , which my player does n't know about .
Is my player now illegal ?
( Well , in this case Behemoth Corp would just make sure that Version 2 does n't play in Version 1 players .
But what about general - purpose programs like Total Recorder that can record any sound playing through your computer to an MP3 file ?
Does that program become illegal if a company releases a new sound file format that they do n't want to be copyable ? )
So I think the acceptance of RealPlayer has nudged us closer to legal acceptance of software that can interact with third - party sites and programs in a way that their makers do n't like .
That 's good .
It should not be against the law to make a program that interacts with third - party web sites in a way that they have n't given permission for , something I literally grew up saying .
It 's brave of Google especially to be distributing RealPlayer along with the Google Pack , at the same time that YouTube is constantly attacked for enabling copyright violations .
A content owner mounting a lawsuit against Google , would be foolish not to say something like , " Your Honor , not only does YouTube host thousands of videos violating the intellectual property rights of my clients , they even distribute a tool called RealPlayer that lets people violate YouTube 's own Terms of Service by saving the videos to their hard drive ! "
Logically , of course , it 's a weak argument -- RealPlayer is universally available whether Google distributes it or not -- but rhetorically the argument is golden .
On the other hand , since that has n't happened , and RealPlayer 11 is pretty well entrenched after being out for a year , the result has probably been an expansion of our rights .
Anyone else who got sued or threatened for releasing a ripping program would be able to point to RealNetworks .
" Look at them , Your Honor , their Web site even tells people , ' Grab videos from thousands of Web sites with just one click ' , something that those ' thousands of Web sites ' would probably not be thrilled with .
If it 's legal for RealNetworks to tell people that , how can it be illegal for me just to have a ripping program on my site ? "
If a small - time programmer had made themselves a legal test case before RealPlayer 11 came out , things might have gone differently ; it is an unfortunate truth that courts are probably more likely to consider something legal when it is done by a large and legitimate - looking company like RealNetworks .
Big companies do well in court partly because their lawyers are paid to make good arguments , but they almost certainly also get more benefit of the doubt just by virtue of being big companies .
I think the time is long overdue for using controlled experiments to measure the bias and objectivity of judges -- for example , having different actors , one white and one black , go into different courtrooms for " mock trials " ( which the judges think are real ) , where both actors are standing trial for exactly identical crimes and their lawyers say exactly identical things , and repeat this experiment enough times to see how differently black and white defendants are treated .
( We already see this , for example , in the disparity of sentences for powder cocaine vs. crack , but skeptics may have a point when they say that 's not a controlled experiment , because the effects of crack and cocaine are different . )
Similarly , have mock trials where a small - time " activist " and a large company are sued for doing exactly the same thing .
I would bet that the disparity in the outcomes of those cases would far exceed any bias due to race or gender .
But since it was RealNetworks , with their lawyers and their NASDAQ listing and their former exec in the U.S. Senate , that brought ripping to the masses , that probably makes it OK for you and me .
It 's not fair , but in this case , it 's a good thing .
Link of the day - Who Is Shawn Casey ?
Is He For Real ?
Thousands of authors write business books every year but only a handful reach star status and the A - list lecture circuit .
Fewer still — one , to be exact — can boast his own action figure .
Last December , the Seth Godin Marketing Guru , a 5 - inch plastic likeness of the well - known marketing maven , joined a line of similar kitschy collectibles that includes Einstein , Mozart , and a popular Seattle librarian named Nancy Pearl .
In the nearly 10 years since his first best - seller , Godin has become a marketing phenom with a string of titles , including Purple Cow , Unleashing the Ideavirus , and his newest , Tribes — written at a pace of almost one per year ( not counting e-books ) .
But Godin did n't reach guru status through his books alone .
A five - year stint as a columnist for the magazine Fast Company helped raise his profile , and his blog , sethgodin.typepad.com , which consistently ranks in Web - tracker Technorati's top 20 , helped him reach beyond business readers .
Across these media , Godin delivers his combination of counterintuitive thinking and a great sense of fun .
" He 's a born entertainer , " says author and consultant Tom Peters .
Godin 's overarching theme is simple : Companies can no longer rely on mass - media advertising to sell average products to average consumers .
Instead , they must create remarkable products and services and let consumers do the marketing themselves to generate a buzz .
In the " new marketing " landscape that Godin chronicles , the balance of power has shifted from companies to consumers , thanks to TiVo , spam filters , blogs , and YouTube .
Dissed by Academics
No one , including Godin , would consider this a totally original thesis .
Patrick Barwise , a London School of Business professor of management and marketing , tut - tuts that while Godin 's writing is " very readable with lots of examples , it 's not grounded in research .
His arguments are oversimplified and overstated . "
But his followers do n't seem to care .
While entrepreneurs are his core audience , Godin 's readership stretches up the corporate ladder , around the globe , and outside the business world .
That Godin 's books appeal to readers like Amy Curtis - McIntyre , a former vice - president for marketing at JetBlue Airways , and also to Jeffrey Reed , an orchestra director , and Anne Jackson , an evangelical author and blogger , is both impressive and curious .
Godin 's secret to resonating with such diverse readers :
He has mastered marketing in the Digital Age .
His blog and books invite readers to join his e-mail list , through which he lets them know about new publications or workshops .
He offers free e-books — Unleashing the Ideavirus was downloaded 2 million times before it was published .
Between books , he also spreads his ideas through speeches and workshops .
The Ultimate Self - Promoter ?
Still , given all the business writers competing for attention , how did Godin reach the top tier ?
How , in the lingo of his new book , has he become the leader of such a large tribe ?
Was it through remarkable ideas .
Or has he just been remarkably good at self - promotion ?
Godin , 48 , works in a light - filled , loft - style office in Irvington , N.Y. , 20 miles north of Manhattan .
Wall - to - wall windows facing the Hudson River offer a calming view .
But Godin himself is hyperkinetic — his mind spins through 70 RSS feeds and 300 e-mail replies a day .
He posts once or twice daily to his blog and reads five books a week .
In 2001 he wrote Unleashing the Ideavirus in five days .
" I clearly have ADHD , " he says .
" Lucky for me the world kind of organized around me rather than the other way around .
It 's such an asset . "
He shares the space with the four - member staff of Squidoo , a Web startup he launched in 2005 that allows anyone to create a page on a topic of their expertise .
There 's no receptionist , and visitors enter a public area with brightly colored furniture and an open kitchen .
One shelf is lined with toys familiar to any Godin reader : the plastic baby figures from the cover of Small Is the New Big ; the wooden Pinocchio that inspired All Marketers Are Liars , as well as the Marketing Guru action figure .
A Stanford MBA
Godin has deep roots in marketing .
After graduating from Stanford Business School at 23 , he worked as a brand manager at a software company , and in 1992 founded Internet marketing outfit Yoyodyne .
The company had some big - name clients such as MCI and American Express , but was spending too long — up to six months — to make a sale .
" So I thought , what if I write a book about what we do ? " he explains .
In his first hit , Permission Marketing , he argues that because attention is increasingly scarce and traditional mass media ads reach thousands , perhaps millions , of people who are n't interested in what 's being sold , companies need to engage in more personal conversations with consumers who agree — or give permission — to accept direct communications , including special offers and new product announcements .
Considered radical at the time , his notion of " turning strangers into friends and friends into customers , " as the book 's subtitle promises , is only more relevant today as companies grapple with how to market within social networks .
In late 1998 , Yahoo ! bought Yoyodyne for $ 30 million in stock and made Godin its vice - president for direct marketing .
" My job was to teach people to think the way we did , " he says .
He soon decided he preferred writing books , which allowed him to play the change - agent role on a larger scale .
Since then , through trial and error , he has developed a winning formula : brief , simple books with eye - catching covers and provocative titles — and no business - speak .
Tribes , for example , is a 147 - page , anecdote - filled call to readers to become leaders of a movement , or " tribe . "
" He 's successful in part because of his breezy style , " says dean Roger Martin of the University of Toronto 's Rotman School of Management .
" People want ' edutainment , ' not some dry content that reminds them of university . "
Learning From Experience
Most of Godin 's ideas are based on his own background , from his days running a temp service as an undergraduate at Tufts University through a ( failed ) subscription - based record label to his years at Yoyodyne .
Many of those experiences involve the early use of new technology :
He recognized the opportunity of Web - based marketing before most people had even heard of the Internet and launched his blog in January 2002 .
This hands - on experience makes his insights particularly valuable in a period of tech - driven change .
Godin 's ability to synthesize and combine topics helps account for his broad influence .
" Some people want a deep dive ; they want metrics .
But if you want someone to take a complicated topic and boil it down to the core , that 's Seth , " says John Moore , a brand consultant and former Whole Foods Market marketing director .
Godin finds patterns of behavior and general problems that exist in seemingly unrelated fields .
He sees Mary Anne Davis , a potter at one of his seminars , grappling with the same problem as executives at Boeing :
How do you market effectively when your products are n't the kind people buy based on an ad ?
And this focus on the general rather than the specific explains part of Godin 's wide appeal .
" The big win is when I say something that 's just vague enough that it 's useful , but people think I wrote it just for them , " he says .
Not everyone joins in the Godin lovefest , of course .
Editors at The Journal of Marketing Research complained that Permission Marketing " overpromised " and did n't adequately explain how marketers should gain permission .
Others charge he simply repackages old ideas in colorful language without offering enough substance .
And some argue his writing celebrates the obvious .
" So he has a concept that you offer something different , " strategy consultant Donald Mitchell says of Purple Cow .
" Every person who 's taken a basic marketing course already knows that .
But how do you do that ?
The devil is in the details . "
Godin 's fans contend his approach is valid , even if nontraditional .
" There is plenty of room for a Clayton Christensen and a Jim Collins and a Seth Godin , " says consultant Peters , citing two other marketing mavens .
" So Seth does n't have as many charts and whatnot .
So what ?
He does n't promise to . "

CNN : Thousands purged from voter rolls in Georgia RAW STORY
Published : Monday October 27 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : Federal panel tells state to let those flagged vote anyway , ballots can later be challenged ; GA sec. of state says screening to continue
With reports of voting problems rife in the media , and instances of vote flipping seen in West Virginia , Pennsylvania and Texas , elections watchdogs are on their toes for any more foul play .
In spite of their activism , thousands of voters have been lopped off Georgia 's rolls .
CNN 's Abbie Boudreau and Scott Bronstein reported :
College senior Kyla Berry was looking forward to voting in her first presidential election , even carrying her voter registration card in her wallet .
But about two weeks ago , Berry got disturbing news from local election officials .
" This office has received notification from the state of Georgia indicating that you are not a citizen of the United States and therefore , not eligible to vote , " a letter from the Fulton County Department of Registration and Elections said .
But Berry is a U.S. citizen , born in Boston , Massachusetts .
She has a passport and a birth certificate to prove it .
Berry is one of thousands of registered Georgia voters who have been " flagged " because of a computer mismatch in their personal identification information .
At least 4,500 of those people are having their citizenship questioned and the burden is on them to prove eligibility to vote .
Experts say lists of people with mismatches are often systematically cut , or " purged , " from voter rolls .
UPDATE : The Associated Press reported that federal judges have ordered Georgia to stop using Social Security Numbers and driver license numbers to verify voters ' immigration status and admonished the state over its handling of voter " flagging . "

Anomalos Publishing , a company that puts out conservative and Christian works and describes itself as “ created for authors who …have a talent for writing but have not found a publisher , ” has announced that one of its authors will appear on right winger Michael Savage ‘s nationally syndicated radio show to compare Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler .
From the press release :
Nationally - syndicated talk show host Michael Savage is set to interview former German member of the Hitler Youth , Hilmar von Campe this Tuesday , November 18 .
The program will focus on similarities , which von Campe sees between the rise of totalitarianism under Hitler and the current social and political trends inside the United States .
“ Every day brings this nation closer to a Nazi - style totalitarian abyss , ” writes von Campe , now a U.S. citizen , and author of “ Defeating the Totalitarian Lie : A Former Hitler Youth Warns America . ”
“ Today in America we are witnessing a repeat performance of the tragedy of 1933 when an entire nation let itself be led like a lamb to the Socialist slaughterhouse .
This time , the end of freedom is inevitable unless America rises to her mission and destiny . ”
Hilmar points to events surrounding the election of Barack Hussein Obama as reminiscent of the way the Nazi regime came to power .
Von Campe was one of a bevy of conservative authors who in the weeks before the election whipped up the fear that Obama was the modern - day version of the Nazi dictator .
In an October 28 WorldNetDaily column , he wrote , “ Socialist Hitler destroyed free society in a few months .
Socialist Obama is close to his steppingstone .
The following is an attempt to clarify the issue . ”
Savage , of course , is an over - the - top purveyor of extreme rhetoric .
He recently questioned whether welfare recipients should be permitted to vote .
Weeks before the election , he proclaimed , “ I fear that Obama will stir up a race war …in order to seize absolute power . ”
In July , he created a fuss when he claimed that autism is a “ fraud , a racket . … I ’ll tell you what autism is .
In 99 percent of the cases , it ’s a brat who has n’t been told to cut the act out . ”
And Savage has already shared his bully pulpit with a conservative who has Hitlerized Obama .
On his October 8 show , Savage ’s guest co-host Rick Roberts huffed :
If you look at world history and you look at Germany when Adolf Hitler was not initially but shortly after he first came on the scene and started making his rise to power as a community organizer , and you look at all the people he surround himself — himself with , and if you look at some of his policies and his guidelines and certain political agendas and even more than that , certain social agendas at the outset , you know , the similarities are staggering between Adolf Hitler and Barack Obama .
You know , sorry , that ’s the way I feel .
I can read and I can look and I can compare and contrast and what I see — the early , early days of Adolf Hitler and the very early days in this presidential campaign of Barack Obama , the similarities are absolutely staggering .
Savage is not breaking new ground by scheduling von Campe as a guest .
But it ’s a signal the say - anything right is not dumping the Obama - as - Hitler argument .
Von Campe , according to his publisher , will contend that the recent election is somehow comparable to Hitler ’s power grab .
Will this stuff play even to the GOP base ?
( Forget about convincing independents with such rhetoric . )
This sort of talk , if it becomes widespread in the months and years ahead , is more likely to separate the brimming - with - resentment conservatives from more responsible Republicans –which certainly wo n’t make the GOP ’s repair job any easier .
But politics aside , the continued use of this hysterical rhetoric raises this question : do these agitators who liken the historic 2008 election to Hitler ’s putsch hate America ?
Interviews with two dozen former employees , mortgage brokers , real estate agents and appraisers reveal the relentless pressure to churn out loans that produced such results .
While that sample may not fully represent a bank with tens of thousands of people , it does reflect the views of employees in WaMu mortgage operations in California , Florida , Illinois and Texas .
Their accounts are consistent with those of 89 other former employees who are confidential witnesses in a class action filed against WaMu in federal court in Seattle by former shareholders .
According to these accounts , pressure to keep lending emanated from the top , where executives profited from the swift expansion  not least , Kerry K. Killinger , who was WaMu ’s chief executive from 1990 until he was forced out in September .
Between 2001 and 2007 , Mr. Killinger received compensation of $ 88 million , according to the Corporate Library , a research firm .
He declined to respond to a list of questions , and his spokesman said he was unavailable for an interview .
During Mr. Killinger ’s tenure , WaMu pressed sales agents to pump out loans while disregarding borrowers ’ incomes and assets , according to former employees .
The bank set up what insiders described as a system of dubious legality that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than $ 10,000 for bringing in borrowers , sometimes making the agents more beholden to WaMu than they were to their clients .
WaMu gave mortgage brokers handsome commissions for selling the riskiest loans , which carried higher fees , bolstering profits and ultimately the compensation of the bank ’s executives .
WaMu pressured appraisers to provide inflated property values that made loans appear less risky , enabling Wall Street to bundle them more easily for sale to investors .
“ It was the Wild West , ” said Steven M. Knobel , a founder of an appraisal company , Mitchell , Maxwell & Jackson , that did business with WaMu until 2007 .
“ If you were alive , they would give you a loan .
Actually , I think if you were dead , they would still give you a loan . ”

Swiss Company to Launch Solar Powered Submarine
November 24th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
Swiss company BKW has revealed that it plans to launch a 20 - 30 meter long solar - powered submarine .
The vessel , to be used as a tourist attraction , will feature a huge ‘ living - room ’ style passenger area , as well as 60 - 70 cm viewing portholes .
Under the plan , called Project Goldfish , a team of engineers will build a submarine , capable of carrying 20 - 30 passengers and two crew , at a depth of up to 300 meters across Lake Thun .
Since it operates underwater , the team has figured that it ’s pointless to attach solar panels on the sub itself .
Instead , the vessel will fully recharge at a floating solar platform on the surface of the lake , decked out with 300 m2 of solar collectors capable of supplying up to 30 kW of renewable energy .
When required , the solar platform will be automatically hooked up with the sub via GPS .
A zero-emission solar - powered shuttle will also ferry passengers to and from the shore and the boarding platform .
Following a successful feasibility study , BKW will build a team of investment partners .
The company envisages that the scheme will become fully operational in 2012 .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- Pakistani troops have been moved to the Indian border amid fears of an Indian ground incursion , two Pakistani military officials told CNN on Friday .

The troops were deployed from Pakistan 's western border with Afghanistan , where forces have been battling Taliban and al Qaeda militants in North West Frontier Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas .
Pakistan 's armed forces have been on high alert in anticipation of a possible conflict with India following last month 's terrorist attacks in Mumbai , which killed 160 people .
India believes the 10 men who carried out the attacks were trained at a terrorist camp in the Pakistani - controlled part of Kashmir .
A senior official said the troops had been moved from areas where there are no active military operations , and emphasized that troop levels have not been depleted in areas where soldiers are battling militants , such as the Swat Valley and near Peshawar , capital of the North West region .
In addition to the move , leave for all military personnel has been restricted and all troops were called back to active duty , the senior official said .
Asked for a reaction to the development , Husain Haqqani , Pakistani ambassador to the United States , said , " Pakistan does not seek war , but we need to be vigilant against threats of war emanating from the other side of our eastern border . "
He said Pakistan 's conduct since the Mumbai attack " has been consistent with international expectations .
There is no justification for threats against Pakistan . "
" Pakistan is also a victim of terrorism and will continue to act against terrorists , " he added .
" We are a country of rule of law and need evidence to prosecute anyone for the crime of terrorism . "
U.S. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the United States has been " in close contact " with India and Pakistan in probing the Mumbai attack and fighting terror .
He is hoping that " both sides will avoid taking steps that will unnecessarily raise tensions during these already tense times . "
In London , England , Pakistani envoy to Britain Wajid Shamsul Hasan countered the report , noting that winter redeployments are normal and that only police and not the army had their vacation canceled .
While he criticized India 's " coercive diplomacy " and regretted India 's " war hysteria , " he underscored the fact that the two countries do n't want to go to war .
Tensions increased between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan following the November 26 attacks in Mumbai , where militants launched a coordinated strike against luxury hotels , a Jewish center and other targets .
India has criticized Islamabad for not doing enough to counter terrorism , and it has accused elements within the Pakistan government and military of complicity in fueling terrorism in the region .
On Thursday , Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi warned India to refrain from launching any strikes against Pakistan , according to a report in The Nation newspaper .
Another unnamed Pakistani military official told CNN that the Pakistani military has been taking precautionary measures to safeguard borders in the face of mounting military threats from India over the Mumbai attacks .
" Naturally , you have to take certain steps to stem that expected tide of Indian operations , " he said , " You can't fight on both fronts so we have redeployed certain military elements from the western border to the northern border to meet Indian operations . "
The official said that while Pakistan has tolerated U.S. missile strikes from Afghanistan into Pakistan , he believes the government and public would not stand for an Indian incursion .
In the Indian capital of New Delhi on Friday , three military chiefs briefed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the security situation .
An Indian officer said Indian soldiers have spotted Pakistani troop movements along the Line of Control in Kashmir .
The Line of Control divides the disputed region between the area controlled by India and the area administered by Pakistan .
Indian defense spokesman Sitanshu Kar said India is n't carrying out a troop buildup along its western borders but " is monitoring the situation closely . "
He also said he is " not aware " of military reports about Pakistani troop mobilization along the Indian border .
" But we are keeping a vigil , " Kar said .
Since the division of the subcontinent in 1947 , India and Pakistan have fought three wars , including two over the disputed territory of Kashmir -- now wracked by an 18 - year , bloody separatist campaign that authorities say has left at least 43,000 dead .
There also was a limited border conflict in 1999 between the countries in Kashmir .

All About Pakistan • India
LOS ANGELES – Two months before she committed suicide in 2006 , a 13 - year - old girl at the center of a landmark cyberbullying case was the happiest her parents had seen her in a long time .
Tina Meier , testifying in a U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday afternoon , described to jurors how her daughter Megan was diagnosed with attention - deficit disorder and depression in the third grade and had spent years taking prescription medication and battling low self - esteem exacerbated by bullying schoolmates .
Megan 's spirits lifted when she switched schools in August 2006 , her mother said .
The teen 's outlook improved even more a month later when a " hot " 16 - year - old boy named " Josh Evans " contacted her out of the blue through her MySpace page and told her he wanted to become her friend .
Less than a month later , " Josh " turned on Megan .
He joined others taunting her with cruel and venomous comments .
After he sent her a message saying , " the world would be a better place without you , " Megan responded , " You are the kind of boy a girl would kill herself over . "
Thirty minutes later , she hanged herself in her bedroom closet with a belt .
The defendant in the case , 49 - year - old Lori Drew , is charged with violating MySpace 's terms of service by conspiring with her daughter and an assistant to set up the hoax " Josh Evans " account and torment Megan .
Ashley Grills , a then - 18 - year - old woman employed by Drew and her husband , has admitted sending the final message to Megan while posing as Evans .
Grills has been granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for her cooperation with the government , and is scheduled to testify against Drew .
As Meier described her daughter 's end , several family members sitting in the courtroom 's front row – including her ex-husband Ron Meier , and aunt Vicki Dunn – sobbed and dabbed their eyes with Kleenex .
Two of the male jurors brought their hands to their chins , listening intently , but there was little to indicate how the jury of six men and six women absorbed the testimony .
Defense attorney H. Dean Steward called Meier 's testimony " totally improper in a computer fraud case . "
Meier took the stand Wednesday following opening statements , and testimony by another witness .
Susan Prouty , a 34 - year - old former business client of Lori Drew , said Drew confessed to her that she had created the MySpace profile used to harass Megan .
According to Prouty ,
Drew also admitted writing some of the messages " Josh " sent to the girl .
Defense lawyer Steward maintains that Drew did not use or create the
MySpace account , and on cross examination , he challenged Prouty 's testimony , zeroing in on the notion that Drew would have shared so much information with a purely - professional associate .
He asked if Prouty might have confused what she'd heard from other people , or in media reports , with what Drew told her .
Prouty said she had not confused the two .
Then Meier took the stand .
Asked to describe her late daughter , Meier called Megan " bubbly " and " energetic " with a " huge sense of humor . "
But Megan also had problems .
She took prescription medication for
ADD and depression , and saw a psychologist on a regular basis , right up until her death .
Megan also suffered from self - esteem and body - image issues , believing herself to be fat in comparison to other girls .
In
2005 , Megan scratched " small marks " onto her wrists , Meier testified .
The medication and counseling did n't entirely address problems that
Megan was having in the world .
Her mother testified that she was taunted and bullied at school and that she stopped eating lunch because boys at school would stand behind her and call her fat .
When prosecutor Thomas O'Brien asked if Megan liked boys , Meier smiled for the first time on the stand and said she " definitely liked boys , "
and had pictures of them on her walls .
She described how Megan and Sarah Drew – Lori Drew 's daughter – became friends in the fourth grade ; the two families lived only four doors apart .
Megan joined the
Drews on at least three family outings and vacations to visit their relatives .
But as they got older , their relationship ran hot - and - cold in a manner typical for teenage girls .
Significantly , Meier said that Drew was aware of Megan 's mental health issues , because they discussed them a number of times .
Furthermore , when Megan accompanied the Drew family on outings , Lori Drew was responsible for ensuring that Megan took her medication .
In eighth grade , the Meiers decided to remove Megan from her public school and send her to a private Catholic school instead .
Drew was " not happy " about the move , Meier said .
But after the change , Megan 's grades improved , as well as her attitude , and she was allowed to open a MySpace account to stay in contact with friends – though under strict restrictions .
It had to be a private account , so no one could view Megan 's profile unless they were approved by Megan and her parents .
Only her parents held the password , and Megan was allowed to use the account only when one of them was in the room .
Megan 's parents also had monitoring software installed to track web sites Megan visited , and instant messages she exchanged with people .
On September 20 , 2006 , not long after she signed up , Megan got a friend request from " Josh Evans " .
Meier asked her daughter if she knew him .
Megan said she did n't , but thought he might be a friend - of - a- friend , and Meier gave her permission to add him to her friends list .
Megan was instantly smitten .
Evans told her she was cute .
Coming from an attractive and mysterious boy , the praise was catnip to a young girl suffering from self - esteem issues .
Meier later became suspicious of " Josh " because as her daughter 's correspondence with him progressed , he made excuses about why he could n't meet up with her in perso or call her , and at one point appeared to make a sexually suggestive remark .
Fearing he might be an adult , Meier contacted the St. Charles
County sheriff department 's cyberdivision about investigating the issue , but was rebuffed .
Then on October 15 , Josh sent Megan a message saying that he did n't want to be friends anymore .
The next day , Josh told her he'd heard she was n't nice to her friends , and that 's why he wanted to sever their ties .
Megan became upset and Meier , who had to leave the house to take her other daughter to an orthodontist appointment , told Megan to shut down the computer .
Megan did n't do as she was told , however , and got embroiled in an electronic brawl when at least two other people began attacking her online , culminating in the final message from " Josh " .
When Meier came home she found Megan still online and in tears .
When she appealed to her mother for support , Meier chastised her for being on the computer when she 'd been instructed to shut it down , and suggested that Megan had brought some of the attacks on herself by continuing to communicate with her attackers .
Megan , in mental anguish at this point , told her mother , " You 're supposed to be my mom .
You 're supposed to be on my side . "
Thirty minutes later , Megan hanged herself , Meier testified .
At this point in Meier 's testimony , Judge Wu called for the proceedings to break for the day .
After jurors were escorted from the courtroom , Steward asked for a mistrial .
Wu denied the request , and told Steward that if he'd found Meier 's testimony objectionable , then he could have objected to it at the time .
" I would have sustained
[ those objections ] , " he said .
The trial resumes Thursday , when Meier is scheduled to be cross-examined .
__Update : __On cross examination Thursday morning , Drew 's lawyer asked Meier about a trio of medications Megan had been taking at the time of her death .
One of them , the antidepressant citalopram , has a reported side affect of contributing to suicidal behavior in children and adolescents suffering from depression , he noted .
Defense attorney H. Dean Steward went on to grill Meier about a different MySpace incident he says occurred in December 2005 , six months before the Meiers began closely controlling Megan 's internet use .
At that time , Megan created a MySpace profile as an 18 - year - old woman , and swapped sexually - charged banter with other users , he said , citing notes he'd obtained from Megan 's psychologist .
Meier had no recollection of the MySpace account .
" Do n't you remember her portraying herself as an 18 - year old , ten months earlier ? , " Steward asked .
" Obviously , I do n't , " said Meier .
Steward 's point : by lying about her age , Megan herself had committed the same terms - of - service violation that Drew is now facing felony prosecution over .
He introduced this theme earlier in his cross examination , asking Meier if she 'd read MySpace 's contract before allowing Megan to establish the MySpace profile through which she befriended " Josh . "
MySpace does n't allow users under the age of 14 .
Meier answered that she had read every word of the contract , even though it took some 25 minutes .
She once worked for a law firm , she said , and had learned to read any contract carefully before agreeing to it .
In this case , Meier saw no harm in letting Megan sign up while only 13 , because she'd be turning 14 in about a month - and - a - half .
Also in December 2005 , Steward said , Megan had been complaining to Sarah that her parents were fighting , and it was depressing her .
She hinted at suicide in some of those conversations , according to Steward , who read from an e-mail Megan allegedly sent to Sarah .
" I think I 'm going to do suicide tonight .
I ca n't take it any more . "
Megan , in other words , was a troubled girl with a long history of problems , who had discussed suicide nearly a year before the MySpace hoax .
Meier said she never saw such an e-mail .

Although most of Google 's software is available for the Mac , the company 's Picasa photo application has been conspicuously absent .
There has n't been much in the way of Mac news related to Picasa , either , but some news appeared this week that is putting Picasa back in the minds of Mac users .
According to an AppleInsider source , a Mac version of the software is not only coming , but is already undergoing internal beta testing at Google .
Google said in January that a Mac version of Picasa would be coming sometime in 2008 , but given the lack of news since then , it did n't look as though that prediction would come true .
Based on this new rumor , though , there seems to be a pretty good chance that Picasa will appear before 2009 .
Internal beta testing has supposedly " just begun , " and it 's unclear just how long that period will take .
Since the company is n't exactly shy about releasing software with a beta label , I think a few weeks of internal testing followed by the release of a public beta sounds plausible .
A release sometime in January is also possible if Google decides things need a bit more time to stew .
Our own David Chartier had good things to say about the newest version of the application , Picasa 3 , and the Mac version of Picasa will provide iPhoto with a bit of competition by providing a reasonable alternative to Apple 's application .
I 'm sure a good number of Mac users will be happy to see Picasa appear , so hopefully Google will get it out the door as soon as possible .

Today ’s title is a play off of Stuart Halloway ’s current series of blog posts titled Java. next .
Stuart is focusing his series on the set of languages that run on the JVM and are looking to replace ( or if not replace , then gain dominance alongside ) Java .
In the third part of the series , Dispatch , Stuart writes about ways the Java . next languages dynamically choose behavior , one such way being with the switch statement .
Stuart provides examples in Ruby ( technically he should have used JRuby ) , Groovy , Clojure , and Scala .
Stuart explores further than just the switch statement , but it was the switch statement example that caught my eye .
The example for each language is a simple piece of code that takes a grade ( either numeric or letter ) and returns the letter equivalent .
If passed a 95 , the code returns A . If passed 55 , it returns F . If passed B , it returns B .
If passed something that does n’t equate to a valid grade , it throws an error .
I could n’t resist coding it in Erlang .
Here is what I came up with :
- module ( grades ) . - export ( [ grades / 1 ] ) .
grades ( N ) -> case N of N when is_integer ( N ) , N >= 90 -> " A " ; N when is_integer ( N ) , N >= 80 -> " B " ; N when is_integer ( N ) , N >= 70 -> " C " ; N when is_integer ( N ) , N >= 60 -> " D " ; N when is_integer ( N ) , N >= 0 -> " F " ; " A " -> " A " ; " a " -> " A " ; " B " -> " B " ; " b " -> " B " ; " C " -> " C " ; " c " -> " C " ; " D " -> " D " ; " d " -> " D " ; " F " -> " F " ; " f " -> " F " ; N when true -> throw ( " Not a valid grade " ) end .
Now for the embarrassing admission : this code took me way longer to complete than it should have .
I could n’t remember the proper syntax for anything and I kept attempting to code Erlang like I was coding Python .
I ’m sure it ’s not done the Erlang way and that I ’ve missed someway to make it more compact .
However , the code does work .
If you have a better solution , please submit it in the comments .
If something can be improved , I always welcome knowing how .
As part of a $ 129 - million plan , the Saskatchewan government has pledged to make high - speed internet accessible to everyone in the province within three years .
Premier Brad Wall , who made the announcement at a news conference Wednesday morning , likened the plan to the " last spike " when the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed .
To make it happen , the government is giving $ 90 million to the Crown - owned phone company , SaskTel for a program to improve rural telecommunications infrastructure .
Currently , about 86 per cent of the population has access to high - speed internet .
SaskTel plans to get to 100 per cent through a combination of wireless and satellite technology .
The program will also see construction of 50 new cellphone towers , increasing cell coverage from the current 96 per cent to 98 per cent .
" It will arguably be the best network in the world , " SaskTel president Robert Watson said .
" We will have this done as quickly as possible . "
Wall said he 's heard from many people in rural Saskatchewan about spotty cellular coverage and the government is going to change that .
It 's the first major announcement on SaskTel since the goverment declared it was changing its policies on Crown investments to focus on in - province opportunities .
While in opposition , the Saskatchewan Party had been highly critical of such out - of - province SaskTel subsidiaries as B.C. - based Navigata , a money - loser for a number of years .
Within Saskatchewan , SaskTel has been criticized from time to time for expanding into areas that are n't traditional for a government - owned phone company — like television and burglar alarms .
Asked by a reporter if the $ 90 million being given to SaskTel amounted to unfair subsidization , Crown Corporations Minister Ken Cheveldayoff said it was n't .
Of the 187 communities that are scheduled to receive the internet upgrade , only three are currently served by a non-SaskTel provider , he said .
There will also be many opportunities for private contractors to bid on the work as the three - year project proceeds , he said .
The announcement was attracting interest from around the country .
" We are excited to see a government define broadband connectivity as important element of public infrastructure , " Iain Grant , president of telecommunications consultancy SeaBoard Group , said in an e-mail message to CBC News .
" This initiative will bring Saskatchewan to [ the ] forefront of North America ( where we 'd argue it already almost was ) .
One hundred per cent is a pretty ambitious goal , especially in a territory as big and as disseminated as Saskatchewan . "
Congratulations , once again , to the Obama family !
They ’ve welcomed a second pup into the White House .
Here ’s a tweet from Mrs. Obama showing a picture of the Portuguese water hound pair .
So excited to introduce the newest member of the Obama family — our puppy , Sunny !
http://t.co/3lsNwsOTCn —mo pic.twitter.com/KKO9NTmgha
— FLOTUS ( @FLOTUS ) August 19 , 2013
Bo , the first Obama First Dog , was a gift from the late Senator Ted Kennedy .
The Obama girls , Sasha and Malia , had been asking for a dog back in 2008 .
Then candidate Obama said the family would bring home a dog following the election .
He kept his promise and home happened to be the White House .
There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth at the time because the rescue world had hoped that the nation ’s canine bully pulpit might be available to an actual bully , and an adopted one at that , or at least to an adopted dog of some description .
Alas ,
Bo was from the same breeder as Senator Kennedy ’s Portuguese water dog – the same litter in fact .
Just as with Bo , the Obamas looked to a breeder to source Sunny .
Disappointing , but hey , chastising the Obamas for not adopting their pets is getting kind of old .
We ’ve done it before , and clearly it did n’t get us anywhere .
I think we all agree that the preference would have been for the Obamas to adopt their second pup from a rescue group or shelter .
Of course , the benefit to the leader of the free world for adopting would be immeasurable , but at least Sunny came from a hobby breeder rather than a puppy mill operation , a pet store or via the Internet .
And given the history of presidential pets – Herbert Hoover had two crocodiles that he liked to frighten selected guests with , Calvin Coolidge had a pygmy hippo , Lyndon Johnson famously lifted his beagle by the ears to get Him ( that was the dog ’s name ) to howl , George H.W. Bush ’s dog Millie actually had pups while in office , and the junior George W’s Barney pooped on camera – the Obamas are n't doing too badly .
Apparently , the Obama girls felt that Bo was not getting enough canine socialization behind the White House gates and had been pitching President Dad for another dog last year .
The president said , following his win last November , that one dog was probably enough for now , but when the girls and Mrs. Obama started organizing play dates on the White House lawn for Bo with dogs of friends and family , the writing was on the wall .
That ’s the way most households work – mom and kids put their collective foot down , and dad does n’t really have much choice .
Maybe it ’s the mood I ’m in , maybe it ’s just too hot here in mid-August to work up a rant , but rather than bash the First Family for not taking the opportunity to be role models when acquiring a new dog by adopting from a rescue or shelter , I ’d like to thank President Obama today for a few different , but related reasons .
Number one : The Obama family made a donation to the Washington Humane Society as part of the Sunny transaction .
If I were in a more cynical mood , I may call that hush money , but today I am going to call it a step in the right direction .
The publicity around such a donation can only stand to show the country the value rescue plays .
So , Mr. President , thank you .
Number two :
The White House has officially come out against any form of breed - discriminatory legislation ( BDL ) .
A petition posted to the We the People site asked for the federal government to ban BDL .
While this is n’t really a federal government issue , the White House has officially responded .
Their response is right on target , highlighting research that shows how ineffective and costly BDL is .
So again , thank you , Mr. President .
And , three :
Thank you in advance for having Sunny spayed .
I do n’t know if she was fixed before she arrived at the White House as Bo was , but I ’m just going to assume that the Obamas will do the right thing .
We certainly do n’t need an “ oops ” litter at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
The nation has enough drama without trying to explain how neutered Bo ’s girlfriend had an out - of - wedlock litter !
News broadcast : Obviously this is in Greek , anyone translate ?.
December 12/08 : Patra , Greece .
TEXT FROM SOURCE :
The video of the broadcast from the occupied station SuperB Patra , a major TV station of Western Greece from Patra area .
The station was occupied by demonstrators and students , during the occupation there was news broadcasted .
After the broadcast the station was left to continue normally the program .
Now killing the President requires a lot of planning , but when you 're crazy , planning involves casting imaginary spells and talking to ghosts .
All of which makes it even stranger that some of the craziest assassination plots ever hatched by some of the craziest people came so close to succeeding .
Anyone can change the course of history .
You can start a movement , run for office , or if you 're too insane for that kind of thing , buy a cheap gun and try to kill the President .
6 Richard Pavlick ( 1887 -1975 )
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The Target :
John F. Kennedy
The Man :
At the dear old age of seventy - three , Richard Pavlick maintained his youthful vigor by constantly ranting about politicians , wealth and Catholics .
So naturally when these things converged in the form of John F. Kennedy 's presidency , Pavlick felt that something drastic had to be done and that he was just the senile nutbar for the job .
Apparently Pavlich learned everything he knew about committing crimes from The Riddler .
After giving away his property and most of his possessions , he decided it would be a good idea to mail postcards around town , with cryptic clues about his intentions .

Pavlick began stalking Kennedy and on December 11th this elderly one man League of Evil launched his plan .
The Attempt :
Fun Fact : Guns can be problematic .
They require training to use well and even then they can still jam or miss .
But do you know what never misses ?
A 1950 Buick filled with dynamite .
Maybe Pavlick felt that the revolution he'd spark would be so awesome that he did n't need to live and witness it .
Maybe he just had a gross misunderstanding of how dynamite works .
Whatever the reason , one Sunday as Kennedy left for mass , there was an old man in an exploding car , prepared to kill him in the flashiest way possible .

What Went Wrong :
On the first attempt , Pavlick saw Kennedy had his wife and two children with him , and got cold feet ( note that if you 're that concerned about bystanders , a car bomb is probably not your best weapon ) .
This bought time for the good guys to work through the diabolical clues he mailed out .
And by that we mean the postmaster glanced at the dates and postmarks and told the Secret Service where he was .
By the time he was working on his second attempt on Kennedy 's life , the cops were closing in .
When they pulled him over , the cops found seven sticks of dynamite wired in the vehicle .
Pavlick originally had much more , but when he became nervous about getting caught he removed most of it , apparently under the impression that it's ok to have just a few explosives in your trunk at any given time .

" What ?
There 's , like , four sticks in there .
Come on . "
He was held in a mental institution for a few years , then upon release decided to stalk and terrorize the postmaster that had tipped off the Secret Service on the Kennedy thing .
Before he could come up with a more efficient way to kill than the old exploding Buick trick , he died in 1975 , and was no doubt buried in a dynamite laden coffin .
City traders may be seeing patterns that ' are n't really there '
The mind naturally creates illusions and superstitions at times of stress - and this could be adding to the global financial crisis , say scientists .
US researchers say feeling " out of control " makes us more likely to misinterpret information as we search for signs of order .
The study in the journal Science found investment decisions of volunteers were adversely affected by these feelings .
Simple psychological techniques might improve their performance , they said .
These dealers are supposed to be rational - but they 're almost certainly not
Professor Cary Cooper
Lancaster University
The researchers , from the University of Texas and Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois , believe that humans cope with feeling out of control by trying to impose order subconsciously - even in situations where there is none .
At a simple level , they demonstrated the principle by asking volunteers to look for images embedded in " snowy pictures " .
Those whose feelings of control had earlier been undermined were more likely to claim to have seen an image , even where none existed .
However , the researchers believe that other kinds of illusion , from conspiracy theories to superstitions , stem from the same basic subconscious problem , and that it may be contributing to the current havoc on the world 's financial markets .
Frightening headline
In another experiment , people were given one of two headlines to read .
The first said " Rough seas ahead for investors " , while the other said " Smooth sailing ahead for investors " .
They then were given statements about two different companies , with the first having 16 positive comments and eight negative , the second eight positive and four negative .
Even though both companies had the same ratio of positive to negative , when given a choice of which company , if any , to invest in , those given the " rough seas " message were far less likely to invest in the second company .
When asked to recall the positive and negative information , again , in the more volatile market , the investors were far more likely to overestimate the amount of negative information about the second company .
This meant , said the researchers , that the volunteers whose feelings of control had been undermined formed an " illusory correlation " linking negative feelings to the company with fewest comments , and made their investment decisions on the back of it .
' Lucky shirt ' Professor Adam Galinsky , one of the authors , said that professional market dealers were almost certainly not immune from this , and that it could affect the strength of their decisions .
Conspiracy theories which sprang up as the $ 700bn US bailout plan was negotiated were also likely to have stemmed from this mindset , he said .
" I imagine that there are a lot of dealers who are wearing a ' lucky shirt ' at the moment , or walking a certain way to work in the hope that this will improve their fortunes . "
When psychological therapy techniques were used to make them feel secure , these effects disappeared , the researchers reported .
" There is no point going up to them and telling them they are wrong , we need to make them feel more secure , " said Professor Galinsky .
Professor Cary Cooper , a researcher on stress in the workplace at Lancaster University , said that rational decisions were unlikely in such a pressured environment .
" These dealers are supposed to be rational - but they 're almost certainly not .
If they feel out of control they will be not be looking in the right way at the information that is coming to them . "

What are these ?
ELLEN SPERTUS , a graduate student at M.I.T. , wondered why the computer camp she had attended as a girl had a boy - girl ratio of six to one .
And why were only 20 percent of computer science undergraduates at M.I.T. female ?
She published a 124 - page paper , “ Why Are There So Few Female Computer Scientists ? ” , that catalogued different cultural biases that discouraged girls and women from pursuing a career in the field .
The year was 1991 .
Computer science has changed considerably since then .
Now , there are even fewer women entering the field .
Why this is so remains a matter of dispute .
What ’s particularly puzzling is that the explanations for under- representation of women that were assembled back in 1991 applied to all technical fields .
Yet women have achieved broad parity with men in almost every other technical pursuit .
When all science and engineering fields are considered , the percentage of bachelor ’s degree recipients who are women has improved to 51 percent in 2004 - 5 from 39 percent in 1984 - 85 , according to National Science Foundation surveys .
When one looks at computer science in particular , however , the proportion of women has been falling .
In 2001 - 2 , only 28 percent of all undergraduate degrees in computer science went to women .
By 2004 - 5 , the number had declined to only 22 percent .
Data collected by the Computing Research Association showed even fewer women at research universities like M.I.T. : women accounted for only 12 percent of undergraduate degrees in computer science and engineering in the United States and Canada granted in 2006 - 7 by Ph.D. - granting institutions , down from 19 percent in 2001 - 2 .
Many computer science departments report that women now make up less than 10 percent of the newest undergraduates .

The country ’s workforce is now reported to be 35 % full - time freelancers .
While being a freelancer is n’t for everyone , there likely is a place for some freelancing within your business .
Adding this type of employee to your company can make a big difference in your productivity and success .
If you ’re wondering why how freelancers could benefit your company , read on for the top reasons to get on the bandwagon !
1. Lower Overhead Costs
One of the biggest benefits of hiring a freelancer is that the company saves a lot of money when compared to hiring a traditional employee .
When you hire a traditional employee who works in your office full or part - time there are things you ’re required to pay and provide .
The biggest expenses include paying for your office space ( making sure it ’s big enough to hold everyone ) and health insurance .
The traditional employee is also likely paid more than a freelancer solely based on the payment systems , ( hourly or salary ) .
Using freelancers allows you to pay them strictly for the work they do ( some are paid by project and others hourly ) .
But there wo n’t be extra time you ’re paying for where they ’re waiting for the next project in the office .
Freelancers are a much less expensive way to get the work your company needs finished .
2. Wider Variety of Employee Options
Freelance jobs are so appealing to people because of their freedom .
Not only are they free to work ( or not ) when they want , they also can work from wherever they want .
This is a huge added bonus for businesses as well as they ’re not limited by geographic area to find the right employee for the position .
They can widen their search to anyone who has access to the internet and the programs necessary for completion .
Finding the right employee is critical to the success of a company , so being able to hire from anywhere aids in getting just the right fit .
3. Raises Production Level
There are times when hiring someone who knows how to do a lot of different things is a beneficial move for a company .
But sometimes knowing a little in a lot of areas does n’t compare to knowing a lot about a single subject .
Freelancers generally have a very specific set of skills .
They have honed those skills to a professional level in order to be marketable .
When you work with a freelancer on a specific task you ’re likely to get very high - quality work because of their focused background .
Since these skills are their specialty , you can also do much less managing and still receive your desired result .
4. Use Only What You Need
Most freelancers are hired on a project basis and then put on retainer to be used later on when the need arises again .
This is appealing for freelancers because it allows them to work on a variety of different projects and keep things interesting .
But it should also be super appealing for businesses as well .
Having to hire out for projects forces the company to get very clear on what they want .
They have to take the time to fully think through projects before starting them .
Jumping the gun on projects can be a waste of all kinds of resources .
So slowing down slightly to get your freelancers ready can be the perfect time to double - check everything .
5. Work More Efficiently
Regardless of the specifics , any business project requires multiple steps in order to make it successful .
There will always be a variety of skills needed in order to get everything done properly .
Freelance work allows you to free up your team members to do the things they ’re good at while still getting everything done .
If your team is great at coming up with marketing strategies and product development , they can focus on that while your freelancer handles all of the design elements for the launch .
This division and outsourcing is a great way to have your company work more efficiently .
It ensures everyone has their part and no one has too much .
6. Generates Outside the Box Thinking
Even the best teams can get stuck when trying to problem solve at work .
This is especially true when working on a big project for an extended period of time .
Bringing in an outside perspective can get everyone ’s creative minds working and come up with the necessary solutions .
Freelancers are a great way to continue to get work done on the project while getting that different viewpoint .
Many companies have started to use an IT Consultant to help them work through some of their technology problems and make informed decisions .
Design is another area that many companies choose to get an outside look from a freelancer .
They can take your vision and bring it to life .
Ultimately , the customer will be an outside set of eyes on your product or service , so bringing that in during development is a smart choice .
7. Focus on What You Want to
As a business owner , it can be so tempting to take over everything and try to handle it all on your own .
After all , this is your baby and no one cares as much about it as you .
But , certainly , there are elements of the job that you do n’t enjoy as much as others .
You ’re the boss , so if you do n’t want to handle those tasks you can hire a freelancer to handle them for you !
And in the end , it ’s a smart investment for most companies .
Then you ’re free to focus on the things you want to focus on instead !
Grow Your Business with Freelancers
Hiring freelancers to handle some projects and areas of your business is the way of the future !
More and more businesses are freeing up their time and letting more specialized , expert employees handle intricate details .
And they ’re saving money all along the way !
This new wave of employees are great assets to have on your team .

( CNN ) -- Hikers in California have found items that may belong to missing millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett , officials said Wednesday .
Steve Fossett , seen with wife Peggy in a 2006 photograph , disappeared in September 2007 .
A weathered sweat shirt , cash and a pilot 's certificate with Fossett 's name were found Tuesday near Mammoth Lakes , police Chief Randy Schienle said .
The certificate did not have a photo , he said .
" We 're not certain that it belongs to Steve Fossett , but it certainly has his name on the ID , " Schienle said .
Fossett , who was 63 , was last seen on the morning of September 3 , 2007 , when he took off from the Flying - M Ranch outside Minden , Nevada , in a single - engine plane .
He said he was embarking on a pleasure flight over the Sierra Nevada mountain range .
A judge declared Fossett legally dead in February .
No plane wreckage has been found , but a multi- jurisdictional team would return to the area of the discovery to search by air and on foot , Schienle said .
Watch police chief describe what hikers found »
Fossett made his money in the financial services industry , but is renowned for his daredevil exploits , which include nonstop , round - the - world trips aboard a balloon , a fixed - wing plane and a boat .
He was the first person to circle the globe solo in a balloon , accomplishing the feat in 2002 , and the first to fly a plane around the world solo without refueling , which he did in 2005 .
He also set world records in round - the - world sailing and cross-country skiing .

There are two common ways to implement single dispatch polymorphism , virtual functions and switch statements .
Object oriented design encourages virtual functions since it is much easier to extend and manage , but people often complain about the overhead of virtual calls .
I ’ve also wondered if the compiler can do any optimizations with C++ virtual functions that are not possible in C with a manually managed v-table .
This post explores the performance of three different implementations , C with v-tables , C++ native virtual functions , and C with switch statements .
It uses the Foo object which is just an integer of state and an operation .
In C++ , the interface ( I ignore the issue of creation in this post ) is
struct Foo { virtual int func ( int , int * ) const = 0 ; long state ; } ;
Ideally , this structure would be presented to the user as an opaque object , thus facilitating a stable ABI .
We ’ll see that this does n’t necessarily cause a measurable performance penalty .
Note that the state is chosen to be type long so that alignment is equivalent to the alternative implementation
/* Forward declaration in interface header */ typedef struct _p_FooStat * FooStat ; /* Implementation header */ struct _p_FooStat { FooType type ; long state ; } ;
which will use a switch statement to determine the type .
The version with explicit virtual functions looks like this
/* Forward declaration in interface header */ typedef struct _p_FooVirt * FooVirt ; /* Implementation header */ struct FooOps { int ( * func ) ( FooVirt , int , int* ) ; } ; struct _p_FooVirt { struct FooOps * ops ; size_t state ; } ;
The interface declarations are the typedef s above and these functions
int FooVirtCall ( FooVirt , int , int* ) ; int FooStatCall ( FooStat , int , int * ) ;
In both cases , Foo can change completely without any change to the ABI .
Interface definitions go in the shared library and look like
int FooVirtCall ( FooVirt f, int i, int * r ) { int e ; e = f -> ops -> func ( f , i, r ) ; if ( e ) exit(e ) ; return 0 ; }
The error handling is for illustration only , obviously the interface function can do an arbitrary amount of setup before the virtual call and cleanup afterwards .
The alternative is
int FooStatCall ( FooStat f, int i, int * r ) { int e = 0 ; switch ( f -> type ) { case FOO_ADD : e = FooStat_Add ( f , i,r ) ; break ; case FOO_SUBTRACT : e = FooStat_Subtract ( f , i,r ) ; break ; case FOO_MULT : e = FooStat_Mult ( f , i,r ) ; break ; } if ( e ) exit(e ) ; return 0 ; }
For performance testing , we create 50000 objects with type equal to index modulo 3 and iterate through all of the objects 10000 times .
The timing is done using gettimeofday .
The architecture is T9300 2.5 Ghz Core 2 Duo running Linux 2.6.27.5 compiled using GCC - 4.3.2 with - O3 .
FooVirtCall : 2.1234 sec 235.4714 M calls / sec FooStatCall : 2.9190 sec 171.2892 M calls / sec FooCxxCall : 2.2018 sec 227.0916 M calls / sec
The first important thing to note is that we are executing over 200 million polymorphic function calls per second .
Optimal memory bandwidth is 10.6 GB / s so if much more than 48 bytes ( 6 double s ) are used per function call ( assuming the working set is much larger than cache ) , aggressively minimizing function call overhead is not going to help much .
For my purposes , the simplest case uses 8 floating point numbers that cannot be in cache already , hence we ’re barely in the realm where optimization of the virtual call matters .
We ’ll start by comparing C and C++ virtual calls and come back to FooStatCall later .
The C++ version is the obvious implementation using an abstruct base class and virtual functions .
The assembly is identical for FooVirtCall and FooCxxCall .
0x0000000000402020 < FooVirtCall+0 > : sub $ 0x8 , %rsp 0x0000000000402024 < FooVirtCall+4 > : mov ( %rdi ) , %rax 0x0000000000402027 < FooVirtCall+7 > : callq *( %rax ) 0x0000000000402029 < FooVirtCall+9 > : test %eax , %eax 0x000000000040202 b < FooVirtCall+11 > : jne 0x402034 < FooVirtCall+20 > 0x000000000040202d < FooVirtCall+13 > : xor %eax , %eax 0x000000000040202f < FooVirtCall+15 > : add $ 0x8 , %rsp 0x0000000000402033 < FooVirtCall+19 > : retq 0x0000000000402034 < FooVirtCall+20 > : mov %eax , %edi 0x0000000000402036 < FooVirtCall+22 > : callq 0x4010b8 < exit@plt >
Now , with C++ virtual functions , the header usually contains the struct definition so adding a virtual function or a data member changes the ABI .
Also , there is n’t usually any error checking in the interface function .
That is , the compiler essentially inlines the following at the call site .
int FooVirtCallTail ( FooVirt f, int i , int * r ) { return f->ops -> func ( f , i, r ) ; }
To maintain ABI stability , we keep the definition of struct _p_FooVirt ( hence necessarily this interface function ) out of the public header .
FooVirtCallTail : 1.7889 sec 279.4943 M calls / sec
The assembly is obviously optimal
0x00007f2ad6c9e130 < FooVirtCallTail+0 > : mov ( %rdi ) , %rax 0x00007f2ad6c9e133 < FooVirtCallTail+3 > : mov ( %rax ) , %r11 0x00007f2ad6c9e136 < FooVirtCallTail+6 > : jmpq *%r11
and is identical to the C++ analogue .
How much better can we do if we allow inlining of the interface function as is normally done in C ++?
Defining the struct and interface function ( static inline ) in the header , we see
FooVirtCallInlineable : 1.8097 sec 276.2880 M calls / sec FooVirtCallInlineableTail : 1.7789 sec 281.0789 M calls / sec
( The latter is what you get from C++ by default . )
So the error checking version is about as fast as the tail call , which has n’t really benefited from inlining .
The reason for this is that the interface function is trivial and already in cache , so the cost of not inlining it is only one perfectly predicted jmp to a hot location .
When there is error checking , the compiler can obviously take advantage of inlining to produce a faster call .
The conclusion here is that using a C - style polymorphism allow us to keep the structure definition and v-table out of the ABI with essentially zero runtime cost compared to putting it in the header .
If we do error checking in the interface function , we pay about a 20 % price compared to the C++ version where the static interface method could be inlined .
In C , if this was an issue , we would put the struct definition and interface function in the public header , thus getting identical assembly to C ++.
While there are ways to obtain ABI stability in C++ , it ’s not the default as it is with C. C also provides convenient introspection and reflection which is not really available in C ++.
For instance , you can determine whether a given object implements a virtual function by checking whether the function pointer is NULL .
It is possible to create new aggregate types by allocating memory for the v-table on a per-object basis and then selectively rewriting parts of the v-table .
Back to the early loser , FooStatCall .
There are lots of ways to speed this up .
Timing for some variations , including the original :
FooStatCall : 2.9190 sec 171.2892 M calls / sec FooStatCallTail : 3.8625 sec 129.4489 M calls / sec FooStatCallArr : 1.7841 sec 280.2485 M calls / sec FooStatCallInline : 1.6448 sec 303.9879 M calls / sec FooStatCallInlineable : 2.4053 sec 207.8724 M calls / sec FooStatCallInlineableTail : 2.8158 sec 177.5725 M calls / sec FooStatCallAllInline : 1.1480 sec 435.5427 M calls / sec
Strangely , using tail calls is actually slower for this calling sequence .
FooStatCallArr is a tail call with an array of static function pointers .
The assembly is clearly optimal and reveals why it is basically the same speed as virtual calls .
0x0000000000401e50 < FooStatCallArr+0 > : mov ( %rdi ) , %eax 0x0000000000401e52 < FooStatCallArr+2 > : mov 0x402460 ( , %rax,8 ) , %r11 0x0000000000401e5a < FooStatCallArr+10 > : jmpq *%r11
The interface function FooStatCallInline is not inlined , rather , it inlines the implementation ( the operation is written into each of the cases in the switch statement ) .
Making the interface function inlineable at the call site does n’t help .
Of course the fastest solution is to inline absolutely everything .
The conclusion here is that making switch statements faster than virtual calls requires at a minimum that the implementations be in the same compilation unit as the interface function .
In this case , the benefits are still very small ; to really win , everything must be inlineable by the user ( i.e. the entire implementation must be written in the public header ) .
This is unacceptable in most environments .
If you ’d like to try some variations , you can start with this tarball .
The motivation for this post is fast application of tensor product operations like interpolation and differentiation between collocation and quadrature nodes in an finite element method .
The mesh is not necessarily homogeneous with respect to topology and spectral order .
C++ templates are not directly applicable since we work with large arrays of mixed type .
It is useful to have the innermost loop completely unrolled , thus essentially templating over the last dimension in the tensor product .
If it was practical to sort by element type , it would be possible to hoist the polymorphism out of the loop over elements ( use separate loops over elements of each type ) .
However , changing the order of element traversal negatively impacts data locality so the polymorphic function call is actually cheaper .

PSYCHODYNAMICS OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS
ABSTRACT
Political correctness represents a regression in university functioning in which paternal influences are repudiated and a biparental model of authority is replaced by one revolving around a primordial conception of the mother .
Paternal influences are those which represent the engagement with external reality , and regression to the primordial mother is therefore a rejection of external reality .
Aspects of university functioning that are explained by this model include the inversion of valuation , the assault against the white males , the subordination of rationality in decision making , the balkanization of the university , the drive to the extreme , and the anomaly of female power .
PSYCHODYNAMICS OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS
Introduction
The term " Political Correctness " made its way into public consciousness through an article by Richard Bernstein in the New York Times ( 1991 ) .
It referred to a strain of post - Marxist leftist thought in which the struggle between economic classes had been replaced , as a primary ontological framework , with a more differentiated set of oppositions based on such differences as gender , race , and sexual orientation .
Thus , as Bernstein put it :
Central to pc-ness , which has its roots in 1960 's radicalism , is the view that Western society has for centuries been dominated by what is often called ' the white male power structure ' or ' Patriarchal hegemony . '
A related belief is that everybody but white heterosexual males has suffered some form of repression and been denied a cultural voice ... ( Section 4:1 )
But , to many of those concerned with this phenomenon , the disturbing thing about political correctness ( " PC " ) has not been the content of its ideology , but the principle of argumentation that it has employed :
more than an earnest expression of belief , " politically correct " has become a sarcastic jibe used by those , conservatives and classical liberals alike , to describe what they see as a growing intolerance , a closing of debate , a pressure to conform to a radical program or risk being accused of a commonly reiterated trio of thought crimes : sexism , racism and homophobia . ( 4:4 )
In response to these charges , those who felt themselves criticized for PC have responded in a number of ways .
Often they have both denied that any coercion to be PC existed and accused the critics of the same thought crimes the accusation of which was said to constitute PC in the first place ( Fried , 1991 ) .
Generally the response has been to attack the motives of PC 's critics .
For instance , those critics have been accused of being agents of right - wing think tanks ( e.g. Wiener , 1992 ) , or otherwise right - wingers who had nobody to direct their venom against now that the cold war has ended ( see , for example , Gitlin , 1992 , although his own perspective is much broader , nuanced and in no way an example of PC itself . )
These arguments have no apparent application me .
I have never received any money from a right - wing think tank and my objection to PC long antedates the end of the cold war .
Actually , my first experience with it was in 1971 .
But it may be useful , by way of introducing PC , to report on my first experience with it during the relatively recent past .
This was in 1987 , after I had returned from a sabbatical where I had been working on a book on narcissistic process in organizations .
The campus minister was interested in my work and asked me to make a presentation at an institute that he was starting .
The presentation , which ultimately grew into Chapter seven of my book Narcissistic Process and Corporate Decay ( 1990 ) , required a presentation of Freuds concept of the Oedipus complex .
As I was going through this part of the argument , a woman in the audience , who happened to be the chair of the psychology department at the time , had what can only be called a fit .
Without addressing herself to anything I was saying in particular , and without any apparent attempt to control her rage , she said that Freud was a sexist and a misogynist , and went on to condemn the entire psychoanalytic enterprise , which she said was " shot through " with sexism and racism .
As she talked , it became clear to me that she had little idea of what she was talking about .
She said , for example , that the Oedipus complex did not apply to women , which was why Freud invented the idea of the Electra complex .
She was evidently unaware of the fact that it was Jung , not Freud , who used the term " Electra complex . "
Despite this woman 's evident lack of grounding in what she was talking about , her voice seemed to express a feeling of absolute authority .
I recall that at the time this struck me as very peculiar .
But what struck me as even more peculiar was that as she engaged in this frenzied performance , the other members of the audience were not looking at her as if she were acting strangely , but were looking at me as if I had done something contemptible and despicable .
I remember thinking at the time that what was going on in that room was not the way things ought to be done in the university .
I cannot say that I felt wounded by this interaction .
I was more bemused than anything else .
But I did have the feeling that if events like this were becoming characteristic of the university , this indicated that there was something terribly wrong in an institution that was very important to me , and I felt a degree of outrage over that .
I also felt that I should make such processes into a focus of investigation .
The results of this investigation are what I present in this paper .
In a previous paper ( Schwartz , 1993 ) , I described a number of instances of PC and attempted to explain them within a theoretical framework .
The present paper represents a more sophisticated development of that framework .
My argument will be that the processes involved in PC represent a regressive shift in organizational functioning from what I will call the " biparental " model , which involves both maternal and paternal elements , to a primitive maternal model from which paternal elements have been purged .
I will begin by elaborating the psychological basis on which this analysis will rest .
Narcissism , The Ego Ideal , and the Superego
According to the standard account in psychoanalytic theory ( e.g. Mahler , Pine , and Bergman , 1975 ) , in the beginning of psychological life , the infant has not yet formed a boundary between itself and its mother .
The total devotion to the infant of the mother , who is the world to the infant , results in the infant experiencing itself as the center of a loving world .
Freud referred to this experience as " primary narcissism . "
As time goes by , the infant is painfully alerted to the fact that the world does not lovingly revolve around it , and comes to feel isolated and helpless as a result .
To escape from its helplessness , the child fantasizes an omnipotent mother who loves it entirely and with whom it may fuse to return to the original narcissistic state . [ 1 ]
The phantasy of oneself as having returned to the state of narcissistic fusion is referred to by Freud ( 1914 , 1921 ) as the ego ideal .
For Freud , the development of the theory of the ego ideal , as a psychological configuration distinct from the superego , was a short foray .
Elaborating this theory more fully in its own right was the work of others , notably of Chasseguet - Smirgel ( 1985 , 1986 ) .
For her , the ego ideal represents a world without obstacles .
In such a world , we would be able to do exactly what we want and have it turn out to our benefit , since the world would be structured to fulfill our desires .
According to this vision , we would be perfectly at home in the world , without anxiety or shame , sure of ourselves , certain of the validity of our behavior , without doubt or marginality .
On the individual level the ego ideal underlies our loved images of ourselves .
On the collective level , the idea of a society manifesting the ego ideal lies behind our image of utopia .
The problem is that , short of psychosis ( Chasseguet - Smirgel , 1985 ) , our experience never fully corresponds to the ego ideal .
We never get to be the center of a loving world .
The problem is that the world is not our mother .
It has an independent existence outside of ourselves .
Far from being structured by love for our selves , the world manifests a cold , powerful indifference .
It does not simply give , but makes demands on us which we must fulfill if it is going to sustain us .
For Freud ( 1923 ) , in the course of normal development we internalize these demands during the oedipal stage to form the superego .
As the ego ideal is structured around an idealized mother , the superego is structured around an idealized father . [ 2 ]
The differentiation between maternal and paternal roles naturally grows out of , and expresses itself in , somewhat different patterns of development for boys and girls .
The point I will make in this paper is that maturation requires the development of capacities for both roles , but it is certainly correct that the two sexes have different inclinations in this regard .
Chasseguet - Smirgels analysis ( 1986 ) , which I follow here and whose implications I have developed more fully elsewhere ( Schwartz , 1995 ) , maintains that all children feel helpless in the face of the omnipotent mother , who they nevertheless deeply love .
Girls can resolve their helplessness by identifying with her and her power .
Boys do not have that option and must find a way to secure an independent identity which will be , at the same time , valued by women .
This has been the root of the paternal role .
The father 's function , as it has emerged in this connection , has been to engage the indifferent external world and to make that world amenable to the life of the family .
His role has been to create a distance between the family and external reality so that the ego ideal , represented by the mother , could operate within the family , giving the children a deep feeling that they were important and loved .
The role of the father with regard to the children , was to inculcate the superego by representing indifferent external reality within the family so that , by introjecting him , the children could learn to cope with that reality . [ 3 ]
Thus , the father acts as the agent of the external world .
Through his prohibitions , he represents its indifference and its demands .
Over time , the children take the fathers prohibitions into themselves .
They build the structure of the world 's constraint into their own character , fashioning it around the core of what they come to call " reality . "
This is how children learn the rules of exchange that operate within their culture : what they must do to get along , in a reciprocal way , with others who are indifferent to them .
Making sense of these rules , they turn external demands into obligations , and thus come to understand what they previously could not understand : why they must do what they do not want to do .
Through the superego people , especially males , are enabled to give up the love of the primordial mother on the promise of being able to earn the ego ideal later through worldly activity .
One can easily see the value of the superego by reflecting on the culturally useful activity that it generates .
At the same time it is also possible to observe that the superego preserves society from the distortion of reality and the sense of infinite entitlement that narcissism would otherwise generate .
None of this takes away from the value of the ego ideal and the maternal role .
Only the ego ideal can give inspiration to what would otherwise be a dry and joyless pattern of obligations .
Thus , the superego structures our understanding of how we are separate from the world around us , and therefore how we must engage it on its own terms .
The ego ideal provides a meaning for this engagement by giving us an image of overcoming our separation and becoming one with the world ..
Society can be seen to involve an intimate interaction of the ego ideal and the superego .
The traditional family , as Freud understood it , manifests what I shall call a biparental model of child rearing along these lines .
It incorporates both paternal and maternal elements , recognizing the difference and the value of each .
It leads to an image of authority that is both realistic and loving .
PC and Regression
In order to understand PC one needs to recognize that in recent decades , specifically since the late sixties , the role of the father , the superego , has come to be repudiated .
Taking its place has been the domination of pre-oedipal narcissism , whose central feature is fusion with the primordial mother .
This development has a number of aspects , but two are of particular importance .
First is the philosophical current typically referred to as postmodernism or poststructuralism , associated with the various writings of Jacques Derrida , Michel Foucault , Jacques Lacan , Francois Lyotard , and others .
What one finds in these works is the general position that there is no objective external world .
Knowledge is only language and language refers only to other language .
The idea that there is an external world is associated with patriarchy , which uses it in the service of male oppression , keeping down and marginalizing the spontaneous , the organic , the feminine .
At the same time , the maternal orientation itself has made a bid for dominance through a number of varieties of feminism .
Setting up an opposition between , on one hand , the supposedly rule - bound , hierarchical , aggressive orientation of men and , on the other , the supposedly spontaneous , caring , non-hierarchical , receptive orientation of women , a broad spectrum of writers has sought to portray what they see as the distinctive psychology of women , which I shall refer to simply as the feminine , as an alternative organizing principle to what they see as male domination ( e.g. Gilligan , 1982 ; MacKinnon , 1989 ; Calas and Smircich , 1991 ; Irigaray , 1985 ) .
To the extent that feminist writers propose the feminine as a complement to the masculine , as a side of the personality that , in our society , and especially outside the family , has needed additional expression , their work seems to me to represent an interesting , valuable , and essentially correct point of view ( e.g. Benjamin , 1988 ) .
Seen within the postmodern context , however , the simultaneous assault on the male and apotheosis of the female mean something else .
They do not represent a revision of the idea of optimal development by adding maternal to paternal elements .
Rather , we can see a shift in the embodiment of authority from the biparental model to one based on the more primitive primordial mother .
The danger of this shift is not so much that it repudiates the father , but that it puts into political form the repudiation of what the father represents  external reality itself .
This is what we see happening in PC .
From the Biparental to the Primitive Maternal in the University
To understand the meaning of a revolt against the paternal within the university , we need to understand how the superego , the institutionalized paternal , traditionally operates in that institutional context .
This is an easy matter .
In the biparental model , the meaning of the university is the generation of achievement .
We may think of this as the beneficial transformation of reality , whether physically or through an increased understanding of that reality .
The function of the superego in the university is primarily the inculcation of standards .
The university presumes that there is an external world which can be known in better or worse ways .
The meaning of standards is the establishment of the best ways of knowing the world , based on the whole history of human engagement with that world .
The function of research , of course , is to get to know the world better , and thereby to raise the standards of knowing .
With regard to teaching , the university functions ideally as a father , who prepares students to achieve something in the world based upon the modeling of good work , work in accordance with the highest standards , and the differential reward of good versus bad work .
If the process is successful , the student internalizes this polarity between good work and bad work as part of the superego , and goes out into the world where he or she does good work based upon this internalization .
With regard to decision making in the biparental university , the superego manifests itself as intended rationality .
The superego , by acknowledging the existence of an objective external world that can punish us if we get things wrong , places a premium on getting things right .
The whole panoply of procedures for making decisions in the university exists for the purpose of taking possibilities for action and subjecting them to rational , logical criticism , of eliminating parochial and narcissistic bias and getting as close as possible to a course of action that will have the desired concrete result .
Surely this is not to say that the university , any more than anyone or anything else , always gets things right .
Certainly this does not mean that university professors are less narcissistic than anyone else  a view that only those unfamiliar with the university could uphold .
It is simply to say that rational criticism is an accepted and legitimated mode of university discourse , that the distortions that narcissistic bias creates are recognized as distortions , and that the structures created to limit their effects are seen as legitimate .
None of this is to deny that the ego ideal is present in the university in equal measure to the superego .
The ego ideal is necessary to transform demands into ideals , without which the university would lose the spirit of its existence , and without which , indeed , it would be impossible to give meaning to the idea of the beneficial .
The ego ideal is also present , perhaps most importantly , in the nurturance of the individual student , bringing that student to be able to accept his or her own spontaneity , which is the well - spring of creativity .
It should never be forgotten , in this connection , that the muse is a female figure .
But within the biparental university , the pursuit of ideals is channeled by the representation of external demand into good work and concrete achievement .
Put the idea of a self - subsistent , objective external world into question , however , and one undermines the meaning of the father .
Take away the idea of an objective world and you deny the legitimacy of external demand and the superego that represents it .
Demands come to be seen as oppression .
Deny the superego and all that is left is narcissism ; the only question becomes whose narcissism .
The idea of achievement , and the distinction between good and bad work , then , come to seem arbitrary categorizations whose meaning is to be found in the expression of the father 's narcissism .
No means remains to explain why the children should not be able to live in permanent enjoyment of their closeness with the primordial mother .
Her power would guarantee their happiness , if only his could be gotten rid of .
The attempt to expel the father , and the external world he represents , is the meaning of the PC university .
Structure and Process in the PC University
In order to understand both the appeal and the danger of organization based on the primitive mother , it is necessary to underscore the fact that the primordial mother is a phantasy .
She is not a real mother .
She is the image of mother cast in the mold of the infant 's desire .
The primordial mother is the phantasy of a person who would complete the circle of a loving world centered upon the child .
In other words , she is the complement of the child 's narcissism .
When individuals identify with her , when they re-form themselves in her image , they give up their own adult character and remake themselves on the basis of the most primitive levels of their psyches .
The appeal of this regression is clear enough .
We all desire to fuse with the primordial mother and again be the center of a loving world .
But , as a principle of organization for the university , the rule of the primordial mother is not as perfect as we might imagine .
First , notice that the loving world of which the person would be the center would have only one person in it , plus that person 's reflection : it would contain no independent others .
This is not recognized as a problem by the narcissistic child , who sees no need for independent others .
But as a principle of organization in a real world which contains real others , it has a contradiction at its core .
Narcissism , which the connection with the primordial mother enshrines and guarantees , makes it impossible to live peaceably in a world in which there are real others .
I demand that you take me as the center of your world , and you demand that I take you as the center of my world .
There is no way in which we can make sense out of the otherness of the other .
It has to be met with total emotional rejection and hatred .
It does not belong in the " good " world which has me as its center , and so therefore must be " bad . "
The gulf between us is absolute .
How can organization be possible at all ?
In a word , the love of the primordial mother , which it seems to us would make the world complete , appears to be a perfect principle of organization .
In reality , however , it would shatter the world .
It is a principle of perfect dis organization , of chaos . [ 4 ]
The problem here is that love is specific .
The kind of unconditional love that defines the primordial mother for us means that she ( or he ) takes our point of view without subjecting it to judgment or to categorization .
Love means being accepted because we are exactly who we are .
But our own inclusion on the grounds of such specificity defines for us a moral universe which excludes everyone who is not who we are , which is to say everyone else .
At one level , this problem is resolved by the psychology of the group .
If the person can substitute a group identity for an individual one , social organization becomes possible at the level of the group .
An idea of oneself as a member of a group can serve as ones ego ideal .
This opens the possibility that others can adopt the same ego ideal .
Those who do so may identify with each other based on that fundamental similarity .
In this way , relations previously characterized by envy and antagonism are transformed into group feeling ( Freud , 1921 ) .
But this means that the problem of narcissistic disorganization will reappear between groups .
Instead of believing that the world should revolve around us as individuals , we come to believe that it should revolve around us by virtue of our group identity .
It is those outside the group , those who do not take the group as their own ego ideal , who are now experienced as threats and as not belonging in the world .
Thus , for mutually antagonistic individuals , we have simply substituted mutually antagonistic groups .
This is the first element of the structure of the PC university .
The second problem of organization based on the primordial mother is the need to provide an affective connection through which the group can make claims on her .
In the family , or for that matter in Japanese organizations where the maternal principle is powerful ( Doi , 1973 ) , a strong interest on the part of the mother is sought through an appeal based on continual association .
But in the university , where people come and go , this is not a viable option .
In the university dominated by the processes of PC , which I shall refer to as the PC university , [ 5 ] this problem is dealt with through an abstraction .
The abstraction is the idea of the child who needs love the most , the one who has been least loved in the past , the victim .
It is this abstraction , this specific claim to having been damaged in a certain way and at a certain time , therefore , that provides the basis of the group 's identity .
This provides the reason why individuals who deviate from the group with regard to the ideology of its victimization are treated as if they do not belong to the group .
( See , for example , Carter , 1991 ) .
It is a mistake , therefore , to think of these groups as defined by demographic characteristics .
At their root , they are defined by an ideology about demographic characteristics .
My point here is that the idea of these group conflicts , to use a familiar phrase , is a social construction .
Understanding such conflicts rests less on understanding the claims of the specific groups against each other than on understanding the fundamentally intrapsychic dynamics of the social construction of the idea of such conflict itself .
This differentiation into groups based on level of victimization determines the logic according to which social structure develops within the PC university .
It also gives rise to the basic social process within the PC university , which is to differentially love the victim and , by the same token , to withdraw love from and to hate those who have previously been loved , who come to be seen as having stolen that love from those who now are in need of it .
Thus , PC transforms the university into a battleground between the forces of goodness , as personified by the victims and their righteous allies , and the forces of evil , personified by the oppressors : those who previously had status , and the whole panoply of social institutions through which they gained that status and have maintained it .
Dynamics of PC
The Inversion of Valuation and the Transformation of the University
The premise of the superego is that love needs to be earned through good work .
To be sure , the superego cannot provide us with love , but only with respect .
Love attaches to who we are , not what we do ; it cannot be earned ( Sennett and Cobb , 1972 ) .
But the superego can provide the criteria on which people agree that persons should be loved , based on the fulfillment of its requirements .
This provides the basis for the social dramatization of love that we call status or prestige , and this is what those of low status feel deprived of .
When the idea of an objective external world is lost , the idea of achievement , of earning love on the basis of good work , no longer has meaning .
Individuals who have had status in the past , and who legitimated that status by claims of achievement , come to be seen instead as having acquired their status illegitimately .
The idea of gaining status through achievement comes to be seen as a smoke - screen for theft .
Those who have had status are thus redefined as having stolen love from those of low status .
They are seen as oppressors who deserve to be hated and attacked , and to have their power destroyed .
On the other hand , those of low status , under the primordial maternal principle , are those who need love the most .
Thus , the social dramatization of love comes to be focused on them .
In the absence of the superego , this dual process of excoriating the oppressors and expressing love for the victims becomes the whole meaning of the university .
For example , the entire nature of what constitutes knowledge changes in the PC university .
Knowledge becomes whatever ideas express hatred of the oppressors and love of the victims .
Along with this change go changes in the ideas of the transmission of this knowledge , in the form of teaching , and the creation of new knowledge , in the form of research and scholarship .
For example , teaching is no longer the study of intellectual and artistic achievements , characteristic of the superego , but becomes a politicized process in which the forces of goodness are trained and mobilized and the forces of evil are subverted .
Everything that is done is legitimated by reference to its function in this battle .
The narcissistic premise here is that anything else serves the purpose of oppression .
As the well - known slogan of the 1960s put it , " If you 're not part of the solution , you 're part of the problem . "
In all of this , we find a disparagement of the idea of great works which is closely related to the depreciation of achievement I have already discussed .
The very idea of great works comes to be seen as a technique of oppression ( Searle , 1992 ) .
The Assault Against White Males
This line of reasoning helps to provide an understanding of one of the most striking cultural developments of our time : the assault against white males .
As Richard Shweder , writing in The New York Times has observed , " white male ,  dead or alive , is now used as an accusation .... a slur . "
Following with the usual thinking behind the charge , he says
The left relishes the usage .
It thinks that white males have held center stage too long , that it 's time for their victims .
( 1991 : Section 4:15 )
Clearly enough , the assault upon white males is an attack upon what is seen as the dominant group .
To me , that is relatively unimportant .
For the reasons Hegel ( 1964 ) referred to as the dialectic of lordship and bondage , the replacement of old elites by new ones is an old and familiar historical pattern .
The effects of this pattern have , no doubt , often been salutary .
More important is that the assault on white males is an attack against the superego itself .
That this assault on white males is an assault on the superego is shown by the fact that the ground upon which the prestige of the white males rests is rarely mentioned .
This is an important omission .
For surely , if white males have had prestige in the past , this has not been entirely undeserved .
Science , technology , social , economic , and political institutions , indeed , the university itself , all reflect the contributions of Western men far out of proportion to their numbers .
Casting white males on the bad side of a clean distinction between good and evil at the very least fails to recognize , let alone express appreciation for , these contributions .
This stance only makes sense if one supposes , in accordance with narcissistic psychology , that good things simply happen , as if by magic , because they are supposed to , without anyone having had to make them happen .
The psychology of the superego is a psychology of doing , while pre-oedipal narcissistic psychology is a psychology of being .
It is only within this primitive psychology that the fact that many good things happen only because somebody worked to make them happen can simply disappear .
The Subordination of Rationality in Decision Making
This last point points to another interesting and important dynamic .
I think of that dynamic as the subordination of truth to goodness .
The premise of the superego is the indifference of the world .
Truth is seen as neutral and is given independent standing .
On the other hand , narcissistic psychology rests all consideration on a prior differentiation between good people and bad people , whose ideas contain this goodness or badness within them .
The idea of an independent truth is replaced by a notion of relative " truths " which are not presumed to have even the possibility of validity outside of the community that uses them ( e.g. Fish , 1992 ) .
Strained through the moralism I have described , this approach comes to mean that the expression of the feelings of a good person must be granted validity without any independent measure of the agreement of those feelings with facts being necessary .
By contrast , it is enough to classify a speaker as a member of a bad group in order to discredit what that person says , with no need for any consideration of the content of what is said .
Within the context of PC , that is to say , the criterion of logic is replaced by the argumentum ad hominem .
This , by the way , provides an answer to those who maintain that what is going on in the PC university is the same thing that has always gone on .
The university , these individuals maintain , has always been a contentious place .
In response one may acknowledge that the university has always been a contentious place , but its contention has been concerned with with what is true and who is right .
In current PC times , the question has become who is good .
At any rate , one can imagine the effect that this development would have on decision making .
Decision making in the PC university loses even the intention of being rational .
Argument about possible courses of action no longer involves consideration of the actual effects policies will have .
The process instead turns to the avowal of one 's own goodness and the imputation of badness to one 's opponents ( Schwartz , 1993 ) .
The Balkanization of the University
Structure under the superego is a behavioral structure : the division of labor .
The purpose of this behavioral structure is to organize the pursuit of achievement and the competition to set its standard .
Under the unalloyed operation of the ego ideal , structure rather becomes a moral structure : good group versus bad group .
From this vantage point , we can understand why , instead of competing for achievement , students come to engage in a competition for sympathy and even pity .
By showing that they have been victimized , oppressed , abused , devalued in the past , the students assert their claims to compensatory appreciation and resentfully depreciate the claims of others .
From this standpoint , we can understand the development which balkanizes student bodies into hyphenated groups proclaiming their competing histories of oppression and grievance .
This emotionally charged conflict , when it takes place in our intendedly multicultural universities , undoubtedly is a source of constant surprise , perplexity , and sadness to the well - meaning individuals who have given rise to it .
Certainly they meant nothing of the sort .
For them " ... the point is to join differences in such a way that the integrity of none is destroyed . "
They had in mind a mosaic , or a quilt in which " differences are sutured together at their edges to form a whole . "
( Choi and Murphy , 1992 ) But by establishing narcissism as the norm for university life , PC advocates made it inevitable that the actual university would be the locus of bitterness , envy and ill - will .
Resentment and hostility are not just temporary feelings which will be outgrown in the PC university ; they are built into its very structure .
The fact that each of these groups recognize and are constituted by the difference of the others does not mean , as Choi and Murphy appear to believe , that they appreciate those differences .
All it means , within narcissistic psychology , is that they define themselves against the others .
It is the superego , from whose indifferent vantage point each voice is only one among many , that makes it possible for groups to get along with each other .
Of course , the superego can be changed .
The fact that it can be changed in accordance with differing and developing reality is implied by the term " rational " in the concept of legal - rational authority ( Weber , 1947 ) .
But the superego is not just one voice among many .
It needs to be located at the top of a hierarchy , not only if it is going to function at all , but also if other voices are going to function without engaging each other in a duel to the death .
Arguably legal - rational authority is the greatest achievement of Western civilization .
The idea that , with its rules , its reliance on reason , its demand for superordinate status , legal - rational authority is seen by the PC as the very source of oppression ( e.g. MacKinnon , 1989 ) , is properly a cause for concern .
The Drive to the Extreme
The psychology of the superego contains a built in conservatism .
This psychology rests on an internalization of external order and places a premium on the maintenance of established structure .
In politics , the superego presses toward a solution that can be applied universally and then toward the acceptance and maintenance of that system .
Narcissistic psychology , because it presses for the attainment of something that cannot be attained , has a built in radical bias .
The psychology of the superego is realized through creation of an organization .
The ego ideal attempts to realize itself through creation of a movement .
History , it seems to me , embraces both of these dynamics , and recommends a proper balance between them .
When the realism of the superego is repudiated , however , the sole operation of the ego ideal creates a politics that manifests what I think of as a drive to the extreme .
There are a number of dimensions to this .
First is what we may see as the insatiability of demand .
In the absence of a superego which can adjudicate between reasonable and unreasonable claims , the measure of victimization must be the subjective feeling of being victimized .
To be sure , the feeling of being victimized may come from real victimization , but the exploration of narcissism shows that this feeling also can come from interpreting the indifference of the world as a personal threat .
This , of course , is the mechanism of paranoia .
This means that , as real victimization is eliminated , the university 's process stands in danger of coming under the control of the community 's most easily offended , most paranoid elements .
The insatiability of demand has another dimension to it .
As Maslow ( 1970 ) observed , most of us want a positive conception of our self .
We want to see ourselves , and wants others to see us , as persons who have done something worthwhile : to have a sense of our self as strong and active .
In a word , we want respect and self - respect .
But this is not something we can attain on the basis of having been victimized in the past .
At its best , recognition of oneself as having been victimized reflects a sense of the self as comparatively weak and passive .
To be sure , the circumstances of victimization may have been such that any self would have been overcome .
But be that as it may , there is no way of resolving this dilemma .
Failure , no matter how inevitable , is still failure .
And the pity of others can never help us to get beyond the sense of ourselves as pitiful .
At its worst , the claim of victimization may fall on deaf ears , and be met with increasing resentment , hostility , and a feeling that one is getting more than one deserves .
In the absence of a superego that could offer a program for the attainment of respect , the perception that others pity or resent them is likely only to raise the level of the victim group 's feeling of being unloved .
Sadly , the logic of narcissism leads victim groups to redouble the efforts which caused them this pain in the first place .
Another reason why PC tends to move the university toward the extreme has to do with the logic of moral debate .
As I have said above , under the superego , debate centers around the issue of what is true and what course of action is right .
Under the rule of the primordial mother , debate becomes a matter of who is good .
The aim of the debate is to show that one 's opponent is bad ( in this case racist , sexist , homophobic or the like ) and that one is good .
For some groups , being good just means being a member of the group , as defined by its ideology of victimization .
For others , and specifically for white males , being good means proving that one is good despite one 's group identification .
The result of this is that , for white males who make up the university power structure , goodness is always in question and must be demonstrated continually , through a kind of moral one - upmanship that operates by an incremental ratcheting up of the stakes .
On top of this , one must see the intrapsychic dimension that operates here .
The PC individual , especially the white male , must not only operate according to the rules of a game of moral goodness .
He also must prove to himself that he is good .
But goodness in this case means the absolute love of the oppressed .
There is no room here for ambivalence or measure .
Yet love is within the domain of the ego ideal .
It is irreducibly narcissistic .
Even the love of the mother for her child is based on her identification with the child .
The love of the oppressed demands something that is psychologically impossible , the permanent abandonment of one 's own separate identity in exchange for enthusiastic subordination to the narcissism of another .
Individuals who accepts this demand must experience their own spontaneous responses as a continual indictment and condemnation of themselves .
The point is that in a moral universe defined either by being or by loving the oppressed , one 's own ego ideal and superego are defined as oppression .
This is intolerable to the self , which must be permanently vigilant against this perception of badness , political incorrectness , at the core of its own being .
Notice again how this process differs from what one would find under the superego .
The superego attaches goodness and badness to behavior , and permits behavioral acts of reparation as ways of compensating for previous badness .
Narcissism attaches goodness and badness to the self , and does not permit reparative actions as a way of reestablishing one 's goodness .
Narcissism demands an absolute , perfect goodness , and our own recognition that we fall short of that ideal drives the continual recreation of a perfect fictional identity and the abandonment of who one is .
One way of dealing with this dilemma is by finding political incorrectness in others before they can find it in oneself .
In effect , this is projecting one 's own badness onto others and attacking it there .
This phenomenon is a manifestation of the dynamic which psychoanalysis refers to as " projective identification . " ( Klein , 1975 ) .
Such projection offers one the aspect of perfect goodness as a righteous warrior in the struggle against absolute evil , a role which offers narcissistic benefits , especially in the form of self - righteousness , in excess of anything the real world can provide .
This , no doubt , helps to explain some of the vigor and verve with which the campaign for PC is pursued .
The other way to experience one 's own political incorrectness is with shame , which delegitimates the self and takes one and one 's own good sense out of the way of the PC tide .
There is an irony to this that is worthy of mention .
If PC is to be justified , it must be justified as a way of combating racism .
But Young ( 1993 ) has observed that racism is itself a form of projective identification .
Seeing PC as a form of projective identification leads us to wonder how effective it possibly can be in this combat .
This notion suggests the alternative possibility of complementary dynamics of projective identification , each reinforcing and justifying the other .
The Anomaly of Female Power
One further point which needs to be made about the psychodynamics of the PC university relates to the ambiguous position of women .
Within the psychology I have outlined here , women are seen as defenseless victims of male oppression on one hand , and as exemplars of the omnipotent primordial mother on the other .
Thus , we find , on the one hand , that the image of the woman as passive , helpless victim is ubiquitous in our society , with whole classes of institutions having been created to protect these victims .
On the other hand , and indeed partly through the manipulation of this image , women have manifested enormous power in the transformation of almost every aspect of society .
This paradox is particularly interesting in connection with the theory developed here because it is difficult to think of any other way to explain it . [ 6 ]
Conclusion
Having maintained that PC represents psychological regression , it is important to reiterate that regression is not necessarily bad .
On the contrary , as psychoanalytic thinkers such as Kris ( 1952 ) have observed , regression is a necessary element of creativity .
Again , it might be argued , times of continuous change such as those we live in call for the enhancement of creativity in all areas of life .
This may be , putting the best light on it , the deeper social function of postmodernism and the rise of the maternal .
But Kris point was that , in order to contribute to creativity , regression has to be in the service of the ego .
What we see being played out in PC , however , and in the war of the primitive maternal against the paternal generally , is not regression in the service of the ego .
It is regression against the ego .
That is its danger .
How the idea developed , in our time , that the maternal and the paternal are fundamentally in opposition to each other is an interesting question , but one that I cannot engage here ( See Schwartz , 1995 , 1996 ) .
It will suffice to say that this idea of fundamental opposition is in serious error .
Far from being in opposition , the maternal and the paternal require each other if they are to be themselves .
The paternal without the maternal manifests itself as form without content ; the structure the isolated paternal creates is not the structure of anything .
But the maternal without the paternal leads to helpless immersion in unrealizable , sterile fantasy , and makes it impossible to rationally engage the world .
In the end , the result for those mothered in this way can only be grief .
On the level of personality , the hypertrophy of the paternal is represented by the obsessive - compulsive ; but the type representing the unadorned maternal arrays itself against external reality itself .
It moves toward the psychotic ( Frosh , 1991 ) .
Putting the matter this way may help us avoid the temptation of trying to choose between them .
To be fully adult means having internalized both the maternal and the paternal .
It means being both father and mother to oneself .
The university serves the purpose of maturation when it provides students with maternal and paternal influences which they can bring into themselves .
But when the university structures itself as a battle between these two essential principles , standing for the destruction of one by the other , it takes a stand against maturation , and tends to make the difficult process of maturation all the more difficult .
NOTES
[ 1 ] Klein ( 1975 ) refers to this primordial , all - loving , omnipotent mother as the " good breast . "
My relationship with my father was more man to man .
He required of a fully developed human being that she have exhaustively studied both Max Shulman and Machiavelli , Django Reinhardt and Louis Armstrong ...
His motto was " winners need not explain . "
He treated B's as if they were F's ....
If you could n't keep up , you got left .
I kept up ....
My father exercised only the tyranny of his expectations , but it was tyranny enough .
And then , not so many years ago , I realized that , like a heart transplant after the rejection phase , his expectations for me had become my own .
And I stopped valuing myself by how my father valued me .
I know from literature and life that is perhaps the greatest passage that human beings ever make .
( 1993 : E17 )
Again , men have no pleasure , but on the contrary a great deal of grief , in keeping company , where there is no power able to overawe them all .
For every man looketh that his companion should value him at the same rate he sets upon himself ; and upon all signs of contempt , or undervaluing , naturally endeavors , as far as he dares ( which amongst them that have no common power to keep them in quiet , is far enough to make them destroy each other ) , to extort a greater value from his contemners by damage , and from others by the example .
( emphasis added , 160 )
Which contributes strongly to this :
In such condition there is no place for industry , because the fruit thereof is uncertain : and consequently no culture of the earth ; no navigation , nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea ; no commodious building ; no instruments of moving , and removing , such things as require much force ; no knowledge of the face of the earth ; no account of time ; no arts ; no letters ; no society ; and which is worst of all , continual fear , and danger of violent death ..
This male students female teaching assistant responded this way in the margin of the paper :
This is ludicrous & inappropriate & OFFENSIVE .
This is completely inappropriate for a serious political science paper .
It completely violates the standard of non-sexist writing .
Professor Rosenstone has encouraged me to interpret this comment as an example of sexual harassment and to take the appropriate formal steps .
I have chosen not to do so in this instance .
However , any future comments , in a paper , in a class or in any dealings w/ me will be interpreted as sexual harassment and formal steps will be taken .
Professor Rosenstone is aware of these comments -- & is prepared to intervene .
You are forewarned ! ( The Michigan Review , 1993 )
The disparity here between the frail , vulnerable woman , grievously damaged by the merest mention of male sexuality ; and the powerful woman , capable of mobilizing the full weight of the University of Michigan against a hapless sophomore , is breathtaking .

Part Five of my reviews ......
October 25 , 2016
Part Five of my reviews ... following on from the Uni Shift .
A lot of people have been raving about the Kuru Toga so I was curious .
I only bought the least expensive plastic version to try .
Even if it is the entry - level version , it feels nicely solid and well - made .
In fact , it feels more solid and well - made than its much more expensive stable - mate , the Shift .
It 's comfortable in use , even for quite long writing sessions and it's been reliable .
But it all rides on the special lead rotation mechanism which is supposed to automatically keep an even , sharp point on the lead as you write .
The mechanism definitely works but for me it only works when I 'm making an effort to write so that it will .
The first issue I had is that I am used to writing with pencils and found it quite difficult to stop rotating the pencil and let the mechanism do it for me .
The next is that I tend to write in cursive .
The mechanism works by rotating the lead each time you lift the pencil from the page .
If you do n't lift the pencil much , it does n't rotate the lead enough .
I found that even doing pages of maths ( as I do ) it was n't working .
Printing in capitals showed off the mechanism best .
It formed a perfect conical point on the lead and produced fine , even lettering .
It 's just a pity that I rarely write in capitals .
I also made things worse by swapping to 4B lead .
I love the 4B lead because it produces a nice line with very little pressure but , unfortunately , very little pressure is not ideal for the Kuru Toga mechanism and tends to result in very little rotation of the lead .
Finally I also realised that I do n't particularly want a fine line all the time .
I like the way the soft leads make a chisel point so I can have a wider line most of the time or as fine as I like if I turn the pencil .
None of this is really a flaw of the pencil and if you write in the right way , with enough pressure and want the fine line then it is very good .
For example , I assume that it was invented for complicated multi-stroke Japanese characters and I imagine it is excellent for that .
Even if the rotation mechanism did n't really work for me , I would have been tempted to keep using the Kuru Toga anyway because I just like the feel of it - except for one thing .
Presumably because of the rotation mechanism , the tip has a LOT of play in it .
The wobbly imprecise tip is too much of a price to pay , for me , for a rotation mechanism that does n't do a lot for me in a pencil which is n't pocket safe .

Sound legal arguments , you have met your match
by Jeremy Hooper
With any court case , there are a whole slew of amicus briefs , support letters , and other supplementary documents that various groups file to voice their views on the matter at hand .

But hey , at least they 've owned their forced marriage of church and state .

Architectural acoustics is more complicated than it should be .
There 's a lot of work to do .
FuzzMeasure is simple and affordable - the kind of tool that will empower the next generation of designers , consultants , and researchers .
To be able to show both the Waterfall and Reverb Time ( RT60 ) graphs at the same time [ in FuzzMeasure 4 ] , without having to close one and then open the other , will save a lot of time as far as them grasping the scope of problems in the space .
I ’m not a trained acoustician , I ’m an audio engineer .
I 'm not the guy designing rooms on a piece of paper , but I can tell you if a room sounds good or not .
That ’s why I like FuzzMeasure .
A lot of clients just want you to tune the room fast and FuzzMeasure has definitely expedited the process .
A lot of mastering engineers do n’t do their own room scans however I feel that you have to know how to do your own work in case something gets accidentally moved or bumped .
Before FuzzMeasure , I did all this by ear .
FuzzMeasure is one of the many helpful tools I use to do my job effectively .
As he demonstrated in his campaign for the presidency , Barack Obama thinks long .
Hence , the new President - elect is better prepared to take office than any other newly elected chief executive in the history of the modern presidency .
( This includes vice - presidents who succeeded to the office , with the possible exception of George H.W. Bush . )
While still in the midst of the grueling contest for the presidency , Obama and his advisers deliberated and planned how he wanted to conduct a possible transition and how he wanted to govern .
This is unusual .
A preelection transition team was formed in early August , weeks before the final campaign began , and put in the hands of the wise and experienced John Podesta , who had held high positions in the Clinton White House and is now the head of the Center for American Progress , a think tank in Washington he founded in 2003 to generate progressive ideas .
Even earlier , not long after he wrapped up the nomination in June , Obama recruited Phil Schiliro , former top aide to California congressman Henry Waxman , to try to keep the Democratic Congress in synch with the campaign .
When during the election race Obama felt that he had to relent on the issue of offshore drilling , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , of California , who is highly sensitive to protecting coastlines , reluctantly switched her position to support him .
Well before the election , Schiliro and other Obama campaign staff members were also in frequent touch behind the scenes with Democratic congressional leaders about the future agenda .
( Schiliro will serve as head of congressional relations in the Obama White House . )
The day after Obama ’s election , he announced an official transition team — led by Podesta , together with Valerie Jarrett , a former city official and businesswoman from Chicago , as well as a longtime Obama friend and adviser , and Pete Rouse , Obama ’s Senate chief of staff — and was well along in his thinking about how to go about setting up his presidency .
By moving quickly , he established that he was taking charge ; several of his predecessors had thrashed about for quite a while in setting up their own teams .
Obama learned from their mistakes ; his decision to name a chief of staff first , in order to start early in shaping the White House staff and making other critical decisions , was in sharp contrast to Bill Clinton ’s waiting until mid-December to name his chief of staff .
And Clinton ’s choice of Mac McLarty , a kindergarten friend from Hope , Arkansas , a nice man with no Washington experience , was n’t a success .
McLarty was replaced two years later .
( In time , Podesta held that job . )
Obama ’s naming of Rahm Emanuel , a former Clinton aide and now high - ranking member of Congress , two days after the election reflected Obama ’s own very tough qualities .
Emanuel ’s notorious toughness is what Obama wanted in order to get things done .
Obama said privately that Emanuel will “ have my back , ” i.e. , be his protector .
Emanuel ’s position in Congress — as chairman of the Democratic caucus he is the fourth - ranking Democrat and he managed the Democrats ’ highly …
In his powerful post , my colleague Ross Douthat explores what torture means , and whether we can sustain a clear boundary between torture and " torture - lite . "
Here 's how I tackle that thorny question , after exploring it for many years .
Focusing on techniques can be misleading .
What it tends to do is make longer , less immediate forms of torture more acceptable than , say , pulling out the finger - nails or electrocuting testicles .
But as I 've been forced to discover over these past few gut - wrenching years , the torture created by freezing someone to near death or heating them to near - insanity or stretching their limbs day after day or depriving them of any real sleep for months on end is no less torture than the comic book Jack Bauer variety .
In fact , if you read accounts of torture in the Soviet gulag or the Gestapo 's " Third Degree " , you find that the torture that left no physical scars was in some ways worse .
Raping an individual 's soul and mind through a war of attrition against their body and humanity can be achieved in many ways .
Ask John McCain or Menachem Begin , two men who are neither liberal wimps nor pacifists .
Our enemies are human beings .
They are never utterly evil ; and we are never utterly good .
Forgetting this truth is to dance with the devil in ways Americans very rarely have .
Throwing out the rule of law or , worse , just rewriting it with hired legal guns to make a mockery of its plain meaning , is to throw out our own protection against the devil as well , when he comes to get us .
And if we do not believe that the power to torture , to wield this kind of total power over other individuals , can warp a mind and destroy a soul , we are ignoring history .

Need machine for DPH benchmarking
Hi all , we , the DPH team , are at the moment in the very unfortunate situation of not having a proper machine for running our benchmarks on .
Could a kind soul maybe give us ( i.e. , me ) access to a quadcore or 2xquadcore x86 Linux or OS X machine ?
I only need to build ghc on it and run small benchmarks which never take more than a couple of minutes , maybe once every couple of days or so .
We do need to use all cores , though , so no other CPU - intensive processes can be running during benchmarking .
This is only for a week or two , until we get our own machine .
We would be eternally grateful and wo n't forget you when DPH takes over the world .

More on Gold Backwardation
Over the last few weeks , there have been a lot of articles on the Internet about backwardation , i.e. , when the price of commodities for delivery today is higher than the price of commodities for delivery in the future .
Like nearly all the things on the Internet , most of what was written is useful , but some of it is total rubbish , and it takes time to sort through to find the gems from the rest .
I offer the following in the hope that it clears up some of the confusion that has arisen about backwardation as well as to provide some insight into today ’s gold market .
Backwardations are no big deal in most commodities , but they are indeed a very big deal for gold .
Since I started following gold in the 1970s , I can recall seeing a gold backwardation against the US dollar only three times .
Fortunately , we can pinpoint the exact dates from data made available by the London Bullion Market Association , which regularly posts the “ GoFo ” ( gold forward ) interest rate at its website .
http://www.lbma.org.uk/?area=stats&page=gofo/2008gofo
http://www.lbma.org.uk/stats/goldfwds
The first occurrence was November 29 , 1995 .
That backwardation lasted for a day and was probably the result of a hedge buy - back by Barrick Gold completed then ( one was announced by it shortly thereafter ) .
The next occurrence lasted for two days , September 29 - 30 , 1999 , after several central banks announced the Washington Agreement on Gold .
That accord set off a mad rush for physical gold to cover short positions in the wake of the price surge triggered by their announcement .
The third occurrence happened last month , and continued for three business days , November 20 , 21 and 24 .
There was not any apparent event triggering this latest backwardation as there was with the two previous occurrences .
But it probably reflects the exceptionally strong demand recently for physical metal .
We can reasonably conclude from the above observations that gold rarely trades in backwardation .
It almost always trades in contango , i.e. , the price for delivery today is lower than the price for delivery in the future .
Therefore , gold is very different from other commodities , all of which frequently trade in backwardation .
Why is gold different ?
Gold is money .
In other words , gold ’s usefulness does not arise from its consumption , but rather , from its accumulation .
In contrast to all other commodities , gold does not get used up and consumed in its applications .
Rather , gold is hoarded , or as I like to say it because it is money , gold is saved .
Gold therefore contrasts to all other commodities because it has a huge aboveground stock of inventory that is available to come back into the market in exchange for national currencies if the price is right .
This aboveground stock is comprised of essentially all the gold mined throughout history .
Other commodities have very little aboveground stock relative to the amount consumed , with the result that shortages in these other commodities can and do occur .
These shortages make it difficult if not impossible to arbitrage any backwardation that appears in these other commodities .
If there were a huge aboveground inventory , one could sell their inventory today and buy it back in the future at a cheaper price , profiting from the difference .
Gold ’s huge aboveground stock makes it different from other commodities .
Backwardation in gold does not occur in practice because there are always people willing to profit by selling some of their hoard in the spot market and buying back gold at a lower price in the future , except the three rare instances noted above .
In the first two instances , the market for physical gold was temporarily disrupted .
The reasons for the third backwardation are not yet certain , but it is important to consider its possible causes .
The demand for physical gold has been strong recently for a number of reasons , but perhaps the two most important are relatively low US dollar interest rates and the growing concern about counterparty risk .
These factors make holding physical gold an increasingly attractive alternative compared to holding US dollars in particular and national currencies generally , and as a result , it is possible that November ’s backwardation may be the precursor of a fundamental change in the gold market .
What could that change be ?
We do n’t need to speculate here because there are only two possible answers .
The first is that gold goes into backwardation because no one who owns gold is willing to sell their hoard at the current price .
I noted this possibility in my August 17th alert http://www.goldmoney.com/en/commentary/2008-08-17.html posted on the GoldMoney website .
I wrote back then : “ The extraordinary demand for coins and small bars can be viewed as an early sign that the market is moving into backwardation .
In other words , the backwardation is in effect being reflected by higher premiums above spot for physical metal , rather than spot itself rising and going into backwardation .
Central banks do not transact in small bars and their coin transactions are inconsequential compared to the size of the market .
So the market for fabricated product is relatively free from government influence .
But central banks of course exert a dominant influence on the market for LBMA - sized bars by using their existing gold stocks , and they can keep the spot price for gold ( which is determined by the buying / selling of LBMA - sized bars ) artificially low by dishoarding gold from their vaults .
So my thought is that if gold does not climb back above at least $ 900 quickly , a shortage of LBMA - sized bars will develop unless central banks allow their vaults to be cleaned out , much like Ft. Knox was drained in the weeks leading up to the 2 - tiered London gold price created in March 1968 . ”
The 3 - day backwardation in November indicates that a shortage of LBMA bars seems to be developing .
The implication is that the gold cartel is about to lose its grip on the gold market , and can no longer cap the gold price at current levels .
The second possible answer is more ominous .
If gold does trade in backwardation against US dollar for a protracted period ( again , barring a very short - term and ephemeral event like the first two instances noted above in which a temporary demand for physical gold disrupts normal market activity ) , it will mean that a collapse of the dollar has begun .
Think about it .
How could gold go into backwardation for any prolonged period ?
If it does , it would mean that no one is willing to take the risk of selling their hoard and instead hold US dollars .
It would mean that no one is willing to accept the risks that come with holding dollars while waiting until they can be used at a future date to exchange back into gold .
Those risks are : the dollar can be created out of thin air by governments , and holding dollars has counterparty risk .
The trillions of dollars of newly created bail - out money highlight the first risk , and the sad state of the banking industry today makes clear the second .
Physical gold has neither of these risks .
So because of the greater risk of holding dollars , dollar interest rates are higher than gold 's interest rates .
In short , the higher interest rate currency is always in backwardation when the forwards are measured against a currency with lower interest rates .
In recent years , the politically correct thing to do is to call gold 's interest rate a “ lease rate ” , which is unfortunate .
If people recognized that gold has an interest rate because it is money , they would more quickly grasp the significance of a gold backwardation if it were to occur .
The contango is gold 's interest rate .
For more information about gold backwardation , I recommend the following : a monograph entitled “ Golden Sextant ” by Reg Howe , which is available at the following link :
http://www.goldensextant.com/goldensextant.html
an article by Doug Pollitt , which can be downloaded by clicking here .
In summary , the market for physical gold is tight .
The extraordinarily high premiums now being charged on coins and small bars is the most visible aspect of this incredible tightness .
The negative GoFo rate for three days in November is another example .
This tightness in the physical market for gold could be a passing phenomenon , but then again , maybe not .
It may be any indication that the gold market is profoundly changing , which will cause the price of gold to soar because the gold cartel is unable or unwilling to use any of its remaining inventory to cap the gold price at current levels , or because US dollar is becoming suspect .
Then again , it is not unreasonable to conclude that both factors may be at work here .
After all , the collapse in the US Dollar Index this month strongly suggests that the dollar ’s 4 - month bear market rally ended in November .
In any case , we ’ll know for sure that the gold price is ready to soar if GoFo goes negative and remains negative .
If that happens , take note of the old saying that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush .

The raw ingredients for planets could be created by supersonic shock waves around young stars , a new study to appear in the Astrophysical Journal suggests .
NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope recently examined five baby solar systems with planets just beginning to form .
The observations revealed the presence of tiny quartz crystals that can only form after flash heating followed by rapid cooling , conditions that scientists think could be the result of shock waves of pressure , akin to those from jets that cause sonic booms .
The quartz crystals Spitzer found , called cristobalite and tridymite , are some of the building blocks of planets .
During the early stages of planet formation , dust grains in the pancake - like disks of dust and gas surrounding young stars crystallize and stick together , eventually snowballing to form a planet .
Shock waves might arise when clouds of gas swirling around these planet - forming disks collide at high speeds .
And this , scientists say , could jump start the process of birthing planets .
" By studying these other star systems , we can learn about the very beginnings of our own planets 4.6 billion years ago , " astronomer William
Forrest of the University of Rochester who led the research , said in a release .
" Spitzer has given us a better idea of how the raw materials of planets are produced very early on . "
In fact , the observations of these star systems about 400 light - years away agree with findings in our own neighborhood .
Ancient meteorites that fell to Earth have been found to harbor round grains called chondrules .
These pebbles also require special circumstances to form , and shock waves in our solar system ’s early disk could be responsible .

The Libertarian Party ’s lawsuit against Louisiana for keeping Bob Barr off the ballot last month is still alive and active .
Here is the party ’s 43 - page brief , filed on December 8 in the 5th circuit .
One little - known fact about this case is that both the Democratic and Republican Parties also failed to file their presidential elector candidates by the statutory deadline , September 2 .
The Secretary of State created a new deadline ( September 8 ) by fiat , but the case argues that under Article II , only state legislatures can create election laws .
This sculpture is the first £ 1 m object to be valued on the Antiques Roadshow Antony Gormley 's design model for his Angel of the North sculpture has become the first £ 1 m object to be valued on BBC One 's Antiques Roadshow .
The model was one of a number Gormley made to win over sceptical councillors ahead of the statue 's commissioning .
Fine art expert Philip Mould broke the news during the recording of the show at The Sage in Gateshead .
Series editor Simon
Shaw said : " This was one of the most exciting moments that we 've ever had on the show . "
Mr Mould said : " It 's a great thrill to me that something produced in the last 15 years has broken the record for the most valuable item to ever have been on the show . "
He said a larger Gormley design model had recently sold at auction for £ 2 m .
The model on Antiques Roadshow , 6ft high and 17ft across , is owned by Gateshead Council and had been in council offices for 13 years .
Councillor John McElroy , who was on the council when it voted for the sculpture , said : " It was a very inspired and bold choice , because you have created on its site probably the most successful contemporary sculpture in Britain . "
Sculptor Gormley told the Sunday Times the models were made to help attract funding and support from politicians and local residents .
The mini-Angel was made to promote the idea of a sculpture " Gateshead was short of money so we helped them by making quite a lot of maquettes to sell the idea , " he said .
The steel angel , 66ft high and 178ft across , was unveiled by the A1 on the outskirts of Gateshead in 1998 .
The programme 's previous most expensive valuation had been a collection of silverware which appeared in 2007 .
Recently a vase bought at a car boot sale in Dumfries for £ 1 and identified by Antiques Roadshow experts as valuable Feuilles Fougeres sold at auction for £ 32,450 .
The Antiques Roadshow has seen a resurgence in viewing figures of late , with nearly nine million now tuning in on a Sunday evening since Fiona Bruce took over this year .

Vinton G. “ Vint ” Cerf is n’t crazy about being called “ the father of the Internet ” — he insists that many people were involved in its invention .
But he is the man who did the most to make it happen , writing the communication protocol for Arpanet ( the “ original ” Internet developed by the Defense Department in the late 1960s ) and codesigning the protocols ( known as TCP / IP — Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol ) that allow computers everywhere to communicate with each other , giving us access to whole worlds of information .
In 2005 Cerf ( and longtime collaborator Robert Kahn ) received the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the highest civilian honor given in the United States , in recognition of work that had placed them “ at the forefront of a digital revolution that has transformed global commerce , communication , and entertainment . ”
Cerf has attributed his interest in the Internet in part to having lost much of his hearing when he was a child .
Internet communication technologies , he points out , provide “ a level playing field ” for deaf people .
Most recently Cerf has been involved with NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in helping move the Internet to other parts of the universe .
The “ Interplanetary Internet ” will create new means of communication from planet to planet with the use of radio / laser technologies .
An appreciation by Tim Berners - Lee , inventor of the World Wide Web and holder of the 3Com Founders Chair at the MIT Lab for Computer Science .
Vint ’s great success was to make the Internet a platform that is usable for all kinds of future technologies , without trying to second - guess what they might be .
Thanks to this approach , I was able to design the Web on top of the Internet because it was a strong but plain foundation for things to come .
In designing Web technology , we try to take the same approach .
As a person , Vint has been not only an engineer but a leader .
He has tried to ensure that both the Net and the community of developers evolve in a healthy way .
This means both sound engineering and a positive impact on society .
" While I do n't agree with the idea of councillors actually growing cannabis in plots near their town halls a positive development has been that our government has now said it will take a close look at the issue of where the cannabis should come from .
We could see the problem of the two doors - legal front door for customers , illegal back door for supplies - being resolved soon . "
( Adds background , analyst comment )
WASHINGTON , Nov 19 ( Reuters ) - Al Qaeda deputy Ayman al Zawahri 's message criticizing U.S. president - elect Barack Obama and urging attacks on " criminal " America demonstrates the militant network is isolated but still a threat , a U.S. counterterrorism official said on Wednesday .
" The message , unsurprising in its bitter tone and content , is remarkable chiefly as an additional sign that al - Qaeda is out of touch with so much of the world .
But , even in its growing isolation , this is still a group that can do serious damage , " the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity ,
Zawahri said in the message that the incoming president would fail if he followed Bush 's policies , reinforced troops in Afghanistan and did not withdraw from Muslim lands .
Analyst Adam Raisman of the SITE Intelligence group , a U.S. - based terrorism monitor , said Zawahri 's audio recording was the first authoritative al Qaeda message on Obama 's Nov. 4 election , but it was not certain that he recorded it after the election .
Zawahri appears to being shifting al Qaeda 's focus to Obama as the face of U.S. policy after long portraying outgoing President George W. Bush in that role , and seeking to justify further attacks against the United States , Raisman said .
The threats contain little new , he said .
" It 's the same message that he 's been carrying for quite a few years -- ' you either leave our lands or suffer the repercussions . ' "
By accusing Obama of betraying his father 's Muslim heritage and comparing him unfavorably with the black American Muslim leader Malcolm X , Zawarhi also seems to be seeking to counter Obama 's broad international popularity and to cast him in a negative light to al Qaeda supporters , Raisman said .

There are about 26,000 Yanomami in the Amazon rain forest , in Venezuela and Brazil , where they subsist as seminomadic hunters and cultivators of crops like manioc and bananas .
They remain susceptible to ailments for which they have weak defenses , including respiratory diseases and drug - resistant strains of malaria .
In Puerto Ayacucho , they can be seen wandering through the traffic - clogged streets , clad in the modern uniform of T - shirts and baggy pants , toting cellphones .
Earlier this decade , the anthropology world was consumed by claims by the writer Patrick Tierney that American scholars may have started and exacerbated a measles epidemic in the late 1960s that killed hundreds of Yanomami .
And claims of medical neglect emerged before Mr. Chávez expelled the American missionaries , who numbered about 200 .
They administered care to the Yanomami with donated medicine from the United States and transported them to clinics on small propeller planes using dozens of airstrips carved out of the jungle .
New Tribes , the most prominent of the expelled groups , has denied Mr. Chávez ’s charges of espionage but declined to comment for this article , citing the tense relations between Venezuela and the United States .
Mr. González and other Yanomami leaders provided the names of 50 people , including 22 children , who they said died from ailments like malaria and pneumonia after the military limited civilian and missionary flights to their villages in 2005 .
The military replaced the missionaries ’ operations with its own fleet of small planes and helicopters , but critics say the missions were infrequent or unresponsive .

The Yanomami leaders said they made the list public after showing it to health and military officials and receiving a cold response .
“ They told us we should be grateful for the help we ’re already being given , ” said Eduardo Mejía , 24 , a Yanomami leader from the village of El Cejal .
The pound has hit a new record low against the euro as the grim outlook for the UK economy continues to put downward pressure on the currency .
Weak house price data and figures showing that homeowners are choosing to repay their mortgages rather than spending , pushed the currency lower .
Low trading levels in the foreign exchange markets also helped to force sterling down to 1.0198 euros .
Many analysts believe parity with the euro is now only a matter of time .
The rate for tourists buying their currency before they travel has almost reached parity , where one pound buys one euro .
At one major High Street currency exchange , 100 euros currently costs £ 99.11 .
Downward pressure Property consultants Hometrack predicted a 12 % fall in UK property prices in 2009 , while figures from the Bank of England showed that households were more keen to pay off their mortgages than borrow money against the value of their homes for spending .
The path to parity is self - fulfilling

Check the latest exchange rate
What the exchange rate means for you Towards the end of October , one pound bought 1.287 euros .
But a string of bad news about the prospects for the UK economy caused sterling to fall .
In December last year , a pound would have bought more than 1.4 euros .
At its peak in 2000 , the pound was worth more than 1.7 euros .
There are two main factors putting downward pressure on the pound , analysts suggest .
First , interest rates in the UK are lower than those in the eurozone , which makes the pound less attractive to foreign investors .
Analysts believe the economic slowdown in the UK will be more severe than in the eurozone , which means the Bank of England could be forced to lower interest rates from their current level of 2 % .
Interest rates in the eurozone currently stand at 2.5 % and the European Central Bank has hinted that further rate cuts are unlikely early in the New Year .
Second , trading levels over the holiday period are low , which means that any moves in exchange rates are exaggerated .
" Actual liquidity levels are painfully thin , " said Daniel Baker at Informa Global Markets .
He believes parity with the euro is almost inevitable .
" The path to parity is self - fulfilling , " he said .

Absolute Beginner Course ( 1 of 5 ) – How to Hold your Ukulele
After tracking down numerous alternatives to Google App Engine after hitting a wall on Project Fangorn , I looked at the most promising alternatives in more depth .
Here is what I found .
GigaSpaces
Using GigaSpaces XAP would mean–at a minimum–creating Python bindings to their C++ API and re-writing my data model .
Actually running on their EC2 value added service costs a significant premium over what Amazon EC2 costs .
While they do offer XAP free to startups , in that case then you have to operate your own servers and the list of alternatives in that space is quite large .
I also could n’t find any statements by GigaSpaces that indicated that you could have no instances running and have one spun up if a web request comes in , so it looks like at least one small instance would have to be running constantly putting the minimum cost at over $ 200 a month to use their EC2 service .
10gen
Using 10 gen would currently mean a total rewrite as it currently supports Jython rather then Python and the effort to get Pylons working on Jython is not yet complete .
Once that effort is complete 10 gen becomes more promising as then I should only need to rewrite my datamodel and I might not even need to do that at some point as the 10gen folks have indicated they are willing to take on the portability issue .
In their alpha stage , they are providing free hosting with quotas and their FAQ states “ but will be competitive with other offerings , and with a very low minimum bill size ” .
For those using Django rather then Pylons 10 gen is working on putting the DJango data model on top of their API .
Amazon EC2 & SimpleDB
Running Python is no problem on EC2 , nor is accessing SimpleDB since it is accessed via a REST API .
So after rewriting my datamodel I would get the joy of managing my own instances and a minimum bill of over $ 70 a month .
I could add third party instance management for an increase in my monthly minimum to over $ 100 a month .
UPDATE 10/23/2008 : Amazon has announced a private beta for their own monitoring , load balancing , and automatic scaling service offering .
No mention of price and it seems likely to be simply included with EC2 service .
Now waiting …
to see who gets there first .
Will it be :
Google by raising their mcycle soft cap , excluding the mcycle consumption of puts from the calculation , or reducing the mcycle consumption of puts ?
GigaSpaces by lowering their EC2 premium , allowing an app to go offline until a web request comes in , and providing Python bindings ?
10 gen indirectly with the help of those working on getting Pylons working on Jython ( or directly by providing the DJango data model for those using Django ) ?
Someone else ?
If they all take too long ?
Then there are numerous options and a few of them follow .
The one that might involve the least changes to my existing code could be continuing and expanding the work of this project to make the GAE SDK portable .
While doing this work would also help other GAE refugees to just change providers without changing code I do n’t feel a great need to tie myself to the GAE API / object model .
An interesting project is Terracotta which uses Aspect Orient Programming to distribute existing multi- threaded Java apps .
It could be possible to reuse everything in the project except for the part doing the aspecting , which would need to be rewritten to Python .
Such an effort could potentially be combined with the work of continuing and expanding the work of making the GAE SDK portable .
Another interesting project is OpenSSI , which basically does the reverse of what is of virtualization .
Rather then allowing multiple virtual machines to run on one physical machine , OpenSSI allows multiple physical machines ( and virtual machines to I ’d imagine ) to be treated as one machine from the perspective of a virtual process ( and thus from the developer ’s perspective ) .
You still have to deal sychronization just like writing a multi- threaded process as well as inter-process communication between different virtual processes , but you do n’t have to deal with writing distribution code .
This may not be a great thing to use for Python because of its global interpreter lock .
When I started getting into Python a couple of years ago I made the decision to multiprocess rather then multithread because of the GIL .
This has a couple of advantages anyway .
One being robustness and the other being just a step away from being a networked distributed app .
If something could be developed to allow the use of Terracotta with Python , then its likely the same could be done to make take advantage of OpenSSI as well .
The PyPy project could be useful in combining Terracotta or OpenSSI with Python since its goal is to let you create a custom interpretor for Python .
Another interesting project is Hadoop which is a distributed filesystem and its derivative HBase which is a distributed database .
Durus could be a starting point for distributed transactional memory in Python .
I say starting point as it ’s home page states “ Durus is best suited to collections of less than a million instances with relatively stable state ” so clearly it does n’t scale as is .
This Wikipedia entry also lists numerous other software transactional memory implementations although most are not distributed but OpenSSI could be utilized to provide that .
CCTV : October 05/08 : Watch until the end !... this moron takes out the front of someones car in a parking lot and by the looks of it was leaving the scene ... does n't realise they performed this maneuver in front of a police officer
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wal - Mart Stores Inc , which is gaining market share amid a global economic downturn , said Lee Scott will retire as chief executive early next year and will be succeeded by Mike Duke , who heads its international operations .

The world 's largest retailer said Scott will retire as chief executive early next year , and will be succeeded by Mike Duke , who heads its international operations .
REUTERS / Combination
The world ’s largest retailer also promoted Eduardo Castro - Wright , 53 , a rising star at the helm of its U.S. operation , to vice chairman , effective immediately .
The surprise announcement on Friday , landing one week before the crucial Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend , comes as Wal - Mart builds on its strength as a discount retailer in a contracting U.S. economy .
Duke , 58 , who will become Wal - Mart ’s fourth chief executive officer , also takes over as the retailer increasingly looks overseas to fuel expansion as U.S. growth slows .
“ Some of you might be wondering why we are making the change at this time , ” Chairman Rob Walton said in a memo to employees .
“ I think Lee said it best when he told me , ‘ This is a great job , but you ca n’t do it forever and at that point you have an obligation to find the right time for a transition ’ . ”
Walton , son of Wal - Mart founder Sam Walton , said he was “ confident that the strategy we have in place is the right one for future success and Mike has been actively involved in developing and executing this strategy .
The CEO change is effective February 1 , 2009 , Wal - Mart said .
Analysts said the succession plan is being outlined as Wal - Mart gets back on track , boosting profits by persistently focusing on low prices .
“ I think it ’s good .
I ’m happy to see it , ” said Joseph Feldman , an analyst with Telsey Advisory Group , of Duke .
Feldman said the timing of the announcement was “ a little strange , ” but recalled that , at Wal - Mart ’s analyst meeting in October , there was almost a sense that Scott was saying farewell and “ finally had the upper hand over Wall Street . ”
He said Castro - Wright ’s promotion could also signal the executive as a future CEO candidate .
“ Wal - Mart is pushing well over $ 400 billion in sales , ” said Thomas Nyheim , portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust .
“ Their business model is probably the only one that ’s working . ”
Wal - Mart shares rose 2.3 percent to $ 51.81 in afternoon trading .
ROCKY TENURE
Scott , 59 , has served as CEO since January of 2000 , with much of his tenure marked by struggles and a stagnating stock price .
From 2000 through 2007 , the company ’s stock fell 31 percent , with most of the drop coming shortly after his promotion .
The stock is up 6.7 percent year - to - date and has outperformed a nearly 49 percent slide in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index .
When the U.S. economy was roaring along , Wal - Mart found itself losing out to trendier stores such as Target Corp and constantly under attack from groups that accused it of mistreating employees and driving competitors out of business with its massive expansion plans .
“ Lee Scott has made life harder for Wal - Mart workers , ” said David Nassar , executive director of Wal - Mart Watch , a union - backed group critical of the retailer .
Scott ’s policies have “ diminished Wal - Mart ’s reputation and hampered its ability to grow , ” he said on Friday .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
A foray into fashion and higher - end merchandise failed to draw wealthier shoppers and its profit took a hit last year when it cut prices to clear out poor - selling merchandise .
Some company - watchers thought at the time that the missteps could cost Scott his job .
But Wal - Mart has returned to its low - cost roots and reined in U.S. expansion , which has paid off as the economy soured and cost - conscious consumers come back to its stores .
Scott , who joined the company in 1979 as an assistant director of logistics , has also tried to portray Wal - Mart as a world leader committed to tackling tough issues like soaring health - care costs and cleaning up the environment .
Scott will remain chairman of the executive committee of the board , receiving an annual salary of $ 1.1 million , and will be employed through January 31 , 2011 .
MAJOR IN THE MAJORS
Duke has overseen Wal - Mart ’s international operations since 2005 and is fond of saying the retailer should “ major in the majors ” -- focus expansion on global markets where it can become a big player instead of simply planting a flag .
Under that strategy , the retailer exited its business in Germany and South Korea in 2006 and has pursued growth in countries such as China , Mexico and Canada .
Its international operations accounted for almost 25 percent of its $ 374.5 billion in total sales last year .
Before overseeing Wal - Mart ’s international unit , Duke was the head of Wal - Mart ’s U.S. operations .
He joined the company in 1995 as senior vice president of logistics .
Wal - Mart will announce a new head of international operations by the end of January , when its fiscal year concludes .

Many people with albinism are living in fear in Tanzania
A six - year - old albino girl in Burundi has been found dead with her head and limbs removed , in the latest killing linked to ritual medicine .
Albinos in the region have been targeted because of a belief peddled by witchdoctors that their body parts can be used for magic potions .
The girl , who was attacked on Sunday , was the sixth person with albinism to be killed in Burundi since September .
There have also been a number of attacks in neighbouring Tanzania .
The latest attack took place in Burundi's eastern province of Ruyigi .
The BBC's Prime Ndikumagenge in Burundi said the child and her family had only just returned to their family home .
Armed attackers broke into the family home and tied up the girl 's parents before shooting her in the head , local officials say .
They had been among a group of about 50 people with albinism to have fled to a provincial centre because they feared for her safety .
The head of the Burundi Albinos ' Association , Kasim Kazungu , says people with albinism had not suffered any discrimination until other Burundians heard about the lucrative trade in albino body parts in neighbouring Tanzania .
Last week , police in south - western Tanzania arrested a man who was attempting to sell his albino wife to Congolese traders .
Two mothers in western Tanzania were also attacked with machetes after gangs failed to find their albino children .
Bottoms ' brothers - Timothy , Joseph and Ben - also became actors
US actor Sam Bottoms , best known for his role as surfer - turned - soldier Lance B Johnson in Apocalypse Now , has died of brain cancer at the age of 53 .
The third of four actor brothers , he was remembered as " handsome , tall ... and very sweet - natured " by that film 's director Francis Ford Coppola .
" Sam was a good actor who seemed right for that part , " he continued .
Bottoms , who died on Tuesday , made his film debut at 15 alongside his brother Timothy in The Last Picture Show .
While visiting his sibling in Texas , he was spotted by director Peter Bogdanovich and cast as a disabled boy forced to lose his virginity to a prostitute .
Producer
Bottoms went on to appear in Clint Eastwood westerns The Outlaw Josey Wales and Bronco Billy before reuniting with Coppola on Gardens of Stone .
In recent years he was seen in Seabiscuit , Shopgirl and SherryBaby , in which he played the father of Maggie Gyllenhaal 's troubled title character .
Born in Santa Barbara , California in 1955 , Bottoms began acting in local theatre productions at the age of 10 .
He is survived by second wife Laura Bickford , a producer whose films include the Oscar - winning Traffic and two - part biopic Che .
What are the religious affiliations of members of the 111th Congress ?
Pretty similar to the American public .
Except for one category …
The “ Unaffiliated ” ?
They apparently do n’t exist in Congress .
Before atheists ask the obvious question , here ’s a more specific breakdown from a report released yesterday by the Pew Forum On Religion & Public Life :
The first question that came to my mind : What about Congressman Pete Stark ?
Is n’t he an atheist ?
Well , yes he is , but he is technically listed as a Unitarian .
( In fact , here ’s a full breakdown of every Congress member along with his / her religious affiliation ( PDF ) — a terrific resource ! )
The ( mis ? ) categorization of Stark leads David Hume of the Secular Right blog to speculate further :
Peter Stark ’s case highlights the likelihood of what is going on : there are almost certainly other “ cryptic atheists ” in Congress , who take advantage of the conventional assumption by Americans that affiliation with a religion connotes theism .
Hume looks at statistics about belief in God among Jewish people and surmises :
It seems very likely that many of the Jews in Congress are culturally and not religiously identified .
A quick & dirty check in the [ General Social Survey ] suggests that Jewish confidence in the existence of God tends to decrease with education …
I ’m still hoping the new Obama administration will give certain members of Congress the impetus and freedom to come out as a non -theist without fearing the worst .
By the way , who are those 5 members of Congress who are “ Unspecified ” or did n’t answer the question ?
Rep. Neil Abercrombie ( D–HI )
Rep. Bill Foster ( D–IL )
Rep. John W. Oliver ( D–MA )
Rep. John F. Tierney ( D–MA )
Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D–WI )

[ A transcript of the SECANT 2008 workshop : Table of Contents ]
The next session of the workshop was a panel of university faculty working in the health sciences , talking about how they use computation in their disciplines and what the key issues are .
Panel chair , Raj Acharya , from Penn State 's Computer Science and Engineering department , opened with the bon mot " all science is computer science " , a reference to a 2001 New York Times piece that I have been using for the last few years when speaking to prospective students , their parents , and other faculty .
By itself , this statement sounds flip , but it is true in many ways .
The telescope astronomers use today is as much a computational instrument as a mechanical one .
Many of the most interesting advances in biology these days are really bioinformatics .
The dawn of big data is changing what we do in CS , but it 's having an even bigger effect in some other sciences by creating a new way to do science .
Modeling is a nascent research method based in computation : propose model , test it against the data , and iterate .
Data mining is an essential step in this new process : all of the data goes into a box , and the box has to make the sense of the data .
This swaps two steps in the traditional scientific method ...
Instead of forming a hypothesis and then testing it by collecting data , a scientist can mine a large collection of data to find candidate hypotheses , and then confirm with more traditional bench science and by checking models against other and larger data sets .
Tony Hazbun , who works in the School of Pharmacy at Purdue , talked about work in systems biology .
He identified four key ideas that biologists need to learn from computer science , which echoed a talk from last year 's workshop :
data visualization
database management ( relational , not flat )
data classification ( cluster analysis )
modeling
Hazbun made one provocative claim that I think hits the heart of why this sort of science is important .
We mine data sets to see patterns that we probably would not have seen otherwise .
This is approach is more objective than traditional science , in which the hypotheses we test are the ones we create out of our own experience .
This is a much more personal approach -- and thus more subjective .
Data mining helps us to step outside our own experience .
Next up was Daisuke Kihara , a Purdue bioinformatician who was educated in Japan .
He talked about the difficulties he has had building a research group of graduate students .
The main problem is that biology students have few or no skills in mathematics and programming , and CS students know little or no biology .
In the US , he said , education is often too discipline - specific , with not enough breadth , which limits the kind of cross-fertilization needed by researchers in bioinformatics .
My university created an undergraduate major in Bioinformatics three years ago in an effort to bridge this gap , in part because biotechnology is an industry targeted for economic development in our state .
( My mind wandered a bit as I thought about Kihara 's claim about US education .
If he is right , then perhaps the US grew strong technically and academically during a time when the major advances came within specific disciplines .
Now that the most important advances are coming in multidisciplinary areas , we may well need to change our approach , or lose our lead .
I 've been concerned about this for a year or so , because I have seen the problem of specializing too soon creeping down into our high schools .
But then I wondered , is Kihara 's claim true ?
Computer science has a history grounded in applications that motivate our advances ; I think it 's a relatively recent phenomenon that we spend most of our time looking inward . )
In addition to technical skills and domain knowledge , scientists of the future need the elusive " problem - solving skills " we all talk about and hope to develop in our courses .
Haixu Tang , from the Informatics program at Indiana contrasted the mentality of what he called information technology and scientific computing :
technique - driven versus problem - driven
general models versus specific , even novel , models
robust , scalable , and modular software versus accurate , efficient programs
These distinctions reflect a cultural divide that makes integrating CS into science disciplines tough .
In Tang 's experience , domain knowledge is not the primary hurdle , but he has found it easier to teach computer scientists biology than to teach biologists computer science .
Tang also described the shift in scientific method that computing enables .
In traditional biology , scientists work from hypothesis to data to knowledge , with a cycle from data back to hypothesis .
In genome science , science can proceed from data to hypothesis to knowledge , with a cycle from hypothesis back to data .
The shift is from hypothesis - driven science to data - driven science .
Simulation has joined theory and statistics in the methodological toolbox .
In the Q - n - A session that followed the panel , someone expressed concern with data - driven research .
Too many people do n't go back to do the experiments needed to confirm hypotheses found via data mining or to verify their data by independent means .
The result is bad science .
Olga Vitek , a statistical bioinformatician , replied that the key is developing skill in experimental design .
Some researchers in this new world are learning the hard way .
The last speaker was Peter Waddell , a comparative biologist who is working to reconstruct the tree of life based on genome sequences .
One example he offered was that the genome record shows primates ' closest relatives to be ... tree lemurs and shrews !
This process is going slowly but gaining speed .
He told a great story about shotgun sequencing , BLAST , and the challenges in aligning and matching sequences .
I could n't follow it , because I am a computer scientist who needs to learn more biology .
When Waddell began to talk about some of the computing challenges he and his colleagues face , I could follow the details much better .
They are working with a sparse matrix that will have between 102 and 103 rows and between 102 and 109 ( !!) columns .
The row and column sums will differ , but he needs to generate random matrices having the same row and column sums as the original matrix .
In his estimation , students almost need to have a triple major in CS , math , and stats , with lots of biology and maybe a little chemistry thrown in , in order to contribute to this kind of research .
The next best thing is cross-fertilization .
His favorite places to work have been where all of the faculty lunch together , where they are able to share ideas and learn to speak each other 's languages .
This remark led to another question , because it " raised the hobgoblin of multidisciplinary research " : an undergraduate needs seven years of study in order to prepare for a research career -- and that is only for the best students .
Average undergrads will need more , and even that might not be enough .
What can we do ?
One idea : redesign the whole curriculum to be interdisciplinary , with problems , mathematics , computational thinking , and research methods taught and reinforced everywhere .
Graduating students will not be as well - versed in any one area , but perhaps they will be better at solving problems across the boundaries of any single discipline .
This is n't just a problem for multidisciplinary science preparation .
We face the same problem in computer science itself , where the software development side of our discipline requires a variety of skills that are often best learned in context .
The integrated curriculum suggestion made here makes me think of the integrated apprenticeship - style curriculum that ChiliPLoP produced this year .
There ’s been quite the activity around this book lately .
Pat Eyler of On Ruby published an interview with the three of us RWH authors .
It apparently got some very positive comments on Reddit .
Over on Amazon , the book is continuing its streak of 5 - star reviews .
When I see a review there titled “ Finally a Haskell book that I could understand ” , I am very glad that we took the time to write Real World Haskell .
It is great to know that people find it useful .
Some of you may know that the book is licensed under a Creative Commons license .
This is most certainly not common in the publishing world these days , and O’Reilly took a risk by letting us do it .
We had tremendous community participation while we were writing it , and O’Reilly is quite pleased with the sales so far .
I hope that this bodes well for future books released under such a license .
It was one ecological disaster we thought we 'd largely licked .
But in an " insidious " echo of the 1980s acid rain crisis , lakes in parts of North America and Europe are now experiencing severe calcium depletions that scientists are terming an " osteoporosis " of the water , a new study in the journal Science suggests .
The paper 's Canadian - led research team says acid rain – a lake - killing cause célèbre largely tamed in the past two decades – expelled much of the calcium from giant tracts of soil during its toxic heyday .
And that calcium loss is now being felt in many of the lakes those soils feed – endangering entire aquatic food chains as well as the waterfowl that marine life supports .
If calcium levels continue to fall , the potential for many lakes to simply die is very real , says John Smol , a professor at Queen 's University and a key study author .
The cycle began when acid components were expelled into the atmosphere by massive industrial plumes late into the 20th century .
These emissions have been greatly reduced by government - mandated scrubber technology .
" We 've made very good progress on acid rain ... and we have been seeing acidity recovery in lakes , " says Smol .
" But we did n't quite realize at the time that acid rain had a whole bunch of other possible side effects . "
Abetted by logging operations , which also deplete calcium levels in soil , acid rain pushed much of the mineral out of the ground in many parts of this continent over many decades , Smol says .
This was especially true in areas of the Canadian Shield where the dirt is not deep .
And while the process initially caused calcium levels to soar in many lakes – as the displaced mineral was washed into the streams and rivers that feed them – those levels eventually dissipated .
And there was no more soil - based calcium to replace it .
" Since the Ice Age , for 12,000 years calcium has been slowly being released from the soils , going into lakes and being used by the lakes , " says Smol .
" With acid rain we speeded that up really fast and now there 's very little left .
...
It 's what we call aquatic osteoporosis . "
The main culprits in acid rain , sulphuric and nitric acids , are like calcium and carry a positive charge .
And as they fall into the ground , their positive charges repel the similarly charged calcium .
Calcium , which helps build bones in humans , is required by all species .
But in marine ecosystems , it 's especially required by some of the tiny " keystone " species at the bottom of a food chain .
And the study , which also included York University researchers , found a creature known as the Daphnia , or water flea , has been especially hard hit .
" It 's an integral part of most lake systems .
It feeds on the algae and any small fish feed on the Daphnia , " says Smol , Canada Research Chair in Environmental Change .
The calcium declines could also prove especially harmful to molluscs and crayfish , whose outer shells require high calcium intakes .
But using the invertebrate Daphnia as an indicator , Smol 's team sifted through sediments in three lakes : Plastic Lake near Dorset , Ont. in the Muskoka region , Little Wiles Lake in Nova Scotia , and Big Moose Lake in New York state .
And in all three they found both low calcium levels and a sharp decline in water flea populations , often dating back to the 1970s .

" A large number of lakes could be similarly effected , " says Smol .
" It 's also probably hitting lakes in Scandinavia , we know in Norway calcium levels are very low .
It 's probably much more widespread . "
University of Waterloo freshwater ecologist Roland Hall says the study introduces a major new environmental concern and should lead to intensive research into the full effects of calcium depletion .
" It 's a little ( like ) when we discovered the ozone hole .
Nobody was thinking about it , and then you find this hole and everybody is out there trying to figure out what ( it 's doing ) . "
WASHINGTON -- Spending is declining in the consumer and capital sectors , as demand for expensive goods took its biggest spill in two years in October and consumption dropped at the sharpest rate in seven years .
Meanwhile , jobless claims fell slightly but remain at elevated levels .
Orders for durable goods decreased by 6.2 % last month to a seasonally adjusted $ 193.02 billion , the third tumble in a row , the Commerce Department said Wednesday .
Durables , ...
Here 's something you do n't see every day : a town built in the middle of a lake .
Not on an island , but actually below water level .
It 's the ancient city of Seuthopolis , in Bulgaria , which was discovered in 1948 .
Six years later , a dam was destroyed and it was covered in water , ending up at the bottom of a huge lake .
Now , the city is being unearthed via the most insane architectural project ever .

This is going to be done via the construction of a huge circular dike that 'll be a whopping 1,377 feet in diameter and 65 feet high .
People will be able to access the recessed city by boat , heading down into it to see the city .
And the focus is n't on archeology here , but rather on tourism , with Bulgaria looking to create a striking image that draws people in .
And really , there are few things that make a town more striking than have it sit on the bottom of a lake .
Cool stuff .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Goldman
Sachs suffered its first loss as a publicly traded company Tuesday , serving as yet another reminder that no corner of Wall Street has escaped the ongoing financial crisis .
Still , the stock soared on the news as investors , fearing the worst , were soothed by the fact that the loss was n't even bigger .
The once - revered investment bank said it lost $ 2.1 billion , or $ 4.97 a share during the fourth quarter , representing the company 's first loss since it went public in 1999 .
A year ago , Goldman reported a profit of $ 3.2 billion , or $ 7.49 a share .
Few analysts were expecting the company to maintain its impressive run given the recent market turmoil in the credit and stock markets and the upheaval in the nation 's financial services sector .
The results were worse than expected .
Consensus estimates were for a loss of $ 1.63 billion , or $ 3.73 a share for the quarter , according to Thomson Reuters .
Lloyd Blankfein , Goldman Sachs ' chairman and CEO , blamed the company 's performance on tough market conditions .
" Our results for the fourth quarter reflect extraordinarily difficult operating conditions , including a sharp decline in values across virtually every asset class , " he said in a statement .
Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) shares , which have lost 69 % of their value so far this year , surged 10 % in Tuesday afternoon trading .
Investors had feared that the firm 's results would exceed even the worst expectations .
" [ The quarter ] was below public expectations , but it was n't as bad the most pessimistic views , " said Mark Lane , equity research analyst at Chicago - based investment firm William Blair & Co .
In fact , one analyst was projecting a loss of $ 6 per share , according to Thomson Reuters .
Also providing some comfort to investors was the bounty of capital the company had on hand at the end of the quarter .
The company 's Tier 1 capital ratio , a key measure of a bank 's ability to absorb losses was 15.6 % at the end of the quarter , up from 11.6 % in the previous quarter .
A capital ratio above 8 % is generally considered a good sign for financial institutions .
Goldman Sachs raised nearly $ 21 billion in capital during the fourth quarter , selling $ 5.75 billion in common stock and an additional $ 5 billion in preferred shares to Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA , Fortune 500 ) .
The Treasury Department also injected $ 10 billion into the firm in October as part of the government 's $ 700 billion bailout program .
The company , known for paying its employees handsomely , also revealed Tuesday that expenses related to compensation and benefits were nearly cut in half during the quarter from a year ago .
Blankfein and six other Goldman executives opted to forgo annual bonuses this year .
And in late October , the company moved to cut 10 % of its workforce , or about 3,260 jobs .
Trouble spots
Still , all this cost cutting was not enough to completely insulate Goldman from the tumult in the markets .
In addition , credit rating agency Moody 's downgraded the firm 's long - term debt ratings after Goldman reported its loss .
One of the areas hit hardest in the latest quarter was the company 's principal investment division business , which suffered a $ 3.6 billion loss during the quarter .
A significant part of that loss originated in the company 's special situations group , which is known for investing in everything from bankrupt nursing homes to golf courses in Japan .
During the quarter , the company was required to mark the value of those assets at currently distressed prices .
The company was also squeezed by its stake in Chinese banking giant Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , whose shares have lost a third of their value through November .
Goldman Sachs lost $ 631 million during the quarter as a result of that investment .
Even as the company slimmed down its balance sheet during the quarter , its exposure to real estate still weighed on results .
The company said it suffered a $ 700 million loss due to commercial real estate loans .
Its investment banking business did n't fare much better .
Revenues across that division fell nearly 50 % from a year ago due to a big drop in merger activity and stock and debt offerings .
Viniar issued a cautious near - term outlook for the firm to both investors and reporters during separate conference calls held Tuesday morning .
But he indicated it was unlikely the company would change its investment banking focus all that much .
" That is what our strategy is and we do n't see why it should change , " said Viniar .
In late September , Goldman Sachs , and rival Morgan Stanley ( MS ' ) converted into bank holding companies , a move that allows them to increase their sources of funding and more directly borrow from the Federal Reserve .
Morgan Stanley , which is expected to report a loss for the quarter on Wednesday , is said to be looking at potential regional bank acquisitions and has hired two retail banking veterans to help with those efforts .
Viniar said that the company is looking to increase its deposit base by $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion over the next year through a number of possible avenues , including its wealth management business and brokered certificates of deposit ( CDs ) .
He did n't rule out launching an Internet banking operation or acquiring deposits through an acquisition either .
Still , there has been a reluctance by the company to transform into a one - stop bank outfit such as Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) or JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , which offer both retail and investment banking services .

With all of the uproar after the US Supreme Court 's ruling on the death penalty for child rape , another important ruling was largely ignored .
The case is Giles v. California , where the defendant , Dwayne Giles , admitted shooting his ex-girlfriend , Brenda Avie , but claimed he shot her in self - defense .
She was shot 6 times and before the last shot was fired into her analysis of the crime scene indicated that she was on the ground .
Allegedly he had his eyes closed the whole time .
Three weeks before Avie was shot to death , she told a cop investigating a domestic violence report that after Giles choked her , he threatened to stab her .
These statements are what was at the center of the ruling .
They were admitted into the murder trial even though the defendant 's attorney was denied the right to cross -examine her .
Yes , you read that right .
The defendant was denied the right to cross -examine the women he himself killed .
Here 's more information on this case from the Washington Post :
The Supreme Court yesterday threw out the conviction of a man accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend because the defendant could not challenge an incriminating account she gave the police weeks before her death . [...]
The case revolved around the Sixth Amendment , which affords people the bedrock right to confront and cross-examine witnesses who give testimony against them .
At issue is whether defendants forfeit their confrontation rights by doing harm to people whose statements are introduced in judicial proceedings .
Typically , courts have carved out few Sixth Amendment exceptions , giving leeway only to deathbed statements and to accounts by witnesses who are kept away from the courthouse by defendants seeking to thwart the judicial process .
For me the question is who really denied him those rights .
His defense team admitted that it was him .
For that reason I absolutely disagree with this court ruling .
It was n't the court who denied him the right or the ability to cross -examine the victim in his murder trial .
Since Giles admitted to shooting the woman whose testimony was thrown out , he will most likely be retried .
Unfortunately , this Supreme Court ruling will inspire other criminals and put more lives in danger .

Today , ESPN launched a beta version of their redesigned website .
The New York Times wrote about the site and the main goals behind it .
The new site is aimed at simplifying a visitor 's experience by reducing the amount of clutter on the homepage .
The goal is to encourage visitors to delve deeper into the site and view more pages .
ESPN was concerned that the overflow of information on the old homepage led people to bounce off and not necessarily delve into the site .
The new beta site feels like a definite improvement over the previous version .
Here are the 5 best things that ESPN did differently .
Removed Automatic Playing Video -
On the old site , a video of highlights in the top right would start automatically playing upon your arrival to the site - this was counter - internet .
We use the internet to seek information , not have information pushed on us like television does .
The video that played was not one that a visitor was likely to be looking for .
Instead it stole attention from looking for the information actually desired .
Also , even though it was a minor graphical element of the design in the top right corner , by playing media , it stole attention from the most important news highlighted in the middle of the page .
Personalization of Information - Immediately available on the new site is an option for " My Headlines . "
This feature allows visitors to personalize the information they see , making it much easier to get the news they find important .
By making this a prominent feature of the homepage , it entices visitors to click through to more interior pages and spend more time on the site .
Simpler Navigation -
The new site has streamlined the main navigation by hiding the inactive sports .
The previous site had 36 links on the top block of the homepage ; that number has now been reduced to 19 , and the links have been cleaned up to better fit the design .
It makes it easier to find and click on the news that a visitor cares the most about .
Larger Feature Video -
The new video is 16x9 and displayed as a central part of the homepage ; this is key .
It allows ESPN to editorialize on what is important ( which is their purpose ) and takes advantage of their audience 's faster computers .
They have traditionally been a leader in web technology and also led the way in the migration to compliant browsers .
Cleaner Homepage Layout - Underneath the main video player and headlines , the new site has 3 more main columns and rows of information / ads .
The sections are all lined up nicely and each content area in a given row is the same size .
This makes it much easier to scan the homepage and find information than it was on the old site .
Previously , the homepage was full of content boxes that varied in size and did n't line up to adjacent boxes , making it very hard for the eye to read over the page .
Overall , ESPN did a really great job with the redesign .
Currently , the site is a traffic hub that captures nearly 50 percent of total minutes spent by Internet users watching sports video and the seventh most total video streams , according to Nielsen Video Census .
So , you can be sure that other media companies will be taking close notes of the design and eagerly awaiting ESPN to report the new traffic data from the redesign .
In addition to improving the user experience on the site , there is also a more corporate goal - the new design gives advertisers eight options to purchase ads on the most popular pages rather than the three that the old site had .
This increase in ads was one of the motivating factors for the redesign , as the NY Times points out that Disney , ESPN 's parent company , was disappointed in soft ad sales by the channel in the most recent quarter .
However , it seems that ESPN did not sacrifice tact for revenue , as the new ad placements are not distracting , and they even eliminated the distracting banner ad up top .
What are your thoughts on the design ?
Where does this design put the ESPN site relative to other media company sites such as the NYT or WSJ ?

Australian police have charged at least 19 men with being part of a global child pornography network involving people in 70 countries .
The investigation was prompted by a tip - off from Brazilian police .
The men who have been charged include a police officer , a senior lawyer and a childcare worker .
Some 500,000 images of child abuse and 15,000 videos were seized , and the Australian Federal Police said more arrests were expected later this week .
Some of the seized videos showed victims as young as 12 months old , while others showed children being abused for more than two hours .
" These are some of the worst images , I must say , that the Federal Police have ever seen , " Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Andrew Colvin told reporters .
Children saved
The Australians said that information supplied by Brazil to the international policing network , Interpol , had helped identify more than 200 suspects in 70 countries .
At least two children had been removed from harm as a result of the investigation , police said .
Although it is difficult to identify the victims of abuse , they appear to be based primarily in Eastern Europe , and North and South America , according to the BBC correspondent in Sydney , Nick Bryant .
All the charges relate to accessing the images over the internet , using what is called a peer - to - peer network .
The method allows members to share files without going through a central network server , avoiding filters operated by internet service providers , making the crime harder to detect .
But Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said law enforcement officers did have ways " we can get in and infiltrate these type of applications " .
The charged men each face a 10 - year sentence for possessing child abuse material .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Merrill Lynch 's chief executive John
Thain has reportedly dropped his request for a $ 10 million annual bonus after being blasted by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo .
Thain requested at a board meeting on Monday that Merrill 's compensation committee not award him a bonus for 2008 , and the board of directors accepted that request , Merrill Lynch said .
Thain had reportedly previously asked for a bonus of up to $ 10 million , which prompted Cuomo to send a strongly worded letter to Merrill 's board of directors in which he called Thain 's request for a bonus " nothing less than shocking . "
Cuomo pointed out that the brokerage reported losses for every quarter this year , and has lost more than $ 11 billion in 2008 .
He added that Bank of America 's ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) takeover of Merrill , which was formally approved by shareholders Friday , " seems to have been the only thing that saved Merrill from collapse . "
" Clearly , the performance of Merrill 's top executives throughout Merrill 's abysmal year in no way justifies significant bonuses for its top executives , including the CEO , " Cuomo said in the letter .
Cuomo has been a vocal critic of the " outsized " bonuses Wall Street 's top executives have received , which he says are even more unjustified in light of the current economic crisis and the billions of taxpayer dollars that have been injected into the banking system .
" It is imperative that Merrill 's Board prevent wasteful expenditures of corporate funds on outsized executive bonuses and other unjustified compensation , " Cuomo said .
Merrill 's board of directors stood by Thain 's leadership .
" The Board accepted Mr. Thain and his management team 's request and applauded the Thain - led management team 's superb performance in an exceptionally challenging environment , " said John Finnegan , chairman of Merrill Lynch 's compensation committee , in a prepared statement .
Meanwhile , John Mack , the chief executive of recently minted commercial bank Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) , will forgo his bonus this year , according to a company spokeswoman .
Going forward , Morgan also plans to tie executive compensation more closely to the firm 's performance .
" This gesture by Morgan Stanley is appropriate , and I hope other firms like Merrill Lynch will take it to heart , " Cuomo said in a separate statement .
Additionally , the top seven executives at Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) decided to forgo annual bonuses last month .
" Goldman Sachs laid down the gauntlet , " said Paul Hodgson , senior research associate at the Corporate Library , an independent corporate governance research firm .
" For anybody to diverge from that path is inappropriate . "
Thain , 53 , replaced Stanley O'Neal as chief executive of Merrill Lynch after the firm reported its first multi-billion dollar loss on bad mortgage - backed assets late last year .
As losses accelerated , Thain orchestrated the deal with Bank of America in September to save 94 - year - old brokerage .
" Thain was brought in after much of the damage was already done .
But it 's not as if he has n't received adequate compensation , " Hodgson said .
Indeed ,
Thain received a $ 15 million sign - on bonus when he took over the firm .
" While American families struggle to keep their jobs and their homes , I question the chutzpah of asking for a $ 10 million taxpayer - subsidized bonus , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , in a statement .
In October , Merrill Lynch received a $ 10 billion capital investment from the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Fund .
Bank of America got $ 15 billion from TARP .
To date , the government has given a total of $ 161 billion to more than 50 banks .
RIGA , Latvia --
Hammered by economic woe , this former Soviet republic recently took a novel step to contain the crisis .
Its counterespionage agency busted an economist for being too downbeat .
" All I did was say what everyone knows , " says Dmitrijs Smirnovs , a 32 - year - old university lecturer detained by Latvia 's Security Police .
The force is responsible for hunting down spies , terrorists and other threats to this Baltic nation of 2.3 million people and 26 banks .
Now ...
Robert Mugabe , Zimbabwe 's President , is trying to hide the real extent of the cholera epidemic sweeping across his nation by silencing health workers and restricting access to the huge number of death certificates that give the same cause of death .
A senior official in the health ministry told The Independent yesterday that more than 3,000 people have died from the water - borne disease in the past two weeks , 10 times the widely - reported death toll of just over 300 .
" But even this higher figure is still an understatement because very few bother to register the deaths of their relatives these days , " said the official , who requested anonymity .
He said the health ministry , which once presided over a medical system that was the envy of Africa , had been banned from issuing accurate statistics about the deaths , and that certificates for the fraction of deaths that had been registered were being closely guarded by the home affairs ministry .

Yet the evidence of how this plague is hurting the people of Zimbabwe is there for all to see at the burial grounds in this collapsing country .
" When you encounter such long queues in other countries , they are of people going to the cinema or a football match ; certainly not into cemeteries to bury loved ones as we have here , " said Munyaradzi Mudzingwa , who lives in Chitungwiza , a town just outside Harare , where the epidemic is believed to have started .
When Mr Mudzingwa buried his 27 - year - old brother , who succumbed to cholera last week , he said he had counted at least 40 other families lining up to bury loved ones .
He said : " That 's sadly the depth of the misery into which Mugabe has sunk us . "
Unit O , his suburb , has been without running water for 13 months .
The only borehole in the area , built with the help of aid agencies , attracted so many people day and night that it was rarely possible to access its water .
Residents were forced to dig their own wells , which became contaminated with sewage .
The water residents haul up is a breeding ground for all sorts of bacteria , including Vibrio cholerae , which causes severe vomiting and diarrohea and can kill within hours if not treated .
The way to prevent death is , for the Zimbabwean people , agonisingly simple : antibiotics and rehydration .
But this is a country with a broken sewerage system and soap is hard to come by .
Harare 's Central Hospital officially closed last week , doctors and nurses are scarce and even those clinics offering a semblance of service do not have access to safe , clean drinking water and ask patients to bring their own .
As the ordinary people suffer Mr Mugabe is locked in a bitter power struggle with the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai over who should control which ministries in a unity government .
The President has threatened to name a cabinet without the approval of the Movement for Democratic Change , which could see the whole peace deal unravel .
Talks were continuing between the two parties in Johannesburg yesterday with little sign of a breakthrough , but pressure is growing from around the region and beyond to strike a deal as the humanitarian crisis deepens .
Hundreds of Zimbabweans have streamed into South Africa , desperate for medical care .
Officials in the South African border town of Musina say their local hospital has treated more than 150 cholera patients so far .
" [ The outbreak ] is a clear indication that ordinary Zimbabweans are the true victims of their leaders ' lack of political will , " the South African government 's chief spokesman Themba Maseko said .
Yesterday Oxfam warned that a million of Zimbabwe 's 13 million population were at risk from the cholera epidemic , and predicted that the crisis would worsen significantly in December , when heavy rains start .
" The government of Zimbabwe must acknowledge the extent of the crisis and take immediate steps to mobilise all available resources , " said Charles Abani , the head of the agency 's southern Africa team .
" Delay is not an option . "

The Zimbabwean Association of Doctors for Human Rights has accused the government of dramatically under - reporting the spread of the disease .
Doctors and nurses – whose salaries can just buy a loaf of bread thanks to hyperinflation – tried to protest last week against the health crisis , but riot police moved in swiftly .
It is not just cholera victims who are suffering .
Willard Mangaira , also from Chitungwiza , described how his 18 - year - old pregnant sister died at home after being turned away at the main hospital because there were no staff and no equipment to perform the emergency Caesarean operation she needed .
Yet he added that if the situation in Chitungwiza was deplorable , what he had left behind in his village of Chivhu , 100 miles away , was beyond description .
Adults and children alike were now living off a wild fruit , hacha , and livestock owners are barred from letting their animals into the bush to graze until the people have fed first .
Bought foodstuffs are beyond reach .
The official inflation figure is 231 million per cent and the real level is higher : some estimates say basic goods double in price every day .
Few can afford to give their deceased relatives a proper funeral .
Death used to be a sacred time , with families taking a week to celebrate the life of the deceased before burial .
Now the dead are buried instantly .
Lovemore Churi buried his father within an hour of his being confirmed dead .
" I did not have the money to let mourners assemble and then start to feed them , " he said .
" If mourners hear that someone is already buried , they do n't bother coming and one does not have to worry about how to feed them .
That is the way we now live . "
The disease : Deadly , but preventable
* Cholera is caused when a toxin - producing bacterium , Vibrio Cholerae , infects the gut .
It is carried in water containing human faeces .
* In its most severe form , and without treatment of antibiotics and rehydration , it causes acute diarrhoea and dehydration , and can kill within hours of symptoms showing .
* John Snow , a doctor in 19th - century London , was the first to link it with contaminated water when he studied an outbreak in Soho in 1854 , which had killed more than 600 in a few weeks .
* Until then , it was thought to be spread by a mysterious " miasma " in the atmosphere .
Snow showed the outbreak came from a single contaminated well in Broad Street .
He had the handle of the well removed , and the epidemic stopped almost overnight .
* Preventing cholera relies on proper sewage treatment , sanitation and water purification .
The potential for electric vehicles has been talked about for decades .
But a former Israeli software entrepreneur is developing a game - changing infrastructure that could finally make them feasible - a standardised network of charging stations where drivers can plug right in .
Futurists have been talking about battery - powered electric cars for as long as there have been futurists .
We ’ve had viable electric vehicles since before the turn of the last century - New York City was plugging in taxis as early as 1897 .
Electric vehicles ( EVs ) offered serious competition to gasoline cars and trucks at least until the 1920s .
Henry Ford was fascinated with them , and collaborated with his close friend Thomas Edison on an ultimately unsuccessful plan to bring one to market .
Groundswells of interest in EVs arose in the late 1960s , in the early 1970s following the Arab oil embargo , and again when the Iranian oil spigot went dry after the 1979 revolution .
Now we ’re all excited about EVs again .
Nissan and Renault are gearing up to produce an electric sedan for the mass market by 2012 .
California - based Tesla Motors , though it has deep financial problems , is starting to roll $ 100,000 EVs down a production line .
Electric versions of the BMW Mini and the Smart car are being tested .
Start - ups Aptera and Fisker Automotive are exploring different corners of the market .

Despite all this activity , battery EVs wo n’t become a mass - market phenomenon until and unless there ’s a standardised network of charging stations to plug them in .
People will need to charge their EVs ( which often have a range of 100 miles or less ) at home , at work , and while out shopping , too .
Carmakers have been wary of anything but small demonstration projects because that network did n’t exist , and cities , states and countries are unlikely to commit millions to build such an infrastructure without readily available cars .
And that ’s where Israeli - born Shai Agassi and his company , Better Place , come in .
They are promoting a vision of an electric transportation future that includes a widespread charging network , with battery exchange stations ( where , for longer trips , depleted packs are exchanged for new ones in just a few minutes ) , and their auto - company partners are planning to produce the electric cars and trucks that will be plugged into those stations .
Agassi , a former software entrepreneur , has been travelling throughout the world , targeting what he calls “ transportation islands ” , either actual islands or densely packed urban areas with plentiful commuters in a small area .
He ’s signed up nations ( Israel , Denmark , Japan , Australia ) , states ( Hawaii ) and even cities ( San Francisco ) as partners .
In some , but not all of those locations , Better Place is co-operating with the Renault - Nissan Alliance .
Nathan Ballard , a spokesman for San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom Better Place , says that the Better Place initiative in the Bay Area is a three - city coalition including San Jose and Oakland , with all three municipalities agreeing to work together on a nine - point plan to offer tax credits , speed up permitting and offer other administrative support for electric vehicle infrastructure .
“ What we ’re doing , ” says Ballard , “ is taking a bet on the future , the idea that electric vehicles will replace fossil - fuel cars and trucks on the road ” .
Agassi ’s model is not based on traditional car dealerships and repair stations .
Instead , he ’s thinking about the cell - phone model , where the hand - held device is incidental to the deal customers make buying air time from a provider .
“ We bring in three concepts , ” Agassi told me .
“ The first is that we build the network ahead of the cars .
The second is that the battery is part of the infrastructure - you own the car , but we own the batteries .
Down the road , when there ’s a magic battery with twice the capacity of the one in your car , we can swap it at no cost to you .
And the third idea is that drivers will buy miles and pay as they consume them . ”

Better Place has n’t yet finalised its pricing structure .
But Deutsche Bank analysts arrived at a hypothetical model in which customers would sign a contract agreeing to pay $ 550 a month for a year to buy enough electricity for 18,000 miles of travel .
The payment includes not only use of the battery pack , but also recharging and unlimited use of the fully automated swapping stations .
So there are some similarities to leasing , but the customer gets the fuel thrown in as part of the deal .
The perhaps unlikely catalyst for Better Place was Israeli President Shimon Peres .
In 2005 , Agassi became a member of the under - 40 Young Global Leaders forum , which challenged its members to make the world “ a better place ” by 2020 .
Agassi ’s answer to that challenge was to come up with the idea of a new infrastructure for EVs , and he unveiled it in 2006 at a meeting attended by Peres and Bill Clinton , among others , at the Brookings Institute ’s Saban Center for Middle East Policy in Washington .
Israel would be a good place to test his electric future , Agassi said .
Soon after that , Peres called Agassi and urged him to make his lofty vision a reality .
Spurred by Peres ’ encouragement , Agassi got to work .
He quit his day job at software giant SAP and , in 2007 , founded Better Place , which is based in Palo Alto , California .
He raised $ 200 million , most of it from Idan Ofer , chairman of Israel ’s largest holding company , Israel Corp .
And Israel became its first customer .
“ We will have limited testing in Israel in 2009 , ” Agassi said .
“ By 2010 we will have 100,000 charge spots and be in full testing mode .
We will be ready for the mass market by 2011 . ”
Retired Minnesota Congressman Jim Ramstad is rumored to be Barack Obama 's new " Drug Czar . "
The " Drug Czar " is the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy ( the term " Drug Czar " was invented by Joe Biden ! ) , and his or her job is to release crappy PSAs about marijuana .
Here is the problem : Ramstad , a recovering alcoholic , not only opposed medical marijuana and supported prosecution of people who use medical marijuana , but he also consistently opposed funding life - saving needle exchange programs throughout his entire congressional tenure .
All these policies are in opposition to crazy liberal things Barack Obama said , during the campaign , about how he'd be less terrible re.
drug policy .
Here is a fun fact :
The Drug Czar is forbidden , by law , from supporting legalization of any drugs , including for medicinal purposes .
This is per the office 's congressional mandate , so barring a rather unlikely withdrawal of congressional authorization from the office , any Drug Czar appointed by any president will be required by law to state that medicinal marijuana will make you put your baby in the microwave and decriminalization will lead to your child becoming William S. Burroughs .
So hooray for Jim Ramstad , who will hopefully have not very much to do at all in the Obama administration , especially with most of the " crime - fighting " bits of the Drug Czar 's portfolio being the Justice Department 's turf , not that Eric Holder is that much better .
( Full disclosure : my stepmother ran for congress against Jim Ramstad a couple years ago !
She lost . )
The Margay is a solitary wildcat with some very unique characteristics .
Its look alone make it stand - out although it is very solitary people rarely have the chance to see it .
The Margay is one of the few animals in the world that can climb trees with their heads facing down , thanks to their very special joints , able to turn up to 180 degrees .
The Margay is on the endangered animals list , but no one really knows how large their population really is between Mexico and Argentina .
Margays do n’t take well to humans invading their habitats and sacientists say they are so well adapted to life in trees that they can go their entire lives without touching the ground .
Like all cats , Margay see very well at night and have no problem feeding of birds , reptiles and squirrels , if they can catch them .

Two weeks to go and the machine is starting to prepare the narrative for how it is possible that John McCain won the 2008 Presidential election .
With every poll showing an Obama lead of anywhere from 10 - 14 points for the past few weeks , suddenly today the Associated Press announced a new poll that shows the race in a dead heat .
Nonsense .
With the backdrop of the Kennedy - Palast reporting on how the GOP has already started the systematic theft of the election this poll today is just the coverage they need to pretend that the results of a McCain victory will be legitimate .
If McCain does indeed go on to steal the election , no doubt his supporters will point to this bogus poll to refute the other polls .
The talking points have been as inane as the alleged poll results .
Primarily , the talking points are that the bump is due to the “ strong ” showing of McCain in the last debate and the “ Joe the Plumber ” nonsense has “ struck a chord . ”
You have got to be kidding me .
Every post debate poll clearly showed that Barack Obama once again dominated John McCain in the last debate .
This was even stronger among undecided voters and independents .
There was no strong showing by McCain ; he lost and everyone saw him lose .
By every count , including Fox News , he lost .
Not only that , but he lost all three debates as well as the Vice Presidential debate .
Throw in the fact that his recent Ayers attack line and socialist charges were also polled to be losers , the new AP poll simply defies logic .
And Joe the Plumber ?
C’mon guys ; you have to do better than this .
It has now been revealed that Joe was probably a plant by the McCain camp , which seemed obvious when he approached Obama with stock GOP talking points and has now been exposed as a McCain campaign donor .
Even the argument fell apart – that an average American making over $ 250,000 per year is somehow being cast as being poor or a victim of Obama policy .
The realities are that Joe could possibly even do better under Obama than McCain .
But moving past the failed realities of Joe the Plumber , the notion that this ridiculous ploy somehow moved a national poll 10 - 14 points in one day , or one week is patently absurd .
A key “ finding ” is that the lead Obama had with voters making under $ 50,000 has shrunk from 24 % to just 4 % .
Really ?
How in the world is that explained ?
People making under 50 K now like the idea of not getting a targeted tax cut and feel bad for millionaires ?
Once again , absurd .
Not to mention that this week saw the incredibly strong endorsement for Obama by Colin Powell on national television on Sunday .
We are supposed to believe that this had a negative effect ?
Let ’s look at this against the backdrop of every other poll out today .
The Washington Post - ABC News poll showed Obama up by 9 percentage points , while a poll by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center had Obama leading by 14 .
A Wall Street Journal / NBC
News poll , among the broader category of people registered to vote , found Obama ahead by 10 points .
So we have 9 , 10 , and 14 ; numbers consistent with what has been the norm for a few weeks now and this one rogue poll which says “ no no , it is a statistical dead heat . ”
Please , let ’s be real .
This is all about the backdrop for the theft of the election .
Already states such as New Jersey are refusing to allow election experts to monitor voting because they claim it is “ too important ” and election .
The crafted talking points on exit polling is that people will be “ too embarrassed ” to admit they did not vote for Obama .
Exit polling is not some haphazard venture .
We use it to challenge the elections in other countries as proof when election results have been tampered with .
We only had problems with exit polling when the Bush Administration came into power .
Suddenly the data collected is not reliable and silly rationales are generated to explain away how someone like John Kerry can win amongst men and women in Ohio , yet still lose the overall count .
Is there a third unknown gender demographic ?
Instead of properly questioning why the vote totals do not match the exit polling and we are talking by wide margins , the exit polling is “ adjusted ” to reflect the vote tallies .
Then with the exit polling dismissed , election experts banned from observing , shenanigans like in Colorado where minority ballots are targeted for removal at a rate of at least 1 in every 6 , and the bogus “ dead heat ” poll in hand , the backdrop is set .
The machine ’s media minions rush out to comment on how legitimate everything was and next thing you know we are in a McCain Administration with Obama and the democrats again wondering what happened ?
What happened is the lazy democratic congress did nothing about HAVA for the past two years and are doing even less about the daily reporting of voter fraud .
I mean real voter fraud , not the silly ACORN nonsense that is being thrown around .
Now we see the bending of reality to absurd levels .
John McCain ’s campaign has been nothing short of an implosion every day .
His Vice Presidential pick has been an unmitigated disaster as brilliantly pointed out by Colin Powel this past Sunday .
His presentation on the economy has been soundly rejected by the electorate .
His dirty politicking has been soundly rejected by the electorate .
He is up to double digits in verbal gaffes and bizarre comments .
There are reasons why Obama has had a consistent double digit leads .
Yet amidst all of this obviousness , the Associated Press wants us to believe that up is down and the election is tied .
Brad Pitt and his mustache ( it 's for that Tarantino flick he 's filming , Inglourious Basterds ) are on the cover of the new Rolling Stone .
To conduct the interview , writer Mark Binelli visited the Jolie - Pitt compound in Germany ( he writes that it " is surrounded by a wall and has three large houses , its own helicopter - landing pad and , when I visit , at least six guards " ) .
One thing Binelli mentions about Pitt is something you may have noticed in televised interviews : Brad Pitt is restless .

Writes Binelli :
In person , Pitt is warm and funny , but is also , at least while he 's being interviewed , an extremely fidgety guy .
He paces .
He musses his hair .
He tears little pieces of dried apricot into smaller pieces before popping them into his mouth .
He rubs his knee so intensely it brings to mind Lennie from Of Mice and Men petting a rabbit .
All of this might have to do with the fact that , despite his repeatedly proven talents as an actor , Pitt remains , for a large number of people , a creature primarily of tabloid fascination .
Did he cheat on his ex-wife with his current partner ?
Will they have another biological child ?
What war - ravaged destination might they visit next ?
Does the mustache make him look hot or porn-y ?

As for the interview , Binelli gets
Pitt to spill about his work , his life , and his thoughts — and there are some revelations .
On Pitt 's crappy movies , like The Devil 's Own and Meet Joe Black :
" I got lost in the wilderness of fame a bit .
There are all of these opportunities you 're supposed to be taking .
And I got really discombobulated . "

On growing up in a religious community :

I get enraged when people start telling other people how to live their lives .
It drives me mental .
This Prop. 8 thing just drives me mental . "

On his new film , The Curious Case of Benjamin Button :
" I find Benjamin is about those universal things we all share — that 95 percent that makes us all the same , wherever we are in the world .
Our loves , our hopes , but also the loss that we all walk around with and hide very well , and the ultimate notion that we 're all expendable .
To me , it 's a counterstatement to this divisive period we 've been in , where we focused on the two , three , four , five percent of ways in which we 're different . "

On the future :
" I have this fantasy of my older days , painting or sculpting or making things .
I have this fantasy of a bike trip to Chile .
I have this fantasy of flying into Morocco .
But right now , more and more , it 's about getting the work done and getting home to family .
I have an adventure every morning , getting up . "

One has to wonder , is this a man who gets bored easily ?
Who loves being on the go ?
Who dreams of never slowing down ?
Who dreams of never settling down ?
And with six kids — and possibly two more on the way — is his family " adventure " enough ?
Brad Pitt : The Rolling Stone Interview [ Rolling Stone ]
McDonalds Japan is testing the waters of no -brand marketing with newly openedstores in Tokyo .
Generic packaging , minimalist decor , a two - item menu - and not a clown in sight !
That goes for the website as well .
McDonalds Japan 's dip into no -brand marketing comes as quite a shock to those who see the global burger master as the poster child for brand name advertising .
Word is , curious customers are lining up to get into Quarter Pounder 's stark black & red shops .
When they finally squeeze through the door , menu choices can be arrived at by a coin flip : a Quarter Pounder with Cheese Set for 500 yen ( about $ 5.15 ) or a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese Set that goes for 600 yen ( about $ 6.20 ) .
It 's been noted by some that McDonalds burgers are smaller in Japan , so take that into account before judging whether either set is a good deal .
No shakes , no pies , no super - sizing , no Happy Meals .
Not even a cheerysince they come included with each set .
Quarter Pounder may look low key , but make no mistake - the might of McDonalds ' marketing has been put to good use promoting the concept .
Thecampaign utilizes ad venues from viral online marketing to hired hands handing out flyers to passersby .
Will McDonald ' sconcept work ?
And , how long before trend - savvy Tokyoites realize that beneath the shiny new wrapper is the same old burger ?
Imagine for a moment the handbag industry adopting the same business model as Hollywood and the record labels .
The Handbag Industry Association of America would launch an aggressive litigation campaign , suing thousands of women for sharing their handbags .
That policy would mirror the campaigns of the Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association of America .
Often , handbags would frustrate owners under the HIAA 's Handbags Rights Management scheme .
For starters , handbags would only work in one country .
All of a handbag 's contents would fall from the bottom at a border crossing , or while on an international flight , under the industry 's HRM standards .
This HRM tool , like DRM on digital music files and DVDs , would only allow the purse to be worn with a single outfit .
The handbag would not function with a different outfit , thus requiring another purchase of the same handbag if a change of clothes was in order .
" Own only one handbag , then be prepared to wear the same outfit day in and day out , " according to a parody at bagbunch.com , an internet handbag store .
The Handbag Industry Association of America 's website would be filled with misleading facts and figures about piracy .
The site would also encourage its customers not to purchase knockoffs , because that finances terrorism and the drug trade .
The website would also warn its customers that it was illegal to throw away handbags .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. President - elect Barack Obama on Wednesday named former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack to head the Agriculture Department and Colorado Sen .
Ken Salazar to become interior secretary , saying they would help further his goal of energy independence for the country .
Colorado Senator Ken Salazar ( D - CO ) speaks after U.S. President - elect Obama ( R ) introduced him as his nominee for secretary of the interior during a news conference in Chicago December 17 , 2008 .

Calling the two “ guardians of the American landscape . ”
Obama told a news conference they would help to spearhead efforts to use less imported oil while expanding use of renewable energy such as biofuels .
The selections moved Obama closer to his goal of completing most of his Cabinet selections before he leaves on Saturday for a vacation in Hawaii , where he grew up .
A few hours after the announcements on Vilsack and Salazar , a senior Democrat told Reuters that Rep. Ray LaHood , a Republican , had been offered the job of transportation secretary .
The pick would help Obama , a Democrat , fulfill a pledge to include members of the opposing party in the top tier of his incoming administration .
Obama has already announced that he plans to keep Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who has served under several Republican presidents , in his current job .
LaHood , who hails from Obama ’s home state of Illinois and is said to have a rapport with the president - elect , is expected to accept the Cabinet position , the Democratic official said .
Salazar is a first - term senator from Colorado and Vilsack was a popular two - term governor of Iowa , a leading farm and ethanol - producing state .
“ I will do all I can to reduce America ’s reliance on foreign oil , ” said Salazar , who will take over an agency that handles leases of federal land for oil drilling along with other issues including national parks .
Vilsack said he would try to improve farm income in the face of the U.S. recession and to put healthier food into public nutrition programs .
Obama supports a $ 250,000 a year “ hard cap ” on farm subsidies with no exemption , a tightening of rules that could save $ 100 million to $ 200 million a year .
He says he would encourage continued rural leadership in renewable energy .
A backer of renewable fuels , Vilsack ran for the Democratic presidential nomination for three months before withdrawing in February 2007 and supporting Hillary Clinton .
DRILLING DECISIONS
Salazar , who once practiced as an environmental lawyer , would make decisions on offshore oil and gas drilling as head of the Interior Department , which handles energy leases for federal land as well as national parks and other issues .
Both appointments require confirmation by the Senate , where Democrats have a majority .
As senator , Salazar criticized the Interior Department ’s proposal under President George W. Bush to rush the sale of commercial oil shale leases .
Oil shale is a fine - grained sedimentary rock containing organic matter from which oil may be produced .
Though oil shale production is not yet commercially viable , companies are interested in tapping it because the United States has an abundance of it .
Salazar supported a one year moratorium on oil shale production and said that the government must answer questions about how oil shale production will impact western states and proceed carefully toward commercial development .
He also attempted to block the sale of oil and gas leases on Roan Plateau in Colorado , instead pushing to gradually phase in lease sales in the environmentally sensitive area .
Immediately after introducing his choices and opening the news conference to questions , Obama was asked about his aides contacts with disgraced Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich .
Obama ’s team has sought to distance him from a developing scandal in which Blagojevich has been accused of trying to sell off Obama ’s vacant Senate seat .
Aides have said a review of contacts between Obama ’s team and Blagojevich ’s office would be released during the Christmas week .
Obama said on Wednesday it was a “ little bit frustrating ” that he was unable to release the information now but that he was abiding by the request of the U.S. attorney ’s office .
“ There has been a lot of speculation in the press that I would love to correct immediately , ” Obama said .
The move was a sharp reversal for Deutsche Post , the German company that owns DHL , which had said that it was planning to maintain its American operations by turning over its domestic air - cargo service to its rival United Parcel Service .

The express package business has been suffering under the sharp economic downturn : express shipments in the United States carried by the top three companies fell in the third quarter for the first time since the 2001 recession .
The company , which cut 5,400 jobs this year at DHL , will discontinue its domestic - only air and ground services in January to focus entirely on its more lucrative international offerings .
DHL said it would close its U.S. Express ground hubs and reduce the number of stations to 103 , from 412 .
It said it would retain 3,000 to 4,000 employees to serve its international express customers .
The deepest cuts will be at the Wilmington hub , which DHL acquired in 2003 and expanded with the help of local and state incentives .
DHL operates the hub in conjunction with Astar Air Cargo and ABX Air , both of which will most likely cease operations there when DHL leaves .
Clinton County , where Wilmington is the county seat , is facing a $ 2 million gap in a $ 14.5 million budget because of the loss of tax revenue .
“ We ’re going to be taking 2009 needs and trying to fund them with 2005 - level revenues , ” said Randy Riley , the county commission president .
Texans got a bit of a surprise Saturday night when the folks at SpaceX did a major test of their 9 - engine cluster At 10:30 p.m. local time , the nine Merlin engines roared into life for a full - up test lasting 178 seconds -- nearly three minutes .
The test shook houses and rattled windows for miles , burned up a half million pounds of propellant , and generated 855,000 pounds of thrust : enough to launch a pretty big rocket into orbit .
SpaceX has an awesome video of the test .
Also , the The Waco Trib has a great article on it , too .
Well , it 's not the article so much as the comments which you simply have to read : they 're from locals who hung on for dear life while it happened .
My favorite :
I live in Valley Mills , just taking the last steak off the grill .
Space - X shook the T - Bone off the grill hit my dog on the head , he thought I smacked him , he bit my ankle .
My wife just getting into our water bed shook up a huge wave , threw her out of bed .
She blamed it all on me .
Milk in frig .is now butter - milk , the cats , will not leave the kitchen .
My son could n’t hear his stereo , cranked it up , blew the windows out of the neighbors house .
Guess I ’ll be replacing them on Sunday .
It was a great light show !
Evidently SpaceX notified some officials , but not everybody got the news .
I can imagine being terrified of something like this happening even 25 miles away -- it must have looked like Armageddon .
I feel kinda bad for the local folks , but on the other hand SpaceX is pumping quite a bit of money into the area , so I hope they can forgive .
But I bet they wo n't forget .

His home was raided on Sunday , November 30 , by Queensland Police from Task Force Argos , which specialises in combating child pornography and child groomers .
He was charged with using the internet to access and publish child - abuse material and is scheduled to appear in court in Maroochydore on December 18 .
It is understood that he had no involvement in the creation of the video , which cannot be published on this website for legal reasons .
The baby is laughing and smiling at the end of the clip , but the video has attracted criticism from child - welfare advocates because of how vigorously the man swings the baby by its arms .
In a phone interview , Illingworth described the clip as a " common interest story " and rejected any suggestions he was a child abuser or interested in such material .
He said that since being charged he could not eat , sleep or work and was worried his children and people in the local community would think he was a pedophile .
" I 've had to go down to the hospital , my blood pressure is 160/108 and I 'm on blood pressure pills and valium - all because of this , " he said .
" Do they realise what pain they put someone through ?
I could fall over dead over this .
I can't even get the office work done .
I 'm just a zombie . "
Queensland Police confirmed the charges but refused to comment , saying it would be inappropriate as the matter was before the courts .
Illingworth said his life changed the moment two officers - a detective chief inspector and a detective chief constable - banged on his door and demanded they search his house .
" I went to turn on the laptop and they got stinking mad , as if I was trying to delete something I guess , and I was just trying to be helpful , " he said .
The officers plugged a small black box into his computer and proceeded for an hour and a half to analyse the contents of his hard drive in a search for child pornography .
Illingworth said the officers insisted on visiting his office at a mechanic workshop to examine his computer there .
They found nothing , Illingworth said .
Before being taken to the police station , Illingworth was allowed to make one call , which he used to phone the owner of Liveleak in Britain to ask that the video be removed .
He was advised to get a lawyer but declined as he was unable to find one on a Sunday afternoon , he said .
At Maroochydore police station , Illingworth was interviewed without a lawyer .
He was forced to provide fingerprints , a DNA sample and a mug - shot photograph .
" They would n't let me go to the toilet without them coming with me - I could n't go anywhere without someone following me , " he said .
The officers explained to Illingworth that they traced him using his IP address after someone in Britain reported the video clip to police .
Interpol had found the clip was originally uploaded to a Russian website .
" It 's going to ruin my f--- ing life and everything .
I 'm 60 years old and what did I do wrong ? "
Illingworth said .
" I did n't make it , I did n't play with a baby , I just uploaded it [ the video clip ] .
It 's nothing sexual or anything else - just a smiling baby . "
Liveleak owner Hayden Hewitt has published a video on the site defending Illingworth and calling on members to help publicise the incident and " fight injustice " .
" Clearly the behaviour in the video is reckless , but I could n't say it 's abuse , " he said .
Colin Jacobs , vice - chairman of the online users ' rights lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia , said public anxiety around the depiction of children seemed to have spiked in recent times , fuelled by politicians and anti-child - abuse campaigners .
" It 's now reached the point where any parent would have to think twice about posting a photo of their children to a photo - sharing website , " he said .
" Cases like this seem to indicate that we 've gone beyond the point of the sensible and entered into hysteria territory . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President - elect Barack Obama failed to give a straight answer when asked on a U.S. talkshow on Sunday whether he had managed to quit smoking .

In a country where cigarettes are responsible for one in five deaths and smoking costs tens of billions of dollars in health care , Obama has been under pressure to set an example by giving up his reported two - decade - old habit .
Appearing on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” program , interviewer Tom Brokaw told Obama he had ducked answering the question during an interview last month with ABC ’s Barbara Walters .
Noting that the White House was a no-smoking zone , Brokaw asked Obama , “ Have you stopped smoking ? ”
“ I have , ” Obama replied , smiling broadly .
“ What I said was that there are times where I have fallen off the wagon . ”
“ Wait a minute , ” Brokaw interjected , “ that means you have n’t stopped . ”
“ Fair enough , ” Obama said .
“ What I would say is that I have done a terrific job under the circumstances of making myself much healthier .
You will not see any violations of these rules in the White House . ”
Obama was often observed on the presidential campaign trail chewing Nicorette gum , which helps ease the craving for nicotine .
He has tried several times to quit .
The 47 - year - old president - elect , who takes office on January 20 , works out daily at the gym and sometimes plays basketball .
His doctor said in May he was in excellent health , often jogged 3 miles a day and was fit to serve as U.S. president .
Website www.cigaraficionado.com says Gerald Ford , who served from 1974 - 77 , was the last U.S. president to use tobacco on a regular basis .
The White House no-smoking rule was imposed by former First Lady Hillary Clinton , now Obama ’s nominee for secretary of state .
From the LA Times : Paul Volcker is back , and he warns of tough times ahead
In speeches , interviews , public policy reports and congressional testimony , Volcker , 81 , has laid out a fairly clear outline of what he thinks is wrong with the present - day financial system and the government 's management of the economy .
His concerns go to the very core of how America lives and how Wall Street operates .
A child of the Great Depression and a man of legendary personal thrift , Volcker thinks Americans have been living above their means for too long .
...
Bringing consumption back in line with income would not only crimp individuals and families , but also require major readjustments in the global economy , which has relied on the U.S. as consumer of last resort .
...
Volcker has become a skeptic of modern Wall Street , worried that the nation 's entire financial system has evolved to a point that the government no longer has effective control over all of its important components .
And the financial industry has become beholden to complex financial engineering that clouds the picture .
" The market was being run by mathematicians who did n't know financial markets , " he said this year after the crisis struck .
Clearly , he wants tough new regulations on securities markets , including oversight of hedge funds , in order to avoid the need for a bailout effort by the Fed ever again .
It seems likely that he will advise Obama that the growth of U.S. consumption -- everything from government spending to household outlays -- should not be financed by selling ever larger amounts of debt to foreign interests .
But he warns people not to expect an easy ride .
" It 's going to be a tough period , " Volcker said in a speech at the Urban Land Institute in late October .
" But when we dealt with inflation , it laid the groundwork for 20 years of growth .
I 'd like to see that happen this time . "
" The only reason I sleep at night , " said a longtime friend and business partner of Volcker 's , speaking on background , " is that Paul Volcker will have the president 's ear . "

Alternative medicines are used by 38 percent of American adults and nearly 12 percent of children , according to a large national survey done in 2007 that was released last week by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM ) .
Natural products were the most popular alternative treatment used by the nearly 24,000 adults and more than 9,400 children interviewed for the survey .
The survey included a general question asking participants whether they had used any herbs , supplements , and other natural products within the last 12 months .
It also contained a specific question asking respondents to indicate which products , from a list of 45 possibilities , they had used within the last month .
Because the question was worded as usage within the last month , this could have influenced the final rankings of the top ten products .
A remedy , such as echinacea has a seasonal usage , typically during the late fall and winter , and if you responded to the survey in the summer , you might not have used this cold - fighting product in the previous month .
Products , such as fish oil and glucosamine , have year - round uses -- factors that may have led to their respective number one and number two rankings .
Another NCCAM survey done in 2002 was equally large , but did not include children .
A few natural remedies that appeared on the top ten list in 2002 but dropped off it in 2007 include St. John 's wort , peppermint , ginger , and soy supplements .
A few products appeared on the 2007 top ten list for the first time .
They included Coenzyme Q10 , flaxseed , and combination herb pills .
Get Your Questions Answered at the ABCNews.com OnCall + Cold & Flu Center
Here are the most popular natural products from the NCCAM survey ( in order of popularlity ) , along with advice from some of the leading experts in the field about their use and the research on them .
# 1 Fish oil
What it is :
These oils , which come from cold water fish , such as sardines and salmon , supply omega - 3 fatty acids .
Fish oil capsules , suggested Dr. Roberta Lee , medical director for the Continuum Center for Health & Healing at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City , offer a good way to get a nutritional oil without having to eat barrels of fish .
" Omega - 3 fats are notoriously under - represented in the diet because of our eating habits , " she said .
What it 's supposed to do :
Fish oils are thought to help the heart and brain , as well as inflammatory conditions .
The American Heart Association has recommended taking two to four grams of fish oil capsules a day to help bring down high triglyceride levels .
One to three grams daily is the amount Lee advises for her patients with existing cardiovascular disease .
In her practice , she suggests fish oils to people with conditions that have an inflammatory component .
This might include rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease , and lupus .
Scientists are also experimenting with the use of fish oils for mental health concerns -- not as a replacement for drugs , but as an adjunct therapy .
What research suggests : " We 're beginning to realize that fish oils are quite powerful , " Lee pointed out .
Fish oils are one of the many things that can help with high triglycerides and elevated lipid and cholesterol levels .
Additional research is starting to look at the supplement 's effect on asthma , ADHD , depression , atherosclerosis , and age - related macular degeneration .
Bottom line :
There 's a growing body of evidence suggesting that fish oils have positive effects on cardiovascular risk factors , but we still do n't have data that it will affect cardiovascular mortality , said the NCCAM survey researchers .
As Lee puts it , fish oils are inexpensive compared with other supplements , and they may be very effective for a broad range of conditions associated with inflammation .
# 2 Glucosamine
What it is : Glucosamine is a compound that 's found naturally in healthy cartilage , a connective tissue that covers the joints .
But the supplement is derived from the shells of shrimp , crab , and other types of shellfish .
What it 's supposed to do :
It 's been recommended for the treatment of osteoarthritis ( OA ) , and in people at high risk for OA , or those who have already had a joint injury , it might be suggested to help prevent arthritis .
Glucosamine might help build or rebuild damaged cartilage in people with OA .
What research suggests :
The most convincing studies for glucosamine have examined its effectiveness in mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis , said Dr. Adam Rindfleisch , an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin Family and Integrative Medicine Clinic in Madison .
But he explained that there has been a lot of debate about how the studies have been carried out .
The majority of them have used glucosamine hydrochloride , but some scientists suspect that glucosamine sulfate might be the form with the more powerful effect .
" My socks are n't knocked off by the most recent research , and it's not cheap to take , " cautioned Rindfleisch .
Bottom line :
Although some people might get some mild nausea as a side effect of glucosamine , Rindfleisch says he recommends the supplement ( along with chondroitin ) because he has seen it make a marked difference in some people with osteoarthritis .
" Give it a shot for at least six weeks or up to six months , and if you 're not seeing a difference , then lay off , " he advised .
The typical daily dose is 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine , taken in divided doses of 500 milligrams three times a day .
# 3 Echinacea
What it is : Echinacea , also known as purple coneflower , is a member of the daisy family .
People who have allergies to other daisy family members , including ragweed , marigolds , daisies , and chysanthemums , could also be sensitive to it .
What it 's supposed to do : Echinacea is believed to help boost the immune system to fight off infection , most typically the common cold and other upper respiratory infections .
It 's been studied for its role in helping to shorten the duration and severity of a cold and for preventing it in the first place .
What research suggests :
Even in the best data , echinacea never appeared to be a home run , noted Dr. Brent Bauer , director of the complementary and integrative medicine program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn .
" The overall enthusiasm for the herb has been appropriately dampened because we have n't seen many good studies coming up positive , " he added .
In earlier studies it was hard to tell which of the three species of the plant were used , but more recently there have been larger trials with well - derived preparations of the herb , and they have been negative on shortening the length of a cold or staving it off .
Bottom line :
More studies are leaning toward that echinacea is not all that effective for the common cold , said Bauer .
" The studies are conflicting , but most look fairly negative . "
# 4 Flaxseed Oil , Pills
What it is :
This tiny seed is an inexpensive plant - based source of omega - 3 fats , but they are not the same exact omega - 3s you would get by eating fish .
Oils pressed from the seeds are either placed into capsules or sold as a liquid , yet , unlike consuming the food , they lack the beneficial dietary fiber as well as lignans , which are plant compounds that have estrogen - like activity and may protect against hormone - driven cancers .
What it 's supposed to do : Grinding up the seeds and sprinkling them on cereals , salads , and cooked vegetables offers a good source of omega - 3 fats in people who do n't care to eat fish .
" Flax might help keep you regular , " explained Lee .
And like fish oil , flax is believed to have anti-inflammatory activity .
She often suggests ground flax to women with PMS and those with perimenopausal symptoms , and also to people with asthma .
What research suggests :
There 's less research on flax than there is on fish oil , even though they seemingly overlap in function , says Lee .
Flax contains alpha - linolenic acid , a type of omega - 3 found in plant foods , and its beneficial effects may not be as compelling as those from fish oils .
In human trials , the evidence for any benefits to high cholesterol or triglyceride levels is mixed .
Bottom line :
Lee endorses the use of buying whole flax seed , and grinding it up yourself .
Ground flax is sensitive to light and heat , so she suggests keeping it refrigerated .
# 5 Ginseng
What it is : A plant containing several different species and thought to be an overall tonic for well - being .
What it 's supposed to do : Ginseng is considered an adaptogen , meaning that it's an herb believed to help you fight off the stresses in the environment .
It 's also purported to increase stamina to help you perform better -- physically , mentally , athletically , and perhaps , sexually .
The herb is also believed to help boost immune function .
What research suggests : Panax ginseng ( also known as Chinese or Korean ) is the best studied form , explained Rindfleisch .
( There is also an American ginseng and a Siberian form , known as Eleuthero . )
He considers the evidence for ginseng as so - so with most of the findings coming from small trials .
Rindfleisch said ginseng probably helps with overall thinking , yet he warned that , in some people , the herb might rev them up .
He would not recommend that men try it for a sexual problem , such as erectile dysfunction .
American ginseng has been studied to help with blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes .
Bottom line : Rindfleisch said ginseng might be worth a try in people with chronic fatigue at a dose of 100 milligrams twice a day .
# 6 Combination Herb Pills
What they are :
These natural products contain more than one herb or natural compound , explained Richard Nahin , one of the co-authors of the NCCAM surveys and the acting director of its division of extramural research .
Two examples are a glucosamine / chondroitin blend for osteoarthritis or a combination of echinacea and goldenseal as an herbal remedy to help relieve a cold .
What they 're supposed to do : Combination products are sold for a host of conditions , from the common cold and pain relief to anxiety and heart health , to name a few .
What research suggests :
These days , most of the research on dietary supplements tends to focus on single ingredient herbs or supplements , to make it easier for scientists to pinpoint whether a natural product is having an influence on the condition or symptom being studied .
" The question that comes up when combining things , is what 's working ? " pointed out Dr. Mimi Guarneri , medical director for the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in La Jolla , Calif .
For example , it 's harder to tease out which ingredient in a pain - relieving remedy is helping to ease inflammation and swelling when it contains many different herbs that might play a beneficial role .
Bottom line : According to Guarneri , she would n't necessarily shy away from suggesting that a patient use a combination product because sometimes she has found that they work better than one supplement alone , because the ingredients can have an additive effect .
" Some combination products are really good .
As a clinician , I would look at what the individual components are in a product and whether I know them to cause any benefit . "
# 7 Ginkgo Biloba
What it is :
The claim to fame for this extract made from the leaves of an ancient tree is its antioxidant activity , as well as its potential to improve blood flow to the brain .
What it 's supposed to do : Ginkgo is best known for its possible brain - boosting powers .
The herb has been studied for its ability to prevent and treat dementia , and has also been looked at for improving cognitive function , such as memory , in healthy adults .
In Germany , the remedy has been used to treat vascular claudication , a type of pain that occurs while walking because the leg does n't get enough blood .
The Mayo Clinic is currently analyzing data from a more than three - year trial on the use of ginkgo in cancer patients experiencing " chemobrain , " a type of mental fogginess that occurs in some people following chemotherapy and radiation .
What research suggests :
Although studies done 10 or 15 years ago on gingko seemed initially promising , research done in the last year or two suggests that the herb may not work as a preventive for dementia , said Bauer .
" The needle is pushing more in the direction that we 're not seeing a strong protective effect on dementia . "
He cautioned that the jury is still out because ginkgo can cross the blood - brain barrier and has antioxidant properties , meaning it can squelch free radicals .
Bottom line : Ginkgo is a vasodilator , so it might do something to increase blood flow , noted Bauer .
He said small studies suggest some ability to improve cognitive function in healthy people , but not enough to say you 'll think better .
# 8 Chondroitin
What it is : A chemical compound derived from cartilage , typically from the windpipe of a cow .
What it 's supposed to do :
It 's typically used in conjunction with glucosamine , primarily to help treat pain and swelling in people with osteoarthritis .
It may replace a different material in cartilage than glucosamine does , but whether this is truly happening is subject to debate , according to Rindfleisch .
Because the supplement is sometimes made from parts of a cow , some people were worried that taking the supplement might theoretically increase their risk for mad cow disease .
What research suggests :
Right now , the research on chondroitin for osteoarthritis is even less convincing than it is for glucosamine , suggested Rindfleisch .
Bottom line :
The typical daily dose of chondroitin sulfate is 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams , often taken as 400 milligrams three times a day .
If you decide to try it , use it together with the supplement , glucosamine sulfate .
# 9 Garlic ( Allium sativum ) Supplements
What it is : Allicin , a component of whole garlic and believed to be the medically active ingredient in the clove , is placed into supplement form .
What it 's supposed to do :
From a cardiac standpoint , garlic has been thought to help lower total cholesterol , and LDL cholesterol , in particular , said Guarneri , who is a cardiologist .
People who consume more garlic in their diet may reduce their risk for stomach and colorectal cancers .
Supplements of the fragrant bulb have also been suggested for reducing high blood pressure and for treating infections .
What research suggests :
There 's no research that it can improve cardiovascular outcomes or decrease cholesterol , noted Guarneri .
" As a matter of fact , there are negative studies . "
The evidence for some cholesterol - lowering benefit seems to come from short - term studies of 4 to 12 weeks in length .
Data on the herb 's ability to reduce blood pressure suggests only a modest reduction .
Bottom line : " Garlic may be something that people can use for other reasons , such as an infection or a sore throat , but I 've not seen a benefit from it for cholesterol , " concluded Guarneri .
She said garlic is not her first choice of supplements to help lower cholesterol ; she prefers , instead , to recommend red yeast rice .
# 10 Coenzyme Q-10
What it is :
Also known as CoQ10 or ubiquinone , this substance is normally produced by the body and is a necessary cofactor in the production of energy by cells .
What it 's supposed to do :
Low levels of CoQ10 have been reported in patients with Parkinson 's disease , congestive heart failure , and those taking statin drugs to reduce cholesterol .
Guarneri believes that " it 's a necessary agent in protecting against statin - induced myopathy , a type of muscle ache and weakness that can be a side effect of taking the drug in some people .
She also thinks 1,200 milligrams of it a day can be beneficial in people who have symptoms of Parkinson 's disease , and it could be helpful for people who have muscle weakness .
What research suggests : " There 's strong research that CoQ10 is an independent predictor of mortality in chronic heart failure , " pointed out Guarneri .
CoQ10 works on the mitochondria in cells , where energy is produced .
There 's good evidence that if levels are deficient , supplementation can be effective .
Bottom line : " It 's an excellent cofactor for supporting the energy of the cell , " advised Guarneri , who recommends it to all of her patients on statin drug therapy and those who have congestive heart failure .

Series producer , The Happiness Formula
Find out how happy you are A new six - part BBC series , starting this week , looks at the newest research from around the world to find out what could it be that makes us happy .
We all want to be happy but the problem has always been that you can't measure happiness .
Happiness has always been seen as too vague a concept , as Lord Layard , Professor of Economics at the LSE and author of " Happiness - lessons from a new science " points out .
" There is a problem with the word happiness .
" When you use the word happy , it often has the sort of context of balloons floating up into the sky or something frivolous . "
Now scientists say they can actually measure happiness .
Neuroscientists are measuring pleasure .
They suggest that happiness is more than a vague concept or mood ; it is real .
Measuring happiness Social scientists measure happiness simply by asking people how happy they are .
It is argued that what a person says about their own happiness tends to tally with what friends or even strangers might say about them if asked the same question .
Most people say they are fairly happy .
PDAs can be used to measure happiness levels during the day The leading American psychologist Professor Ed Diener from the University of Illinois , told The Happiness Formula that the science of happiness is based on one straightforward idea : " It may sound silly but we ask people ' How happy are you 1 - 7 , 1 - 10 ?
" And the interesting thing is that produces real answers that are valid , they 're not perfect but they 're valid and they predict all sorts of real things in their lives . "
One type of measurement even tries to record people 's levels of happiness throughout the day wherever they are .
Ecological momentary assessment uses hand held computers .
The person being quizzed is bleeped and then taken through a questionnaire .
" The measures are not perfect yet I think they are in many ways as good as the measures economists use , " said Professor Diener .
It is a remarkable claim .
Simply by asking people , we have a measure of happiness that is as good as the economists ' measure of poverty or growth .
And if true , governments could be judged by how happy they make us .
An adviser to the Prime Minister , David Halpern , told us that within the next 10 years the government would be measured against how happy it made everybody .
Power of happiness Happiness seems to have almost magical properties .
We have not got proof , but the science suggests it leads to long life , health , resilience and good performance .
Standard of living has increased dramatically and happiness has increased not at all
Professor Daniel Kahneman , University of Princeton Scientists work by comparing people 's reported happiness and a host of other factors such as age , sex , marital status , religion , health , income , unemployment and so on .
In survey after survey involving huge groups of people , significant correlations between happiness and some other factors are repeated .
At the moment scientists cannot prove causation , whether for example people are healthy because they are happy , or whether people are happy because they are healthy .
However , psychologists have been able to identify some very strong links .
According to Professor
Diener the evidence suggests that happy people live longer than depressed people .
" In one study , the difference was nine years between the happiest group and the unhappiest group , so that 's a huge effect .
" Cigarette smoking can knock a few years off your life , three years , if you really smoke a lot , six years .
" So nine years for happiness is a huge effect . "
Richer but no happier Happiness researchers have been monitoring people 's life satisfaction for decades .
Happy people have close friends
Yet despite all the massive increase in our wealth in the last 50 years our levels of happiness have not increased .
" Standard of living has increased dramatically and happiness has increased not at all , and in some cases has diminished slightly , " said Professor Daniel Kahneman of the University of Princeton .
" There is a lot of evidence that being richer ... is n't making us happier "
The research suggests that richer countries do tend to be happier than poor ones , but once you have a home , food and clothes , then extra money does not seem to make people much happier .
It seems that that level is after average incomes in a country top about £ 10,000 a year .
Scientists think they know the reason why we do not feel happier despite all the extra money and material things we can buy .
First , it is thought we adapt to pleasure .
We go for things which give us short bursts of pleasure whether it is a chocolate bar or buying a new car .
But it quickly wears off .
You can't take a grouch and make him giggle all the time
Professor Martin Seligman , University of Pennsylvania Secondly , it is thought that we tend to see our life as judged against other people .
We compare our lot against others .
Richer people do get happier when they compare themselves against poorer people , but poorer people are less happy if they compare up .
The good news is that we can choose how much and who we compare ourselves with and about what , and researchers suggest we adapt less quickly to more meaningful things such as friendship and life goals .
What makes us happy ?
According to psychologist Professor Ed Diener there is no one key to happiness but a set of ingredients that are vital .
For added happiness , look for meaning in your life First , family and friends are crucial - the wider and deeper the relationships with those around you the better .
It is even suggested that friendship can ward off germs .
Our brains control many of the mechanisms in our bodies which are responsible for disease .
Just as stress can trigger ill health , it is thought that friendship and happiness can have a protective effect .
According to happiness research , friendship has a much bigger effect on average on happiness than a typical person 's income itself .
One economist , Professor Oswald at Warwick University , has a formula to work out how much extra cash we would need to make up for not having friends .
The answer is £ 50,000 .
Marriage also seems to be very important .
According to research the effect of marriage adds an average seven years to the life of a man and something like four for a woman .
The second vital ingredient is having meaning in life , a belief in something bigger than yourself - from religion , spirituality or a philosophy of life .
The third element is having goals embedded in your long term values that you 're working for , but also that you find enjoyable .
Psychologists argue that we need to find fulfilment through having goals that are interesting to work on and which use our strengths and abilities .
Unhappiness
However , there are also many things we experience in life that can produce lasting unhappiness .
Professor Ed Diener identifies two key events which can have lasting effects .
After the loss of a spouse it can take several years to regain the previous level of well - being .
The loss of a job can affect a person for years even they are back to work .
So if you are born grumpy are you always going to be grumpy ?
The question of whether we can actually use our knowledge of what makes us happy to lift our levels of happiness permanently is hotly debated by psychologists .
According to the positive psychologist Professor Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania it is possible to lift our biological set range of happiness , at least to some extent if we work at it .
" The best you can do with positive emotion is you can get people to live at the top of their set range .
" So I think you 've got about 10 to 15 % leverage but you can't take a grouch and make him giggle all the time . "
The first episode of The Happiness Formula was shown on BBC Two at 1900 BST on Wednesday .
