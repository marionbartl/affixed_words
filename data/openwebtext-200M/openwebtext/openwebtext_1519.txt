In my previous post , I posed the following question to Ian Adamson , director of product development and education for the Newton Running Company :
Me : Available data indicate that most people are heel - strikers .
Is it your belief that the presence of extensive heel cushion ( i.e. , a heel wedge / lift ) essentially forces a heel strike in most people ?
Ian ’s response to this question was as follows :
“ More accurately the data shows people running in traditional shoes are forced to engage the ground with heel of the shoe .
Remove the heel and you remove the heel strike .
Professor Daniel E. Lieberman from the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University has been studying running gait in humans and concluded that no one heel strikes naturally .
He looked at ( among other groups ) , people who have never worn shoes .
Dr. Lieberman ’s study should be appear shortly in a major scientific publication . “
Needless to say , I ’m looking forward to seeing Dr. Lieberman ’s forthcoming paper ( I ’ve previously written an extensive post about some of Lieberman ’s earlier work ) , but in the interim I thought I ’d contribute a little personal insight into Ian ’s answer to this question .
My interest in footstrike stems from a study I am conducting with my students looking at footstrike patterns in runners recorded during the recent Manchester City Marathon in Manchester , NH .
Regardless of what we find , we will be unable to tease apart the question of whether the footstrikes we observed are the “ natural ” gait of each runner or patterns that are induced by the shoes that they have on their feet .
To do this would require that we film each runner in shoes , and then barefoot under identical conditions .
While this is doable in a controlled laboratory situation , it is impossible to do this in a “ real - world ” racing situation .
Given this difficulty , I , along with one of my students , have decided to address this question in the simplest way possible – by looking at ourselves .
Although the sample size is very small , simple studies like this are great for hypothesis development , and hopefully this will serve as a springboard for more complex studies with larger samples in the future .
A quick word about Ryan , who is the student that I ’m working with .
Like me , Ryan was an early reader of the book “ Born to Run ” by Christopher McDougall .
Also like me , “ Born to Run ” heavily influenced Ryan ’s thinking about footwear and its relation to running .
Ryan is a Junior runner on the cross-country team at our college , and since early this year he has been running almost exclusively in Vibram Fivefingers , homemade huarache sandals , or barefoot .
He has accumulated approximately 1500 miles in Vibrams ( and if I ’m not mistaken , all of those miles have been on only a single pair ) , and he has been known to run barefoot in temperatures down into the 30’s .
He ’s worn his Vibrams so much that the cinching strap has worn off , and in its place he used a long strip of leather .
Needless to say , although I have also put in some miles in Vibrams , Ryan is a far more dedicated minimalist runner than I .
Currently , he is a captain of our track club , and is averaging running about 50 miles per week .
Filming conditions were similar to those in my previous post on treadmill running in various shoe types ( in fact , videos of me below were pulled from that post ) .
For each of us , videos show our footstrike in stability shoes ( Brooks Adrenaline for me , Asics 2130 ’s for Ryan ) , Vibram Fivefingers KSO ’s , and barefoot .
All were recorded while running steadily at 7mph .
First me :

In me , what you can see is a progression from a clear heel - strike in the stability shoes with a big heel cushion to a more midfoot strike in Vibrams and in the unshod ( barefoot ) condition .
And now for Ryan :

Ryan ’s shift in footstrike between the Asics stability shoes and the Vibram / barefoot conditions is truly a thing to behold .
He goes from being a harder heel striker than me in the Asics , to being a clear forefoot striker in the Vibram Fivefingers and when barefoot .
This is all the more compelling given that he had n’t run in the Asics for quite some time ( he ’s pretty much as exclusive a minimalist runner as you ’ll find at this point ) , and simply putting them on resulted in a reversion back to the heel - striking condition .
We were both pretty amazed this afternoon when we first watched the videos , and he even reported that his shins were tight after running just over a mile in the Asics .
Seems his body may have re-adapted to the unshod condition ( he generally does n’t even wear regular shoes when walking around campus or going to class ) , and the shod condition now seemed to be putting his legs under greater stress .
I ’ll re-emphaisize that we are still only a sample of two , but the pattern here is clear enough to me that it warrants additional investigation .
So , for at least me and Ryan , when wearing shoes with a big , cushioned heel we are both heel - strikers , and when that heel is removed , we convert into a midfoot striker ( me ) and a forefoot striker ( Ryan ) .
If humans evolved to run without shoes , then the lack of a heel cushion would seem to be the more natural condition for our bodies , and it makes one wonder why the heel cushion is necessary .
I still do n’t believe that there are solid data that conclusively show that one type of footstrike is necessarily better than another from a performance or injury - prevention standpoint , but I firmly believe that our footwear choices heavily influence the type of footstrike that we adopt .
I see it in myself , and I see it in my student .
I also see it in children – my son is a midfoot striker when barefoot .
Now I just need to get him on a treadmill in his mini Asics 2130 ’s ( yes , he does have them ! ) , and hope that they come out with Vibram Fivefingers in childrens sizes !
If you have any questions for either Ryan or I , feel free to leave a comment .
FOR years foreign observers gave warning that Japan 's combination of economic stagnation and rising public debt was unsustainable .
Over the past two decades the country has stumbled in and out of deflation , slipped down the global league tables on many social indicators and amassed the largest gross public debt - to - GDP ratio in the world ( a whopping 190 % ) .
Yet government - bond yields have remained stubbornly low and living standards , by and large , are high .
Visit the country and you will see no outward sign of crisis .
Politicians and policymakers have bickered and schemed , but have mostly chosen to leave things as they are .
That can not go on much longer .
The figures are getting worse .
Japan urgently needs radical policies to tackle the problems , and new leaders to implement them .
Triple troubles
There are three big reasons why the crisis in Japan 's public finances will eventually come to a head .
The first concerns government bonds .
The state has for years relied on domestic savers to buy them .
But as Japan 's people age and run down their savings , they will have less money to invest in government bonds .
An IMF paper calculates that even if the savings rate remains close to where it is now , gross debt may exceed gross household assets by 2015 .
Japan might then have to rely on foreigners to finance its debt , and they will want much higher returns .
That will , at the very least , provide an acute reality check .
Goldman
Sachs says some foreign investors are already positioning themselves for a “ meltdown ” .
The second , more immediate problem is deflation .
Falling prices may have helped the government by providing its bondholders with invisible gains , but in other ways deflation is a menace .
It pushes the debt - to - GDP ratio inexorably higher .
As expectations of deflation become entrenched — 35 % of Japanese expect prices to be the same or lower in five years ' time — they will continue to depress consumption .
Third , despite the recent pick - up in global economic activity , Japan cannot count on foreign demand being strong enough for it to sustain export - led growth , as it did in the past decade .
Without a stronger domestic economy , growth will not generate enough tax revenue to reduce the debt .
One ominous sign is that in the 2010 budget implemented on April 1st , borrowing , at ¥ 44 trillion ( $ 468 billion ) , is for the first time forecast to exceed tax revenues , at ¥ 37 trillion .
Japan 's efforts to tackle these problems have resembled a big whimper ( see article ) .
What is needed is a big bang .
That means structural reforms to raise productivity , fiscal reforms to boost growth and a strong monetary stimulus , all at once , to shock the economy back to life .
These could range from an overhaul of the tax code to deregulation of farming and the opening up of protected areas of the economy , such as transport and energy , to foreign competition .
A sensible short - term aim for the government would be robust nominal GDP growth .
That would help stop the debt - to - GDP ratio rising , and would also ensure that the authorities did not prematurely choke off a recovery because of concerns about inflation .
But all this assumes that policymakers want to be bold .
The current crop is anything but .
Last September , when almost 55 years of one - party rule came to an end , there were faint hopes that the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) might take a fresh approach .
It has not done so .
Yukio Hatoyama , the prime minister , and his most influential backer , Ichiro Ozawa , have since been caught up in election - funding scandals that have shredded the government 's credibility .
They are clinging to their jobs , more concerned with their own futures than that of the DPJ , or indeed Japan .
Enlightened economic policymaking suffers most .
Mr Hatoyama prevaricates over fiscal reform , arguing that Japan should wait until the next general election in 2013 before shaking up the tax system .
He is wrong .
Japan urgently needs cuts in business taxes , perhaps , as well as a gradually higher spending tax .
The ousted Liberal Democrats are just as out of touch ( see article ) .
When a group of supposed reformers left the splintering party this week to set up a new outfit , it could have grabbed the fiscally conservative , business friendly centre .
Instead it moved to the right , as if anti-immigrant nationalism were the tonic Japan needs .
It is time for more fiscally astute members of Mr Hatoyama 's government to set the agenda .
The main opposition , too , needs regime change .
Japan 's old guard worries that radical steps will precipitate an economic crisis , and so prefers the status quo .
It does not realise how inherently dangerous the status quo is .
[ an error occurred while processing this directive ] Goldman Sachs , the Wall Street powerhouse , has been accused of defrauding investors by America 's financial regulator .
The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) alleges that Goldman failed to disclose conflicts of interest .
The claims concern Goldman 's marketing of sub - prime mortgage investments just as the US housing market faltered .
Goldman rejected the SEC 's allegations , saying that it would " vigorously " defend its reputation .
News that the SEC was pressing civil fraud charges against Goldman and one of its London - based vice presidents , Fabrice Tourre , sent shares in the investment bank tumbling 12 % .
The narrative of what transpired , as set out by the SEC , is quite the financial thriller
Robert Peston , BBC Business Editor
Peston 's Picks : Why Goldman may owe UK taxpayers $ 841 m
The SEC says Goldman failed to disclose " vital information " that one of its clients , Paulson & Co , helped choose which securities were packaged into the mortgage portfolio .
These securities were sold to investors in 2007 .
But Goldman did not disclose that Paulson , one of the world 's largest hedge funds , had bet that the value of the securities would fall .
The SEC said : " Unbeknownst to investors , Paulson ... which was posed to benefit if the [ securities ] defaulted , played a significant role in selecting which [ securities ] should make up the portfolio . "
" In sum , Goldman Sachs arranged a transaction at Paulson 's request in which Paulson heavily influenced the selection of the portfolio to suit its economic interests , " said the Commission .
Housing collapse
The SEC alleges that investors in the mortgage securities , packaged into a vehicle called Abacus , lost more than $ 1bn ( £ 650 m ) in the US housing collapse .
The whole building is about to collapse anytime now ...
Only potential survivor , the fabulous Fabrice ...
Email by Fabrice Tourre How US media has reacted
Mr Tourre was principally behind the creation of Abacus , which agreed its deal with Paulson in April 2007 , the SEC said .
The Commission alleges that Mr Tourre knew the market in mortgage - backed securities was about to be hit well before this date .
The SEC 's court document quotes an email from Mr Tourre to a friend in January 2007 .
" More and more leverage in the system .
Only potential survivor , the fabulous Fab[rice Tourre ] ... standing in the middle of all these complex , highly leveraged , exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstrosities !!! "
Goldman denied any wrongdoing , saying in a brief statement : " The SEC 's charges are completely unfounded in law and fact and we will vigorously contest them and defend the firm and its reputation . "
The firm said that , rather than make money from the deal , it lost $ 90 m .
The two investors that lost the most money , German bank IKB and ACA Capital Management , were two " sophisticated mortgage investors " who knew the risk , Goldman said .
And nor was there any failure of disclosure , because " market makers do not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa . "
John Paulson made billions of dollars in the financial markets Calls to Mr Tourre 's office were referred to the Goldman press office .
Paulson has not been charged .
Asked why the SEC did not also pursue a case against Paulson , Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami told reporters : " It was Goldman that made the representations to investors .
Paulson did not . "
The firm 's owner , John Paulson - no relation to former US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson - made billions of dollars betting against sub - prime mortgage securities .
In a statement , Paulson & Co. said : " As the SEC said at its press conference , Paulson is not the subject of this complaint , made no misrepresentations and is not the subject of any charges . "
' Regulation risk ' Goldman , arguably the world 's most prestigious investment bank , had escaped relatively unscathed from the global financial meltdown .
This is the first time regulators have acted against a Wall Street deal that allegedly helped investors take advantage of the US housing market collapse .
The charges come as US lawmakers get tough on Wall Street practices that helped cause the financial crisis .
Among proposals being considered by Congress is tougher rules for complex investments like those involved in the alleged Goldman fraud .
Observers said the SEC 's move dealt a blow to Goldman 's standing .
" It undermines their brand , " said Simon Johnson , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Goldman critic .
" It undermines their political clout . "
Analyst Matt McCormick of Bahl & Gaynor said that the allegation could " be a fulcrum to push for even tighter regulation " .
" Goldman has a fight in front of it , " he said .

The Pentagon ’s decision to begin making so - called morning - after emergency contraception available at military bases around the world marked welcome , if overdue , progress in meeting the health needs of women serving the United States in the military .
The decision followed a recommendation by the Pentagon ’s Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee .
The medical advisory panel voted in November to add emergency contraception , which can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex , to the list of drugs required to be stocked at every military facility .
A similar recommendation by the panel in 2002 was blocked by the Bush administration , which chose to ill - treat servicewomen  including victims of sexual assault  to placate antiabortion extremists who view emergency contraception as a form of abortion .
In 2006 , after a protracted fight , the Food and Drug Administration approved the over - the - counter sale of the morning - after pill to adults .
That made the military ’s policy of denying its soldiers access even harder to justify .
The turnaround on emergency contraception is all the more significant given the serious , continuing problem of sexual assaults among service members .
The cartoonist who won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning this week says Apple has asked him to resubmit an iPhone app that it earlier rejected because it " ridicules public figures . "
Mark Fiore , who won the prize for animations that ran on SFGate.com , submitted an iPhone app to Apple last year and received an email informing him that his application had been denied , according to a post by Laura McGann at Harvard 's Nieman Journalism Lab .

Study : Adults Can't Agree What ' Sex ' Means A survey from the Kinsey Institute shows " sex " still gets lost in translation .
March 8 , 2010  -- Paging Dr. Ruth : Adults do n't even agree on what it means to " have sex . "
Researchers at the renowned Kinsey Institute at Indiana University asked 484 people " Would you say you had sex with someone if … "
People between the ages of 18 and 96 took part in the study , and their results showed no single generation or gender agrees on a definition of " had sex " -- be it oral , anal or digital .
But doctors , sociologists and therapists all agree that the varying definition of " sex " can be a big problem in some cases .
" Having sex is a euphemism .
It is not a very exact term , " said Eli Coleman , of the Program in Human Sexuality at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis .
" That 's why it 's very important that physicians and health care workers ask more specific and precise questions rather than using euphemisms . "
Nearly 95 percent of people in the study agreed that penile - vaginal intercourse meant " had sex . "
But the numbers changed as the questions got more specific .
For example , 11 percent of respondents would not use the phrase " had sex " if " the man did not come . "
About 80 percent of respondents said penile - anal intercourse meant " had sex . "
About 70 percent of people believed oral sex was sex .
" The only things we see consistently are the inconsistencies , " said Brandon J. Hill , Kinsey Institute researcher and corresponding author on the recent study published in the journal Sexual Health .
Researchers at the Kinsey Institute first examined the question of what " had sex " meant to people in 1991 , among college students at Indiana University .
They asked nearly 600 students about various scenarios of sexual behavior , and 59 percent of respondents said that oral sex did not constitute having " had sex " with a partner .
Stephanie A. Sanders , who is also an author of the current study , and June M. Reinisch , director emeritus of the Kinsey Institute , published the student survey research eight years later -- shortly after the 1999 scandal between former President Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky .
Research to Define ' Sex ' Stirred Controversy
The decision to publicize the work at that time cost Dr. George D. Lundberg , the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association , his job .
Hill said the most recent study gave researchers the chance to compare answers across age groups , and a few interesting differences appeared .
For example , 81 percent of all survey participants considered penile - anal intercourse as having had sex , but only 50 percent of men age 65 and up agreed .
" I do n't think people were looking at other people [ for the answers ] , " Hill said .
" I think the definition definitely ran through their own experience . "
By Hill 's estimation , different ideas about what sex means may have less to do with a generational gap and upbringing , and more to do with forming the idea of " sex " into something that makes people feel good about themselves at the moment .
For instance , Hill hypothesized that " younger male participants may want to increase or decrease the number of partners at any given point so that would change the way they define sex . "
If a person felt nervous in front of a doctor who was asking about the number of sex partners , that person may exclude oral sex to decrease the number , Hill said .
On the other hand , if there was a bragging atmosphere , a person might extend the parameters of " having sex " to increase that number .
Reinisch , who is now director of Acquisitions and New Exhibitions at the Museum of Sex in New York City , pointed out that the older men in the study were unlikely to label penile - vaginal intercourse as " sex " if they were using a condom .
One hundred percent of the men in the 18 to 29 age group called penile - vaginal intercourse with a condom sex , but only 82 percent of the men in the 65 and up age group considered sex with a condom sex .
Reinisch said this " reflects how a significant portion of individuals born during a certain era feel about or understand a particular phenomenon . "
Why Different Ideas About ' Sex ' Could Cause Problems
People who came of age before the contraceptive pill was widely available may then define intercourse as sex only if there 's a possibility to procreate .
" Perhaps for older men what really counts ... is the act that is involved with procreation .
The act that was primarily thought of and discussed as ' the sex act , ' " Reinisch said .
Ed Laumann , a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago , said these differences require social science researchers to be really careful about asking questions in studies .
" It 's been a discussed problem for a long time , " said Laumann , who also does n't believe we will ever come to a consensus as a society about what it means to have sex .
" Well , what is the answer ?
There is no true objective thing here , " he said .
While changing definitions might be interesting for sociologists , the shifting definitions could cause doctors problems .
Coleman , of the University of Minneapolis ' Program in Human Sexuality , said , " What kind of sexual activities a person is having will determine what kinds tests and where to test them . "
In “ The Hostile Hospital , ” from the Lemony Snicket “ Series of Unfortunate Events ” books , the three young orphans at the center of the story visit the fictitious Heimlich Hospital , where Babs , the head of human resources , asks them if they know what the most important work done in a hospital is .
“ Healing sick people ? ” one of the children asks innocently .
“ You ’re wrong , ” Babs growls , silencing the children .
“ The most important thing we do at the hospital , ” she continues without flinching , “ is paperwork . ”
It ’s a satirical stab that comes uncomfortably close to the truth .
Paperwork , or documentation , takes up as much as a third of a physician ’s workday ; and for many practicing doctors , these administrative tasks have become increasingly intolerable , a source of deteriorating professional morale .
Having become physicians in order to work with patients , doctors instead find themselves facing piles of charts and encounter and billing forms , as well as the innumerable bureaucratic permutations of dozens of health insurance companies .
But despite the paperwork burden , there are few studies on the amount of time current doctors devote to charting , ordering , filling out forms and dictating .
That is , except among one subset of doctors — doctors - in - training , or residents .
This is a Tachihara 4x5 wooden field camera .
It 's a completely manual camera which uses fixed focal length lenses .
Each image is exposed onto a large 4 - inch by 5 - inch sheet of film , which records an enormous amount of detail .
The 4x5 camera also enables a variety of lens movements which contribute to the incredible sharpness of the images .
It takes me about 5 to 10 minutes to set up the camera , compose the scene , focus the image under a dark cloth using a magnifying loupe , calculate the exposure with a light meter , and finally expose the film .
The tedious process of taking photos with the large format camera is rewarded by the ability to print the photos at huge sizes with incredible detail .
You can see my gallery of large format photos here .

It is likely that starring in bareback porn starting at 18 will lead to HIV / AIDS , but is the glorification of unprotected sex through the porn industry also leading to an increase in HIV / AIDS related diagnosis among young gay men throughout the country ?
Chad Noel 's March 17 death was reported on at GayPornGossip on March 26 .
The posting read , " Chad Noel age 25 , a former ' twink genre ' gay porn performer using the stage names of Donny Price & Craven Cox passed away in New York City , on March 17 , 2010 following a brief illness associated with complications of HIV . "
The article also noted that Noel had worked for an adult entertainment company that makes videos of men barebacking -- a euphemism for unprotected anal sex .
Noel had also performed under the names Craven Cox and Donny Price .
Noel was a native of Laramie , Wyoming , the town outside of which Matthew Shepard was beaten and left to die .
A notice of Noel 's death was also published in the Laramie Boomerang on March 23 .
Chad Noel 's untimely death is symptomatic of a growing problem in our community .
HIV is on the rise for young people , and the glorification of unprotected sex in gay porn is part of the problem .
When did porn stars start shedding their condoms for riskier bareback sex ?
Most of the major labels like Titan , Bel Ami , Lucas Films , and Chi-Chi-La Rue all require their actors to wear protection during production .
They understand that not only are their films entertainment , but they are educational .
Proper sex education is lacking in our schools .
It has been ever since George W. Bush replaced sex education with " Abstinence Only " education .
Fortunately I was taught about sex pre George W. Bush .
My mom was a sex education teacher and helped design the curriculum in the school system I attended .
Every student learned about condom use , and was shown an awkward demonstration about how to put a condom on a banana .
The visual was memorable .
People still come up to me and tell me my mom taught them how to have sex .
I 'm proud of her .
Unfortunately , my mom is n't teaching sex ed any more , because no child left behind left schools fending for basic resources based on math and science scores only .
Kids are not being tested on whether you should mix Vaseline and latex condoms .
( You should not .
Water based lubes should only be used with condoms . )
Instead , young people are learning about sex mostly on their own via the internet .
Particularly gay adolescents .
I 'm not aware of a single school in the country brave enough to teach gay sex ed .
If I 'm wrong , please let me know .
Most free gay porn sites are full of bareback sex porn -- the kind of porn that killed young Chad Noel .
Why are these sites promoting bareback sex ?
Because that 's what people are looking for .
A simple Google Analytics report will show you that " bareback sex " is a very popular search term .
Far more popular than " gay condom porn " .
So , to stay competitive in a market when most porn companies can't even turn a profit , bareback porn is produced to fill the demand .
Every time people click on bareback porn , they help promote risky behavior by telling young people condoms are n't sexy .
The glorification of bareback porn is a dangerous development and is killing our youth .
They 're being taught that bareback is sexy , it is the norm , and it is how to behave .
In turn , they are contracting HIV / AIDS at a staggering rate .
You have to own your role in the system .
You know who you are bareback porn fans .
When you watch bareback porn online you are voting for more bareback porn production .
When you watch safer sex porn from the companies I listed above or others , you are supporting a system that promotes healthier sexual behavior .
Young actors like Chad Noel should not have to die , just so you can get your rocks off .
Millions of youth do not have to be taught that bareback is ok .
Simply , choose safer porn and you will be helping more than you will ever know .
DETROIT --
If finishing higher in the standings and riding some momentum into the playoffs is n't enough to drive the Detroit Red Wings in their the final two games , perhaps extending their NHL record streak of 100 - point seasons will provide added incentive .
Or , for a couple players , the possibility of losing their spots in the lineup could supply extra motivation .
The Red Wings wrap up the regular season with games Friday night in Columbus and Sunday afternoon in Chicago .
They can finish anywhere from fifth to eighth in the Western Conference , and their first - round playoff opponent probably wo n't be determined until after the final game .
It will be Chicago , San Jose , Vancouver or Phoenix .
Red Wings coach Mike Babcock will have more options at his disposal when the series starts , Wednesday or Thursday on the road .
The Red Wings will recall seven players from AHL affiliate Grand Rapids on Monday , two of whom , forwards Justin Abdelkader and Brad May , will compete for lineup spots right off the hop .
" They 'll be parachuted into our lineup right away .
Whether they get into the lineup Day 1 or do n't get in , or just practice with us , I can't answer that , " Babcock said .
" We 're going to watch our players and they decide . "
Abdelkader will try to win back his fourth - line center spot .
He played 50 games for Detroit this season ( three goals , three assists ) but was sent down due to roster and salary - cap limitations when injured players began filtering back into the lineup .
Abdelkader led the team with 152 hits before being sent down .
He played in 10 playoff games for the Red Wings last season , scoring goals in Games 1 and 2 of the Stanley Cup finals .
The veteran May was signed in October to serve as an enforcer .
He had 10 fighting majors in 40 games before being sent down , also due to the roster squeeze .
He has five goals and three assists in 15 games with the Griffins .
The players who appear most susceptible to losing their regular spots are Jason Williams , who has no goals and four assists in his past 15 games , and Kris Draper , whose ice time has been reduced in the past month .
Abdelkader and May will practice with the Red Wings .
Forwards Mattias Ritola and Jan Mursak , defensemen Doug Janik and Jakub Kindl and goaltender Daniel Larsson will be recalled as " Black Aces , " taking the ice after the main group is finished .
Mursak will join the club after competing for Slovenia in the B Pool World Championships .
The Griffins , who failed to qualify for the AHL playoffs , finish the season with three games in three nights beginning Friday night .
The Red Wings had a few streaks snapped this season -- 17 years with home - ice advantage in the first round , eight seasons as Central Division champions , four years with 50 or more wins .
They still need two points to record their 10th consecutive 100 - point season .
" It would be great for ( general manager ) Kenny Holland , he 's been the GM that whole time , " Babcock said .
" It would be great for our team , but for him , you got a long - standing record . "
The Red Wings have reached the 100 - point mark in 13 of the past 15 seasons , excluding the lockout - shortened 1995 campaign , when , during a 48 - game schedule , they were on pace for a 120 - point season .
" You talk about playing well the last couple of games and have that carry over into the playoffs , and that 's one the things that can motivate you , too , to get 100 points again , " captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
Defenseman Brad Stuart agreed .
" At this point of the season , you want to have something to play for , and that can be a number of things , " he said .
" So I do n't think we should have any problems being focused . "

Bolivian president Evo Morales is under fire for suggesting that eating hormone - injected chicken could provoke male " deviance " .
Bolivia 's opposition and homosexual groups criticised comments made by Mr Morales at the first " people 's conference " on climate change the previous day , in which he said chicken producers inject birds with female hormones and " when men eat those chickens , they experience deviances in being men . "
The Bolivian president also suggested that European food made men go bald .
Spain 's National Federation of Lesbians , Gays , Transsexuals and Bisexuals sent a protest letter to the Bolivian embassy of Madrid , calling Mr Morales ' remarks " homophobic . "
The president of Argentina 's homosexual community , Cesar Cigliutti , said " It 's an absurdity to think that eating hormone - containing chicken can change the sexual orientation of a person . "
" By following that reasoning , if we put male hormones in a chicken and we make a homosexual eat it , he will transform into a heterosexual , " he added , in online comments .
Right - wing Bolivian deputy Andres Ortega criticised Mr Morales for recounting " urban legends " at the conference which sought to draft new proposals for the next UN climate talks in Mexico at the end of the year .
" I thought it was a place to talk about science and real and positive things about preserving the environment , " Mr Ortega said .
Thousands of environmental activists , indigenous leaders and ecologists were taking part in the three - day summit focusing on the world 's poorest , whom they say were largely ignored at official UN - sponsored climate talks in Copenhagen last December .
Mr Morales on Wednesday announced the creation of an international movement to protect the Earth which would promote a world tribunal for climate issues and a global referendum on environmental choices .
Developing nations have resisted a legally binding climate treaty , arguing wealthy nations must bear the primary responsibility for climate change .

Alan Greenspan had a dream , or rather a nightmare .
Greenspan seems to have woken up in a cold sweat one morning in fear that the period of " disinflationary pressures " that had kept inflation low since the 1990s was about to end .
This was 2007 , when he published his autobiographical economic treatise , The Age of Turbulence .
Despite his well - known love for economic data , and poring over the latest reports from every statistical agency , he did not realise that he was sitting on a housing bubble of epic proportions .
Not seeing the bubble ( he also missed the prior stock market bubble that accumulated and burst on his watch , causing the 2001 downturn ) , he could not know that it would soon collapse and cause a very ugly recession , in which inflation would be irrelevant .
This by itself should be enough to question the wisdom of central bankers , since the evidence for both of these world - historic asset bubbles was blindingly obvious once they had reached a certain size .
But Greenspan 's nightmare is scary for other reasons , some of which will become increasingly relevant as the world economy recovers .
As Greenspan details in his book , the reason for his nightmare is that the world was depleting its stock of hundreds of millions of unemployed people , including those of the former Soviet Union and also in rural China .
In other words , " too many " of them had become employed , and this was allowing for wages of factory workers in China to rise .
So long as China had a huge mass of unemployed , wages were held in check , and – according to Greenspan – competition from low - wage production there held down wages in the rest of the world , including even rich countries like the United States .
All good !
Until the nightmare started .
Is there something wrong with this picture , that one of the world 's most powerful economic decision makers ( at the time ) , dreads the decline of mass unemployment and rising wages among people making 80 cents an hour ?
What , then , is the purpose of economic development , if not to raise living standards for poor people ?
Some may dismiss Greenspan 's values as unrepresentative – he was , after all , a devotee of the extreme libertarian writer Ayn Rand .
And his autobiographical narrative is rather unusual : although we learn about his love of baseball , music ( he attended the Julliard School ) , and how he became interested in economics , there is something missing .
Most public figures of his stature , and even most economists , would have offered at least a perfunctory paragraph about how his economic thinking was aimed at helping those at the bottom of the social ladder – whether true or not .
Greenspan did n't bother .
But unfortunately Greenspan is not an outlier but a moderate among central bankers .
What is worse , their perverse world view has a hugely disproportionate influence on reporting and discussion of economic issues .
As the press has recently reported , wages in China are again rising , due to the additive effect of the global economic recovery and the world 's most effective economic stimulus programme , which enabled China to plough right through the world recession with 8.7 % growth in 2009 .
The reports are somewhat less negative than they were a few years ago , but Greenspan 's nightmare is everywhere : a dreaded " labour shortage " is forcing Chinese wages up and this will add to inflation .
It is not clear what is wrong with a " labour shortage " being resolved in the way that markets resolve other shortages : ie the price of labour goes up until quantity supplied matches quantity demanded .
" China has drained its once vast reserves of unemployed workers in rural areas and is running out of fresh labourers for its factories , " reports the New York Times .
" Personnel managers here say they are also abandoning the informal tradition of not hiring anyone over 35 – they say they are now hiring workers up to 40 years old , and sometimes older , despite concerns about whether they can keep up week after week with the rapid pace of Chinese assembly lines . "
" Managers can no longer simply provide eight - to - a - room dorms and expect labourers to toil 12 hours a day , seven days a week , " says Business Week .
There is more , but we would n't want to give Alan Greenspan a heart attack .
To its credit , the Times recognises the positive aspect of rising wages for Chinese workers and also notes that the Obama administration , which has complained about the Chinese yuan being undervalued , should welcome this development .
An increase in Chinese wages , to the extent that it raises the price of the country 's exports , has the same impact as an appreciation of the yuan .
But the reality is that the Obama administration , as well as Congressional leaders , are not really serious about a more competitive dollar .
If they were , they could push down the value of the dollar worldwide , rather than trying to blame the Chinese for our overvalued currency .
But they do n't do that because the Greenspan / Wall Street view prevails : anything that lowers inflation is good , whether it's an overvalued dollar , cheap imports from repressed overseas labour , or US workers ' wages stagnating , as they have , for decades .
All this despite the fact that the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects inflation over the next 10 years averaging less than 1.7 % annually – lower than any decade for more than half a century .
Imaginary threats of inflation could turn out to be one of the more real threats to the United States ' economic recovery .
Once more , for the record : Nestor Carbonell does NOT wear eye make - up !
During the panel for ABC ’s “ Lost ” at the TCA Press Tour a few weeks ago , executive producer Carlton Cuse said that the true mystery of the series is , “ Is Nestor Carbonell wearing make - up ? ”
Those familiar with the man who plays Richard Alpert , advisor to the inscrutable Benjamin Linus , have pondered this question for quite some time , and millions more wondered about it after seeing Carbonell playing the Mayor of Gotham City in “ The Dark Knight , ” but Cuse ’s fellow “ Lost ” producer , Damon Lindelof , swore to an audience of TV critics that Carbonell is not guilty on all charges .
“ When we first saw dailies of Nestor , we were , like , ‘ Someone ’s gotta talk to him about the eyeliner situation , ’ ” Lindelof said .
“ And he does not wear any mascara , no eyeliner , nothing .
He is completely 100 percent sans makeup .
That ’s the God ’s honest truth . ”
And , yet , there are those who still refuse to believe it .
Therefore , when I was given the opportunity to talk with Carbonell in connection with the DVD release of “ Killer Movie ” ( he has a small but hilarious part as a Hollywood agent ) , I figured that this was the perfect opportunity to get confirmation straight from the horse ’s mouth .
Word of the TCA tour had clearly gotten back to Carbonell , however , since the mere mention of the event led him to start laughing ( “ My brother told me about it , ” he explained ) , and the laughter increased dramatically , however , when I told him that the changing of my status to indicate my impending interview with him had immediately resulted in one of my friends – okay , it was Mekeisha Madden Toby , who writes for The Detroit News ’
TV blog – replying , “ OOOH !
Ask him if he uses eyeliner ! ”
So I asked him .
“ Let me make this perfectly clear : I do not .
I do not wear make - up , and I do not wear eye - liner , ” said Carbonell , still laughing .
“ My brother sent me that article ( about the “ Lost ” panel ) , and I just laughed so loud .
This is something I ’ve had to deal with my whole life .
When I was a little kid , I was about five years old and living in Mexico , and I remember my mom ’s friends would come over and say , ‘ Oh , look at his eyelashes ! ’
I got such a complex about it that I ended up taking scissors to them once , and my mom stopped me and said , ‘ What are you doing ? ’
But they were talking about them , and I got a lot comments about my eye - liner .
Eventually , I got over it and was , like , ‘ What are you gonna do ? ’
But I definitely had a complex when I was a kid about having dark eyelashes . ”
Sadly , the complex would come back to haunt Carbonell a few years later .
“ When I was in college in Boston , I had a commercial agent who sent me out for some print commercial stuff , ” he said .
“ But they called me into the office and said , ‘ Look , we called you in to talk to you because we just want you to know that …well , we do n’t think you need to wear eyeliner . ’
And I ’m , like , ‘ What ? ’
‘ Yeah , it ’s okay , you do n’t have to wear it for print ads . ’
‘ No , I ’m not wearing eyeliner ! ’
And I kept dabbing my eyes and saying , ‘ Look !
No eyeliner !
I ’m not wearing any ! ’
And , finally , they started laughing .
“ So , yeah , it ’s something I ’ve dealt with it in the past , and sometimes , makeup artists are able to diminish it …and they ’re doing it on ‘ Lost ’ more and more … by putting a base on my eyelashes so it makes it less dark .
But I did n’t know it would be a question at the TCA tour , that ’s for sure ! ”
Stay tuned for the full interview with Mr. Carbonell on Bullz - Eye next week , with more “ Lost ” talk , plus conversation about the “ Dark Knight ” / “ Tick ” connection , his regrets over the too - quick departure of “ Cane ” from the airwaves , and …yes ! … his work on “ Suddenly Susan . ”

Proof positive that racial justice , of a sort , can be crowdsourced : A few days ago , someone posted this photo of a rolling Inner America sterotype on the Internet , and Gawker picked it up .
Apparently , a patriotic Confederate — as evidenced by his love for the stars and bars — wanted everybody behind him to know how much he hates Muslims while driving past the Philip Morris plant south of Richmond on I - 95 .
“ EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ISLAM I LEARNED ON 9/11 , ” his slick tailgate decal reads , in block letters superimposed over explosions at the World Trade Centers , which must have been oh , such a personal blow to this south - of - the - Mason - Dixon waterdrinker .
But then the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) took a look at the photo and noticed Jebediah Q. Public ’s license plate :
Turns out it ’s laden with white supremacist code .
The “ 88 ” you might know :
That ’s a popular way among yahoos of subtly saying “ Heil Hitler , ” since “ H ” is the 8th letter of the alphabet .
( Apologies to all you well - intending NASCAR fans of Jarrett , Junior and Geoff . )
The “ CV ” means “ confederate veteran ” , which is consistent with the plate ’s tiny confederate battle flag denoting the licensee as a Sons of Confederate Veterans member .
Best of all , though , is the lesser - known “ 14 , ” which is a reference to the “ 14 Words , ” a white supremacist manifesto first coined by The Order member David Lane :
“ We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children . ”
Turns out the driver of this mystery machine is n’t just a racist lunatic ; he ’s a joiner .
“ If the license plate had been on a VW Beetle with nothing else on it , or a Volvo station wagon , no one would probably have noticed , ” CAIR ’s director told the Washington Post .
“ But when the Confederate flag is thrown in …it shows the convergence of anti-government and anti-Islamic sentiments that unfortunately seem to be growing . ”
Mind you , this is Virginia , where the recently elected “ moderate ” Republican governor , Bob McDonnell , has held a shadow state of the union address , fought against equal protection for gays , expressed secessionist sentiment over health care reform , and declared April “ Confederate History Month ” ( a proclamation that he was forced to modify when critics pointed out that it glossed over that whole , you know , slavery thing ) .
In Virginia , you may not be able to hang testicles on your truck or have a casual chat with cops while cutting loose , but hey , the Confederacy ’s cool .
That ’s part of a general doublethink trend in ( mainly southern ) conservative circles , where extolling America ’s anti-American past is now a supreme sign of patriotism .
To its credit , once CAIR and the blogosphere got involved , the state commonwealth of Virginia ’s Department of Motor Vehicles moved quickly to put the kibosh on this David Dukemobile ’s licensing .
Next , maybe they ’ll write the dude a ticket for bogarting that disabled parking spot .
Unless he claims some mental derangement .
But last time I checked , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders did n’t have an entry under “ douchebag . ”
An RSPB officer discovered an exhausted polar bear that had washed up on the Isle of Mull in Scotland when he was conducting a routine wildlife survey earlier today .
When he returned to the spot an hour later , the bear had disappeared .

Mull officer , explained how he saw a white shape on the west coast of the island that turned out to be a polar bear .
He said : ‘ At first I felt sure it was dead , but then I realised it was still breathing .
Scarily , it opened its eyes as we got near it , but did n’t show any other signs of moving .
We grabbed a few photos and ran off to get help . ’
On his return , Mr Sexton was amazed to discover that the polar bear had gone .
He added : ‘ Having spent many years protecting threatened wildlife , I just hope this polar bear is going to be ok . ’

Mull islanders , the coastguard , the local police and Arctic - marine - mammal experts are searching for the missing polar bear , which is thought to have drifted across to the island on an ice floe .
Scientists believe that the colder winter and lower - than - average sea temperatures this year may have allowed the ice floe to remain frozen longer than usual , assisting the polar bear ’s passage .
The nearest polar - bear populations to the Isle of Mull are on Greenland and the Svalbard archipelago , between Norway and the North Pole .
Other recent visitors to Mull from the high Arctic have included a bearded seal and two northern bottle - nosed whales .
The public have been warned not to approach the polar bear if they see it , as it may be hungry after its long journey .

Apparently , CNN does n't care about being the most relevant name in news anymore , they only want to be the new Fox News at any cost .
Mediaite is reporting that CNN sent secret emails to Right Wing Bloggers to express their support for the Tea - baggers ' cause .
Mediaite 's Tommy Christopher took a look at this story after Crooks and Liars wondered why CNN was " pimping " the Great American " Tea Party Express PR and Propaganda Tour . "
According to Christopher , conservative Newsbusters ' post , with an email from CNN , seems to confirm elements of liberal Crooks and Liars ‘ thesis , or at the very least , that CNN is trying to have it both ways .
Since , then , Newsbusters has removed the email in question .
In the post , Newsbusters credits CNN for what it considers to be " one of the first to offer fair coverage of the Tea Party movement outside of Fox News " .
Mediaite found some quotes from emails sent by CNN's PR department to a list of right wing bloggers .
Here what CNN , reportedly , sent to Michelle Malkin :
" Hi there , I thought this might be an interesting post for you - a behind - the - scenes piece about the Tea Party and how the stereotypes do n’t tell the full story .
Let me know if you need anything else ! "
In their email sent to Brent Bozell of Newsbusters parent Media Research Center , CNN seems to bash the Left in order to prove their support for the teabaggers :
" Clearly our critics from the left do n’t think we should be covering the Tea Party movement in the way we are and clearly CNN thinks it ’s a legitimate and important story .
If anyone from Newsbusters is interested in this angle – let me know . "
Maybe CNN should have kept focusing on their twitter thing or their magic map instead of becoming a real joke .
CNN had the choice to be the BBC of the United States letting MSNBC and FOX News with their partisan and biased views .
But look like CNN rather be Fox News than BBC

Will the Kentucky Derby end the Republican filibuster of FinReg ?
Word is that the Democrats might make the Republicans actually filibuster FinReg tonight .
That is to say , stand on the floor and talk and talk and talk .
And if the Democrats are serious about forcing the Republicans to really filibuster the bill , this is the right week for it :
The Kentucky Derby starts Friday , and Kentucky 's senior senator , Mitch McConnell , would surely prefer to attend .
Given that his members are already talking about breaking ranks , McConnell may find himself eager to get this kabuki dance over with a little bit early .

The World Health Organization has recently released the results of health surveys taken between 2000 and 2008 on world obesity , and the news is n’t pretty .
Since obesity rates can be an indicator of a nation ’s nutritional trends , health and culture , we thought it might be useful information for the expat to know .
Here are the 10 fattest countries of the last decade :
(1) American Samoa , 93.5 % ( of the population that is overweight )
It ’s a staggering number .
Many Pacific
Island nations have had trouble with weight in modern times mostly because they have abandoned their traditional foods for cheap , easily attained processed foods from the West .
Perhaps no other Pacific Island has had such access to these habits as American Samoa .
(2) Kiribati , 81.5 %
Like American Samoa , Kiribati has been flooded with processed foods like Spam and mutton flaps ( fatty sheep scraps ) , often sold at lower prices than native food .
(3) U.S.A. , 66.7 %
Well , the U.S.A. does n’t top the list , but it ’s close , and it falls behind only a small islands nation and one of its own unincorporated territories .
The United States of Processed food , high fructose corn syrup and fast food has been high on this list over the last half century .
(4) Germany , 66.5 %
The fattest country in Europe no doubt owes their portly woes to lots of beer , fatty foods and inactivity .
(5) Egypt , 66 %
Obesity among Egyptian women is particularly high , often attributed to cultural taboos on women exercising or playing sports .
(6) Bosnia - Herzegovina , 62.9 %
Once considered a problem only in high - income countries , obesity is dramatically on the rise in low - and middle - income countries like Bosnia - Herzegovina , where smoking , drinking and eating unhealthy foods spiked during the war that ravaged the country from 1992 to 1995 .
(7) New Zealand , 62.7 %
Obesity is a growing concern for New Zealand .
While its native Maori have struggled with weight due to loss of traditional culture like other Pacific Islanders – they are mostly just a scapegoat .
New Zealand ’s entire population is getting fatter at a rapidly increased rate .
(8) Israel , 61.9 %
In the past 30 years , the number of obese Israelis has tripled , evidence the country is truly part of the Western world .
(9 ) Croatia , 61.4 %
Croatia , where cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death , is also a victim of the globalization of the food market , which tends to suppress traditional diets as cheaper processed foods from the U.S. and Europe flood store shelves .
( 10 ) United Kingdom , 61 %
A recent survey ranked Brits among the bottom third of European nations in physical exercise , leading Health Secretary Andy Burnham to comment , “ We ’re really in danger of being known as the best in the world for watching sport , but one of the worst for getting out there and doing it for ourselves . ”

TOKYO , Japan —
In the coming days , a fleet of Japanese ships will return from the Antarctic Ocean laden with a controversial cargo of whale meat — the spoils of a four - month “ lethal research ” expedition condemned by conservationists and even Japan ’s closest trading partners and allies .
Foreign media criticism and harassment from activists have frustrated the fleet in recent years , but it has n’t stopped it from conducting what Japan believes is its inalienable right to maintain a 400 - year - old tradition of killing and eating whales .
Japan ’s persistence in the face of international opposition is a mystery to many .
Diplomatically and financially it has nothing to gain by exploiting a loophole in the International Whaling Commission ’s 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling that allows it to kill about 1,000 whales every winter .
It is clear that the fleet is not satisfying a popular appetite for whale meat back home .
While some older Japanese look back fondly on a time , from the late 1940s to the early 1960s , when the meat was served in school lunches , most younger people wonder why anyone would prefer the chewy , oily flesh over chicken , pork and beef .
According to a 2008 survey by the Nippon Research Center , 95 percent of Japanese either consume whale meat very rarely or never at all .
Annual per capita consumption now amounts to no more than four slices of sashimi a year .
The result is a growing stockpile that has prompted the reintroduction of whale meat into the school lunch system in several parts of Japan .
While industry supporters talk of a national culture of whale consumption , the meat is eaten regularly only in a handful of coastal villages with strong historical links to the industry .
These communities , including Wada , on Japan ’s Pacific coast , are permitted by the agriculture ministry to catch a certain number of smaller whales not covered by the IWC ban , despite fears over high levels of dioxin , mercury and other toxins .
The catch is of limited economic value to local people , but forms a pivotal part of a campaign to save traditions under attack from what some call Western culinary imperialism .
In fact , large - scale whaling in distant oceans began only after the U.S. Gen .
Douglas MacArthur , who led the postwar occupation of Japan , identified whale meat as a cheap source of protein for an impoverished and hungry nation .
“ Whale meat saved Japanese people from starvation during the food shortage after the war , ” said Konomu Kubo of the Japan Whaling Association .
“ We believe whale meat was a source of vitality and enabled Japan to achieve high economic growth after the war and become a major economic power . ”
Jun Morikawa , a professor at Rakuno Gakuen University in Sapporo , is one of few Japanese to have openly challenged the belief that whale consumption is an important part of the country ’s cultural heritage .
Instead , he points to collusion between Fisheries Agency bureaucrats and politicians representing coastal communities with a vested interest in promoting a loss - making industry that also comes with enormous environmental and diplomatic costs .
“ They are like a fishing industry tribe , ” said Morikawa , author of " Whaling in Japan : Power Politics and Diplomacy . "
" Japan ’s whaling policy is determined , executed and assessed by a small governing elite .
The whaling industry is not financially viable .
Its job is to spread pro-whaling propaganda and manipulate public opinion so that people think that eating whale meat is part of our national culture . "
As the IWC prepares to meet in Morocco in June , Japan , which has never come close to the two - thirds majority it needs to overturn the commercial whaling ban , is looking for new ways to keep its controversial fleet active .
Among the proposals now under discussion is one that would allow Japan , Norway and Iceland to conduct limited commercial whaling in return for a huge cut in the size of the current “ scientific ” catch .
Pro-whaling officials blame the moratorium for the artificially high prices that prevent whale meat from re-establishing itself as a key part of the Japanese diet .
“ Although current supply of whale meat is just 2 percent of what it was 40 years ago our unique dietary patterns and diet culture are still ingrained in various regions , ” said Kubo .
“ It is not true that young people do n’t eat whale meat because they do not like its taste .
When we organize special classes at schools , most of the children , who ate whale meat for the first time , said they liked it . ”
Despite the damage whaling inflicts on Japan ’s international standing , its fate could be determined not by backroom deals at the IWC but by shifting attitudes at home .
Morikawa hopes that Japan ’s progressive government , which took office last autumn , will “ consider ending research whaling and at the very least promote a public debate on the issue . ”
It is a debate he believes the power brokers in the whaling industry would lose : “ Young Japanese people would rather watch whales than eat them .
They ’re more interested in protecting wildlife than in destroying it . ”
The brontosaurus is an interesting creature : a curious mix of ambition , poor scientific methods and a part of the “ bone wars ” of the late 19th century .
It could be described as a mythical beast with the body of one dinosaur and the head of another .
Alternatively , it could be said to have resulted from the hasty misidentification of an incomplete skeleton .
Although the name is still in popular use , the vast majority of paleontologists believe this particular dinosaur never existed as such : it was simply another specimen of an already known animal .
For a long time , the most complete exhibit was in fact an Apatosaurus body with a Camarasaurus head .
The " brontosaurus " presented on a US postage stamp .
The Bone Wars
During the 1870s and 1880s , a bitter rivalry existed between two paleontologists , Othniel C. Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope , which became known as the “ bone wars . ”
A number of incidents seem to have contributed to the enmity between the two .
For example , it was alleged that Marsh had paid some of Cope ’s workers to send the bones they had dug up to him instead of to their employer .
On another occasion , Marsh publicly humiliated Cope when the latter mistakenly attached the skull of a fossilized marine reptile to its tail instead of its neck .
It was against this background that the confusion regarding the Apatosaurus and the “ Brontosaurus ” arose .
For many years , the most complete fossilized brontosaurus display was actually an Apatosaurus with a Camarasaurus head .
The “ Discovery ” of the Brontosaurus
In their haste to claim new discoveries , both men could be careless in their methods , often basing their claims on very limited evidence and sometimes lumping together bones from different animals .
In 1877 , Marsh , on the basis of a few vertebrae and a pelvis , identified a new dinosaur , which he named Apatosaurus .
It was a large sauropod — a four legged animal with a long neck and a long , tapering tail .
Two years later , he examined another incomplete sauropod skeleton and declared it to be new dinosaur , which he named “ Brontosaurus , ” meaning “ thunder lizard . ”
In 1883 , most of the remainder of this skeleton was found and Marsh was able to piece together an almost complete reconstruction .
The skull , however , was missing .
Ironically echoing Cope ’s earlier mistake , he completed the skeleton by attaching the skull of another dinosaur , Camarasaurus .
This error , though suspected for some time , was not confirmed until the 1970s .
To be fair to Marsh , it was a common practice to use parts of similar dinosaurs to fill in missing pieces in a skeleton for public display .
A comparison of the Apatosaurus and “ thunder lizard ” skeletons by the paleontologist Elmer Riggs in 1903 concluded that they were the same dinosaur .
Since the name “ Apatosaurus ” had been given first , it had to take precedence and “ Brontosaurus ” became redundant in scientific terms .
Once the skeleton went on display , however , it caught the public imagination in a way that the Apatosaurus had not .
It continued to appear with the no longer accurate name in books on dinosaurs at least until the 1970s and featured in numerous movies and cartoons .
The Apatosaurus
The idea of an enormous , herbivorous dinosaur that once walked the earth did not die with the brontosaurus .
The Apatosaurus was an amazingly large beast and it was a herbivore .
It grew up to 75 feet ( 23 m ) in length and may have weighed more than 20 tons .
An average sized human would have reached just a bit above its knee .
The main reason for Marsh ’s misidentification of the skeleton is that the second finding had more vertebrae .
This suggested a different dinosaur ; however , it was later established that , as these dinosaurs grew , some of the vertebrae fused together .
It seems that Marsh had simply found a younger example .
The dinosaur formerly known as brontosaurus was certainly real — it just had the wrong name and the wrong head .
The main difference is that the head of the Apatosaurus was narrower , slightly longer in the snout and smaller than that of the heavy - jawed Camarasaur .
If Marsh had used the term “ brontosaurus ” for his first sauropod discovery , the name would have been scientifically valid and might have been more appropriate .
A computer simulation has suggested that the dinosaur may have been able to make a thunderous noise — possibly reaching 200 decibels — by cracking its tail like a whip .
The Thunder Lizard Lives On
This huge , arguably fictional , dinosaur lives on in the popular imagination and continues to be referred to as “ real . ”
A well - known spell checker , for example , recognizes brontosaurus , but not the names of the two creatures that made up the original exhibit .
All this is in spite of the fact that museums in the US have now corrected their displays .
At least one prominent paleontologist , however , believes that the skeleton of Marsh ’s thunder lizard is sufficiently different from that of Apatosaurus for it to be considered a dinosaur in its own right .
Another skeleton formerly regarded as a type of Apatosaurus has now been recognized as a different dinosaur and named Eobrontosaurus , meaning “ dawn thunder lizard . ”
There is one place where a brontosaurus exhibit can still be seen , as of 2013 : Othniel C. Marsh ’s original reconstruction , albeit with a new skull , is on display at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History .
As it forms a part of a historical record , it is labeled “ Brontosaurus . ”
I ’ve always had a special place in my heart for Star Wars - themed art .
Yes , I know , this should n’t really come as a surprise to anyone here , I am a geek after all !
So when Geeks are Sexy reader Amanda contacted me to let me know about one of her friend ’s art , I eagerly clicked on her link , and let me tell you , I really , really liked what I saw .
James Hance is a Jacksonville - based artist who takes his inspiration from television shows and movies from his childhood to create some of the best paintings I ’ve seen in a long time .
When I asked James about what medium he uses and where he takes his inspiration for his paintings , here ’s what he replied :
I paint in acrylics , mainly on wood board .
I pick up well - loved and slightly sorry looking frames from thrift stores and the like as I feel they sometimes offer just as much character to the painting as the painting itself . :)
I ’m inspired by television and movies from my childhood .
It ’s funny how you watch some of those things today and wonder why you were so obsessed with them at the time .
I remember the Fonz being SO much cooler than he actually was .
My paintings are basically just placards screaming ‘ Childhood !
It was amazing !
I want it forever , please ! ’
I paint mainly in my pajamas , watching the Muppet Show and eating cereal .
I ’d like to think it shows .
Painting in your pajamas while watching the Muppet Show and eating cereal ?
That sure sounds like fun , James , and as far as I ’m concerned , yes , it does show .
Here are a few more of James ’ paintings ( posted with permission ) , for your viewing enjoyment .

Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) , the poster child of liberal bloggers ’ ire , has done it again .
Once the darling of Democratic political heavyweights — he campaigned in 2000 as the vice presidential running mate of then - Vice President Al Gore — the Connecticut senator now appears to enjoying sparring his his former party at every opportunity .
Lieberman became an independent during his 2006 campaign , in which he faced off with liberal millionaire Ned Lamont .
Liberal bloggers largely supported Lamont .
ADVERTISEMENT
Since then , Lieberman has nettled those in his former party for his continual overtures to Republicans .
Recently , he said he would n’t rule out running as a Republican in his 2012 Senate race .
But in a Newsmax interview published Monday , he took himself one step further toward the party he once campaigned to defeat .
“ There were a lot of people , particularly Democrats , who were declaring after the 2008 election that we were beginning a period of Democratic dominance that would go on for decades , ” Lieberman told Newsmax .
“ Now , all of a sudden , the momentum is with the Republicans .
And that ’s Ã¢â‚¬â€ thank God Ã¢â‚¬â€ that ’s the way people have spoken , you know ?
That ’s our democracy . ”
The senator also said that “ everybody should listen ” to former Alaska governor Sarah Palin .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I think Sarah Palin for a lot of people has become a spokesperson , ” Lieberman said .
“ People worried that government has forgotten them , has grown too big , that the deficit is growing too large , and in some sense that weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re not being as strong as we should be in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€  Governor Palin has spoken to those concerns as much as anyone .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I do disagree with her on some of the specifics that she has said , but I think anybody who underestimates Sarah Palin as a political force in America does so at some peril , because she is speaking for a lot of people out there , ” he continued .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t know what her future is , but IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m just saying everybody should listen .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Lieberman was speaking in an interview that largely focused on US foreign policy regarding Israel and Iran .
The onetime Democrat has repeatedly urged the US to take a hawkish position against Iranian development of nuclear weapons , and consider an armed airstrike to halt nuclear enrichment .
It just seems more and more problems have been deriving out of Infinity Ward ’s decision to neglect dedicated server support and their last minute plan P2P announcement with IW .
net .
Gamers has been complaining that IW .
net leads to threats from termination from their ISPs for “ running servers on their home connection ” and “ excessive file sharing through peer to peer connections . ”
I am by no means an ISP security expert but I believe you have got to spend a whole lot of time playing to bring up that red flag .
Several gamers have been downgraded to dial - up or spend hectic phone conversations explaining the dilemma to their ISPs , some even faced higher phone bill charges .
IW . net forces a good portion of MW2 players to violate the terms of most ISP providers as you can see here .
I am curious , any of our readers have this issue yet ?
I received a letter from time - warner cable which I would type out but it would take me 20 minutes .
the letter basically says that they think I have a virus thats sending / receiving information . ” when computers that are connected to the network become infected with viruses and other intrusions , serious problems can arise , such as degradation of network performance and he infection of other users ”
It directs to link for virus removal .
I can assure you I do not have a virus as I did a fresh install of windows 7 the day before mw2 came out .
I dont open any emails , and really the only thing I do on that computer is play games .
Its my gaming computer , I use my laptop for everything else and I know 100 % I do not have a virus nor have I had .
They say “ We ask you to bear in mind that continued violations of the road runner acceptable use policy can result in suspension or even termination of your road runner account ”
This is complete and utter bull crap .
Thanks Infinity Ward / Activision for nearly getting my internet shutoff .
Im done with this game .

I got a call from my ISP saying this :
Dear Customer
It has come to our attention that you are running servers on your home connection .
While this is not allowed , we inform you that measurements can be taken when continuos usage .
We regret to inform you that hosting servers at your home connection is not allowed , we have special packages for server connections .
Now this is translated from my native language , I had to call up my ISP and tell them the problem .
This is a serious problem , IW is just using your computer to host the games .
I work as a network admin myself and had to explain myself to my ISP why this is happening .
Most of the times i’m leaving games that i’m hosting because i do n’t want my connection to be used as gameserver .
IW fails to see that UPnP and a open NAT is dangerous to your network .

i’ve already gotten a mail from my isp telling me they are reducing my 20 meg line to dial up speed for the next month for “ excessive file sharing through peer to peer connections ” and i will be cut off if i persist .
tried telling them that its a pc game thats causing it , their reply is pc games do not use p2

TUCSON , Arizona —
It is eerie and ugly , coming home to a state of the union that now incites cops to roust fourth - generation Americans on the simple evidence of a suntan .
That smacks of what evil empires do .
Arizona is not yet Azerbaijan but neither is it , any longer , the big - hearted Mexican - accented place I loved to say I was from .
“ Oh right , ” a friend remarked the other day in New York , “ the hate state . ”
A new guilty - until - proven - innocent law allows police to detain anyone on the mere suspicion of having sneaked across the Mexican border .
The irony rankles .
Many Mexican - Americans who now must fear any law officer in a bad mood have family roots far deeper than Arizona ’s 1912 statehood .
Most people who want them gone are relative newcomers .
True enough , illegal immigration from Mexico is a problem , and so is drug trafficking .
But building barriers , physical or psychic , only brings on worse crises and undermines what America represents .
For an Arizonan - at - heart like me , this is personal .
My father ended up here from a different direction , welcomed at Ellis Island by that towering statue that is supposed to define us .
Arizona ’s new law led the news on Al Jazeera .
It is the butt of bitter jokes across Europe .
People are losing their last shreds of faith in the nation that once symbolized liberty and tolerance .
Who can blame them ?
Ronald Reagan earned his place in history by thundering : “ Mr. Gorbachev , tear down that wall . ”
Now his spiritual heirs want to put it back up in Arizona .
Gov. Jan Brewer assures that this is not about racial profiling .
Everyone , dark or light , needs identity papers to produce for no particular reason .
Remember those old Nazi films ?
“ Vos papiers ! ”
Nations must patrol their borders and enforce their laws .
But when they target broad ethnic groups , or generalized categories , they venture dangerously close to what we have fought wars to thwart .
This closing of the Arizonan mind comes simultaneously with ecological peril : the squandering of scarce water and the relentless bulldozing of the dramatic Sonora desert landscape found nowhere else .
In Massachusetts , I visited Alan Weisman , whose best - selling “ The World Without Us ” looks hard at such things .
Fed up with Arizona ’s changing face , a while back , he sold his Tucson house and burrowed into the Berkshires .
When people are fearful , Weisman says , they tend towards easy — and invariably wrong — measures .
They give authorities license to attack obvious surface symptoms while the underlying causes fester .
The recent murder of a rancher on the border sparked exactly this response : buy more guns , round up the usual suspects and slam the door .
But that only swells the ranks of desperados with nothing to lose .
We would do better to understand the problems we are trying to solve .
For starters , we ought to consider the human realities .
Broad stereotypes are as unhelpful as they are ignorant .
“ Mexicans , ” no one should be surprised to learn , include a whole lot of hard - working , law - abiding folks with family values who hate drugs and crime .
Some , fabulously rich , could put gringos to work .
Plenty of others can enrich America ’s intellectual capital .
But if some are drawn north by choice , illegal immigration is far more of a push than a pull .
In part because of U.S. policies , Mexico has lost much of its arable land .
Young people , less rooted in old traditions , want a better life than near slavery in a border manufacturing plant .
For many , those harrowing trips across the border are acts of desperation to feed hungry families .
Sensibly designed aid programs would allow them to stay home , earn incomes and buy American exports .
Drug trafficking is a separate issue , and hapless Mexicans along the border suffer from it more than Americans .
Decriminalizing the small stuff would free lawmen to go after gang leaders at the top .
As policy debates rage on , we might stop to reflect on what is at risk .
As anyone with Arizona bloodlines can tell you , it is a lot .
I only got here when I was 3 .
My father , who escaped Bolshevik Russia and went to Wisconsin , discovered Tucson in 1946 .
He ran El Tampico
Bar in the heart of the old town , a cluster of Mexican barrios .
Arizona was sun-baked and laid back , a land of gorgeous gorges , Indian lore and green corn tamales .
In Tucson , the people who wore guns could mostly shoot straight .
In the 1970s , developers tore down the mud wall and the Spanish - style plaza of the oldest continually settled city in North America .
Water wasters dried up the Santa Cruz River , killing the cottonwoods .
By then I was living in Paris , in awe at how careful planning could add in so much of modern times and so many different cultures yet still preserve the soul of a 2,000 - year - old city .
Until only recently , French friends sought my advice on travel to Arizona .
For them , “ Weet Ehrp , ” the legendary Tombstone marshal , ranked up there with Asterix le Gaulois as a folklore hero .
These days , the Arizona lawman they picture is a swaggering bully in Maricopa County , a sheriff who crows that the new immigration law will allow him freedom to get serious .
And not many plan to visit .
Stop .
Before you eat that honey mustard onion pretzel , did you know it could make you sick ?
Do n’t put it in the onion dip , either , because that may also give you food poisoning .
On March 4 , the Food and Drug Administration announced a recall of hydrolyzed vegetable protein ( HVP ) .
The federal agency , on a tip from a consumer , tested the HVP produced by Las Vegas - based Basic Food Flavors , Inc. and found a strain of salmonella .
Salmonella is a bacteria typically found in feces , and not food , and is the most common cause of food poisoning in the United States .
The FDA told peoplesworld .org it has n’t pinpointed the source of the contamination and its investigation is ongoing .
The president of Truth in Labeling , Jack Samuels , who has spent 19 - years investigating the food industry and its use of monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) , said the bacteria could have been introduced in any number of ways , from the handling of the materials to being on the soy , corn or wheat when it came to the factory .
The recall has far - reaching consequences because HVP is basically in every processed food in the country .
This paste or powder product is added to everything from soups , sauces , chilis , stews , hot dogs , gravies to seasoned snack foods , dips and dressings .
It is processed corn , soy or wheat with acid and is added to foods to “ enhance ” the flavor .
Dozens of big name companies have already started to recall their products , including McCormick , Pringles , National Pretzel , Herbox ( boullion ) , Quaker , Safeway and CVS snack products .
Many , including the FDA , are already predicting that this could lead to the biggest food recall in North America .
It could take months before food manufacturers figure out if the recalled HVP is even in their products .
Experts say this is due to a weak tracking system for such a common ingredient .
Best Food Flavors has a list of close to 800 HVP products recalled .
To date , there have been no reports of illness .
Salmonella could be killed in the cooking process but many of the food products that have HVP are uncooked and “ ready - to - eat . ”
Best Food Flavors , Inc. distributes HVP internationally , and recalls are underway in Canada .
Inquiries to Europe , South America and the Middle East were not answered .
But a spokesperson for the FDA said the agency contacts its partners in each country regarding recalls .
The name , hydrolyzed vegetable protein , rarely appears on food labels .
Instead , consumers may see “ hydrolyzed corn protein ” or “ hydrolyzed soy protein . ”
It is also mixed with spices and identified simply as “ natural smoke flavor ” or “ natural flavors . ”
Not only does HVP enhance flavors of food , it enhances the food shelf life and the food industry ’s bottom line .
“ In the food industry , the word ‘ natural ’ is meaningless , ” Samuels said .
They have turned Webster on its head , he said .
“ As long as something is started in nature , no matter what is done to it , it can be called natural . ”
Samuels , and other food industry watchdogs , are hoping the recall brings a renewed scrutiny to the weak regulatory food system .
For Samuels the attention the recall has brought to HVP , which he says is also linked to MSG , carcinogens and genotoxins , could bring scrutiny to this little regulated industry .
“ Flavor and flavoring are considered proprietary .
And for the first time , in my experience , the FDA has admitted HVP is a ‘ flavor enhancer . ' ”
MakeOurFoodSafe.org , a coalition of public health organizations that includes American Public Health Association and Center for Science in Public Interest , urges the public to send a message to the Senate to pass food safety reform legislation that has languished in that body since the House passed its version in July 2009 .
According to the group , one in four Americans will get sick from contaminated food this year and 5,000 will die !

Tomorrow 's weather can be determined ( over ) simply by looking at what the weather 's like wherever the wind is blowing from .
Figuring out what the weather will be in space follows the same basic principle : look at what the Sun is doing now , and you 'll get a sense of what will happen to the Earth in the near future .
Predicting what the Sun is doing or is going to do , however , is a much more complicated problem than standard terrestrial weather prediction .
I have heard it said that the space weather prediction capabilities of today are about 30 to 40 years behind the capabilities of the weather forecast on the local news .
To help us understand space weather and climate , NASA recently launched the Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO ) .
The Sun is an incredibly complex physical environment , one where gravity , pressure , fusion reactions , plasma physics , and multiple complicated magnetic fields come together to form a highly dynamic system .
A system that , in a fraction of a second , can burp off an arc of material greater than the entire mass of Earth .
To study it , the SDO has been placed in a geosyncronous orbit above a dedicated ground receiving station in New Mexico .
Its trio of instruments are capable of taking images of the Sun with a resolution 10 times that of an HDTV , streaming over 1GB of data down to Earth every minute .
The main scientific goals of the SDO focus on how and why the Sun 's magnetic field changes , how energy is stored in the magnetic field , and , ultimately , how it is released into geospace .
With an understanding of the physical dynamics of the Sun itself , the information can be used to more accurately predict space weather .
Those predictions have big implications for the equipment that we have parked up there , and for the representatives of humanity who temporarily reside in space .
According to NASA , there are seven specific scientific questions that the SDO Project seeks to answer :
What drives the 11 - year
cycle of solar activity ?
How is magnetic flux created
and transported across the solar surface ?
How does the breaking and
reconnection of magnetic field lines affect the overall magnetic field
and affect the outer reaches of the solar atmosphere ?
Where do variations in the
Sun 's extreme ultraviolet brightness come from and are they linked to
the magnetic field ?
What magnetic field events
lead to coronal mass ejections ?
Can the solar wind that
reaches Earth be predicted based on the magnetic field and near the Sun 's atmosphere ?
When will activity occur ,
and is it possible to make accurate and reliable forecasts of space
weather and climate ?
The SDO has three primary instruments for carrying out its science mission .
The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager ( HMI ) will primarily be used to try to track internal solar processes by studying what goes on at the surface of the Sun .
Unlike the Earth , which has a relatively easy - to - describe magnetic field , the sun has countless magnetic fields that help drive solar flares , sunquakes , and a wide variety of other solar phenomena .
HMI 's job will be to monitor the magnetic fields found on the surface of the Sun .
It is hoped that a more detailed understanding of the magnetic fields on the surface will provide clues into the inner workings of the star .
Next up is the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly ( AIA ) .
Its primary role will be to image the solar corona — the outer layer of the Sun 's atmosphere .
Within the corona itself , temperatures can range from a relatively cool 20,000 K to a scorching 20,000,000K .
The instrument will be capable of following solar mass ejections from their origin as microinstabilities where surface magnetic fields reconfigure , and track them as they grow into the largest explosions in the solar system .
Mass ejections can send millions of tons of charged material streaming out into the solar system and , when they end up pointed at Earth , they cause what we experience as a solar storm .
The four telescopes that make up AIA will provide eight full - Sun images every ten seconds , twenty - four hours a day , seven days a week .
Last up is EVE , the Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment .
The Earth 's upper atmosphere completely protects us from the effects of EUVs , but also prevent us from measuring light at these wavelengths from the surface of the planet .
Solar scientists and space weather researchers are interested in why the brightness of EUVs changes when the magnetic fields of the Sun change .
Measurements from EVE will be used to help space weather observers know when a burst of EUVs are headed towards a satellite or astronaut stuck outside the protection of a spacecraft .
The SDO has a planned mission life of five years .
Hopefully , with the data gained from this mission , space weather prediction will become more modern and robust , where a solid understanding of the dynamical processes that create weather allow us to known when and how it will affect us .
The Marine Times reports that the USMC have adopted the new SOST ( Special Operations Science and Technology ) 5.56 mm ammunition …
The open - tipped rounds until now have been available only to Special Operations Command troops .
The first 200,000 5.56 mm Special Operations Science and Technology rounds are already downrange with Marine Expeditionary Brigade - Afghanistan , said Brig .
Gen. Michael Brogan , commander of Marine Corps Systems Command .
Commonly known as “ SOST ” rounds , they were legally cleared for Marine use by the Pentagon in late January , according to Navy Department documents obtained by Marine Corps Times .
SOCom developed the new rounds for use with the Special Operations Force Combat Assault Rifle , or SCAR , which needed a more accurate bullet because its short barrel , at 13.8 inches , is less than an inch shorter than the M4 carbine ’s .
Using an open - tip match round design common with some sniper ammunition , SOST rounds are designed to be “ barrier blind , ” meaning they stay on target better than existing M855 rounds after penetrating windshields , car doors and other objects .
The full name and designation of the round is the MK 318 MOD 0 “ Cartridge , Caliber 5.56 mm Ball , Carbine , Barrier ” .
The 62 grain bullet was designed by Federal / ATK .
It features an open tip with lead at the front and a thick copper base .
The lead is designed to defeat barriers and the copper to penetrate the barrier .
Trophy Bonded Bear Claw
Many have said that it closely resembles the Federal Trophy Bonded Bearclaw bullet .
Personally I think the similarities are superficial .
It should be noted that the bullet is open tip , not hollow point .
Bartholomew Roberts explains …
It is n’t a hollow point .
It is an Open - Tip Match round much like the M118LR .
The jacket is drawn from the base ( instead of the cheaper method of jacket drawn from the nose and an exposed lead base ) to the tip of the bullet .
The tiny little hole there is just a remnant from jacketing the bullet that way .
It is n’t designed for expansion or calculated to cause unnecessary suffering , so it does n’t violate the Hague conventions
The load has been optimized for ballistic performance and reduced muzzle flash from short barrels .
From a 14 ″ barrel is achieves 2925 fps .
A 7.62 mm version of this round , the MK 319 MOD 0 , has also been developed .
It also has been optimized for short barrels ( 16 ″ ) but also for reduced recoil .
I have not heard of any adoption outside the special forces .
[ Many thanks to Matt Groom and Stu C. for the info . ]
UPDATE : The Marines are not dumping the standard M855 round , but will be the SOST alongside it in situations where the SOST will be more effective .
THERE is something both innocent and exciting about a picnic , even if you are only packing a few things at the last minute and heading down the street to the park .
It may be nothing fancier than bologna or tuna salad on white bread , but you ’re still likely to have a good time , which is probably why many of us remain devoted to the same picnic foods we ’ve eaten all our lives .
But at some point , you may get the urge to vary the menu a bit .
With that in mind , I ’d like to make a few — or , actually , 101 — suggestions , ranging from snacks to dessert .
With a little shopping , a little effort , and 20 minutes or less for assembly , you can create the kind of carry - out food that will put the local prepared food shops to shame while saving you a small fortune .
No matter how faithful you are to your old favorites , I ’ll bet you will find something intriguing here .
1 BEET SALAD Peel beets and grate them ( a food processor will keep the juice contained ) .
Add pistachios or hazelnuts ; dress with orange zest and juice , and olive oil .
Add bits of goat cheese and chopped parsley .
2 PESTO CHICKEN ROLLS Season and grill chicken cutlets .
Brush lavash or any other wrap - type bread with pesto ; layer with the chicken , sun-dried tomatoes and arugula ; roll up and cut on the bias .
INNER DISK , ANDROMEDA GALAXY — Thanking the spiral - shaped celestial body for its 6.8 billion years of tireless service , Our Lord and Divine Creator announced Thursday His " very difficult decision " to close down the Andromeda galaxy for good .
" Nobody ever wants to have to do something like this , but operating Andromeda on a daily basis has grown impractical and I can't in good conscience keep it going , " God said of the incomprehensibly massive nebula , which is home to more than 1 trillion stars and an untold number of planetary objects .
" So much has changed since I brought it into being , and to be honest , it 's just not working out the way I 'd hoped . "
A spokesman for the Supreme Being issued an apology to Andromeda 's 750 quadrillion resident life - forms , who as of midnight Eastern Time on May 15 will cease to exist .

Out of this world : Hubble celebrates its 20th birthday with amazing pictures of a turbulent cosmic tower
This stunning image is not from some artist 's science fiction fantasy but was taken by Nasa 's Hubble Space Telescope .
For 20 years it has been peering into deep space and this image was released today to celebrate its birthday .
Taken earlier this year the picture captures the chaotic activity atop a three - light - year - tall pillar of gas and dust that is being eaten away by the brilliant light from nearby bright stars .
This image was released by Nasa to celebrate the Hubble 's 20th birthday .
It shows a small portion of one of the largest star - birth regions in the galaxy , the Carina Nebula .
The picture is reminiscent of Hubble 's classic image of the Eagle Nebula dubbed the ' Pillars of Creation ' .
Seen here is the top of a three - light - year - tall pillar of gas and the dust that is being eaten away by the brilliant light from nearby bright stars
These two images of Carina Nebula show observations taken in visible and in infrared light by Hubble reveal dramatically different views .
The one on the right reveals the stars behind the nebula's wall of hydrogen laced wtih dust
The pillar is also being assaulted from within , as infant stars buried inside it fire off jets of gas that can be seen streaming from towering peaks .
This turbulent cosmic pinnacle lies within a tempestuous stellar nursery called the Carina Nebula , located 7,500 light years away in the southern constellation Carina .
The image has been released by Nasa as the agency celebrates the 20th anniversary of Hubble 's launch and deployment into an orbit around Earth .
First launched on April 24 , 1990 , Hubble has since sent back to Earth a series of extraordinary images which have become some of the most iconic in the history of photography .
The image of Carina Nebula resembles this 1995 image taken by Hubble which was dubbed the ' Pillars of Creation ' and has become one of its most famous images .
Located at the heart of the Eagle Nebula , the Pillars are gaseous nurseries for newborn stars .
The largest of the three pillars in this image is about four light - years from base to tip
Hubble 's images have proved sharper than ever before over 12 months since Nasa launched a repair mission last May .
Its new suite of instruments , installed during five space walks , are more sensitive and allow it to see everything from ultraviolet light all the way to near - infrared light .
' This marks a new beginning for Hubble , ' Ed Weiler , associate administrator for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , said at the time .
' The telescope has been given an extreme makeover and is now significantly more powerful than ever . '
Nasa said the telescope should keep working until at least 2014 , when it will be replaced by a more powerful observatory to be called the James Webb Space Telescope .
The Hubble Space Telescope drifts 353 miles above at the boundary of Earth and space .
Here it can avoid the atmosphere and clearly see objects in space
Over the past few days we ’ve been playing around the latest beta release of Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 .
Many of the changes made are hard to appreciate without actually seeing the application suite in use , and for that reason alone we have assembled a massive gallery of screenshots .
On the other hand , images can be meaningless without a bit of an explanation so we ’ve put down a brief summary of our initial thoughts .
You can check them all out after the jump .
Across the board , each application has had its UI completely overhauled as Microsoft has made the wise decision to redo the entire layout of the application suite .
Instead of the awful configuration found in Office for Mac 2008 , 2011 draws from both Office 2007 and Office 2010 for Windows .
In fact , it did such a good job that we ca n’t think of a reason why someone who is used to one OS would n’t be able to jump into the other and get work done in Office .
One of the main reasons for this is Ribbons .
Microsoft has finally conceded that people do n’t like using the attractive but horribly implemented Toolbox found in previous versions of Office for Mac .
Yes , the option to use the Toolbox is still there , but it ’s no longer nearly impossible to get away without using it .
One nice thing we will say about the Toolbox is that if you ’re heavily into incorporating multimedia into your documents , the Toolbox is now fully integrated with iPhoto , iTunes , Photo Booth and Garage Band .
It works phenomenally well .
Speaking of things working , Excel finally has working support for macros .
We ca n’t even tell you how happy this makes nerds like us .
But back to Ribbons .
They just make life so much easier .
Basically every option you could ever want to use is attractively presented to you through the ribbons .
What this does is allow you to save yourself an awful lot of time navigating the menu bar , hence why Microsoft calls the Ribbon a “ Fluent User Interface ” .
Sadly there is a pretty big weak link in Office 2011 : Outlook .
It seems that Microsoft simply sacrificed brains for beauty .
Do n’t get us wrong .
It ’s definitely the best and most powerful email client we ’ve ever used on OS X , but after using it for 10 minutes we honestly gave up on it .
Why ?
Because it simply requires more work to get simple tasks done than on the Windows version .
It sucks to say it , but given the choice between using the new Outlook for Mac and virtualizing Outlook for Windows , we ’d go with the latter any day .
We ’ve got more that 50 screenshots lined up for your eyes to feast upon , so check them out , ok ?

A question of ethics : say you want a new novel bad — really bad — but you want the digital version for your Kindle / iPad / Sony Reader .
The publisher , hoping to goose sales of the book in hardcover for $ 28 , is n't about to offer a $ 10 e- book version until the novel comes out in paperback .
So you buy the hardcover and then pirate a homebrew e-book , which someone has helpfully made available in one of the darker corners of the Internet .
Should you be fitted for an eye patch and peg leg ?
As a matter of law , you probably are a pirate ( or , to be accurate , an infringer ) .
But the interesting question is n't one of law , it 's one of ethics , and New York Times syndicated columnist Randy Cohen tackled the conundrum in last week 's " The Ethicist " column .
His answer might surprise you , appearing as it does in the pages and on the websites of newspapers , which are so concerned about piracy that many are lobbying for a new federal " hot news " law .
" An illegal download is — to use an ugly word — illegal .
But in this case , it is not unethical , " writes Cohen .
" Author and publisher are entitled to be paid for their work , and by purchasing the hardcover , you did so .
Your subsequent downloading is akin to buying a CD , then copying it to your iPod .
" Buying a book or a piece of music should be regarded as a license to enjoy it on any platform .
Sadly , the anachronistic conventions of bookselling and copyright law lag the technology .
Thus you ’ve violated the publishing company ’s legal right to control the distribution of its intellectual property , but you ’ve done no harm or so little as to meet my threshold of acceptability . "
Shifting gears
The question is one about the limits of format shifting .
Is it the case that purchasing any piece of intellectual property entitles you , as a matter of morality if not quite of law , to shift those words or sounds or images to computers , iPods , smartphones , and e-book readers ?
To put it another way : once you purchase a song or a book or a movie , do you have perpetual rights to that content , digitally shifting it from one device to another , never needing to rebuy all your stuff in order to have it in some new format ?
Publishers are aghast at the idea as extended to books , though to consumers , it sounds pretty wonderful .
Imagine that you had some way of verifying that you owned each item in your personal library , and that you could then download a digital copy of all those books for free through Google Books .
Wonderful — and certainly a spur to the hardware vendors like Apple and Amazon and Sony .
But not so terrific for publishers .
The site Mediabistro collected a few complaints about Cohen 's column from its book - business readers .
" So , if you own the hardcover you should get the paperback for free ?
Different platform , right ? " said one .
A moment 's thought makes clear the confusion underlying this rejoinder ; paperbacks cost the publisher money to design and print and store and ship .
Homemade e-books do not .
Another complained that audiobooks were a different thing from the printed word ( the original column does n't mention audiobooks at all , but e-books ) .
Another argued that the pirating was fine , so long as the reader eventually paid for the legal e-book once it was available .
" [ Cohen ] is basically stating , ' Hey , you paid for the words , period , no matter their packaging . '
I can't agree with that . "
We actually think that giving away a free e-book version of hardcover books is a superb idea .
Many of us at Ars are wedded to our dead tree book collection and leery of having only an e-book , what with the DRM , the limitations on resale , and the like .
But the convenience can't be beat .
Offering both for the same price would spur hardcover sales ( which make more than paperbacks ) while still providing the convenience readers want .
But publishers do n't want to devalue the e-book , and both our suggestion and Cohen 's casuistry can be seen as committing this cardinal sin .
The worry is that the public comes to see e-books as being worth nothing ; they are an add - on , a freebie offered with something else .
As books migrate increasingly to digital formats , this is a dangerous feeling to encourage .
Still , we can't help wondering if Cohen has a point here .
If transferring content from a CD to a computer is acceptable , then would it not be acceptable to spend two weeks typing a newly acquired book into your word processor ?
And if so , why not just cut out all the work and download the e-book ?
This is the same as asking : if I paid for a CD , can I just grab those songs from a P2P network instead of ripping them to my machine ?
If this were about buying a DVD of Finding Nemo and then grabbing a Blu-ray P2P rip a couple years later , that would be one thing ; the two really are different versions of the same film , and buying the DVD would not seem to entitle you to the Blu-ray .
Likewise , paying for a movie ticket in the theater does n't make it ethically allowable to go home and grab a camcorder rip from P2P networks .
But this example is different : identical textual copies in electronic form , both designed to offer the same private reading experience .
Are these not , in essence , identical in all the ways that matter ?
Given the industry 's worries about actual piracy , the kind where people do n't pay the publishers a cent , such format - shifting probably is n't high on the list of worries that keep publishing execs up at night .
It 's a complicated debate .
Say that the e-book version you download is not one that some poor sap with a scanner cooked up on his own , but is in fact the official version from the author or publisher .
Yes , you have the same words , but you 've only paid for the one object ( the book ) , while the e-book took time and resources to prepare , even if distribution is dirt cheap .
Assuming that the Ars Hive Mind had the chance to instruct the world in the digital ethics around format shifting , what would it say ?
At Guide Dogs for the Blind in San Rafael , a career - change dog refers to a dog in training that does n't qualify to continue as a guide dog .
Medical issues can intervene and behavioral issues or personality types might make the dog better suited for search and rescue , pet therapy , cancer detection or hearing - dog training .
What makes Morry Anne Angell 's career - change dog extra special is that 8 - year - old Chapin is himself totally blind .
Chapin started life as a Guide Dog puppy , but by the time he was 1 1/ 2 years old , his puppy raiser realized that the frisky yellow Labrador was n't suited for the job .
So Chapin was adopted by a family .
However , when he was 3 1/ 2 years old , he was diagnosed with glaucoma in his left eye .
His guardians made sure their dog received the utmost in medical care , which included outfitting Chapin with a prosthetic eyeball - a rubber ball implanted in the eye , leaving the exterior ( cornea ) of the eye untouched .
Shortly after he lost his first eye , his other eye was diagnosed with glaucoma as well .
His devastated guardians were told it was only a matter of time before their dog would be completely blind .
They made the painful decision to return Chapin to Guide Dogs .
His guardians were truly saddened , but overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for a completely blind dog .
This is when Chapin entered our lives .
As foster care volunteers , my husband , Randall Dunn , and I fostered Chapin while Guide Dogs ' Placement Department searched for a new adoptive home .
But the prospects were slim .
Not many people want to take a chance on a young , active and soon - to - be - blind dog .
In anticipation of pending blindness , Randall and I started playing blindfold games so Chapin could learn how to navigate without sight , a skill he quickly mastered .
The longer he stayed in our home , the more apparent it became that this was one phenomenal dog who would n't let a little thing like blindness slow him down .
And in our hearts Randall and I knew :
We were the family Chapin was meant to have .
After several months we adopted Chapin .
The very morning that we completed the paperwork was the morning that he lost all the sight in his remaining eye .
We like to think that somehow he knew that he had a permanent home , and it was OK to let that eyeball go .
He was fitted with a second prosthetic eye to match his first and , as we suspected , blindness did n't slow his stride one bit .
Today Chapin is a total trouper treated no differently than any other dog :
The only notable difference is the protective " doggles " he wears on hikes in case he bumps into anything sharp .
But he 's always there by our side , hiking , swimming , sailing and rafting .
From backpacking treks to cross-country ski trips , a little inconvenience like blindness wo n't keep Chapin from joining in our family fun .

[ Adobe would like me to make it clear that the opinions below are not the official views of the company and are entirely my own . ]
By now you have surely heard about the new iPhone 4.0 SDK language that appears to make creating applications in any non-Apple - approved languages a violation of terms .
Obviously Adobe is looking into this wording carefully so I will not comment any further until there is an official conclusion .
[ Sentence regarding Apple ’s intentions redacted at request from Adobe ] .
This has nothing to do whatsoever with bringing the Flash player to Apple ’s devices .
That is a separate discussion entirely .
What they are saying is that they wo n’t allow applications onto their marketplace solely because of what language was originally used to create them .
This is a frightening move that has no rational defense other than wanting tyrannical control over developers and more importantly , wanting to use developers as pawns in their crusade against Adobe .
This does not just affect Adobe but also other technologies like Unity3D .
I am positive that there are a large number of Apple employees that strongly disagree with this latest move .
Any real developer would not in good conscience be able to support this .
The trouble is that we will never hear their discontent because Apple employees are forbidden from blogging , posting to social networks , or other things that we at companies with an open culture take for granted .
Adobe and Apple has had a long relationship and each has helped the other get where they are today .
The fact that Apple would make such a hostile and despicable move like this clearly shows the difference between our two companies .
All we want is to provide creative professionals an avenue to deploy their work to as many devices as possible .
We are not looking to kill anything or anyone .
This would be like us putting something in our SDK to make it impossible for 3rd - party editors like FDT to work with our platform .
I can tell you that we would n’t even think or consider something like that .
Many of Adobe ’s supporters have mentioned that we should discontinue the Creative Suite products on OS X as a form of retaliation .
Again , this is something that Adobe would never consider in a million years .
We are not looking to abuse our loyal users and make them pawns for the sake of trying to hurt another company .
What is clear is that Apple most definitely would do that sort of thing as is evidenced by their recent behavior .
Personally I will not be giving Apple another cent of my money until there is a leadership change over there .
I ’ve already moved most of my book , music , and video purchases to Amazon and I will continue to look elsewhere .
Now , I want to be clear that I am not suggesting you do the same and I ’m also not trying to organize some kind of boycott .
Me deciding not to give money to Apple is not going to do anything to their bottom line .
But this is equivalent to me walking into Macy ’s to buy a new wallet and the salesperson spits in my face .
Chances are I wo n’t be buying my wallets at Macy ’s anymore , no matter how much I like them .
Now let me put aside my role as an official representative of Adobe for a moment as Speaking purely for myself , I would look to make it clear what is going through my mind at the moment .
Go screw yourself Apple .

Rep. Paul Hodes introduced today a Constitutional Amendment to reverse the Supreme Court ’s decision in Citizens United v. FEC .
Michael B. Keegan , President of People For the American Way , issued the following statement :
" Rep . Hodes should be applauded for his leadership in the effort to undo the Supreme Court ’s disastrous decision in Citizens United v. FEC .
The decision overturned more than a century of settled law to give corporations wide - ranging power to influence elections and disproportionate sway over the policies that affect all Americans .
" Passing legislation to dampen the effects of the Supreme Court ’s ruling is an important first step , but a Constitutional Amendment is the only way to truly restore the power of individual voters to the democratic process .
Polls have shown that Americans strongly oppose the Supreme Court ’s decision to hand elections over to corporate interests , and are ready to take strong steps to reverse it .
The overwhelming election of Constitutional Amendment advocate Ted Deutch in Florida yesterday was another clear sign that Americans wo n’t stand for the buying of elections .
We look forward to working with Rep .
Hodes in the effort to amend the Constitution to put elections back in the hands of voters . "

Teachers have banned supervising students in their national numeracy and literacy ( NAPLAN ) tests .
This is because the publication of these results on the Labor Government ’s My School website is a league table of ‘ good ’ and ‘ bad ’ schools and stigmatises students in ‘ bad ’ schools .
The tables can induce parents to move their kids to supposedly better performing schools .
It may come as no surprise that high fee private schools rate near the top of the tables and badly funded public schools in areas of disadvantage score poorly .
In other words the tables will reinforce and exacerbate inequality .
What they wo n’t do is improve funding .
Labor ’s education revolution has been an investment in tricks and mortar .
Labor has not invested in the people in the system , the teachers and other staff who work hard to educate our kids .
Without such investment the Gillard ’s education revolution is a non-solution .
Labor ’s industrial laws , like the Liberals ’ industrial laws , make it illegal to undertake action outside the collective agreement bargaining period .
The states have similar legislation .
The NAPLAN test ban is outside the bargaining periods and so illegal .
Last month Gillard went to Western Australia to give her support to Woodside Petroleum .
The company is suing its workers and union leaders for taking ‘ unprotected ’ action .
Each striker faces a fine of $ 22,000 .
To date unions have paid fines rather than develop and implement a Clarrie O’Shea rolling general strike strategy and smash the penal powers .
Now it might be easy in the court of public opinion to bag out building workers and hamstring or punish them with fines for striking .
But it is something altogether different for Gillard to attack unionists who have the fate of our kids in their hands every day and for whom most people have nothing but respect .
Our industrial laws are split between federal and state jurisdictions .
In Victoria , the ACT and the Northern Territory teachers could have their pay docked by a minimum of four hours under the Federal Labor Government ’s laws .
Under the other States ’ industrial laws the action is likely to be unprotected , according to Gillard .
In those States the union rather than the members could face fines .
In January when unions floated the idea of banning the tests Gillard said she would not rule anything in or anything out about how the Rudd Labor Government would deal with bans .
The teachers ’ union needs to be prepared to face the ferocity of Labor using its laws to smash the ban .
They should resolve not to obey any pre-emptive court direction to lift he bans .
They should threaten to strike if their pay is docked or members or the union fined over the bans .
They could resolve not to pay any fines and risk jail for doing so .
And they should seek support from other unions like the Construction , Forestry , Mining and Energy union to form a united front against Labor ’s penal powers and win the end of league tables for schools and worsening safety on building sites .
One of the CFMEU ’s members faces jail for not providing details of a lunchtime meeting he attended .
To its credit the union is organising strikes if he is jailed .
Teachers can learn those lessons .
The right to strike and take other industrial action at any time is fundamental to a democratic society .
Labor will attack teachers .
When it does the teachers have the opportunity to defeat the league tables by striking and smashing Labor ’s penal powers .
Toronto ’s public school board is considering a plan to open four new specialty schools — one for boys , one for girls , a choir school and a sports academy — in an attempt to stem declining enrolment and give students more choice .
The proposal is bound to revive debate about whether specialty schools , especially single - sex programs , cause social segregation when it comes before a Toronto District School Board committee Wednesday .
The move to an almost boutique option for learning , wildly popular in Edmonton , Chicago and New York , has been kick - started in Toronto by new director of education Chris Spence , who started a sports academy and two all - boy programs in Hamilton , where he was director until last July .
He has asked Toronto trustees to approve a feasibility study of the four schools by June , with the possibility of opening by September 2011 , perhaps even in stand - alone buildings if enough students sign up , and maybe in high - needs neighbourhoods to make sure they are accessible to students of all backgrounds .
Spence would not say he ’s taking aim at the Toronto Catholic board ’s successful St. Michael ’s Choir School — a joint public - private venture with the city ’s Catholic archdiocese — but noted the proposed new programs would mean “ offering private school options in the public system .
“ And it ’s no secret 68 boards in the province are struggling with declining enrolment , including ours . ”
The Toronto board loses roughly 4,000 students a year to falling birth rates and migration to the 905 .
Eight Toronto neighborhoods are in the grip of public school closing talks right now ; dozens of half - empty schools are expected to be shuttered in the coming years .
Currently , about 260,000 students are enrolled at board schools .
Yet specialty schools can serve as magnets , noted board chair Bruce Davis , who expects demand could fill several schools of each of the kinds proposed ; an all - boy leadership academy for kindergarten to Grade 3 , an all - girl leadership academy for girls in Grades 4 to 8 , and a co-ed choir school and co-ed sports academy for students in Grades 4 to 8 .
“ Parents love these schools and so do kids ; at our four high schools for the arts , parents tell me they do n’t have to fight to get their kids out of bed – their kids wake them up to go to school , ” said Davis .
Spence ’s original proposal of an all - boys ’ academy this fall was scrapped after several trustees expressed concern about the social implications of separating children by gender , even in an alternative program for only those who want it .
Instead , a task force was created to take a more cautious , researched approach to the concept of single - sex schools , with some staff visiting all - boy schools in the United States .
However Annie Kidder of the advocacy group People for Education warns that while popular , these programs typically draw children of more affluent , school - savvy parents , “ so they end up segregating kids along class lines as well as the specialty focus .
“ My own daughter goes to an arts high school and to be brutally honest , I can see the division along socio-economic lines .
It ’s a hard balance to strike , between appealing to individual students ’ interests and the overall good . ”
Spence said neither the choir nor sports school would require an audition , in order to avoid some of the class barriers .
That ’s also why staff has proposed vocal music rather than instrumental , said Davis .
“ Vocal music is not elitist ; you do n’t need to have a cello .
And we ’re proposing it be a real cross-cultural focus , ” he said .
The Catholic board ’s choir school , which has a waiting list , focuses on sacred Christian music .
Besides , Davis argued there are too few specialty programs to fragment the board .
“ We have four arts high schools ( out of about 560 schools ) – whoop - de - doo !
And 10 per cent of our kids go to French immersion programs and 1 per cent go to alternative schools right now , so we ’re not cannibalizing the system at all . ”
The staff report suggests the boys ’ academy start in kindergarten to catch boys right at the start of their academic careers , Spence said , considering boys lag behind girls academically by 4 to 13 per cent , are more likely to drop out or be suspended for bad behavior and are less likely to go on to higher learning .

A single - gender school would offer the same curriculum but use some different materials - more non-fiction books and hands - on activities for boys – and a somewhat different teaching style , including more opportunities to move around .
In contrast , the girls ’ academy would start in Grade 4 to address some of the pre-teen issues of body image , self - esteem and relationships , said Karen Grose , the board ’s system superintendent .
The schools would not seek to hire teachers of just one gender .
Already the board runs a smattering of girls - only and boys - only elementary classes where principals report improvement in many students ’ performance .
( Do as I say , not as I do )
With the latest news about a Republican push for a new Contract With America for the upcoming mid-term elections , I was wondering what ever happened to the other one , the much touted one , the feel - good one , the one that did n't get much past its first 100 days .
Oh , that one .
I remember the orgy of " come brother , let us reason together " proclamations that gushed during the first press conference that November in 1994 .
And remember Dick Armey ?
Dick Armey : “ When we committed to open process that would allow participation by all our members , giving due respect and the right to participate to both the majority and minority , we anticipated that the minority may flood the floor with amendments and try to slow down , stop the process .
In anticipation of that we had a resolve at the time we wrote the Contract that we would be prepared to work seven days a week if necessary , even twenty hours a day if necessary .
But there are two things we will not violate – one , is our commitment to an open process , where people are allowed to participate , irrespective of minority or majority status .
And two – our commitment to get the work done .
We believe a Congress where every member feels their right to participate is fully respected is a Congress that will work smoothly and efficiently .
And we expect that to be the case . ”
Lofty ideals and bi-partisanship ( despite a reporters inquiry if Democratic members would stay on committees the answer was a flat " no " ) and none of it came much to pass before the Ethics violations would roll out .
All that hypocrisy , all those values , all that change .
And they would very much like to do it again .
Former astronaut Neil Armstrong has issued a strongly worded rebuke of President Barack Obama , criticizing the president for proposed revisions to the U.S. ' space program .
Armstrong , along with astronauts James Lovell and Eugene Cernan , called the proposal “ devastating ” in a letter obtained by NBC News .
Read below for the full text :
" The United States entered into the challenge of space exploration under President Eisenhower ’s first term , however , it was the Soviet Union who excelled in those early years , " the letter begins .
" Under the bold vision of Presidents Kennedy , Johnson , and Nixon , and with the overwhelming approval of the American people , we rapidly closed the gap in the final third of the 20th century , and became the world leader in space exploration .
...
" When President Obama recently released his budget for NASA , he proposed a slight increase in total funding , substantial research and technology development , an extension of the International Space Station operation until 2020 , long range planning for a new but undefined heavy lift rocket and significant funding for the development of commercial access to low earth orbit .
" Although some of these proposals have merit , the accompanying decision to cancel the Constellation program , its Ares 1 and Ares V rockets , and the Orion spacecraft , is devastating .
" America ’s only path to low Earth orbit and the International Space Station will now be subject to an agreement with Russia to purchase space on their Soyuz ( at a price of over 50 million dollars per seat with significant increases expected in the near future ) until we have the capacity to provide transportation for ourselves .
The availability of a commercial transport to orbit as envisioned in the President ’s proposal cannot be predicted with any certainty , but is likely to take substantially longer and be more expensive than we would hope .
" It appears that we will have wasted our current ten plus billion dollar investment in Constellation and , equally importantly , we will have lost the many years required to recreate the equivalent of what we will have discarded .
For The United States , the leading space faring nation for nearly half a century , to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future , destines our nation to become one of second or even third rate stature .
While the President 's plan envisages humans traveling away from Earth and perhaps toward Mars at some time in the future , the lack of developed rockets and spacecraft will assure that ability will not be available for many years .
Without the skill and experience that actual spacecraft operation provides , the USA is far too likely to be on a long downhill slide to mediocrity .
America must decide if it wishes to remain a leader in space .
If it does , we should institute a program which will give us the very best chance of achieving that goal .

Renowned Winnipeg adventurer and author Don Starkell is recovering in hospital after a blaze at his home almost claimed his life in March .
He was taken to hospital with serious burns to his legs and suffering from smoke inhalation but over the course of the past few weeks his health has improved .
" I got away with things in my life that not one person in a thousand would survive .
And I can't explain it .
And all I can say ( I 've ) got something going for me , " says Starkell .
He is known for his Paddle to the Arctic and Paddle to the Amazon books .
During a paddling expedition to the arctic , Starkell lost some fingers to frostbite and would have died if rescuers had not saved him .
In Central America , he bluffed his way out of a dangerous situation where thieves had a gun to his head .
The recent fire at his East Kildonan home in March has Starkell feeling fortunate to be alive once again .
" I should n't be here — I lucked out again , " says Starkell .
He heats his home with a wood stove .
" That particular night , I might have left the door open a little tiny bit , " says Starkell regarding the evening the blaze broke out .
After running from the home when he awoke to flames , Starkell attempted to go back in to put out the fire but a neighbour stopped him .
Starkell was later taken to hospital .
Once out of hospital , Starkell plans to return to his passion for paddling on the water .
He says he 's only about 300 miles short of paddling 75,000 miles during his life , an important milestone for him because it's three times the distance of the circumference of the earth .
Starkell plans to stay with friends once out of hospital until his home is repaired .
He also plans to remove the wood stove at his home and replace it with a natural gas furnace .

Let ’s be clear about something .
A person who decides to give up his US citizenship is not guilty of disloyalty to America ; quite the opposite .
He could very well be more loyal to American principles than the regime is willing to tolerate .
It also does not mean that he is giving up hope for liberty ; he may have great hope for liberty , in a different way and in a different place .

In any case , the rise of emigration , expatriation , and citizenship renunciation is a trend that is not going away .
It is rising and will get more significant .
In some ways , it is completely expected .
When regimes over - control , over - tax , over - regulate , they gnaw at the innate sense of the right to be free .
When this gets worse and worse , people tend to look around for better environments .
We ’ve all known people who talk about it openly .
It is becoming cocktail conversation , the once - unthinkable now standard fare .
It ’s not just an impression .
State Department records show that 502 people gave up citizenship in just the last quarter of 2009 .
That is more than twice the total for 2008 .
That might not seem like a lot but what stands out here is the trend line , which is soaring .
I also hear reports of year - long bureaucratic delays in approval , and , of course , plenty of people leave without permission .
The driving factors here are not cultural or social ; they are economic .
The US government is making it ever more difficult for Americans living abroad , taxing them wherever the bureaucrats can find them .
The government makes it very difficult even to hold a bank account in the US unless the account holder can point to a US residency ( thanks to the Patriot Act ) .
And when the government finds a reporting error on income earned overseas , it can charge a 50 % penalty .
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
Even when a person gives up US citizenship , and establishes citizenship with a freer country , the US government can still haunt him with continuing tax obligations and demands for military service .
There is , at the least , a vast exit penalty .
Any regime that would do things like this inspires people to want to stay at arm ’s length .
Far more frightening is the sense that financial calamity is around the corner .
A look at the data seems to suggest that .
Vast reserves are sitting in the banking system , waiting to be unleashed to create what could be total destruction of the dollar .
The deficit is rising so fast that it is hard to chart .
Getting Out : Your Guid ... Ehrman , Mark Best Price : $ 1.70 Buy New $ 14.00 ( as of 12:20 EST - Details )
The jobs situation is terrible , especially for young people ( and adults often make decisions based on what is best for their kids ’ future ) .
Personal income is falling and falling .
Investment is not recovering after its cliff dive in 2009 .
The social welfare state is broke .
Private debt is rising even though lending has not restarted .
The policies of the fiscal and monetary authorities are absolutely terrifying .
The Fed is keeping rates at zero .
The government is spending and spending beyond belief .
Tax receipts are falling as never before , unleashing the greedy hand of the predator state to extract every last dime .
Expert Expatriate : You ... Patricia Linderman Best Price : $ 2.25 Buy New $ 12.49 ( as of 06:10 EST - Details )
And look at what the US congress and president are doing about this terrible mess : they are working to socialize health care , start a war with Iran , impose tariffs on China , and otherwise tax , regulate , inflate , and control more more more .
An economy that is heavily capitalized and driven by the entrepreneurial spirit can stand a surprising amount of abuse .
But that reserve capital is being drained away into new bubbles , and the entrepreneurial spirit is being crushed at every turn .
Based on all these facts , the sense of impending doom is hard to avoid .
And consider that most people are thinking only about today , this month , and this year .
But among the rich and entrepreneurial we find a class of people who specialize in thinking outside the box , and for the very long term .
It is among the ranks of these people that we are seeing the renunciation trend take hold .
The smart money is giving up on the US political system .
What precisely is a person actually giving up when he walks into a US consulate and signs the renunciation oath ?
The right to vote ?
Yes , but just how much value are we supposed to place on the right to choose between dumb and dumber , and to have your vote cancelled out by the guy behind you in the line ?
No living person has ever swung a significant election .
It is hardly a surprise that people put so little value on going through the motions of democracy .
There is much to give up in a cultural and social sense .
It is not a decision to be made with a light heart .
It is final and scary for that reason .
What compels many people to do it now rather than wait is the sense that at some point , it might not be possible to renounce citizenship .
As the controls grow ever tighter , so will the regulations on those who try to escape .
Every socialist and fascist regime in history has put up walls to prevent flight by people and capital .
This is why people and capital are flying now , while they still can .
In so doing , they are inspired by the writings of the American revolutionaries .
The difference is that they have decided that living in the land of the free and the home of the brave means not being a slave of the US government .
The way to stop the brain and capital drain is readily at hand .
Relinquish controls .
Stop taxing people abroad .
Adopt laissez - faire .
Reinstitute freedom .
Reject militarism and nationalism .
Only that path will inspire optimism in the future of this country .
Until that happens , we can expect this trend to continue , and to advise the young and successful families who ask us , to get out while the getting is good .

Idra BM of course is named after our fellow CJ Entus Progamer , Idra .
Looking good Idra .
Idra has become notorious throughout the Teamliquid community by the way he reacts when he loses to players he would n't expect to lose to , especially by cheese .
BM statements such as " a useful skill toi have " and " Is n't it funny , you won without doing a single thing " have become Teamliquid memes .
But usually , Idra has started becoming more good mannered and even when he does rage quit , it is n't as pure rage as before .
Therefore , I characterize Idra BM as more of a lesser , more light - hearted type of BM .
In my own personal opinion , I have no problem with this type of BM .
I think a little BM definitely can melt the ice in competitions and ease up players with a little humor involved .
The other type of BM , which I call non-Idra BM , is a different story .
I believe this BM is worse than Idra BM , because the player in question who is BMing starts to blame losses on other factors such as lag , which may be even nonexistent .
This type of BM may also characterize players who believe they are superior to everyone else and have bursts of invective against other players who they have lost to .
Players who may even just do anything to piss another person off just because they lost to that said person .
This kind of BM is what I have problems with .
This is just pure rage and there 's nothing humorous involved .
Just all about anger and hate .
No guy , you 're not good .
And lately , I have been seeing more non-Idra BM lately in the Beta at the higher levels .
It 's a shame , because I think the higher players get , the more arrogant and haughty they become and they get all full of themselves .
I just wish in the US servers , players would be more good mannered and accept losses with a good spirit .
I mean take a look at the European and Asian servers .
What exactly is wrong here ?
Okay , so as I 've been starting to play with higher level players , I 've been noticing the amount of bm increase each time .
BM of course means Bad-mannered .
There are two types of BM that I 'll break it down to : Idra BM and non-Idra BM .
Idra BM of course is named after our fellow CJ Entus Progamer , Idra .
Idra has become notorious throughout the Teamliquid community by the way he reacts when he loses to players he would n't expect to lose to , especially by cheese .

I would n't want to get all technical and psychoanalytic talking about their possible childhoods and whatnot .
I wish more people would be good mannered everywhere in life haha .
But I guess it 's just something we have to deal with at times .
I can't really tell you what 's wrong other than that 's just the way a lot of people are unfortunately .

From my point of view , and who knows me knows I 'm really eager and always want to win , its really hard to play an unbalanced game where you sometimes totally play amazing in point of macro and control and still lose due to some imbalanced stuff .
I do n't want to break down a balance discussion here , but it explains a lot of anger and rage in the early Sc2 Beta stage .
I got no problem with losing in a game the other player played a better game , hell let it even be a cheese , but its definately driving me insane if some Protoss tells me that Terran is far superior and storm does n't do shit anymore , while he totally rapes my army even though he got hit by 6 EMPs and I got like 20 Tanks on a cliff -_-
So ... also you have to see that its not only Sc : BW players now , its W3 , C&C , WOW ... etc Commentator Polt | MMA | Jjakji | BoxeR | NaDa | MVP | MKP ... truly inspiring .

Being bad manner is fun( ny ) .
Maybe I 'm the only one but I love bming after the game and the follow up whispers I get , which are even more BM .
And then when you WIN next time and use the offensive BM it 's even funnier .
Players that are BM are the people who are n't cowards , and are n't afraid to speak their minds anonymously over the internet .

You bring up a good point , saying that it 's the Internet .
Yet keep in mind , something that is really valued in a competitive game like this is respect , integrity , and honor .
That means BMing does n't really fall under those categories .
Even Idra does have respect for the players he loses to even though in the immediate aftermath of the game he may not show it .
Players who exhibit the second type of BM which I like to coin as " Non - Idra BM " do n't even have this respect .

Idra is n't notorious for lighthearted BM , he 's notorious for calling people " faggots " and " fucking homos " after losses .
I do n't see how someone can see that kind of BM not being as bad as someone saying " you are terrible and lucky " at the end of a game .
The only reason he does n't do that anymore is because he's in the spotlight , not because he 's lighthearted or changed ( lol ) .

I do n't think so actually .
I think his staying in Korea , where a lot of good - mannered progamers reside , has really changed him .
I did n't say he was notorious for lighthearted BM .
I know he is notorious for his huge disrespectful BM , but that was before he changed .
I refer to the way he BMs now just as " Idra BM " because I do n't think he BMs out of pure rage now , I believe there 's some humor involved in it nowadays .
He definitely does n't BM out of pure rage now just because he's in the spotlight .
He 's done that before actually .

This perhaps may apply to your average player just playing the game for fun , but the type of players that I am referring to who competitive players , who play for the money and fame .

Well , if they play for money then it might be a bad business investment .
Let 'em have at it .
If they play for fame ... you 're making threads about them so they are doing something right .

How do you know when he blames on lag theres actually no lag ?
For the majority of the games I play , for example , it lags the entire game for me and it does n't lag for the opponent

For example , it will lag for like probably two seconds when a drop screen shows up and when your opponent loses , he will blame his loss entirely on that two seconds of lag that was probably insignificant .
Those kinds of things I am talking about .

I remember this in Call of Duty 2 back when it was all over the leagues .
Tons of players who were good ( not great ) that put themselves in some sort of imaginary spotlight , and would trash people constantly when they were challenged or things did n't go their way .
They would lose and just refused to accept defeat .
Then I remember seeing a lot of the higher level players , the guys who actually would go beyond CAL - O into CAL - I or CPL or CEVO -P , and they'd have a lot more restraint and respect for people , although it was n't always the case .
Then I always get stories that Quake players are really respectful , and for the most part , Starcraft players seem to be pretty good , although I think this " demographic " is going to become more prominent as it becomes more apparent there 's competition to be had .
I do remember years ago on Bnet , though , many players with horrid attitudes .
I can't tell if it 's just ego , or if they are just desperate to be something really bad that they get defensive or try to put themselves in that position in their head .

The person who found and sold an Apple iPhone prototype says he regrets not doing more to return the device to its owner , according to a statement provided by his attorney Thursday in response to queries from Wired.com .
Brian J. Hogan , a 21 - year - old resident of Redwood City , California , says although he was paid by tech site Gizmodo , he believed the payment was for allowing the site exclusive access to review the phone .
Gizmodo emphasized to him " that there was nothing wrong in sharing the phone with the tech press , " according to his attorney Jeffrey Bornstein .
Wired.com identified Hogan as the finder of the prototype by following clues on social network sites , and then confirmed his identity with a source involved in the iPhone find .
Hogan has been interviewed by law enforcement investigators but has not been charged with a crime .
His attorney says he is willing to cooperate with authorities .
It 's generally considered theft under California law if one " finds lost property under circumstances that give him knowledge of or means of inquiry as to the true owner " and yet appropriates the property for his own use " without first making reasonable and just efforts to find the owner and to restore the property to him . "
The person who found the phone " is very definitely one of the people who is being looked at as a suspect in theft , " San Mateo County Chief Deputy District Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe told Wired.com Wednesday .
" Assuming there 's ultimately a crime here .
That 's what we 're still gauging , is this a crime , is it a theft ? "
On April 19 , Gizmodo , which is owned by Gawker Media , published a bombshell story about the iPhone prototype , which had apparently been left at the Gourmet Haus Staudt in Redwood City .
It was left behind by an Apple engineer named Gray Powell .
According to the statement from his lawyer , Hogan was in the bar with friends when another patron handed him the phone after finding it on a nearby stool .
The patron asked Hogan if the phone belonged to him , and then left the bar .
Hogan asked others sitting nearby if the phone belonged to them , and when no one claimed it , he and his friends left the bar with the device .
" Brian opened the phone onto a Facebook page but then the phone shut down , " attorney Bornstein writes .
" From that time on , the phone was inoperable the entire time Brian had it . "
Hogan did n’t know what he had until he removed a fake cover from the device and realized it must be a prototype of Apple 's upcoming next - generation iPhone , according to Gizmodo 's account of the find .
A friend of Hogan 's then offered to call Apple Care on Hogan 's behalf , according to Hogan 's lawyer .
That apparently was the extent of Hogan 's efforts to return the phone .
After the friend 's purported efforts to return the phone failed , several journalists were offered a look at the device .
Wired.com received an e-mail March 28 – not from Hogan – offering access to the iPhone , but did not follow up on the exchange after the tipster made a thinly veiled request for money .
Gizmodo then paid $ 5,000 in cash for it .
The owners of the bar told reporters that Hogan did n't notify anyone who worked at the bar about the phone .
They also said Powell returned several times after losing the phone to see if anyone had found it and turned it in .
Powell and Apple 's outside counsel contacted the San Mateo County District Attorney ’s office last week to report the phone stolen , according to reports .
" He regrets his mistake in not doing more to return the phone , " says Bornstein 's statement .
" Even though he did obtain some compensation from Gizmodo , Brian thought that it was so that they could review the phone . "
Shortly after Gizmodo published its story , people identifying themselves as representatives of Apple appeared at Hogan 's home seeking permission to search the premises , according to a source involved with the iPhone find .
A roommate turned them away .
Records show a Redwood City address for Hogan about a mile from the bar where he found the phone .
Nobody was at home when Wired.com knocked on the door earlier this week .
Hogan previously lived in Santa Barbara , where he attended Santa Barbara City College as recently as 2008 , according to his Facebook profile , which was deleted last week .
His attorney says he recently transferred schools and will resume his college education in the fall .
He has been working part time at a church - run community center giving swimming lessons to children and volunteered at a Chinese orphanage last year while he was enrolled in a study - abroad program .
" He also volunteers to assist his aunt and sister with fundraising for their work to provide medical care to orphans in Kenya , " his attorney says .
" Brian is the kind of young man that any parent would be proud to have as their son . "
In addition to Hogan , investigators have targeted Gizmodo editor Jason Chen , who received and reported on the phone .
Last Friday , officers from California 's Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team raided Chen 's Fremont , California , home and seized computers and other equipment .
Gawker Media and others have said the search warrant violated state and federal shield laws protecting journalists from searches and seizures without a subpoena .
The San Mateo County district attorney 's office said this week that investigators will not examine the seized materials until the legality of the warrant has been resolved .
Hogan 's attorney , Jeffrey Bornstein , is a former federal prosecutor , who is now a partner at the San Francisco law firm K & L Gates .
As a defense attorney , Bornstein notably represented the captain who steered a container ship into the San Francisco Bay Bridge in 2007 .
In an interview at his office Thursday afternoon , the lawyer said Hogan 's family has relocated to an undisclosed location in anticipation of a media frenzy .
" This thing has gotten completely , completely out of control , " said Bornstein , referring to the public interest in the story .
" He made a mistake , " Bornstein added .
" He should have just immediately turned that phone in . "
Story updated 19:45 to quote Bornstein .

At that point , the Democratic Party enjoyed an 11 - point favorable image advantage over the Republican Party .
Now , the favorable ratings of the two parties are essentially tied .
The images of the two major parties have particular significance in a midterm election year .
For example , the favorable rating of the Democratic Party exceeded that of the Republican Party by 52 % to 37 % just prior to the 2006 midterm elections , in which the Democrats gained 30 House seats .
Americans ' current 41 % favorable rating of the Democratic Party is five points lower than the party 's previous low , recorded twice in 2005 .
By contrast , the Republican Party 's image reached its all - time low of 31 % in December 1998 -- just after the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Bill Clinton .
The Republicans ' current rating is improved from a pair of 34 % ratings Gallup measured in late 2008 and in May 2009 .
Partisan Ratings
The Democratic Party 's favorable image has dropped among all three partisan groups compared to August / early September 2009 .
There has been little change by party in the Republican Party 's favorable image compared to the late summer 2009 measure , although the percentage of Republicans with a favorable image of their party remains significantly higher than it was in May 2009 .
Full trends on these favorable measures for both parties are included on page 2 of this report .
Last winter , in the middle of my intern year , I became Facebook friends with a young man who was dying in the intensive - care unit .
An investment banker in his mid-20s , he thought he was healthy until a fluttering in his chest and swollen ankles took him to a doctor .
Now he was in the I.C.U. with a rare cardiac condition and the vague possibility of a transplant .
And his laptop .
That ’s the first thing I noticed the morning a group of us stood outside his room on rounds .
He was shocked by his internal defibrillator three times the night before — died , that is , three times before being brought back with jolts of electricity .
And this young man with a steroid - swollen face was surfing the Internet .
In medical school , when we cut open a cadaver and lifted the heart from its silent cage , it was beautiful and unreal .
With this patient , it was clear to me that there would be no poetry .
He was dying , and it would be ugly , and I knew I could n’t help him .
He terrified me .
Eventually , I was sent in to pull a central line out of his neck .
“ Hey , ” I said .
I told him I was just going to cut out the stitches and then pull out the line — basically a large IV for giving drugs — from the vein deep inside .
It would bleed , and I ’d apply pressure for a while .
When I pulled , I told him , I wanted him to hum .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. regulators will announce a major Internet policy this week to revolutionize how Americans communicate and play , proposing a dramatic increase in broadband speeds that could let people download a high - definition film in minutes instead of hours .

Dramatically increasing Internet speeds to 25 times the current average is one of the myriad goals to be unveiled in the National Broadband Plan by the the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday .
The highly anticipated plan will make a series of recommendations to Congress and is aimed at spurring the ever - changing communications industry to bring more and faster online services to Americans as they increasingly turn to the Internet to communicate , pay monthly bills , make travel plans and be entertained by movies and music .
“ This is a fairly unique event , ” said Paul Gallant , an analyst with Concept Capital .
“ The FCC really has never been asked to design a broad regulatory shift like this .
Broadband is important and difficult because it threatens every established communications sector . ”
Some details of the plan have trickled out in the last few weeks including how to find spectrum to meet an anticipated explosion of handset devices capable of playing movies and music in addition to handling emails and voice calls .
But some carriers like AT&T Inc and Qwest Communications International Inc were irked last month when the agency ’s chief , Julius Genachowski , announced that the FCC would propose in the plan a goal of 100 Mbps speeds to be in place at 100 million American homes in 10 years .
The current average is less than 4 Mbps .
In a sign of tension between the FCC and carriers , Qwest called it “ a dream ” and AT&T reacted by saying the FCC should resist calls for “ extreme forms of regulation . ”
Since the FCC announcement , Cisco Systems Inc announced it would introduce a router that can handle Internet traffic up to 12 times faster than rival products .
Google Inc has also gotten in on the hype , saying it plans to build a super - fast Internet network to show that it can be done .
The FCC has praised both announcements .
The plans could also touch off tensions with television broadcasters , who will be asked to give up spectrum to wireless carriers who desperately need it for their mobile devices , such as the iPhone and Blackberry .
The FCC plans to let them share in the profits of auctions structured to redistribute the spectrum .
“ We ’ve developed a plan that is a real win - win for everyone involved and we have every expectation that it will work , ” Genachowski said in an interview with Reuters .
“ We ’ve certainly heard from a number of broadcasters who told us they think this is a promising direction and are getting ready to roll up their sleeves with us , ” he said .
The FCC also wants to make sure that anchor institutions -- government buildings , schools , libraries and healthcare facilities -- get speeds of about 1 gigabit per second by 2020 .
The full broadband plan is expected to be released at a Tuesday meeting among the FCC ’s five members who are expected to discuss the results and recommendations of the roadmap , which was mandated by Congress .
Congress may have to pass legislation to enact some portions of the plan .
FCC officials have said some of the goals are aspirational and should be viewed as a “ living , breathing ” document for the next decade in hopes of helping 93 million Americans without broadband get connected .
ACHIEVABLE
“ It is both aspiration and achievable , ” Genachowski said .
The Obama administration has touted the plan as a way to create jobs and make energy use more efficient .
“ It will be a call to action , ” said Blair Levin , who heads the FCC ’s broadband task force which has collected data and comments from the industry , academics and the public as well as from three dozen public workshops .
The FCC has placed most of its attention on broadband policy which Darrell West , director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution , called “ the signature issue ” since Genachowski took over the helm in late June .
“ It means that broadband is going to drive other types of policy decisions and it really sets the parameters for telecommunications and new applications , ” West said .
FCC officials have said that the plan will not take sides on technology or applications , but they want to lay the groundwork to spur innovation and job creation .
Officials have said the plan will ask Congress to fund up to $ 16 billion to build an emergency public safety system .
It would also tell lawmakers that a one - time injection of $ 9 billion could accelerate broadband reach to the 4 percent of Americans who do have access .
Otherwise they could let the FCC carry out a 10 - year plan to realign an $ 8 billion U.S. subsidy program for universal broadband access instead of universal phone access .
Experts call the plan ambitious but question if the FCC , which plans to spin off a series of rule - making proposals linked to the plan , can realistically make good on its recommendations .
“ There ’s so little progress on this stuff in Washington , ” said Rob Atkinson , who heads the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation .
“ I think Chairman Genachowski has a real opportunity to bring different warring interests under 50 - 75 percent of the plan . ”
Yes .
That IS an abandoned , dirty , battered old teddy bear sitting in the gutter during a downpour .
I ’m not sure how much sadder it could get , except maybe to add that we found him face - down in an alleyway during a shoot today and brought him back to the trailer so he would n’t be ‘ alone ’ .
But even when he ’s not alone , Mr. Teddy still feels lonely .

A former FBI agent convicted of planning an invasion - style robbery of what he thought was a drug stash house containing a half - million dollars in cash was sentenced to 30 years in prison Monday by a federal judge in Santa Ana .
Ex-agent Vo Duong Tran , 42 , and his accomplice , Yu Sung Park , 36 , were arrested in possession of bulletproof vests , a machine gun , other weapons , silencers and hundreds of rounds of ammunition that they intended to use to rob the supposed drug house in Fountain Valley , a jury found .
In reality , the “ stash house ” did not exist .
It was created as part of a law enforcement sting operation .
During the probe , Tran and Park were secretly recorded planning the details of the would - be caper with an undercover federal agent and an informant .
Tran and Park told the agent and informant to use one of the drug dealers inside the house as a “ human shield ” to clear the location and to shoot anyone who did not follow instructions .
In a reference to the machine gun , Tran , an 11 - year FBI veteran , boasted that he could “ take out five cops in a second ” if any officers responded to the scene during the robbery , according to court papers .
Recordings of those and other statements were played for jurors during a month - long trial before U.S. District Judge Andrew J. Guilford last year .
Tran ’s attorney , Alex R. Kessel , argued at trial that despite having been fired by the FBI years earlier , Tran remained loyal to law enforcement .
He said Tran was only pretending to be a criminal because he was conducting his own undercover investigation and planned to go to authorities with the results .
The jury , which deliberated for one day , rejected that explanation .
Jurors found Tran and Park guilty of conspiracy to obstruct commerce by robbery , interstate travel to commit a crime with a firearm and possession of a machine gun .
Though they were not charged with any actual robberies , both Tran and Park admitted having committed “ similar home - invasion style robberies of drug dealers in the past , ” according a sentencing memorandum filed by prosecutors .
Tran was hired by the FBI in 1992 and assigned to the Chicago field office .
He was suspended nine years later after admitting to a bureau security officer that he attempted to bribe a Vietnamese official for information while on a personal trip to Vietnam , according to court records unrelated to the Orange County case .
While on suspension , he was charged by prosecutors in Illinois with impersonating a peace officer after he allegedly identified himself as an FBI agent to a family he said was being targeted for a home invasion robbery .
He was acquitted of those charges in court .
Tran was fired from the FBI in April 2003 .
A little more than a year later he was indicted by federal prosecutors in Atlanta on charges that he obtained firearms and silencers by falsely stating that he was a resident of Georgia and that he needed the items in connection with his work for the FBI .
The government dismissed the case after a judge ruled that evidence seized from Tran ’s apartment in Chicago was inadmissible .
In the case for which he was sentenced Monday , Tran traveled from his home in Louisiana to Southern California to commit the robbery .
He and Park , who was also sentenced to a 30 - year prison term , were arrested by an FBI SWAT team in July 2008 in the parking lot of an Orange County hotel .

Where is God in the Midst of Tragedy ?
Ever ask , " God where are you ? "
What exactly can you count on God for ?
By Marilyn Adamson
To what degree can we rely on God to help us ?
Is He really someone we can turn to at all ... in times of crisis as well as times of calm ?
Who is God ?
God is the Creator of the universe who yearns for us to know Him .
That is why we are all here .
It is His desire that we rely on and experience His strength , love , justice , holiness and compassion .
So He says to all who are willing , " Come to Me . "
Unlike us ,
God knows what will happen tomorrow , next week , next year , the next decade .
He says , " I am God , and there is no one like me , declaring the end from the beginning . "
1
He knows what will happen in the world .
More importantly ,
He knows what will occur in your life and can be there for you , if you 've chosen to include Him in your life .
He tells us that He can be " our refuge and strength , an ever - present help in times of trouble . "
2
But we must make a sincere effort to seek Him .
He says , " you will seek Me and find Me , when you search for Me with all your heart . "
3
Where Is God in Difficult Times ?
That does n't mean that those who know God will escape difficult times .
They wo n't .
When wars or rampant disease cause suffering and death , those who know God will be involved in that suffering also .
But there is a peace and a strength that God 's presence gives .
One follower of Jesus Christ put it this way : " We are hard pressed on every side , but not crushed ; perplexed , but not in despair ; persecuted , but not abandoned ; struck down , but not destroyed . " 4 Reality tells us that we will experience problems in life .
However , if we go through them while knowing God , we can react to them with a different perspective and with a strength that is not our own .
No problem has the capacity to be insurmountable to God .
He is bigger than all the problems that can hit us , and we are not left alone to deal with them .
God 's
Word tells us , " The Lord is good , a refuge in times of trouble .
He cares for those who trust in him . " 5
And , " The Lord is near to all who call on him , to all who call on him in truth .
He fulfills the desires of those who fear him ; he hears their cry and saves them . "
6
Jesus Christ told
His followers these comforting words : " Are not two sparrows sold for a cent ?
And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father .
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
Therefore do not fear ; you are of more value than many sparrows . "
7
If you truly turn to God , He will care for you as no one else does , and in a way that no one else can .
God and Our Free Will
God has created humanity with the ability to choose .
This means that we are not forced into a relationship with Him .
He allows us to reject Him and to commit other evil acts as well .
He could force us to be loving .
He could force us to be good .
But then what kind of relationship would we have with Him ?
It would not be a relationship at all , but a forced , absolutely controlled obedience .
Instead
He gave us the human dignity of free will .
Naturally , we cry from the depths of our souls ... " But God , how could You let something of this magnitude happen ? "
How would we want God to act ?
Do we want Him to control the actions of people ?
In the case of dealing with a terrorist attack , what could possibly be an acceptable number of deaths for God to allow ?!
Would we feel better if God allowed only the murder of hundreds ?
Would we rather God allowed only the death of one person ?
Yet if God would prevent the murder of even one person , there is no longer freedom to choose .
People choose to ignore God , to defy God , to go their own way and commit horrible acts against others .
This planet is not a safe place .
Someone might shoot us .
Or we might be hit by a car .
Or we might have to jump from a building attacked by terrorists .
Or any number of things that might happen to us in this harsh environment called Earth , the place where God 's will is not always followed .
Yet , God is not at the mercy of people , but the other way around .
We are at His mercy , fortunately .
This is God who created the universe with its uncountable stars , simply by speaking the words , " Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky . " 8
This is God who says
He " reigns over the nations . " 9
He is unlimited in power and wisdom .
Though problems seem insurmountable to us , we have an incredibly capable God who reminds us , " Behold , I am the LORD , the God of all flesh ; is anything too hard for Me ? " 10 Somehow
He is able to maintain the freedom of sinful humans , yet still bring about His will .
God clearly says , " My counsel shall stand , and I will accomplish all My purpose .
" 11 And we can draw comfort from that if our lives are submitted to Him .
" For God opposes the proud , but gives grace to the humble .
" 12
Where Is God When We Reject Him ?
Many of us -- no , all of us -- choose at times to stiff - arm God and His ways .
Compared to others , certainly compared to a terrorist , we might consider ourselves to be respectable , loving people .
But in the raw honesty of our own hearts , if we were to face God , it would be with the knowledge of our sin .
As we begin to address God in prayer , are we not caught short , paused by the sense that God is well aware of our thoughts , actions and self - centeredness ?
We have ... by our lives and actions ... distanced ourselves from God .
We have often lived like we could run our lives just fine without Him .
The Bible says that " We all , like sheep , have gone astray , each of us has turned to his own way .
"
13
The consequences ?
Our sin has separated us from God , and it affects more than this life .
The penalty for our sin is death , or eternal separation from God .
However , God has provided a way for us to be forgiven and know Him .
God Offers Us His Love
God came to earth to rescue us .
" For God so loved the world , that he sent his only Son , that whoever believes in him should not perish , but have eternal life .
For God sent the Son into the world , not to condemn the world , but that the world might be saved through him .
"
14
God knows the pain and suffering we encounter in this world .
Jesus left the safety and security of His home , and entered the hard environment we live in .
Jesus got tired , knew hunger and thirst , battled accusations from others and was ostracized by family and friends .
But Jesus experienced far more than daily hardships .
Jesus , the Son of God in human form , willingly took all of our sin on Himself and paid our penalty of death .
" In this is love , that he laid down his life for us .
" 15 He went through torture , dying a slow , humiliating death of suffocation on a cross , so that we could be forgiven .
Jesus told others ahead of time that He would be crucified .
He said that three days after His death
He would come back to life , proving that He is God .
He did n't say He would reincarnate someday .
( Who would know if He actually did it ? )
He said three days after being buried He would show Himself physically alive to those who saw His crucifixion .
On that third day , Jesus ' tomb was found empty and many people testified to seeing Him alive .
God Invites Us To Be With Him In Heaven
He now offers us eternal life .
We do n't earn this .
It is a gift from God offered to us , which we receive when we ask Him to enter our lives .
" The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus . " 16 If we repent of our sin and turn back to God , we can have the gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ .
It 's pretty simple .
" God has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
He who has the Son has life ; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life .
" 17 He wants to enter our lives .
What about heaven ?
The Bible says that God has " set eternity in the hearts of men .
" 18 Maybe that means we know , in our hearts , what a better world would look like .
The death of people we love convinces us that there 's something very wrong with this life and this world .
Somewhere deep down in our souls , we know that there must be a much better place to live , free from heart - wrenching difficulties and pain .
To be sure , God does have a better place He offers us .
It will be a completely different system in which His will is done all the time .
In this world , God will wipe every tear from people 's eyes .
There will be no more mourning , crying , death or pain .
19 And God , by His Spirit , will dwell in people in such a way that they will never sin again.20
The events of a terrorist attack are horrific enough .
Refusing an eternal relationship with God , which Jesus offers you , would be worse .
Not just in light of eternal life , but there is no relationship which compares to knowing God in this life .
He is our purpose in life , our source of comfort , our wisdom in confusing times , our strength and hope .
" Taste and see that the Lord is good ; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him . "
21
It has been said by some that God is just a crutch .
But it is likely that He is the only reliable one .
Jesus said , " Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives do I give to you .
Let not your hearts be troubled , neither let them be afraid . " 22 For those who will rely on Jesus during their lives ,
He says it is like building your life on a Rock .
Whatever crises attack you in this life , He can keep you strong .
Where is God ?
He Can Come Into Your Life
You can receive Jesus into your life right now .
" To all who received Him , to those who believed in His name , He gave the right to become children of God . " 23
It is through Jesus Christ that we can come back to God.
Jesus said , " I am the way , and the truth , and the life ; no one comes to the Father , but through Me . " 24 Jesus offered , " Behold , I stand at the door and knock ; if anyone hears
My voice and opens the door , I will come in to him . "
25
Right now you can ask God to enter your life .
You can do this through prayer .
Prayer means talking honestly with God .
At this moment you can call out to God by telling Him something like this in sincerity :
" God , I have turned away from You in my heart , but I want to change that .
I want to know You .
I want to receive Jesus Christ and His forgiveness into my life .
I do n't want to be separated from You anymore .
Be the God of my life from this day onward .
Thank you God . "
Have you just now sincerely asked God into your life ?
If you have , you have a lot to look forward to .
God promises to make your present life one of greater satisfaction through knowing Him.26
Where is God ?
He promises to make His home in you .
27 And He gives you eternal life .28
No matter what happens in the world around you , God can be there for you .
Though people do not follow God 's ways , God is able to take horrible circumstances and bring about His plan anyway .
God is ultimately in control over world events .
If you are God 's , then you can rest on the promise that , " All things work together for good for those who love God and are called according to His purpose . "
29
Jesus Christ said , " My peace I give to you ; not as the world gives , do I give to you .
Let not your heart be troubled .
In the world you have tribulation , but take courage ; I have overcome the world .
" 30 He promises never to fail us or forsake us .

David Cameron has admitted to a " gaffe " in his general election campaign after forgetting the name of a seat his party is trying to win in Gloucestershire .
When asked by BBC News which seats were being targeted , the Conservative leader mentioned Gloucester and Cheltenham but forgot Stroud .
He said : " I 'm desperately racking my brains , which one have I missed out ? "
Given a clue , Cider With Rosie , a novel set in Stroud , he said : " Of course ...
My first gaffe of the campaign . "
Mr Cameron said : " Funnily enough , Cider With Rosie is one of my favourite books .
I 'm terribly embarrassed . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He told BBC Gloucestershire presenter Mark Cummings : " You 've got me - middle stump . "
Mr Cameron 's constituency in Witney is on the border with Gloucestershire .
Stroud was a Conservative seat for nearly 50 years before it was won in 1997 by Labour 's David Drew , who is the current MP .
Boundary changes for this election have led to Minchinhampton moving from Stroud to the Cotswolds constituency , swapping with part of Wotton - under - Edge .
Stroud is a key Tory target seat for next month 's general election .
Candidates so far announced in Stroud are : Conservative : Neil Carmichael ; Labour : David Drew ; Lib Dem : Dennis Andrewartha ; Green : Martin Whiteside
So just whose e-mails are they ?
On orders from Maricopa County , a third - party vendor has archived an unknown quantity of e-mails written by Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office personnel since August 2008 .
The Sheriff 's Office says the e-mails belong to them , and they should have been deleted from an emergency backup system after 28 days .
County management says the e-mails are county property .
And the messages play into two federal cases , a racial - profiling civil lawsuit against Sheriff Joe Arpaio and an FBI criminal investigation into Arpaio 's office , so they refused to turn them over to the sheriff .
Special investigator takes up Bar probe of Thomas
A Pima County judge will try to sort out ownership in an emergency hearing Wednesday morning .
The issue first arose in February when the Sheriff 's Office claimed in the civil lawsuit that e-mails concerning Arpaio 's controversial " crime - suppression operations " had been deleted from the system .
The federal judge imposed sanctions against the office .
But last week , county officials announced they had recovered the e-mails - though actually , they had been archived .
The news caught the Sheriff 's Office by surprise .
On Friday afternoon , Sheriff 's Commander Bob Rampy confronted county technology managers and demanded the e-mails be turned over to him , first by e-mail and later in person .
County officials turned Rampy down .
County lawyers filed an emergency motion for an order of protection against the Sheriff 's Office with the Pima County judge , who is handling an ongoing case between the county and the sheriff over management of a county law - enforcement computer database .
In that motion , attorney Julie Pace , who represents the county , revealed that not only were some of the e-mails subject to the racial - profiling suit , but that other , unspecified e-mails also had been subpoenaed by a federal grand jury investigating Arpaio 's office .
The two sets of e-mails may overlap , but county officials will not reveal the contents of the latest subpoena .
Judge Theodore Borek , who was assigned to the computer case last year , granted the order of protection and set a hearing for Wednesday in Tucson .
Eric Dowell , an attorney representing the Sheriff 's Office , said the Sheriff 's Office was not aware that its e-mails had been archived since August 2008 , following an order by another attorney for the county in an unrelated lawsuit involving county officials .
" They never once told anybody that for the last two and half years , they 've been backing up every single e-mail , " Dowell said .
" If some attorney is looking at my attorney - client e-mails , there are going to be some ethical problems . "
Dowell said the initial request for e-mails was based on word searches relevant to the racial - profiling case .
But he did not know the extent of the federal grand jury subpoena .
" We do n't know what the county has turned over , but what we do know is that someone at ( the U.S. Department of Justice ) is reviewing the e-mails , " he said .
But Pace said that e-mail from all county departments except the County Attorney 's Office and the libraries are archived in the same manner .
And Pace said that the backup e-mails are on data tapes that are inaccessible to the company that maintains them .
" They can't read them and do n't read them , " she said .
" Only they ( the Sheriff 's Office ) know what 's in those e-mails . "
Statement from Ambassador Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame Wilson :
Karl Rove ’s book " Courage and Consequence " is less memoir than hoax .
The chapters that relate to the CIA leak scandal are yet another attempt to deflect attention from his central role in the betrayal of Valerie Plame Wilson ’s identity as a covert CIA officer .
His distortions and fabrications are consistent with his approach throughout this sordid and criminal affair .
Wasting his opportunity to tell the truth , he offers absolutely nothing new , and his selective use of facts and quotes are a transparent effort to continue his long campaign to confuse people , unfortunately consistent with his past behavior .
His book is a pathetically weak defense of the disastrous policies pursued by the Bush administration , involving our country in a war of choice based on false intelligence and badly tarnishing the good name of the United States of America .
Nothing in Karl Rove 's book refutes those facts .
His book , however , is illuminating in further exposing his political methods , especially his reliance on personal insults , not simply towards Valerie and myself , but also towards all those who opposed his unprincipled behavior .
If any additional proof to the irrefutable historical record were needed , Rove 's book demonstrates once again the actions of a vindictive , angry and petty man .
Karl Rove betrayed his nation ; now he has betrayed history .
CIA officers in Afghanistan were so eager to meet the spy they believed would help them crack al - Qaida ’s leadership they planned a birthday celebration for his visit in December , current and former U.S. officials said .
A birthday cake was waiting .
But before they could even begin to question their golden source , he detonated a powerful bomb , killing himself and seven CIA employees in one of the deadliest attacks in the agency ’s history .
ADVERTISEMENT
Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al - Balawi , a 36 - year - old doctor who had been recruited by Jordanian intelligence officials , was really a double agent .
The account of the planned birthday gathering is the latest evidence that CIA officials at the Afghan base trusted the Jordanian and wanted to build rapport with him .
It was confirmed by current and former officials briefed on the case , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter .
The bombing not only weakened U.S. intelligence operations , it touched off a sometimes contentious debate within the close - knit intelligence community about whether such emotions led the CIA to be too lax with its security .
CIA Director Leon Panetta has scoffed at suggestions that security lapses were to blame for the attack .
But it remains unclear why there was such a large contingent around al - Balawi when the bomb erupted .
It ’s not unusual for CIA officers to offer gestures such as a birthday cake or a small gift for spies they are overseeing , former intelligence officials said .
Such gestures lighten the mood and take some of the pressure off .
And they tell an informant that he ’s important .

“ Normally , though , that ’s something you do after you ’ve established a relationship , ” said former CIA and National Security Council official Bruce Riedel , who was not aware of the CIA ’s birthday plans for al - Balawi .
“ It ’s not something you do on the first date . ”
Such celebrations are typically discreet , small affairs of one or two officers .
In this case , many officials were nearby when al - Balawi arrived at the base .
Seven were killed and six others were wounded .
In an interview made public after his death , al - Balawi said he knew in advance that he was meeting “ an entire CIA team . ”
He said he had been planning to kidnap or kill his Jordanian intelligence contact , but the chance to take out CIA officers was too tempting .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We planned for something but got a bigger gift , a gift from Allah , who brought us , through his accompaniment , a valuable prey : Americans , and from the CIA , ” al - Balawi said .
“ That ’s when I became certain that the best way to teach Jordanian intelligence and the CIA a lesson is with the martyrdom belt . ”
Al - Balawi ’s contacts with Jordanian intelligence , one of the CIA ’s most trusted partners in the Middle East , gave him credibility .
He was thought to have critical intelligence about al - Qaida ’s No. 2 official , Ayman al - Zawahri .
He was not searched .

Shortly after the attack , Panetta pushed back against criticism that poor spycraft was to blame .
“ That ’s like saying Marines who die in a firefight brought it upon themselves because they have poor war - fighting skills , ” Panetta wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece .
Robert Baer , a former top Middle East CIA operative , heaped criticism on the agency in this month ’s GQ magazine .
Baer said the top officer at the base “ was in over her head ” and never should have let so many people meet the source .

“ Informants should always be met one - on - one , ” Baer wrote .
“ Always . ”
CIA spokesman George Little had harsh words for former employees who criticized the agency from retirement .
“ They do n’t have all the facts of this case , yet they criticize those who were on the front lines on Dec. 30 , including some whose lives were taken .
That ’s disgraceful , ” Little said .
“ Informed criticism can be very valuable , ” he said .
“ Some of the junk I ’ve seen in the press clearly is n’t . ”
They could market ShaveMate on their own through shavemate.com and specialty retailers like hotels , airport stores and cruise ships , using their tagline , “ The future of shaving is here . ”
This was the most affordable option , costing an estimated $ 100,000 to produce razors for the initial stock , displays and promotions , but it would take a while to build the brand and increase sales .
Finally , they could initiate a two - pronged marketing attack for about $ 1 million , looking for a big splash with a low - cost specific public relations effort to put ShaveMate in front of print editors and TV producers .
Then they could begin a national , as - seen - on - TV campaign on cable channels to educate consumers via two - minute commercials on how their product could simplify shaving .
The goal would be to have a well - known spokesman promote the razors .
THE DECISION
The Tomassettis picked the two - pronged attack .
All new revenue would feed the marketing beast , and the brothers hoped to build recognition quickly .
The blitz to send out samples and promotional material paid immediate dividends : ShaveMate Diva 6 appeared in the Love That section of O , the Oprah Magazine .
Local news stations tested ShaveMate razors on the air .
“ Live With Regis and Kelly ” featured Diva .
Producers of the Discovery Channel program “ PitchMen , ” heard about ShaveMate , and in February 2009 , they invited the brothers to California to try out for the show .
Billy Mays , the face of OxiClean , and Anthony Sullivan , also a pitchman , were the hosts who would decide which inventors had a marketable product .
Image After years of research and development , the brothers took their razors to the military in 2002 because they had heard that soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan were dry shaving .

“ When we auditioned , they literally went crazy , ” Louis recalled .
“ They said this is a monster hit . ”
The brothers would be included on the show and Mr. Mays and Mr. Sullivan were both going to be spokesmen .
Mr. Mays said , according to the Tomassettis , that he loved the product so much he was going to shave his beard with a ShaveMate on national TV .
He would be the face of ShaveMate .
French salt has long been an essential element in recipes for country cooking .
It is the ultimate condiment that has to be used in an appropriate manner for it to make a mark .
To help you out with this , here are some guidelines to follow .
The first thing you should know about french salt is that you should always use the properly sized granules .
Never use too much of it because you will dilute it .
Furthermore , never put too little .
Too little will dilute it too much .
The second thing you should know is what kind of seasoning your recipe calls for .
Many types of recipes call for sea salt , which is a mixture of sodium chloride and sea salt .
For this reason , you should never use regular table salt .
Table salt is made up of tiny impurities , so you can achieve a better flavor with fleur de sel , or fleur de sel salt .
Fleur de sel salt is a unique type of salt with its distinctive gray flecks .
Fleur de sel is more expensive than regular table salt , but it can last a long time when placed in the refrigerator or freezer .
Another thing you should know is that although the salt is commonly used in many recipes , the quality of the food it is used to also determine the quality of the salt .
If the recipe does n't specifically state that it is " fleur de sel , " then it 's best to assume that it is not good enough .
Fleur de sel is better than sea salt , but it is still not as good as table salt .
Some chefs actually put fleur de sel in all of their dishes when they have to serve different dishes at different times of the day .
This is to help establish a uniform taste across the entire course .
In addition , the size of the salt is important .
Just like the amount of seasoning in the food , the size of the salt also depends on the recipe .
Finally , it is important to note that there are two other forms of salt that are used in cooking .
These are the medium - sized salts and the small - sized salts .
In most cases , large table salt and small table salt are used interchangeably , as they have similar properties .
It is best to use the small - sized salt when you are using it in a recipe where the amount of salt is greater than that in large - sized salt .
For example , if you are using large table salt to flavor a large chunk of meat , then small table salt is fine .
This will prevent the large salt from causing a salmonella outbreak in your cooking kitchen .
The same holds true when it comes to the amount of salt that is used in the food .
Large amounts of salt should be used to flavor large quantities of food .
Small amounts of salt should be used for smaller portions of food .
There are also some cooking methods that will require you to use large amounts of salt .
For example , when you are grilling or pan-frying , you can use either large or small amounts of salt .
Using fleur de sel is one of the most important things you should learn when it comes to making good use of it .
Take a look at the salt to see what the difference is between small and large - sized salts .
Pressure was mounting today on David Cameron over claims his aides had encouraged the rightwing media to publish smear stories against the Liberal Democrat leader , Nick Clegg .
Clegg 's election coordinator , Danny Alexander , said it appeared that the Tory high command had orchestrated a campaign of negative stories in the run-up to last night 's debate in an attempt to neutralise his surge in the polls .
The accusation came as polls revealed that neither Clegg nor Cameron could claim a clear win from last night 's debate .
Provisional viewing figures showed 4 million people watched the debate across the three channels that carried it live : Sky News , Sky Three and the BBC News channel .
A further 300,000 watched a repeat on BBC2 .
Sky came under fire for stoking the anti-Clegg campaign , with more than 100 people complaining to the TV regulator , Ofcom , about the conduct of the debate moderator , Adam Boulton .
It is being alleged that Boulton , Sky 's political editor , breached the strict rules governing the debate by raising with Clegg the front page of yesterday 's DailyTelegraph .
The paper carried a story relating to donations to pay for a member of staff , which were paid into Clegg 's personal bank account .
The donations were all properly declared , and there has been no suggestion that the money was used for any other purpose .
Clegg has denied doing anything wrong .
Alexander said : " I think that now what it looks like is that the first act that team Cameron took after his pledge to redouble the positive was to try and orchestrate a media smear campaign against us which had the effect of quadrupling the negative .
" George Osborne needs to come clean as to whether he himself was personally responsible for this negative media smear campaign , which is now backfiring spectacularly with voters . "
He said the campaign reflected " a panic in the old political establishment that they are in a battle for survival " .
" If Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems are able to change the way things work in this country in ways we have prepared to do , they see it as a huge threat , " he added .
" The election now is between hope and fear and the vested interests are frightened the people might make their own choice . "
Four newspapers ran attacks on Clegg on the eve of the debate , including claims that he was funnelling money from businessmen into his private bank account and that he had committed a " Nazi slur " against the British people .
Osborne met some political editors on Monday and discussed the party 's response to the Lib Dem surge .
In one paper , a strategist was reported as expressing the hope that the media would do the Tory party 's dirty work .
There is no evidence that Osborne made this remark or that Conservative headquarters fed any story to any paper .
During a press conference convened to accuse Labour of " scaremongering " regarding the elderly in their campaign literature , the Tory chairman , Eric Pickles , and the shadow schools secretary , Michael Gove , were forced to defend the Conservatives from accusations they were involved in the onslaught of negative press against Clegg and his party .
" We 've been insistent this week that we wanted to redouble the positive , " Gove said .
" That 's one reason why David Cameron did so well [ in the debate ] .
You 'll see that the Daily Telegraph story came from their groundbreaking expenses investigation .
If you look at the other stories , they related to things in the public domain .
We have been responding to dealing with the electoral landscape as it is by emphasising the positive .
" All the stories which appeared were based on material which either the Telegraph has secured based on its own research , or information in the public domain – articles Nick Clegg has written , policies the Liberal Democrats have .
This is the press operating in the way it always has , putting all politicians from all parties under scrutiny . "
Pickles added : " We have a free and vigorous press , and beware of politicians who tells you that the press have gone too far .
Beware of politicians who want to put restraints on the press .
We do n't complain when articles are written about us and we might be unhappy about it . "
When challenged by one journalist on whether this was true , he said : " Well , we do n't go too far – we might be occasionally a bit unhappy , but we do n't think it 's a great conspiracy .
" This is not Zimbabwe or the Soviet Union .
No political party , no government controls the press .
" The Daily Mail , the Daily Telegraph , the Express , the Times , the Sun , the Financial Times ... all these newspapers are edited by grown - ups and read by grown - ups who make their own minds up . "
The bra advert with the fuller - sized model that proved a little TOO hot for American TV
An advert for plus - size bras has been banned on American television because it is thought to be too raunchy for viewers
Network executives pulled the commercial starring full - figured model Ashley Graham over fears that it was revealing just too much cleavage .
Plus - size lingerie firm Lane Bryant was planning to air the advert this week during a break in Dancing With The Stars .

But ABC network chiefs refused to screen it , sparking claims that they were discriminating against larger models .
A source at Lane Bryant said : ' The cleavage of the plus - size model , they said , was excessive , and we do n't think that 's the case .
' It certainly appears to be discrimination against full - sized women . '
The 25 - second advert shows Ashley in a series of poses in Lane Bryant underwear .
A voiceover says : ' Mom always said beauty is skin deep .
Somehow , I do n't think this is what mom had in mind . '

Lane Bryant said the Fox network also originally refused to show the ad during American Idol and insisted on the advert being re-edited .
They finally agreed to feature it during the final ten minutes of the show .
A Lane Bryant spokesman said : ' We knew the ads were sexy , but they are not salacious .
[ caption ]
' Our new commercials represent the sensuality of the curvy woman who has more to show the world than the typical waif - like lingerie model .
' What we did n't know was that the networks , which regularly run Victoria 's Secret and Playtex advertising on the very shows from which we 're restricted , would object to a different view of beauty . '
A Fox spokesman insisted : ' We did n't treat them any differently than Victoria 's Secret . '
ABC declined to comment .
This Move Is Just Ridiculous ( GIF )
When it comes to skateboarding , highlights often come in the form of nasty spills that result in busted arms or broken ankles .
However , there are also times when we are treated to something that is simply incredible .
I think it ’s fair to say that this is one of those moments .
I do n’t believe this move has a name .
After all , there has never really been a need to name it when you consider the fact that there is probably only a very select few that would even attempt it .
So how about we just call it the “ front - flip over ten flights of stairs and onto your skateboard jump ” for now .
That may seem a little long , but seeing as how this guy might be the only one to ever land it successfully , I do n’t think we will be saying it too often .

Well , I do n't know how to put this , but after being so accomodating for so long , I have finally come to terms with the fact that Ms B's behaviour in bed , is ...... hmm , let 's just call it unconventional .
Despite my patience , I do n't think she will be able to change .
Ever since
Ms B and I first consumated our relationship , I was quite struck by her imobility in bed .
She is completely non-tactile , and she just does n't move .
This is not to say that she does n't enjoy sex , which she does , but the act of sex for us is not based on mutual reciprocation .
I am the active party and she simply lies there and enjoys it .
I have tried encouraging her to simply touch me during the act , so that we can experience the intimacy of being together , but try as she may , it seems as though it just makes her very uncomfortable .
It goes without saying of course that other sexual pleasures of a more engaging nature are out of the question .
Ms B also considers full - mouth kissing as unhygenic , and simply cannot bring herself to kiss in that manner .
This inability to be tactile is however not a hallmark of our relationship outside of the bedroom .
Ms B loves to hold hands , lie on the couch toghether , and cuddle each other late at night .
This sexual dynamic is something that of course I must live with , but it is uncoventional and not what I expected .
Now this of course begs the question as to whether the multitude of Chinese women who wear sexually provocative clothing also behave in such a non-tactile manner in bed .
This I do not have an answer for , but it is an interesting question .
Humans have very limited ability to regenerate heart muscle cells , which is a key reason why heart attacks that kill cells and scar heart tissue are so dangerous .
But damaged heart muscles in the amazing , highly regenerative zebrafish have given Duke University Medical Center scientists a few ideas that may lead to new directions in clinical research and better therapy after heart attacks .
" Our hearts do n't seem so complex that they should n't have the capacity to regenerate , " said Kenneth Poss , Ph.D. , senior author of the study in Nature and professor of cell biology at Duke .
The data in this study showed that the major contributors to the regeneration of surgically removed heart muscle came from a subpopulation of heart muscle cells ( cardiomyocytes ) near the area where the removal occurred .
The study appears in the March 25 issue of Nature .
The team labeled cells in the heart and found that cells that activated the gata4 gene upon injury ultimately contributed to regenerating the heart muscle .
The team first used a labeled " fluorescent reporter " fish that shows the presence of gata4 , a gene required for heart formation in the developing embryo .
They found that fluorescence was undetectable in uninjured zebrafish ventricles , but when they clipped a small section of the heart , a subpopulation of cardiac muscle cells along the outer wall of the ventricles began to fluoresce .
Some of these cells near the removal site ultimately proliferate and integrate into the wound , replacing the injury clot .
advertisement
" We do n't know the instructions or the mechanisms yet that mobilize these cells or cause them to proliferate , but we now know that they are the cells that are participating in new muscle growth , " said Poss , who is also an investigator in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
Finding a key origin of heart muscle provides a target for studies that will help scientists understand cardiac muscle regeneration , said lead author Kazu Kikuchi , a postdoctoral fellow in the Poss lab .
" By studying this important cell population , we expect results that could help in the repair of diseased human hearts . "
The team uncovered other interesting findings .
They still needed to know whether the new cardiomyocytes were connecting in a useful way to the muscle that was spared by injury .
They found that within two weeks of the injury , the new heart cells started to show normal electrical coupling needed to keep the heart beating in rhythm .
A month later , the electric coupling was the same as in the uninjured heart , Poss said .
" This is the first evidence that I know of that the new cardiomyocytes do become electrically coupled .
It 's exciting because the new muscle has to approach the functional level of the existing muscle to be of use . "
This experiment was done in collaboration with colleagues at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston .
Another finding was that the fish heart muscle found a way to work around scar tissue , a finding with interesting implications for the human heart , which stubbornly scars after heart muscle dies during a heart attack .
Poss and the team found a genetic way to manipulate the zebrafish to slow down the regenerative process and form cardiac scars after tissue removal , which they normally do n't do .
advertisement
The scientists were able to make the tissue form a scar by blocking a certain genetic signaling pathway .
Then they returned the activity of the pathway to the animal to learn whether regeneration could occur after scar tissue formed .
The manipulation worked , and the researchers saw the gata4 label expressed in cells near the scar .
They could also see a wall of new muscle forming around the scarred tissue removal site .
" I think this experiment is relevant to a lot of heart attack victims who have established scars , " Poss said .
" We would like to know ultimately to what extent regenerative therapy of the heart could help people who have lived with scars for a long time .
When we allowed the regenerative signaling pathway to remain active after the scar was formed , we did n't see removal of scar tissue , but we did see improvements in the tissue near those injuries . "
Poss said there is more to learn from the zebrafish .
" We want to know the sources of all of the different cell types in the regenerated heart tissue , and the molecular events responsible for activating those sources , " he said .
" There is a lot left to learn about the mysterious regenerative abilities of animals like zebrafish and salamanders . "

Nine activists protesting state Senator Russell Pearce 's anti-immigrant bill SB 1070 chained and locked themselves to the doors of the Arizona Capitol today , forcing the Capitol Police to use bolt cutters to unchain the nine and arrest them for disorderly conduct .
As a demonstration of hundreds denouncing SB 1070 raged on the state House lawn , the nine twenty - somethings sat silent and stone - faced , waiting to be taken away .
Some moved their lips in prayer , as reporters and activists crowded around them .
One activist separate from the group handed out a statement from the nine , calling for " massive and ongoing civil disobedience to be organized all over Arizona and the rest of the nation . "
The press release further read , " A people can only remain oppressed for so long before they rise from the shadows , from the margins , from oblivion ... We chain ourselves to the Arizona State Capitol because nothing else has worked . "
( You can read the entire statement , here . )
Capitol Police Commander Andrew Staubitz told reporters that the nine would be transported to Maricopa County 's Fourth Avenue Jail to be booked .
Asked why he did n't cite and release the nine , Staubitz said that they were told they would be arrested if they did not unchain themselves .
When they did not comply , they were taken into custody .
The nine protesters were later marched out of the old Capitol building in handcuffs , singing " We Shall Overcome , " and chanting , " Veto 1070 , " a reference to the anti-immigrant legislation now on Governor Jan Brewer 's desk that would make it illegal to be in the state of Arizona without proof of citizenship or legal residency .
They were then loaded onto a black sheriff 's department bus .
Demonstrators met them outside , cheering them like heroes .
This list of their names was acquired from one of the lawyer 's representing them , Antonio Bustamante : Faviola Augustin , Leilani Clark , Daisy Cruz , Gregorio Montes de Oca , Justine Garcia , Ernesto Lopez , Rubin Lucio Palomares , Jr. , David Anthony Portugal , Jr. , and Armando Rios .
Present for the rally outside was organizer / activist Alejandro Chavez , grandson of civil rights leader Cesar Chavez , who said the protest was very much in the spirit of his late grandfather .
I asked him if he thought we would see more civil disobedience if Governor Brewer signs the bill or lets it become law without her signature .
" I do , " he said .
" The important thing is that we do it in a peaceful , nonviolent manner .
It 's important for people to listen .
If there 's violence , people shut off their ears .
My grandfather said that nonviolence is our greatest strength .
That 's more important now than it 's ever been before . "
There is some sort of element to competition to life .
" Oh that ’s not natural , " [ says the squishy - sounded liberal ] .
Oh really ?
Go out and watch the lions eat the weakest .
And that is what America is missing right now .
The ability and willingness to compete !
To even admit that there ’s a competition .
Got that ?
What America is really missing is lions eating the weakest .
" Everyone wo n’t get a trophy , " he says , conflating reward with survival .
" We should be correcting our children ’s work in red ink again ...
" ' Well that ’s a little traumatic , ’ " [ says the liberal ] .
" You know what ’s even more traumatic ?
When little Johnnie keeps getting these answers wrong and he goes out into the big bad world and he ’s EATEN . "
Beck relishes the word eaten , making it sound , not like a tragedy , but like someone more powerful prevailed in an Olympic event .
How does he get away with such blatant championing of this survival - of - the - fittest mentality ?
He moves seamlessly between concepts no one would argue with ( " It ’s not the government ’s job to ensure happiness " ) and pure Randian thought ( " Life is not fair , bad guys sometimes win , and some people will die " ) .
It ’s precisely these sorts of conflations that help the city employee I see regularly behind the counter at the golf course insist that we do n’t have a right to healthcare .
He 's a friendly fellow -- lower middle class , with a job , a house , and healthcare .
A huge Beck fan , he thinks people who do n’t have healthcare or housing are simply not willing to work hard enough because they think they ’re entitled to happiness with the help of the government .
This kind of conflation is mainstream thought today .
" What we do n’t have a right to is healthcare , housing , and hand - outs , " says Beck to wild cheers .
Now , take a second to digest this curious Beckian construction :
You do not have a right to NOT pursue success .
This sentiment is key to understanding the conservative mindset that is so incapable of empathy .
Beck describes his own life challenges , and how he studied successful people to learn how he could succeed .
It ’s the old pulling - yourself - up - by - your - own - bootstraps narrative .
It dismisses the facts that some people are simply unfortunate , some are incapable , and some are attempting to contribute in important ways that are inherently riskier and more difficult than the single - minded pursuit of financial success .
Did you ( for example ) get a degree in literature instead of business ?
In Beck ’s mind , you ’re a parasite and deserve to be eliminated .
Beck talks about growing up above the bakery his family owned .
He said he learned to work hard there , to interact with people , etc .
It never occurs to him that , even though his family might not have been rich , these skills , imparted to him early in life , gave him quite a leg up in the world of competition .
After years of studying how to emerge on top , Beck became one of the world ’s lions .
He 's now fighting ruthlessly to preserve his power .
With the prospect of the pendulum swinging toward a much - needed infusion of progressivism to slow the rapidly widening gap between rich and poor , he ’s leading the Fox News pack tirelessly spreading the narrative that it is perfectly natural and acceptable that some of us get eaten .

Washington ( CNN ) --
An American lawyer has been holding secret negotiations with Iran for the release of an Iranian - American being detained for two years .
Reza Taghavi , a retired businessman from Orange County , California , has been held in Iran 's notorious Evin prison since his arrest in May 2008 without ever being charged , his lawyer said .
Los Angeles - based attorney Pierre Prosper told CNN he has been talking to the Iranian government since September 2009 and traveled to Tehran in December to seek the release of Taghavi , a retired businessman accused of supporting an anti-regime group .
Taghavi , 71 , traveled frequently to Iran to visit family and friends without incident , according to Prosper .
In April 2008 , he went to Tehran with his wife .
Before he left , he was asked by an acquaintance in Los Angeles to take $ 200 for a friend in Tehran " who was down on his luck . "
Los Angeles has a large Persian community .
Taghavi did not know the individual to whom he was asked to deliver the money , Prosper said .
He handed over the money and two weeks later was detained by Iranian authorities , after the recipient of the money was arrested on charges of association with an anti-regime group called Tondar .
The group , which seeks to restore the monarchy in Iran , claimed responsibility for the April 12 , 2008 , bombing of the Hosseynieh Seyed al - Shohada mosque in the city of Shiraz .
Prosper declined to name the man , who he said has since been tried and convicted .
Taghavi has a rag - to - riches story , his 36 - year old daughter , Leila Taghavi , told CNN .
He brought his family to the United States in 1979 , before the revolution , and stayed on in California to keep his family safe .
Leila Taghavi said her father taught himself English , started a video game company in his garage and grew it into a successful corporation , which he handed over to his son when he retired 10 years ago .
" His life was the American dream , " Leila said .
" He learned everything the hard way , sacrificed for his children and taught us to be grateful for the good things .
He is wonderful , honest and generous , the kind of father every daughter would want . "
Taghavi's family was silent for more than a year about his arrest , fearful his arrest would be politicized in Tehran and Washington by getting the American government involved .
" It was blind faith , really , " Leila said , explaining the silence .
" Not knowing it would take this long , and fear of the system .
There was never a doubt of his innocence . "
In September 2009 , with no movement on the case and losing hope he would be released , they hired Prosper to contact the State Department and initiate a dialogue with the Iranian government .
Prosper said he contacted the State Department about seeking a consular visit by Swiss diplomats , which was denied because Iran does not recognize the dual citizenship of Iranian - Americans .
The United States and Iran do not have formal relations , and Switzerland serves as the " protecting power " for the U.S. in Tehran .
A U.S. State Department spokesman urged Iran to allow Swiss diplomats to be granted consular access to Taghavi .
" We are adamant that we believe he should be released on humanitarian grounds along with all the Americans who are unjustly held there , " Mark Toner , a State Department spokesman , told CNN Wednesday .
A senior government official who met with Prosper said the lack of information makes it difficult to help Taghavi .
" As far as we are concerned , there are no facts in the case , " the official said .
" Our concern is that he should get due process . "
Taghavi is one of several Americans in prison in Iran .
American hikers Josh Fattal , Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd were detained on July 31 , 2009 .
According to their families , they accidentally strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while on a hiking trip in Iraq 's Kurdistan region .
They are being held on espionage charges .
Kian Tajbakhsh , an Iranian - American scholar who spent four months in jail in 2007 , was arrested in July after the disputed presidential election and sentenced to 15 years in jail for spying .
His sentence was later reduced by an appeals court to five years , and a State Department official tells CNN he has been released for two weeks from jail to celebrate the Persian New Year .
The United States has no information about Robert Levinson , a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran almost three years ago .
After being hired by Taghavi family last September , Prosper said he contacted the Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations and was granted a meeting with the ambassador , who eventually put him in touch with Iran 's foreign ministry .
After several months of weekly contact with Iranian officials in New York and Tehran , Prosper was invited to Iran in December for talks about Taghavi 's case .
Prosper said he was briefed on the Iranian view of the case but was told the authorities were still investigating the matter .
" It 's still not clear what the accusations actually are , " he said .
Prosper left Tehran without being allowed to see Taghavi , but he was taken to visit victims of the 2008 mosque bombing by Tondar in an Iranian effort to show him the threat the regime says it 's facing from " terrorist groups " being financed from sources abroad .
" I think they had me meet with victims and survivors of the bombing to let it be known that they , too , in their eyes had experienced terrorism , " Prosper said .
It is unclear why the Iranian government invited Prosper , who served as the ambassador - at - large for war crimes under the Bush administration and as a prosecutor for the Rwanda tribunal at the Hague , for talks in Iran .
Beyond talking about the case and attacks at the hand of the Tondar group , Prosper said his Iranian hosts made no effort to broaden the discussions to include the nuclear standoff between Iran and the West or the Obama administration 's offer of engagement .
The facts of the case remain a mystery .
Taghavi's family maintains he is innocent and has never been involved in political activism against the Iranian regime .
Prosper acknowledged the case has been a challenge to investigate because of his inability to question people in Iran and the lack of information from the government or Taghavi 's Iranian lawyers in Tehran , who do n't speak English .
But based on his discussions with the family and his own " due diligence , " Prosper said he believes Taghavi is an innocent man , whose only crime is guilt by association .
As a former prosecutor , Prosper said he believes if the Iranians had a case against Taghavi , they would have already tried him .
He 's seeking a humanitarian release for Taghavi , who suffers from diabetes and whose health is deteriorating in prison , according to his family .
The political upheaval in Iran after the disputed presidential election and subsequent violent crackdown on demonstrators has complicated his efforts , the lawyer said .
" It casts a shadow over our efforts , " Prosper acknowledged .
" What I 've been doing to my best ability is to cut through that , cut through the fog that has been created , focus on Mr. Taghavi and work with the Iranian authorities on the substance of what happened in 2008 . "
Leila Taghavi traveled to Iran last year and was allowed a brief visit with her father in prison .
" I saw him behind a window , " she said , choking back tears .
" It was painful to see your father , an innocent man , behind a window . "
" We are chipping away at this , " Prosper said .
" I want to give them credit for the dialogue , but the proof will be in the results .
We are holding out hope because that is the only thing we can do .
... Effectively his life is at stake . "
Leila spoke with her father by phone Wednesday morning and said he sounded tired and anxious .
" My biggest hope is that this message reaches people and somebody can do something , " Leila added .
" Not just for my father , but for the many people that are trying to get their loved ones out of Iran . "

It may be difficult to confess , but continuing in dishonesty will only make matters worse .
Brace yourself for your partner 's reaction .
Even if she knew that you were lying , talking about it may stir up emotions that you may not otherwise expect such as anger , sadness and hurt .
Trust is an important part of every relationship , and when one partner lies to another , the damage done to their relationship may be irreparable .
Being honest with your partner will start you on the path to repairing your relationship .
Apologize for telling the lie .
Do n't simply apologize because that is what you are supposed to do , but say you are sorry because you really are .
Be open and vulnerable with your partner as you apologize .
Do n't blame him for the lie , but let him know that you understand that lying was the wrong thing to do .
Talk about why you lied .
What caused it ?
Explain that you want to work together toward a more trust - filled relationship .
Apologize for telling the lie .
Do n't blame him for the lie , but let him know that you understand that lying was the wrong thing to do .
Explain to your partner that you hope to never lie to her again .
Talk to her about why you felt that you had to lie .
Discuss the situation and talk about the effects of your lie .
It is good to be realistic and to realize yourself that no one is perfect .
But it is even more important to let your partner know that you do not plan to repeat the same mistakes .
Explain that you are willing to grow and change and to be a better partner for her .
Ask your partner how he feels about the lie .
Listen carefully as he talks and show him that you believe that what he is saying is important .
Be an active listener .
Lean forward and tune in to what he is saying .
Your partner may have a lot to say about this and other issues .
Listening is the most important step toward solving relational problems and in mending the relationship .
Failure to listen may lead you to repeat the same mistakes .
Engage in the conversation .
Ask questions that encourage your partner to continue speaking .
Try not to dominate the conversation , but let him vent .
Explain to your partner that you hope to never lie to her again .
Explain to your partner that you understand that trust may not be instantly regained .
Tell her that you plan to work to rebuild your relationship .
Try to remain honest and to be open and sincere with you partner .
Be realistic .
Be patient with your partner as she works through her feelings .
Show that you are faithful , dependent and truthful more than you were in the past .
Continue to listen to your partner and to respect her feelings .
Communicate with your partner if you feel hurt , ignored or frustrated during the healing process .
This may strengthen your relationship and open up communication barriers between you .
Move over , New Jersey , you 're getting a run for your tax money as the nation 's most dysfunctional state from the once great mecca of commerce and finance known as New York .
Politics in the Empire State has become a carnival of spendthrifts , sexual miscreants and the all - purpose ethically challenged .
In the latest sign that the Apocalypse is upon Albany , New York Governor David Paterson announced yesterday that he wo n't seek election to a full term in November only two weeks after he had announced that he would .
Mr. Paterson , ...
If you ’re a huge Starcraft fan , then you probably have already heard the rumors that something was going down last Monday at Blizzard Headquarters in Irvine regarding your beloved game .
Thanks to Aaron from Starcraft.org , we were given access to see , hear and play the new things that were ready for media personnel in Starcraft 2 ’s first of three single player games .
The first single player game that will be shipping is called Wings of Liberty .
The campaign focuses mainly on the story around the Terrans and James “ Jim ” Raynor .
At the presentation portion of the press event , we were shown two new Terran missions and one new Protoss mission .
The presented 3 new missions
The first of the two Terran missions was a basic mission of killing enemies , in this case Protoss units , and gathering special gases they are trying to defend .
The second mission was another basic defend for “ X ” amount of time mission .
The third presented mission was focused on Zeratul .
In this mission , you do not control any Terran units .
Just Zeratul and some reinforcements that show up along the way through a dark cave filled with Zerg swarm .
For more things we learned about Starcraft 2 during our stay at Blizzard , screenshots , and videos , go past the break .
Notes about Single player mode
A lot has been asked through out the day , and here are the notes I have taken .
Single player mode and multiplayer modes are completely different .
Many upgrades in single player mode are not available in multiplayer due to the very different gameplay styles between both modes .
Single player mode upgrades are just too powerful for multiplayer .
Some upgrades you can get in Single Player mode are : Neo -Steel bunker – Increases number of bunker slot by 2 .
Dual Fusion Welders – SCVs repair twice as fast .
Advanced Construction – Multiple SCVs can work on one building to increase build speed .
The Hyperion has 4 areas to explore .
Bridge – Area to choose which mission you want to go to or see missions you have already completed .
Armory – Area to purchase upgrades to your vehicles , bases , and units .
Laboratory – Area to purchase better buildings and tech using research points .
Cantina – Area to purchase Mercenaries , watch the UNN News , and play The Lost Viking
The UNN News changes every time you complete a mission .
It will show what you have done from a new journalist perspective .
In the back corner of the Cantina area , there is an Arcade cabinet with the game The Lost Viking .
You can walk up to it and play it , but sadly , it was n’t accessible at the time of our hands - on demo .
Mercenaries are just like regular units but with a bit more stat bonuses .
You purchase mercenaries in the Cantina area of the Hyperion .
Once purchased , a mercenary building will appear next to your command center .
Summoning your mercenaries is the same as building any other type of unit .
But instead of waiting , they come out instantly .
Galaxy Editor
After you are done with your custom map , you will be given the option to publish it privately so your friends can test it out before pushing it out publicly for sale in the Battle .
net marketplace .
In the Galaxy Editor , you will be able to create Challenge mode mini games .
A question was asked during the Q&A if you would be able to create your own achievements for your maps , and the answer was “ no . ”
Challenge Mode
Another unique thing the press learned while playing the game was a Challenge mode .
In challenge mode , you have four levels of difficulty with each level having a set of 4 challenges .
You can think of these challenges of more like mini-games .
The only challenge we were able to play was a wave - after - wave type challenge .
You control five Protoss Sentries and five High - Templars .
During each wave , you have a timer that shows how much time is left before the next wave comes .
The more waves of enemies you defeat the hard it becomes .
It is really a good practice for your micro .

Other Notes :
The developers expect the Single Player mode to have at least 20 hours minimum of gameplay .
They also hope that this will get the casual / noob players interested in some multiplayer mode games of 3v3 or 2 v2 , then eventually that player will go into 1v1s .
They also stressed that Single player mode does NOT train you for multiplayer mode games .
The developers have mentioned that they work 12 to 13 hour workdays just on balancing issues alone .
There are tons of data they must go through day to day to make the right decisions on what to nerf and what to buff .
The process of a nerf or buff decisions goes as follows :
Developers check forum posts , suggestions by an office - mate , and stats on Battle . net .
Then they cross reference that with a replay and study the replay thoroughly .
They usually would like to see a replay for live gameplay to study since it does help with their decision .
They have also mentioned that closed beta is not meant for the casual or noob player .
The Closed beta is just a tool that is used for balancing , server load , and battle .
net data .
Making groups , like groups in Steam , within the Battle .
net environment is being looked at but not yet developed .
Battle.net for Starcraft will work just like Battle . net does now for World of Warcraft .
If the servers go down , then no one will be able to play any multiplayer games .
A question was asked about campaign co-op and this is something they have though of about 6 months ago but not high in their priority list .
The doubt they will have something like this ready for shipping .
But , they do want to try to develop this sometime in the future .

Elizabeth Haag used to work for a pickup artist .
After we wrote about female pickup artists ( or the lack thereof ) , she contacted us to tell her story of misogyny , sex in bathroom stalls — and a growing sympathy for men .
Advertisement
For legal reasons , Haag could n't name names or reveal her employer 's trade secrets .
But she could tell us about the disturbing manipulations she witnessed — and about how her feelings about pickup and men in general changed over the course of her job .
Here 's her story .
Last July , I found myself in a Manhattan vodka bar surrounded by pickup artists , dating coaches , a " sex god , " and a handful of novices practicing their newly learned skills .
It was just another day at the office , smack dab in the middle of the year I spent as an assistant to a pickup artist .
I shopped , filed , helped with customer service and aided in the production of our new products .
For the most part , my job was a lot like any other assistant 's — only our products helped guys get laid .
I loved it , especially at the beginning .
It was a young , laid - back company , and I was one of the boys .
The guys spoke openly in front of me , and while I heard some pretty gruesome and graphic sex stuff , I felt like I was privy to the secret world of men .
Over time I began to feel differently , but for a while I felt right at home .
Advertisement
The company was very small .
There was the PUA ( pickup artist - we referred to him as a " dating coach " ) , myself , several trainers , and a very small support staff .
The PUA was about 30 , average - looking , publicly quiet , and unassuming , certainly not what you 'd expect .
And while he may not have fit the stereotype , it did n't take too long to recognize his intelligence or get swept up in his charm and charisma .
Working for him was a lot of fun , and the company , by design , was a place people wanted to hang out .
He had been perfecting his method for years , and now provided clients with books , CDs , and coaching , so that they too could become girl magnets .
Our method was different from what a lot of people think of as " pickup . "
The advice was based on building men up , as opposed to denigrating women .
I suppose that 's why I did n't mind it at first .
A lot of it made sense .
Do n't get me wrong , the people I worked with were not " sweet " guys .
There was one trainer that spoke publicly about how much he loved women , but privately believed any woman approaching thirty was trying to get pregnant and trap a man .
Others considered themselves " old- school " in that they remembered when the community was more about making men better men , but many still had questionable preconceived notions about women .
Still , for the most part , they did n't approve of what a lot of popular PUAs were putting out into the seduction community , ( as far as negging , etc. ) .
During the course of my time there , I learned a lot about PUAs , their customers , the industry , and myself .
Each PUA has a specific persona for a reason , and in most cases these personas work for them and only them , there is a reason the PUA has chosen his particular façade .
For example , the most famous PUA , Mystery , worked as a magician before he got into pickup .
He was comfortable as a magician , so he incorporated it into his pickup artistry .
It worked for him , but it's also why we now see men flubbing magic tricks in bars hoping to impress the ladies .

Upon being hired , I was handed some of our material to study .
I asked my boss if it would it make me hate men .
He thought about it , and with a genuine laugh said , " No , but it may make you hate me . "
I went into the job expecting to be disturbed and disgusted , but was surprised to find that for the most part I was n't .
Weeks of hearing about how to get women into bed , and how to get them addicted to you did n't phase me .
That changed one evening , when a trainer mentioned an article on how to get your ex back .
My blood ran cold .
The thought of my exes having this information was terrifying .
But when I heard the advice , to me , it was sort of common sense .
It was the sort of thing we women tell each other to do all the time .
( Also , it probably would n't have worked on me , anyway .
I 'm a fierce breaker - upper . )
What I came to learn over time was that many men are really clueless about dating , sex and relationships .
They genuinely do n't realize that they stand too close , or touch your arm in a weird way .
They 're baffled by the difference between our flirtatious ribbing and straight - up rejection .
They 're afraid to go in for the kiss because they 're oblivious to all the signals you 've been sending .
Ninety - nine percent of the curriculum did n't bother me at all .
However , the tactics of the trainers and PUAs themselves were a different story — a far more sinister one .
For them , manipulating women was often a game .
They enjoyed seeing how far they could push the limits of their skills .
I met girls that were being cheated on .
I saw texts from women begging to be taken back .
Some of these guys were seeing more girls at one time than you could think possible .
They knew how to get women into bed ( or a bathroom stall for that matter ) in just hours or even minutes .
They had tricks to get girls to pay for things , and techniques to get a girlfriend to agree to a three - way .
They had girls declaring their love after only one encounter , without any reciprocity .
There were stories you could tell a woman to make her panic about losing you every time you left a room , and while I never witnessed this in action , I do n't have a hard time believing it 's the truth .
There are also many men in the seduction community ( not necessarily my company ) that talk a big game , but never see much action themselves .
There were ups and downs regarding how I felt about my colleagues , and at times , men in general .
It 's worth noting , however , that most guys who go to these companies for help are not going to end up sleeping with three different women a day .
They may hope to , but ultimately , they really just want to hook up with a few girls , or find a girlfriend .
I can't fault anyone for wanting that .
Seduction is like any other skill .
Many people study painting , but very few become Picasso .
For the most part , the PUAs and their customers are in different leagues .
The guys that go on to work in the field are generally more skilled with women than their clients will become .
It took a while , but at some point I realized that if I ever wanted to date normally again , I would have to leave my job .
I had a nagging feeling that it was starting to change me .

So , back to that night , in the vodka bar : I was bantering back and forth with an Australian dating coach , and after receiving a few jabs I joked to the other guys that he was " just mad because I rejected him earlier . "
He flipped his shit .
He got loud and aggressive , and very serious about letting everyone in the group know this was untrue .
He followed me around the room for hours alternating between trying to prove my comments had n't bothered him , trying to convince me he had been kidding , and earnestly yelling at me .
Then it dawned on me .
He could n't deal with public rejection .
It is no secret within the seduction community that most PUAs , trainers , and the like are insecure .
Most men get into pickup after a lifetime of rejection , or even being hurt badly by just one woman .
They begin learning pickup as a means of control .
The professional PUAs seem to control every aspect of every relationship they get involved in .
It becomes a defense mechanism gone awry .
Fortunately , they 're the exception and not the rule .
I guess I had always known this , but seeing it play out in real time really solidified it for me .
I 'm happy to no longer work for this company , but I am thankful for the insight it has given me .
Having spent the past year working with our customers ( including guys that just want a girlfriend , guys that got divorced and have no idea what to do , and men trying to get their marriages back on track ) , I have a new point of view .
I have a lot more empathy and respect for a guy that walks all the way across a dance floor to say hi , because I realize how hard this can be for many men .
However I 'm also more apt to see the darker side : the depths some men will go to control a woman .
And I assure you , they are deep .

" I just finished eating six hot dogs . "
These are the words of Jim Harrison , a friendly 22 - year - old , university student who is in the midst of a quest to eat 450 hot dogs during the month of April .
If he is successful , he will win $ 1,500 , courtesy of a soon - to - be roommate who placed the bet with him at the end of March .
If he wimps out , Harrison will be obliged to pay $ 1,000 for welching on the bet .
During a recent telephone interview , Harrison said he has been eating six hot dogs per meal , three times a day .
It 's an aggressive pace that he needs to keep if he is going to eat his way to victory .
" It 's been a lot easier than I thought it was going to be , " Harrison told CTV.ca from Hamilton , where he lives in a student house near McMaster University .
Before the bet , Harrison typically would eat two hot dogs if he was at a barbeque , though he believes he may have eaten three hot dogs on a handful of prior occasions .
As of Friday morning , he 's managed to down 317 hot dogs in just over three weeks .
But that means he still has 133 to go .
Origins of the ‘ hot dog prop bet '
It all started when he and a friend found themselves with a fortuitous windfall of cash , courtesy of online poker winnings .
Armed with the newfound cash , one joked that the other should spend his poker money on hot dogs .
Then they began to speculate on how many hot dogs a person could eat in a month .
Next the conversation turned to more concrete numbers , as they began debating how many hot dogs Harrison could eat in a month and how much cash would be involved .
His roommate put the hot dog number at about 480 , but Harrison said he " haggled him down " to a measly 450 .
With 3 - 2 odds in place and the cash payout set , the so - called " hot dog prop bet " was born .
" The money is important to me , " said Harrison , whose two - month summer job does n't begin until July .
Then came the rules , which came into effect two days later when the third - year multimedia student began chowing down on the Schneiders Red Hots he and his roommate purchased for the bet .
Rule # 3 : You can only throw up four times
Harrison has to eat each hot dog in front of a web cam , to prove that he actually digested it .
He can eat a hot dog off - camera if technical difficulties prevent him from recording the event .
Each hot dog has to be accompanied by a bun and Harrison can put whatever toppings on it that he wants .
He can throw up a maximum of only four times during his hot dog odyssey .
The advantage here , is that he does n't have to re-eat any hot dogs that he lost from his system .
Harrison is not , however , allowed to throw up on purpose .
He has to finish up his eating by 11:59 p.m. on April 30 .
Fame , friends and family
Champion hot dog eaters have made headlines , even before Harrison and his gargantuan eating goal came along .
Takeru Kobayashi made a name for himself in the United States , after winning Nathan 's Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest in July 2001 .
Kobayashi , whose nickname is " The Tsunami " , would win for six straight years , until he was bested by Joey Chestnut , a California man who beat him in July 2007 .
Chestnut and Kobayashi , are currently ranked No. 1 and No. 2 , respectively , by the New York - based Major League Eating , which bills itself as " the world body that oversees all professional eating contests . "
The official Major League Eating website says that Chestnut currently holds the record for hot dog eating , when he ate 68 of them in a 10 - minute period last summer .
Harrison said he did not research the strategies employed by competitive eaters before diving into his own bet , but believes the process that Kobayashi and Chestnut go through is " more of a sprint than a marathon . "
His own contest has won him little acclaim , outside of a radio interview and a mention on a blog covering the poker world .
But there is the notability he has gained on the Internet .
A Google search of the words " hot dog bet " results in Harrison 's story showing up in the top three hits .
If you search " hot dog prop bet , " his story is mentioned in each of the top five .
Some people have jokingly told him " this will kill me , " said Harrison .
And then there was his family .
His dad found out about the bet and telephoned Harrison while he was in the middle of eating a hot dog in front of his web cam .
" Dad said : ‘ I 'm watching you right now , ' " Harrison said , noting that the odd contest of intestinal durability has won his father 's support .
But his mom did n't agree .
" She was not pleased at all , " he said .
Hot dogs and …‘ health '
Harrison admits the hot dog prop bet is not the first time he 's kept to an unconventional diet .
He claims to have once made 32 visits to McDonalds in a single month , in addition to " September 09 " when he also ate at McDonalds every day .
While his mom expressed concerns about his health during his current dietary departure , Harrison admits even he has thought about the issue .
Harrison considered going to a doctor , but concluded it could affect his ability to win .
" I did n't want to go before and freak myself out , " he said , noting that he plans to visit a physician after the end of the month .
Overall , he feels pretty good and said he has gained only a pound overall .
" I 've been eating more fruits and vegetables than I ever have , " Harrison said .
But he admits it 's " not going to ever balance out " in the end .
Leslie Beck , a Toronto - based nutrition expert and registered dietician , said Harrison 's diet is far from ideal .
" From a heart - health perspective , it 's horrendous , " Beck told CTV.ca in a recent telephone interview , citing the high levels of sodium and saturated fats in the hot dogs and buns .
Based on the type of hot dogs Harrison is eating , Beck estimates he is likely taking in a week 's worth of sodium in a single day , as well as three times the amount of saturated fats that he should be consuming on a daily basis .
" Thank goodness he 's doing it on a short - term basis , " she said .
Somehow , a reporter gets the impression that with dozens of hot dogs already devoured , Harrison seems to have the right constitution to win .
" The fact that it 's gross does n't seem to bother me , " he said .
Asked what he is going to eat when it's all over , Harrison initially says he might go out for " a quarter - pounder meal from McDonalds . "
On further reflection , however , Harrison might consider eating a nice breakfast .
Or anything really , so long as it " does n't taste anything like a hot dog . "
One of the avenues of approach taken by “ birthers ” in their quest to demonstrate that Barack Obama is not eligible to hold the office of President of the United States is to try to demonstrate that , even if he was born in the United States , he gave up his U.S. citizenship somewhere along the way … and if he ’s not a U.S. citizen , then he ca n’t legitimately be President of the United States .
Therefore , many birthers gleefully seized onto a supposed news report from April 2009 , which purported that Barack Obama attended Occidental College in Los Angeles under a scholarship granted only to students of “ foreign citizenship ” :
April 1 , 2009 Final Nail In Obama ’s Lack Of US Citizenship Coffin ?
AP — WASHINGTON D.C. :
In a move certain to fuel the debate over Obama ’s qualifications for the presidency , the group Americans for Freedom of Information has released copies of President Obama ’s college transcripts from Occidental College .
Released today , the transcript indicates that Obama , under the name Barry Soetoro , received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate at the school .
The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California .
The transcript shows that Obama ( Soetoro ) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program .
To qualify , for the scholarship , a student must claim foreign citizenship .
This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama ’s detractors have been seeking .
The news has created a firestorm at the White House as the release casts increasing doubt about Obama ’s legitimacy and qualification to serve as president .
When reached for comment in London , where he has been in meetings with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , Obama smiled but refused comment on the issue .
Meanwhile , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs scoffed at the report stating that this was obviously another attempt by a right - wing conservative group to discredit the president and undermine the administrations efforts to move the country in a new direction .
Britain ’s Daily Mail has also carried the story in a front - page article titled , Obama Eligibility Questioned , leading some to speculate that the story may overshadow economic issues on Obama ’s first official visit to the U.K .
In a related matter , under growing pressure from several groups , Justice Antonin Scalia announced that the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear arguments concerning Obama ’s legal eligibility to serve as President in a case brought by Leo Donofrio of New Jersey .
This lawsuit claims Obama ’s dual citizenship disqualified him from serving as president .
Donofrios case is just one of 18 suits brought by citizens demanding proof of Obama ’s citizenship or qualification to serve as president .
Gary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation of Obama ’s campaign spending .
This study estimates that Obama has spent upwards of $ 950,000 in campaign funds in the past year with eleven law firms in 12 states for legal resources to block disclosure of any of his personal records .
Mr. Kreep indicated that the investigation is still ongoing but that the final report will be provided to the U.S. attorney general , Eric Holder .
Mr. Holder has refused to comment on the matter .
However , this item was n’t a news report at all — it was a hoax whose elements were all demonstrably false :
The article was datelined “ April 1 , 2009 ” and tagged “ AP , ” supposedly signifying it came from the Associated Press news agency .
The date was a giveaway to the hoax ( it ’s April Fool ’s Day ) , and the text of the article does not at all fit the standard Associated Press stylebook guidelines .
There was no such group as “ Americans for Freedom of Information ” at the time this article began circulating ( although someone has since registered a site using that domain name ) ; in fact , a web site for the then - faux organization was established to poke fun at those who believed it did :
Read these tiny words very closely : the group Americans for Freedom of Information does not exist , just like the supposed “ AP article ” you keep cutting and pasting into e-mails to your irritated family does not exist , just like the “ Daily Mail article ” referenced in the fake “ AP article ” does not exist .
They ’re all fabrications .
Fakes .
Hoaxes .
Ask yourself why you ’re so eager to believe these obvious fakes .
No , really .
Really , really ask yourself .
Barack Obama attended Occidental College in California for two years as an undergraduate from 1979 - 81 under the name Obama , not Soetoro ( the latter is the surname of his Indonesian stepfather , Lolo Soetoro ) :
Occidental has no record of a “ Barry Soetoro ” ever attending [ Occidental ] , nor was there ever any such court order [ requiring the school to turn over his transcripts ] , said Jim Tranquada , Occidental College ’s communications director , who personally answers the inquiries , demands and pleas of people looking for proof that the president is not who he claims to be .
Tranquada said : “ Contemporary public documents , such as the 1979 - 80 freshman ‘ Lookbook ’ [ a guide distributed to incoming freshman ] published at the beginning of President Obama ’s first year at Occidental , list him as Barack Obama .
All of the Occidental alumni I have spoken to from that era ( 1979 - 81 ) who knew him , knew him as Barry Obama . ”
If Barack Obama were an Indonesian citizen , he could n’t possibly have “ received financial aid ” or “ been awarded a fellowship for foreign students ” from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program while attending Occidental as an undergraduate .
Fulbright scholarships for foreign students of Indonesian citizenship are coordinated through the American Indonesian Exchange Foundation ( AMINEF ) , which does not fund Indonesians for undergraduate study in the United States ( only for master ’s or doctorate programs ) .
Barack Obama ’s student records from Occidental College remain unreleased .
He has not chosen to make them public , nor has any court ordered the school to release them .
Searches of newspaper archives and electronic news databases show that neither Britain ’s Daily Mail nor any other major UK newspaper published a front - page article entitled “ Obama Eligibility Questioned ” in 2009 , nor did any such newspaper publish an article consisting of the text reproduced above .
nor any other major UK newspaper published a front - page article entitled “ Obama Eligibility Questioned ” in 2009 , nor did any such newspaper publish an article consisting of the text reproduced above .
Leo Donofrio ’s lawsuit challenging Barack Obama ’s eligibility for the presidency was denied a hearing by the Supreme Court of New Jersey back in December 2008 .
It has not been taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court .
The web site of the United States Justice Foundation includes no report of an “ investigation of Obama ’s campaign spending , ” and the executive director of that organization who is referenced in the e-mail , Gary Kreep , said in response to an inquiry that the e-mail was a hoax .

Variations :
In September 2009 , this item was prefaced with photographs of Barack Obama ’s family ( Barack Obama posing with his mother ; his step - father , Lolo Soetoro ; and his half - sister , Maya ) and an Indonesian elementary school registration form for Barack Obama :
Meet the Soetoros Meet the Soetoros Indonesia
Left to Right : Lolo Soetoro , Stanley Ann Dunham Soetoro , baby Maya Soetoro , and 9 year old Barry Soetoro
This registration document , made available on Jan. 24 , 2007 , by the Fransiskus Assisi school in Jakarta , Indonesia , shows the registration of Barack Obama under the name Barry Soetoro made by his step - father , Lolo Soetoro .
Name : Barry Soetoro
Religion : ….. Islam
Nationality : ….. Indonesian How did little INDONESIAN , Barry Soetoro , ( A.K.A. Barack Obama ) get around the issue of nationality to become president ?
Someone who tells lies is a L __ __ r ?
After her divorce from her first husband , Barack Obama ’s mother married an Indonesian student named Lolo Soetoro who was attending college in Hawaii ; in 1967 the family moved to Indonesia , where Barack attended elementary school in Jakarta until 1971 , when he returned to Hawaii to live with his maternal grandparents .
Much has been made of the above - displayed registration from St. Francis of Assisi School in Jakarta , which ostensibly shows Barack Obama ’s stepfather having listed his stepson ’s nationality as “ Indonesian ” ( thereby supposedly indicating that Barack Obama relinquished his U.S. citizenship at some point )
However , Lolo Soetoro ’s putatively listing his stepson ’s nationality as Indonesian on a school registration form does not in itself demonstrate that Barack Obama was officially regarded as an Indonesian citizen by the government of that country .
In any case it ’s a moot point , since the same form shows that Barack Obama was born in Honolulu , Hawaii , thereby making him a U.S. citizen from birth , and U.S. law states that a foreign nationality acquired through an alien parent does not affect one ’s U.S. citizenship status , nor can a child ’s U.S. citizenship be renounced solely through the actions of his parents :
The automatic acquisition or retention of a foreign nationality , acquired , for example , by birth in a foreign country or through an alien parent , does not affect U.S. citizenship .
The automatic acquisition or retention of a foreign nationality , acquired , for example , by birth in a foreign country or through an alien parent , does not affect U.S. citizenship .
Parents cannot renounce U.S. citizenship on behalf of their minor children .

CONCORD , N.H. — New Hampshire 's House voted Wednesday to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana by adults , but the victory was followed immediately by the governor 's pledge to veto the bill .
The House voted 214-137 to send a bill to the Senate to allow adults to possess one - quarter ounce or less of the substance .
It also would decriminalize transporting less than one - quarter ounce of the drug .
Anyone under age 18 caught with one - quarter ounce or less would be subject to a $ 200 fine .
The youth 's parents would be notified and he or she would have to complete a drug awareness program and community service within one year of the violation .
Failing to comply would result in a $ 1,000 fine .
Wednesday 's vote comes seven months after Gov. John Lynch vetoed legalizing medical use of the drug .
Lynch also opposes the new House bill , and immediately after the House vote said he would veto it .
" Marijuana is a controlled drug that remains illegal under federal law .
I share the law enforcement community 's concerns about proliferation of this drug , " Lynch said .
" In addition , New Hampshire parents are struggling to keep their kids away from marijuana and other drugs .
We should not make the jobs of parents -- or law enforcement -- harder by sending a false message that some marijuana use is acceptable . "
Opponents agreed the bill would send a bad message to New Hampshire citizens , particularly youth .
They said marijuana is addictive and can lead to abusing other drugs .
State Rep. William Butynski , D - Hinsdale , said comparisons should n't be made with the bill approved last year to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes .
That bill required a doctor 's oversight and created centers to dispense the drug .
" There are no controls in this bill , " he said .
He said prosecutors could n't plea bargain because the penalty would be a violation .
Rep. Joel Winters , D - Manchester , said that was the whole point of the bill .
" Prosecutors are n't going to be able to threaten jail time for small amounts of marijuana , " he said .
Winters noted the bill calls for parents to be notified if police catch minors with the drug .
" Parents will tell you they 'd rather deal with this over the kitchen table than in a courtroom , " Winters said .
Decriminalizing marijuana has been debated for years but gained some steam in the Legislature after Democrats took control in 2006 .
The House passed a bill in 2008 that made possession of up to one - quarter ounce of marijuana punishable by a $ 200 fine instead of a misdemeanor that could have resulted in a sentence of up to a year in jail and fines up to $ 2,000 .
The bill did not make an exception for minors .
The Senate killed it after Lynch said he would veto it for sending the wrong message to youth .
Last year , the House killed a decriminalization bill and instead approved legislation to narrow the focus to use by severely ill people .
That bill would have established three nonprofit " compassion centers " to dispense 2 ounces of marijuana every 10 days to severely ill people whose doctors approved the drug 's use .
The state would have licensed the centers and issued identification cards to their staff , approved patients and caregivers .
In vetoing the bill , Lynch cited concerns over distribution and cultivation and the potential for abuse .
He also said the bill did not clearly restrict marijuana use to people suffering severe pain , seizures of nausea .
The House overrode the veto , but the Senate fell two votes short and the bill died .
Bill supporters vowed to bring it back in 2011 .
In the meantime , state Rep. Steven Lindsey , a Keene Democrat , proposed the pending decriminalization measure .
Fourteen states have medical marijuana laws and 13 have decriminalization laws , according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .

A Senate panel will hear complaints on Wednesday from nursing home operators , doctors , nurses and pharmacists that a Drug Enforcement Administration narcotics crackdown has left seriously ill patients crying for pain relief .
The D.E.A. says it is merely enforcing the law that requires pharmacies to wait for prescriptions that are signed by physicians before dispensing potent painkillers like Vicodin , Percocet and morphine .
But the nursing home groups say the new enforcement rules upend many years of practice in which the government informally allowed nurses to speed the process by taking doctors ’ orders orally , or from medical charts , and passing them along to pharmacies , similar to the procedures used in hospitals .
Now many of the nation ’s nursing homes report delays of a day or more in getting pain drugs to patients , according to the Quality Care Coalition for Patients in Pain , a group set up by nursing home operators , pharmacists and nursing groups .

Redwoods in coastal areas are protected from hot , dry summers Scientists in California say a drop in coastal fog could threaten the state 's famed giant redwood trees .
Their study , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , says such fog has decreased markedly over the past 100 years .
The weather records analysed come from the US National Climate Data Centre .
" Fog prevents water loss from redwoods in summer and is really important for the tree and the forest , " said research co-author Professor Todd Dawson .
The team at the University of California , Berkeley was interested in how fog was involved in climate changes on the coast and noticed a drop that they believe could have an effect on the trees .
The scientists say redwoods are concentrated along the coastal areas primarily because they are not as well adapted as other tree species to deal with California 's hot summers .
No extinction threat Dr James Johnstone from the University of Berkeley , who led the research , explained the team had examined tree rings and found signs that reduced fog has had an effect .
" The evidence that you see in the tree rings is consistent with drought stress produced by drought reduction . "
Dr Johnstone thinks drought stress could affect the growth of new trees and the plants and animals that depend on the redwoods .
But he notes that the negative impact on the tree population is , as yet , unproven .
" We 're concerned for certain , we expect some impact on the ecology but we do n't have clear evidence that the redwoods are about to go extinct in the near term . "
" We need further analysis to find out whether the effects are as we expect , " said Dr Johnstone .

It used to be said that men married for sex and women for money .
But marriage is proving an increasingly profitable ­enterprise for a growing number of ­American men who earn less than a ­growing number of better educated spouses – without enduring the social stigma that once afflicted husbands with working wives .
A study of married couples in the US has revealed that the proportion of American wives earning more than their husbands has risen more than five - fold since 1970 .
With that has come greater control by women of household finances .
The study , by the Pew Research Centre in Washington DC , shows that the shift ­follows a reversal in patterns of education .
Today , a majority of wives are as well , or better , educated than their husbands .
" This is a portrait of gender role ­reversals in marriage , " said one of the report 's authors , D'Vera Cohn .
" The larger earner is increasingly likely to be the wife , the better educated partner is likely to be the wife .
" Marriage has been a way for men to raise their economic standing in recent decades when traditionally marriage has been a way for women to increase their economic standing . "
In 1970 , just 4 % of American wives earned more than their husbands .
That figure rose to 22 % in 2007 .
Men are still the bigger earners in one in four marriages but with a far smaller proportion of wives not working , the income gap is smaller .
Most married men did not have a working wife 40 years ago .
Now they do .
Andrew Cherlin , a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University who ­specialises in the study of marriage , said the findings showed a fundamental change in marriage over recent decades .
" It shows a shift in the basic marriage bargain .
Under the old bargain men earned the money and women took care of the house , " he said .
" Now the bargain is that they both work and marriage is a pooling of income .
The two - earner ­couples are the winners .
Increasingly , they are better off . "
From about 1990 , it made economic sense for men to get married as the median income for those who got hitched for the first time rose above those who remained single .
The median income of married women and men , and unmarried women , is about 60 % higher than similar groups in 1970 .
But unmarried men , who once had the financial benefit of not having to support a family , have fallen behind .
Their median income is only up by 16 % .
The report said the economic crisis was " reinforcing these gender reversal trends , because it has hurt employment of men more than that of women " .
The Pew study , based on US census ­statistics for married couples aged 30 to 44 , shows that the changing financial ­fortunes of married couples reflects rising levels of education among women .
Over the past 40 years , there has been a reversal in the pattern of education within marriage .
The number of couples who have equal levels of education has stayed constant at about 53 % .
But in 1970 , 28 % of husbands were ­better educated than their spouses while 20 % of wives had the more advanced ­education .
Now those numbers are reversed .
" Women had more access to ­education in the 60s and 70s , " said Cohn .
" The 70s began an era of great change for women in education and working .
Marriage changes reflect those changes . "
The report added that there was ­evidence from other research that women 's growing economic clout gave them more power within marriage .
A Pew study two years ago found that wives who earned more than their ­husbands were more likely to have decision making power , especially over major purchases and household finances .
In couples where the wife made more money she was then more than twice as likely to make most decisions on ­household finances .
But the report said there was an ­important exception to the rule that ­married people have fared better than unmarried ones .
" Married women without a high school diploma did not make the same gains as more educated women , " it said .
" The stagnant incomes of married women without high school diplomas reflect the poor job prospects of less ­educated men in their pool of marriage partners .
These less educated married women now are far less likely than in the past to have a spouse who works : 77 % did in 2007 , compared with 92 % in 1970 . "
In addition , less educated Americans are less likely to get married .
Forty years ago , education levels had little impact on who got married .
That is no longer true , with university graduates significantly more likely to marry – and each other .
" The university - educated people have been marrying each other and separated from the rest of the population .
We 've seen a shift between the educated and less well off , " said Cherlin .
The report also found that the economic downturn was reinforcing the gender reversal trends as men were more likely to become unemployed .
" Males accounted for about 75 % of the 2008 decline in employment among prime - working - age individuals , " the report said .
How are men taking all this ?
Opinion polls show that there is an expectation among a clear majority of couples that both partners will work , something that was not true in polls as recently as 1988 .
" Certainly there are still some men who are insecure about women who earn more than they do , " said Cherlin .
" But increasingly they are pleased and less pressured than a generation ago .
Fifty years ago a man would be ­embarrassed and ashamed of a woman working .
It was a sign he could n't support his family .
No one thinks that any more . "
Smallville is coming to an end this week , but after ten seasons , the series has to qualify as one of the most successful comic book adaptations ever .
What began as a simple story featuring a high school age Clark Kent and his friends has grown into something much larger .
A decade later , the series has showcased dozens of the most famous heroes and villains in the DC Universe .
Naturally , some of these characters are more faithful to their original comic book counterparts than others .
In this Smallville visual guide , we 've selected some of our favorite heroes and villains from the past ten seasons .
We compare their live - action appearance to the look of the comics , examining which characters succeed , which ones stumble , and why .
Even with as many characters as there are in this list , we still did n't get to every single DC character that appeared on Smallville , and have mostly focused , with some exceptions , on the more outwardly super - powered characters ( sorry , Ma and Pa Kent ! ) .
But if there 's a favorite Smallville character you have that we did n't list , let us know , and we might just add them in a future update .
Clark + Kent
It 's one of the most common complaints we hear about Smallville - " Why has n't Clark put on the costume ? " .
Yes , even after ten seasons and meeting countless other costumed heroes , Clark seemingly has been very reluctant to don the red and blue tights .
In that sense alone he does n't qualify as being completely faithful to the comics .
But strictly comparing Smallville 's Clark Kent to Clark Kent of the comics , there are definitely many shared features .
Tom Welling has the bulky , chiseled features of a Kansas farmboy in a way other live action Superman actors have n't always managed .
Clark 's preference for red and blue clothes is also a continuous tease for the eventual costume change they may or may not ever come .
One aspect of the Clark Kent look that was only recently introduced is the glasses .
In the comics , Clark relies primarily on his glasses and subtle use of posture and body language to distance himself from Superman .
The Clark in Smallville slowly adopted this same strategy , and thus the glasses made their long - awaited debut .
Clark has so far worn two different costumes that blend the Superman design with a more street clothes inspired look .
Instead of a cape and spandex , in Season 9 , Clark prefered a trenchcoat and a shirt with his trademark " S " logo painted on .
In terms of color , this suit actually recalls the comics .
Aside from the trenchcoat , the comic book Clark wore a similar " Kryptonian Life Suit " that helped restore his body after his near - fatal battle with Doomsday
The more recent costume change involves a red leather jacket with the familiar S logo .
This look reminds us a bit of current comic book Superboy Connor Kent 's original costume from the mid-'90s .
It 's also worth pointing out that we have glimpsed the real Superman costume hiding behind ice in the Fortress of Solitude in Season 10 .
This suit looks to be the one worn by Brandon Routh in Superman Returns .
Will Welling 's Clark don this outfit , or is there another new costume in the works for the final episode ?

https://stars.ign.com/objects/922/922093.html'>Lois+Lane</a>
As a non-costumed resident of Metropolis Lois Lane does n't have much in the way of a defined look .
As such , it 's difficult to criticize Smallville for its portrayal of Lois .
In either universe , Lois is a headstrong reporter who wears clothes that accentuate her beauty without flaunting it .
In the comics , the one source of variation In Lois ' over the years has been her hair color .
She debuted with black hair , but during the '70s and ' 80s her hair lightened even as her personality became more forceful .
Lois ' is usually portrayed as having black hair in the current comics , though some artists depict her as a brunette instead .
A similar shift has taken place in Smallville .
Lois debuted in her earlier seasons as a brunette .
However , more recently her hair has become darker , if not fully black .
Lois is often known to briefly adopt costumed identities in the comics , particularly during the freewheeling days of the Silver Age .
This too is referenced in Smallville in the episode " Stiletto " .
In this episode , Lois adopts the identity of Stiletto and briefly wears a black leather costume that fits right in with Clark 's own Matrix - esque costume .
And we 'll get to another DC - influenced alter ego for Lois later in this list ...
<a+class='autolink '+href= '
https://stars.ign.com/objects/921/921082.html'>Lex+Luthor</a>
Lex Luthor is one of the more faithful characters in the show in terms of appearance .
It 's not hard to capture the look of the twisted billionaire industrialist .
As long as you have an intense man with a completely bald head , you have your Lex Luthor .
Lex 's fine business attire only seals the deal .
The comics have gone though a number of varying explanations as to Luthor 's hair loss .
Originally , Lex was a corpulent man who slowly lost his hair due to advancing age .
However , the modern Lex is portrayed as much thinner and fully bald from a young age .
Smallville established that Lex's hair fell out as a result of the meteor shower that brought Clark to Earth .
That 's a better explanation than some of the stories we 've seen .
The most significant difference between Smallville 's Lex and the comic book Lex is that the latter prefers a green and purple ensemble when committing his villainous acts .
Often he dons an armored battlesuit when combating Superman directly .
The Smallville version seems content to stick to dark , well - tailored suits .
With Lex set to return in the series finale , we do n't expect this to change .
<a+class='autolink '+href= '
https://stars.ign.com/objects/923/923987.html'>Supergirl</a>
Clark 's Kryptonian cousin shows many of the same predilections when it comes to appearance .
On a basic level , Kara is similar to her comic book counterpart .
Supergirl is usually portrayed as a tall , leggy blond with good looks and a love of halter tops and mini-skirts .
Smallville has that much down pat .
Like Clark , Kara initially showed little willingness to don a true costume .
Instead , she favored a similar red-and - blue color scheme in her everyday attire .
She also mixed in some white clothes as an homage to the Linda Danvers version of Supergirl .
But when she returned in Season 10 , including her final appearance in the episode " Prophecy , " Kara sometimes wore a blue top and red skirt and boots , which left her but a cape and an S shield away from mimicking the classic Supergirl of the comics .
Hiring 200 goats to do the job of a single lawn mower might sound foolish for a company like Google but they will disagree .
First the news : Google has hired 200 goats from the California Grazing for the purpose of mowing their lawns at their headquarters in Mountain View , California .
Here ’s the reason why they ’ve hired so many “ employees ” to do a simple job :
The cost of bringing in the goats is comparable to hiring lawn mowers for the same job and the green benefits are clear : the goats eliminate mower emissions , reduce noise pollution , restore plant species and fertilize while grazing .
For those who do n’t know , besides this Green initiative , Google also harnesses Solar power through hundreds of large Solar cells installed at their headquarters , the Google Plex .

For all the talk , saber rattling , obstruction and fervent peddling of alternate realities Republicans have engaged in since President Obama took office , one might think they ’d be doing a little better in the polls , even if by merely playing the role of a lesser of two evils in the eyes of the masses .
Not quite .
President Obama is still by far the most national politician in the United States , according to a new CNN poll [ PDF link ] which stacked leading Republicans against the president and asked who respondents would vote for in 2012 .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The poll shows Obama topping Romney 53 percent to 45 percent , beating Huckabee 54 percent to 45 percent , defeating Gingrich 55 percent to 43 percent and topping Palin 55 percent to 42 , ” the network reported .
CNN ’s survey also claims that half of Americans see Sarah Palin as “ honest and trustworthy , ” although a full 69 percent do not believe she is qualified to be president .
The poll also sampled Republicans ’ leanings on who to run against Obama and found conservatives strongly divided .
Overall , former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee came out on top with 24 percent .
Twenty percent favored former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in second place and trailing him at 15 percent was Sarah Palin .
Texas Congressman Ron Paul placed fifth on the survey with eight percent .
The news is certain to cheer the White House , which has seen declining approval ratings ever since Obama took office .
In a Real Clear Politics sampling of all the major polls , Obama scored overall just 46.1 percent : a fact that , in the context of his standing with the opposition ’s top personalities , should speak volumes about the political mood in America .
Dog owners react to the crackdown plans guardian .co.uk
All dogs are to be compulsorily microchipped so that their owners can be more easily traced under a crackdown on dangerous dogs to be unveiled today .
The package will include extending the dangerous dogs law to cover attacks by dogs on private property to protect postmen , and making third - party insurance compulsory so that victims can be financially compensated .
The measures will be set out by the home secretary , Alan Johnson , who will point to rising public concern that " status dogs " are being used by some irresponsible owners to intimidate communities or as a weapon by gangs .
The RSPCA says the number of complaints about dog fights has risen 12 - fold between 2004 and 2008 .
In London alone , police seized 900 dangerous dogs in the last year .
Johnson is expected to give details of the package in a speech on crime and antisocial behaviour .
" Britain is a nation of animal lovers , but people have a fundamental right to feel safe on the streets and in their homes , " he said .
" The vast majority of dog owners are responsible , but there is no doubt that some people breed and keep dogs for the sole purpose of intimidating others , in a sense using dogs as a weapon . "
He said ministers were determined to stamp this out .
The crackdown has been endorsed by the environment secretary , Hilary Benn .
The package is expected to also include proposals to give police and councils more powers to tackle the problems of dangerous dogs by introducing dog control notices ; consider removing exemption rules that allow some people to keep banned types of dogs ; and introduce compulsory third - party insurance so victims of dog attacks are financially compensated .
Under the scheme a microchip the size of a grain of rice is injected under the skin of the dog between its shoulder blades .
The chip contains a unique code number , the dog's name , age , breed and health as well as the owner 's name , address and phone number .
When the chip is " read " by a handheld scanner the code number is revealed and the details can be checked on a national database .
Many dog owners already microchip their dogs with the details logged on the national PetLog database .
Vets , dog wardens and RSPCA branches offer the service at a cost of £ 10 to £ 35 .
The practice appeals especially to those who take their dogs abroad .
If the scheme were made compulsory owners would face a fine for failing to microchip their dogs .
It is not known how the scheme will be phased in but it is assumed a " puppies first " approach will be adopted .
Four types of dog are banned under the dangerous dogs legislation , including pit bull terriers and Japanese tosas .
The ban means it is illegal to breed or keep one of these breeds unless a court places the animal on the exempted dog index and it is neutered , tattooed , microchipped , muzzled and kept on a lead in public .
Much of the legal framework stems from the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act , which used to be held up as an example of the poor quality of legislation passed by MPs in haste but has actually proved a resilient and useful law over the past 19 years .
The Home Office said yesterday : " While this legislation is an essential tool in tackling antisocial behaviour , the government wants to look at it again to ensure it is working as it should and enables the police , local authorities and the RSPCA to take swift action to protect the public and stop abuse . "
A Home Office grant of £ 20,000 is to be spent this year helping police forces train dedicated dog legislation officers to deal with dangerous dogs .
A leaked Whitehall discussion document on dog control legislation suggested that competence tests for dog owners would also be included .
This sparked a storm of protest on the blogosphere among dog lovers and does not appear to have been included in the final version .
Benn said : " There is a lot of public concern about dog attacks , including the recent tragic deaths of young children , and about the rise in the number of so - called ' status dogs ' used to intimidate or threaten people .
This is a serious issue of public safety .
" The government wants to hear what people think about the law as it stands and what more we might do to protect people from dangerous dogs . "
Billy Hayes , general secretary of the CWU , which represents postal workers , said : " This is a long - overdue , but extremely welcome step .
" We 've been calling for changes to the law for several years now following some terrible dog attacks on postal workers . "
​ Denver celebrated the year ’s highest stoner holiday , 4/20 , in Civic Center Park — and there were plenty of interesting things at which to look .
( CNN ) --
The superintendent of the Kansas City , Missouri , school district on Thursday defended a plan to shutter nearly half the district 's schools .
" No one likes closing schools .
It 's hard .
It 's tough on families , and it 's certainly tough on our community , " superintendent John Covington said Thursday .
" Closing schools and making the remaining schools much stronger academically is unquestionably the right thing to do .
We were operating far too many schools , " he said .
He said the district was only using about 60 percent of the seats in its elementary schools , 40 percent in its middle schools and an even smaller percentage in its high schools .
After weeks of contentious debate and years of dwindling enrollment , a divided Kansas City Board of Education voted Wednesday night to approve what Covington calls the " right - size " plan .
The plan will close 29 education facilities , including 26 schools , according to the district .
Some parents voiced anger .
Some students cried .
" I have an 8 - year - old and a 6 - year - old that will be going to school with 12th graders .
I find that very inappropriate .
I do n't feel my children will be safe , " Deneicia Williams told CNN affiliate KSHB -TV .
" I feel like I have nothing , I have no high school legacy .
I feel like I have nothing , nothing to go back to , " said Prince Jones , a senior , who will be part of the final graduating class at Westport High School .
Covington proposed the plan arguing that the financial future of the entire school district was at stake .
The plan also cuts 700 jobs and saves $ 50 million to help reduce a burgeoning deficit .
School districts across America , hit hard by budget cuts , have been struggling to make ends meet .
They have had to make tough choices between closures , program cuts , bus route cancellations and layoffs of teachers and staff .
Schools in at least 17 states have opted for four - day weeks .
Are your schools having trouble ?

Covington said the closures were the first phase of " right - sizing " a district where enrollments have plummeted from more than 35,000 in the 1999 - 2000 school year to about 17,000 in 2009 - 10 .
" Closing schools is hard , and it is tough on the community , " Covington said recently in remarks posted on the superintendent 's Web site .
" Closing schools and making the remaining schools much stronger academically is unquestionably the right thing to do for kids , " he said .
" Keeping all of the schools open with too few children in them is draining the resources we need to improve the education of all students . "
But four of the nine board members disagreed with Covington .
" I deserve the right to make a rational decision based on facts , and we were never given facts about student achievement , " Cokethea Hill , who voted against the closings , told KSHB .
Some members of the public showed up Wednesday to air their last - minute appeals .
" What I 'm asking you today to do is to give our children justice , " said Ron Hunt , a community activist .
Others worried that school closures would lead to deterioration of communities and drive residents out of the district .
" The blighting of the urban core is scandalous and shameful , " said Sharon Sanders Brooks .
Covington is slated to discuss the school closings at a news conference Thursday morning .

Mr. Ensign denied any wrongdoing .
“ Senator Ensign has stated clearly , he has not violated any law or Senate ethics rule , ” said Rebecca Fisher , the senator ’s spokeswoman .
“ If Doug Hampton violated federal law or rules , Senator Ensign did not advise him to do so , did not suggest that he do so , and did not cooperate with his doing so . ”
Officials from the F.B.I. and the Senate ethics panel declined to comment .
P2SA , which has tried to turn Las Vegas into a national center for alternative energy , is co-owned by Greg J. Paulk , a contractor who has been a campaign donor to Mr. Ensign .
According to the e-mail messages , Mr. Ensign met with Mr. Paulk and Bob Andrews , then P2SA ’s executive vice president , in May 2008 to discuss any help the senator might be able to provide on energy projects .

At that time , Mr. Ensign was scrambling to find work for Mr. Hampton , his former top administrative aide .
The senator had already helped find a position for Mr. Hampton at November Inc. , a political consulting shop run by a former fund - raiser for the senator , and had spoken with donors at Allegiant Air and NV Energy about possible consulting work there .
At the meeting , Mr. Andrews said in an interview , he sought the senator ’s support for a biodiesel facility the company was building in Las Vegas and a possible land swap in Sloan , Nev. , with the federal Bureau of Land Management ( referred to as BLM in e-mail exchanges ) so the company could build a solar power plant .
Mr. Ensign brought up the idea of P2SA ’s hiring Mr. Hampton , Mr. Andrews recalled .
The senator mentioned “ that he might have somebody we should talk to who might be able to provide us with assistance in our biodiesel program , ” Mr. Andrews said , adding : “ I took this as a helpful hint . ”
A FORMER High Court judge wants a " big Parliamentary apology " made to gay people - similiar to one Kevin Rudd made to Aborigines .
Michael Kirby , who went public about his own gay lifestyle in 1999 while on the High Court bench , remains one of the most respected figures in Australian legal history .
In a new collection of essays he says : " One day there will be a big parliamentary apology in Australia to gay people for the oppression that was forced on them and the inequalities that were maintained in the law well beyond their use - by date .
" Just like the delayed 2008 apology to the Aboriginal people of our country . "
Justice Kirby , 71 , also predicts legal reform for gay people , and says Australians will learn to overcome their homophobia .
" I also do not doubt that , in a comparatively short time , Australia will move towards same - sex civil unions and gay marriage , " he writes .
" If Australians are now more homophobic than racist , as some recent public opinion polls suggest , this is because Australians have lacked good leadership on this issue . "
Justice Kirby says just as Australians overcame racism by " getting to know " people of different races , " we would all overcome homophobia more quickly if every gay person were open and felt able to say without fear of violence and discrimination : ' This is me .
Get over it .
It is no big deal ! ' "
In 2002 Justice Kirby was falsely accused in the Senate by Liberal senator Bill Heffernan of using Government cars to solicit prostitutes .
Senator Heffernan later apologised , and several times offered to shake hands with the judge .

The party is fielding nine candidates in the general election A movement inspired by the success of Sweden 's pro-internet file sharing Pirate Party in the European elections hopes to make waves in the UK on 6 May .
Launched less than a year ago , Pirate Party UK are fielding nine candidates in the general election .
Although they have fewer than 900 members , they still hope to stir mutiny among sections of the electorate unhappy with " criminalisation " of file sharing , " excessive surveillance " and what it sees as limits to free speech .
The party 's leader , Andrew Robinson , says he hopes to make enough of an impact to build momentum for the next European Parliament elections - likely to be in 2014 - and match the success of their Scandinavian inspiration .
Sweden 's Pirate Party was founded in 2006 and last year had more than 50,000 members , making it the country 's third - largest political party in terms of membership .
It also secured two MEPs in last year 's European Parliament election .
So why did it become so popular so quickly ?
Internet copyright laws have to change , or else you are criminalising a whole generation
Andrew Robinson , leader of Pirate Party UK Essentially it is a single issue party that is opposed to copyright controls on the internet .
It wants people to be able to download any song or movie free on the internet .
As long as no money is changing hands , it wants the practice to be decriminalised .
It takes its inspiration from the well - known Swedish file - sharing website Pirate Bay , whose four founders were last year found guilty of assistance to copyright infringement and sentenced to 12 months in jail .
While the Swedish Pirate Party has no direct connection to Pirate Bay , it shares the same beliefs and saw a major surge in membership following the high - profile Pirate Bay court case - particularly among internet - savvy young people .
However , it is important to note that may of the 50,000 people that joined the Swedish Pirate Party in 2009 have not renewed their membership a year later , and as such it has fallen back to between 25,000 and 30,000 .
Pirate Party UK , and similar organisations springing up around the world , share the same core policy principle that copyright law should be changed to allow file sharing over the internet .
But Mr Robinson admits they have a long way to go before it can catch up with the size and success of the Swedish party .
" As we are coming from absolutely nowhere , our best hope is just to raise our profile , " says the 41 - year - old website developer , who will be standing for the party in his home town of Worcester .
" This election is all about a learning experience for us , about getting the party 's name known .
" It 's about building up to the next European election , when because they are elected under PR [ proportional representation ] , we hope to be able to win a seat or two . "
' Free advertising '
For the impending general election , Pirate Party UK 's key focus is on how the internet is policed .
" Internet copyright laws have to change , or else you are criminalising a whole generation , " says Mr Robinson .
" Sharing music over the internet for example , should n't be considered an offence , as in reality it is free advertising for the band in question .
" In the old days record companies would pay a plugger to get their music on the radio , today it is all about people listening to it over the internet , which a far more democratic process . "
In addition to decriminalising file sharing , Pirate Party UK wants tougher rules to protect people 's privacy on the internet , requiring the police to get specific warrants before they can monitor an individual 's communications .
It also wants stricter limits to prevent companies from keeping excessive personal data on their customers , and laws to prevent government censorship except in the most extreme circumstances .
On a more prosaic note , it wants internet users to only have to pay for the actual speed they get from their provider , and not what was advertised .
Young candidates " I may be 41 , but the average age of our candidates is slightly under 25 , " says Mr Robinson .
" And one is just about to turn 19 , so we are certainly bringing a breath of youth into politics . "
Although the internet is Pirate Party UK 's main focus , it is standing on a manifesto that also has policies on medical patents , privacy and freedom of speech .
The Swedish Pirate Party says it is unconnected to website Pirate Bay They want all pharmaceutical patents to be scrapped so instead of the NHS spending a fortune on expensive patented drugs , they say , the health service would save millions of pounds if all drugs were available generically .
To recompense the drugs giants for the lost earnings that would have gone into research and development , Pirate Party UK proposes that the government would instead pay them directly to continue to conduct this .
The party are also calling for a big reduction in the number of CCTV cameras to pay for more police on the beat .
Mr Robinson admits Pirate Party UK 's immediate battle is to gain enough votes to retain candidates ' deposits but says it is " very , very difficult " to predict the outcome on the night .

Dear Mr. President and Governors of the 50 States :
We , the undersigned , applaud the federal court ruling by Judge Barbara Crabb declaring the National Day of Prayer unconstitutional .
Our secular nation was founded in part by refugees seeking freedom of conscience and freedom from religious tyranny .
They wanted a land where government could not tell them which church to support , what religious rituals to engage in or what to believe or disbelieve .
They knew there can be no true religious liberty without the freedom to dissent .
Whether to pray , or believe in a god who answers prayer , is an intensely precious and personal decision protected under our First Amendment as a paramount matter of conscience .
Congress , in 1952 , abridged that freedom of conscience when it designated a National Day of Prayer : " The President shall set aside and proclaim a suitable day each year , other than a Sunday , as a National Day of Prayer , on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches , in groups , and as individuals . ” ( Public Law 82 - 324 )
Rev. Billy Graham asked Congress to declare an annual National Day of Prayer so “ the Lord Jesus Christ ” would be recognized across the land .
Sen. Absalom Robertson , father of Rev. Pat Robertson , introduced the bill to instill " faith in an Almighty God . "
Influential evangelicals lobbied Congress in 1988 to designate the first Thursday in May as the annual National Day of Prayer so they could better organize prayer events uniting religion and government .
Our founders did not pray when they adopted our Constitution , which shows their intent to separate religion from government .
The Constitution 's only references to religion are exclusionary .
The U.S. President and elected officials have neither the moral nor the constitutional authority to dictate to Americans to pray , much less to tell citizens what to pray about , to set aside an entire day for prayer every year , and to gather with others “ to turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches , in groups , and as individuals . ”
As Judge Crabb ruled , " In this instance , the government has taken sides on a matter that must be left to individual conscience . ”
Do n't let Christian evangelicals hijack our secular Constitution .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has announced plans today to stop the issue of arrest warrants for foreign officials such as Tzipi Livni , Ehud Barak and other Israeli war criminals who were forced to cancel planned trips to London after arrest warrants were issued against them .
Under Brown ’s proposals , the Crown Prosecution Service will take over responsibility for prosecuting war crimes and other violations of international law .
Currently magistrates have to consider the case for an arrest warrant to be issued .
A warrant for the arrest of Ms Livni was issued by a UK court in December last year following Israel 's massacre in Gaza over a year ago .
She consequently cancelled a planned visit .
Mr Brown wrote in the Daily Telegraph : ' As we have seen , there is now significant danger of such a provision being exploited by politically - motivated organisations or individuals who set out only to grab headlines knowing their case has no realistic chance of a successful prosecution ’ .
PM Brown better explain to the nation why arresting a genocidal war criminal like Livni , Olmert or Barak is a ‘ politically motivated ’ act .
He should also explain to us all why is he convinced that a case against Livni would n’t stand a chance in court .
As far as Justice Goldstone is concerned , the case against Israel and its leadership is actually watertight .
According to the Daily Mail , Colin Powell , the former US secretary of state and a leading player in the Iraq War , has also reportedly expressed alarm about the prospect of arrest in Britain .
Yet , no one in Britain politics rushed to appease the American politician or to amend British universal jurisdiction laws just for him .
Clearly , Israeli lobby has much more influence within the British cabinet than the USA .
This should n’t take us by a big surprise considering our Foreign Secretary David Miliband is a listed ‘ Israeli Hasbara ( Propaganda ) Author ’ .
Brown admitted that ' There is already growing reason to believe that some people are not prepared to travel to this country for fear that such a private arrest warrant - motivated purely by political gesture - might be sought against them . ’
Surely this is good news .
Criminals such as Livni or Barak should never dare to step on a plane .
Instead they should stay in their Jewish Ghetto and stare at the separation walls they erected around themselves .
The PM said he wanted legislation putting jurisdiction for war crimes and similar offences under the CPS to be brought in 'as soon as possible ' .
This is indeed what you would expect from a government that is so heavily funded by the Jewish Lobby .
Such a move would allow attorneys such as Lord ‘ green light ’
Goldsmith to open Britain ’s gate to Israeli genocidal murderers .
Yet Brown failed to tell the Brits what it is that stops magistrates from taking the right decisions regarding war criminals .
Let us face it .
If Brown does n’t trust Britain ’s magistrates he better let them go .
He can always hire some Rabbis to look after Britain legal system .
If Britain is about to give up on its universal jurisdiction laws , it better be prepared to let some tribal experts to look after its ethical stand .
Brown also said , “ I am confident that an amendment on better enforcement of existing legislation will serve to enhance Britain 's status in the eyes of international law , world opinion and history ” .
I do not know much about the ‘ eyes ’ of the international law ’ or ‘ world opinion ’ , but I can assure Brown that his move is more than welcome by the Jewish Chronicle and his Jewish fundraisers .
Do n’t forget , it is election time after all .

How the hell does this happen ?
Bradley Johnson , a math teacher at Westview High School in the Poway Unified School District in California — a public school system — had put up banners in the classroom advocating his faith .
The banners are about 7 feet wide and 2 feet tall .
One has the phrases “ In God We Trust , ” “ One Nation Under God , ” “ God Bless America ” and “ God Sheds His Grace
On thee . ”
A second reads “ All Men Are Created Equal , They Are Endowed By Their Creator , ” with the last word in uppercase letters .
Clearly , that ’s what you want to see in a math classroom .
The school rightfully told him to take those banners down .
There ’s no reason a teacher should be pushing his faith — making students feel uncomfortable in the process — in a public school classroom .
What ’s a non-Christian student supposed to think ?
Can they get a fair shake in his class ?
Lawsuits were filed .
The judge issued the verdict on Friday :
Judge Roger Benitez said teacher Bradley Johnson is entitled to a declaration that his First Amendment rights were violated by the Poway Unified School District .
He also said in a ruling Friday that Johnson should get damages of $ 10 ? from each of nine officials he named in a lawsuit filed in 2007 .
Benitez also ordered the district to allow Johnson to rehang the banners in his classroom .
What .
The .
Fuck .
Benitez said the district allows other teachers to post things on a variety or religious and nonreligious topics without penalty .
He said the action against Johnson amounted to discriminating against a particular point of view , which courts have long said is not permitted .
I ’m not a lawyer .
Someone please explain to me how this makes any sense .
*** Update ***:
Here is the judge ’s ruling ( PDF ) .
To me , it ’s opening a can of worms .
Any teacher in the district can now put up signs / banner / posters indicating their faith in their classroom .
This school district has a problem — and many more potential lawsuits — on their hands .
I wonder if the same verdict would have been issued if the banners read : “ There is no God , ” “ God B less AmericaN ” or “ One Nation Indivisible ” …
I guess that test may happen before long now that ’s it ’s legal to do so .
This only serves to harm the students .
Johnson is more interested in proselytizing his faith than teaching his subject .
And Judge Benitez is an accomplice in letting him continue .

NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR :
If you have any questions or feedback about this whole thing ( or if you just want to compliment me on my fine drafting skills ) , I can be reached at : CARINTHECLIFF@HOTMAIL.COM
I only ask that you please be gentle .
If you piss me off , I 'll end up taking it out on my wife , kids or students , and I know you do n't want that on your conscience .
FAST FORWARD
The first thing you should know about the legend of the Rocket Car ( especially if you got the story via E - mail or the Web ) is that it 's been around a lot longer than most people think .
It started years ago , as a vague rumor passed from one guy to the next by word of mouth , usually in bars or during lunch - break bullshit sessions .
The kind of story someone hears from a friend who read it in a magazine , or a half - remembered newspaper story that someone read a long time ago .
It 's a story that comes out of nowhere , gets passed around for awhile , then dies out , like one of those weird strains of flu that keep coming back every few years .
The period of dormancy varies , but whenever the story springs back to life , it seems to spread like a grass fire .
I used to think it was funny how the legend of the Rocket Car managed to spread so far ( and fast ) purely by word - of - mouth , but now that it 's become a subject of Internet interest , its popularity has become downright spooky .
If you 've never heard the legend before ( in which case I can't imagine why you 'd be reading this ) , here 's the bare bones of it :
Once upon a time , in some out - of - the way part of the country ( take your pick of locations ) a maniac took a rocket of some sort , and mounted it on the back of a car ( make and model depend on automotive trends when the story is told ) .
The maniac then sped down a deserted stretch of highway , and when he reached an appropriate spot , he lit the rocket .
Unfortunately , the rocket ( which was either a JATO bottle , a surplus ICBM engine , or an experimental Shuttle booster ) proved to be far more powerful than the maniac anticipated .
The car reached an incredible speed in a matter of seconds ( somewhere between 150 miles per hour and Warp 9 ) at which point the car 's brakes and steering became ... ineffective .
This development would 've been bad enough on a straightaway , but through some error in planning or navigation , the maniac found himself hurtling down a road that curved sharply , not far from where he ignited the rocket .
When the car arrived at the curve , it went straight ahead instead of negotiating the turn .
Pilot and car then flew like an arrow ( for a distance only limited by the imagination of the person telling the story ) , before crashing into an inconveniently - placed mountainside .
Nifty .
I 'm sure this sounds pretty ridiculous if it's the first time you 've heard the Legend of the Rocket Car , but that 's because I did n't go out of my way to make it sound good .
Most people do try to make it sound convincing , embellishing the story with all sorts of little facts and details to make it easier to swallow .
I 've personally heard a dozen versions of this story over the past 20 years , and I 'm constantly amazed at how the story grows , shrinks , and generally mutates with each retelling .
Maybe I notice these changes more than most people because I 've always paid close attention to this particular rumor .
Oh , I 'm not a car expert or an aerospace engineer or anything , and I really do n't have much interest in urban legends .
Even if I did , from an intellectual point of view , this story is n't as entertaining as some of the others that have come and gone .
The one about McDonalds shoveling worms into the grinders that produce Big Macs , for instance , beats it by a mile .
I only pay attention to the Rocket Car legend because I 'm 99 % sure that I started the whole thing in the spring of 1978 .
Not intentionally , of course .
Now , before you draw any conclusions , I do n't want you to get the impression that I , myself , claim to be the maniac who drove the Rocket Car into the wild blue yonder .
I said I was probably responsible for the rumor , not that I actually performed the test flight .
As far as I know , the flight in question never happened .
Like all legends , the root of the story might be true ( or partially true ) , but once the tale started circulating , the root was lost in the embellishments .
If the Legend of the Rocket Car survives , my great - grandchildren will probably end up talking about a guy from Lunartown who nailed an anti-matter pod onto an old Apollo moon - rover and flew into the side of Tycho Crater .
That 's how it goes with legends .
Like I said , I 'm not a rocket scientist or motorhead .
I do n't even KNOW any rocket scientists or motorheads .
I 'm a high - school biology teacher .
I know , this must sound like I 'm the most unqualified person in the world to give opinions about things like jet - propelled cars , but I was n't always a biology teacher .
The fact that I 'm a biology teacher today is only relevant to the extent that it 's responsible for my writing this story down .
Last year , a week or two before Thanksgiving , I was taking my class through some of the particulars of evolution ( " how human beings were raised from monkeys " as one of my students phrased it ) .
We were discussing Charles Darwin and The Origin of Species when one of my students asked me how Darwin 's research ship ever got the name " H.M.S. Beagle " .
Damned good question , when you stop and think about it .
Since I 've been teaching this subject for 11 years , it 's rare when a student asks a question I can't answer .
But this one was a real pisser .
Anyone who 's ever taught in a classroom knows that sometimes you get a student that likes to play " Stump the Teacher " .
A kid who asks questions he does n't really care about , just to see if he can find a gap in the teachers knowledge .
Usually these questions are pretty easy to evade or ignore ( or even lie about ) but sometimes one will catch my interest .
This was one of them .
You have to admit , " The Beagle " is a pretty dumb name for a ship that cruised the Galapagos in search of exciting bird - beak variations .
So I told the student that I had no idea where the ship 's name came from , but I 'd find out .
After all , I 've been teaching the same class for 11 years , so I 've amassed a pretty good variety of books on the subject .
Surely the answer would be in one of them .
Hah .
I could n't find the answer anywhere .
My reference books concerned themselves with headier subjects , the Scopes trial and genetic mutations and whatnot , NOT the name of Darwin 's boat .
I looked through every book I could find , but came up dry .
After exhausting all my research options , I was thinking about conceding this particular round of Stump the Teacher when one of my kids asked if I 'd looked for the information on the World Wide Web .
I said " Of course I looked there .
It 's the first thing I checked .
Go play in traffic . "
Truth be told , I not only had n't checked the Web , I did n't know how to check it .
In addition to being a non-rocket scientist , I 'm not ( or at least I was n't ) very interested in computers or the Internet .
I know this is a shameful thing for a teacher to say in 1998 , but it 's true .
I kept meaning to take a look at the Internet - connected computers in the school library , just to see what all the hoo - hah was about , but I simply had n't gotten around to it .
Actually I was a little bit intimidated by the machines , and kept putting off the inevitable confrontation due to embarrassment .
Sure , I could 've walked into the library during my free period , sat down at one of the machines and tried to figure out what to do on my own , but what if I could n't make it work ?
It would n't be long before someone spotted my baffled expression and realized I was completely lost .
So the next day I went to the library during my free period and asked the librarian for help , feeling like Crocodile Dundee asking how to work the bidet .
But the librarian had obviously dealt with the situation before , and gave me her ten- minute " Internet For Stupid Teachers " course without making me feel any dumber than she had to .
As soon as she left me alone with Netscape running and a search engine online , I typed " Darwin " into space provided , and let the machine do its thing .
When the results of my search started filling the screen , the first thing I noticed was that there were over two MILLION sites listed as being Darwin - related .
The second thing I noticed was that none of them seemed to pertain to Charles Darwin , the most famous naturalist in history .
Instead , they all seemed to focus on " The Darwin Award " , an " ... honor ( posthumously ) bestowed on people who did the most good for humanity by removing themselves from the communal gene - pool " .
Which really is n't a bad idea , when you think about it .
Of course I expected this " award " to be a piece of tongue - in - cheek humor , the sort of thing that used to make the rounds via smudgy Xeroxes in the days before E-mail and the World Wide Web .
And that 's exactly what it turned out to be .
What I was n't prepared for was my very first encounter with the story of the Rocket Car in print .
Not only in print , but in a format that can reach around the world .
When I read the story , I did n't know whether to laugh or cry or get nauseous , but I think if I were alone , I 'd have done all three .
Based on the number of different Websites cross-referenced to the word " Darwin " , I 'll bet that if you read the Rocket Car story from a computer monitor , the version you saw looked something like the one that follows .
The text , anyway .
The high - tech , precision - drafted engineering diagrams are my own addition .
Do n't bust my balls about them , either .
I already told you that I 'm not a motorhead or a rocket scientist , and I 'm no Leonardo da Vinci , either .
The Arizona Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road at the apex of a curve .
The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash , but it was a car .
The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene .
The lab finally figured out what it was and what had happened .
It seems that a guy had somehow obtained a JATO unit ( Jet Assisted Take Off - actually a solid fuel rocket ) that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra " push " for taking off from short airfields .
He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert and found a long , straight stretch of road .
Then he attached the JATO unit to his car , jumped in , got up some speed and fired off the JATO !
The facts as best could be determined are that the operator of the 1967 Impala hit JATO ignition at a distance of approximately 3.0 miles from the crash site .
This was established by the prominent scorched and melted asphalt at that location .
The JATO , if operating properly , would have reached maximum thrust within 5 seconds , causing the Chevy to reach speeds well in excess of 350 mph and continuing at full power for an additional 20 - 25 seconds .
The driver , soon to be pilot , most likely would have experienced G - forces usually reserved for dog- fighting F - 14 jocks under full afterburners , basically causing him to become insignificant for the remainder of the event .
However , the automobile remained on the straight highway for about 2.5 miles ( 15 - 20 ) seconds before the driver applied and completely melted the brakes , blowing the tires and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface , then becoming airborne for an additional 1.4 miles and impacting the cliff face at a height of 125 feet leaving a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock .
Most of the driver 's remains were not recoverable ; however , small fragments of bone , teeth and hair were extracted from the crater and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel .
As I said earlier , for the past 20 years I 've kept an eye out for stories like this , and I 've heard plenty of them .
But the stories I 'd heard up until then had always been vague and somewhat skimpy on technical details , making them marginally easier to swallow .
Or at least to repeat .
But the Darwin Award version was different .
It was chock full of numbers and specifics , which is always bad news for a legend .
Oh , initially it might make the story more believable , but throwing in a lot of facts and figures also gives the non-believers plenty of details they can use to refute the story .
In the case of the Darwin Awards version , I 'm surprised that anyone , anywhere , believed the story well enough to repeat it the first time .
For instance , there 's the fact that this event was supposedly investigated by the Arizona Highway Patrol .
Well , that 's not too hard to check , is it ?
One call to the state police in Arizona would be all it took to get a confirmation or denial .
If you do n't believe me , give it a try .
You 'll get an irritated denial before you 've even finished asking the question .
Actually , the AHP is so sick of answering questions about this whole thing that they may well hang up in your ear .
Do n't feel like making a long - distance call just to have someone hang up on you ?
Then ask yourself this :
If the Darwin Award story is true , then why was it never reported in the national media ?
Why has nobody ever produced pictures of the crash site ?
And how about the unfortunate " pilot " ?
Nobody was ever able to attach a name to this person ?
Specify the location ?
If you want to explain these questions away by blaming human error or police indifference or whatever , that 's okay .
There 's too much apathy and incompetence in the world to pretend that could n't be the case .
But if you look at the physics of the story , you 'll see that the whole pile of bullshit is impossible , regardless of the human angle .
It 's simple stuff , too .
You do n't have to be an aerospace engineer to see what I 'm talking about .
For instance , when the Chevy left the road with its rocket still going full - blast , why did it go in a straight line ?
Take a look at a missile sometime .
You 'll notice that it 's ... missile - shaped .
Nice pointy nose , tail fins , stuff like that .
It 's built that way so it 'll go in a straight line .
The 1967 Chevrolet was a nice looking car , sure .
But it does n't look much like a missile .
Mount a big rocket on a ` 67
Chevy and it may go straight as long as it's on the ground .
But once it got airborne , the weight of the engine would immediately pull the nose down .
And if the JATO was still blazing away , the car would drill itself into the ground like a tent - spike before it got fifty feet from the cliff .
This story is obviously bullshit to anyone willing to give it a little thought , but it persists , mainly because people WANT it to be true .
And most of those people are men .
As a story that got its start when it was still being shouted across pool tables in noisy bars , women were left out of the loop until it hit the Internet .
Sort of like the story about the deadly gas that lies inside the core of a golf ball .
Little boys learn this one too , but not little girls .
And when the little boys grow up ( to whatever extent they actually do grow up ) , the Golf Ball Toxin story is replaced with the Rocket Car story .
One " urban legend " debunker attributes the huge popularity of this story to the fact that it 's " ... a real - life version of the Road Runner cartoon .
Wile E. Coyote nails an Acme Jato Rocket onto the back of a Chevy Impala and flies into a canyon wall . "
Works for me .
The question is , how did such a story ever get started in the first place ?
Oh , do n't get me wrong , I 'm not trying to say that nobody would ever be dumb enough to attempt a stunt like this .
Anyone who followed the O.J. Simpson trial will probably agree that there simply are n't any limits to the depths of human stupidity anymore .
It 's just mighty unlikely that someone stupid enough to pilot the Rocket Car would be smart enough to build it in the first place .
The story probably started with an event that that bears some similarity to the final version , a much smaller event that gradually evolved into the final legend .
All I know for sure is that myself and three other guys were getting up to some awfully weird shit out in the desert back in the spring of 1978 , shit that was more than weird enough to start the Legend of the Rocket Car .
And only one of us was stupid enough to be the pilot in the Darwin Awards story .
At least that 's what I keep telling myself .
WHY THE ROCKET CAR DOESN'T WORK
One thing I want to make clear from the start is that I 'm not pissing on the Rocket Car legend purely as an academic exercise .
When my friends and I set out to build the vehicle we test - fired in the spring of 1978 , a real - life jet - powered , road - traveling car was exactly what we had in mind .
Craig Breedlove was busy breaking land speed records in the Spirit of America , Evel Knievel had graduated from " biker " to " payload " while attempting to jump the Snake River Canyon a few years earlier , and rocket - powered vehicles were a pretty popular notion .
Unfortunately , machines like this require a lot of time and money and engineering skill to build and operate .
My friends and I had none of these things .
In 1978 , I was 22 years old and still living with my parents .
My father owned a scrapyard , twenty - two acres of barren desert scrub ideally suited to having junk thrown on it .
The yard was a salvage smorgasbord , covered with everything from dead water heaters to junked airplane cockpits .
And since we lived near a major Army storage facility , a lot of the scrap my father bought and sold came from government auctions .
To be brutally honest , the main yard looked like a cross between Sanford & Sons and Apocalypse Now .
My father would go to the auctions held at the post from time to time , bid on pre-marked lots of God only knew what , then send me out he next day with the big flatbed to collect the latest pile of junk he'd bought .
Plenty of people who went to these auctions ended up with nothing more than tons of unusable junk that was worth less than they paid for it , but my Dad always seemed to find the lots that contained valuable stuff .
He also knew plenty of people who owned military surplus stores , and usually had some idea of what was in demand and what was n't .
But since the nearby Army base was a huge storage depot , the auctions were n't the sort of affairs that the average man - off - the - street would be interested in .
The lots for sale were usually measured by the ton , and if a lot seemed to have a few items you were interested in , you had to buy the whole mess .
Because of this , my Dad ended up with an amazing amount of unusable military surplus , things like gas - masks and vehicle parts that were worthless in the civilian world .
But from time to time , we'd get weapons , too .
No , he never bought a pile of crap and ended up with a crate full of M - 16's or a Shrike missile , the military was usually careful enough to keep THAT from happening .
But from time to time we did end up with stuff we were n't supposed to have .
Once day I opened a crate marked " heater assembly " and found it full of smoke grenades .
My Dad found a steel ammo box full of blank M - 60 rounds once .
And even though these instances were a rarity , the Army had a very strict policy toward scrap dealers who found such things :
You had to give them back .
No two ways about it .
Before even being allowed to place a bid , dealers at an auction were required to sign several forms , one of which stated that they 'd return any " explosive , ordnance , fuse , detonator , or other chemically viable part or assembly of a weapons system . "
I remember that paragraph well , since it 's the only part of the Army red tape that ever directly pertained to me .
The penalties for non-compliance outlined at the end of the paragraph sounded pretty scary ( five - figure fines , possible imprisonment , etc ) , and were enough to make my Dad return the crate of smoke grenades , but not the blank ammo .
These were judged to be too trivial to warrant a drive to the base , and my Dad ended up keeping them draped over a file cabinet in his office , as a decoration .
Of course I 'm telling you this because it's how I managed to get hold of the JATO bottle we used for our rocket car .
Actually there were four of them , each in a long , hay - filled crate with " BARREL ASSEMBLY " stenciled on the side .
One day I went out to the base to pick up a load of junk my Dad had bought at the auction , and while we were going through the stuff back at the yard , I spotted the crates and took a look .
And even though I did n't know what the hell it was at first glance , I knew it was n't a barrel for anything .
The JATO bottle was a round metal cylinder about four feet long , and less than a foot in diameter .
At first I thought it was a gas cylinder of some sort , but written on the side in red paint were the words " M - 23 JET ASSIST UNIT " .
And rather than the sort of valve assembly you 'd see on a gas cylinder , the end of the bottle had an inverted funnel shape to it , with a rubber plug at the lowest point .
It was obviously a rocket of some sort .
And judging from the weight ( it took two people to even budge the things ) they were still full of something .
Once I figured out what they were , I decided I had to call Jimmy .
Jimmy and I met in the third grade ( or thereabouts ) , and were best friends for most of our growing - up .
His family lived just down the street , and his father ran an auto body shop in town .
On more than one occasion Jimmy 's Dad and my own traded parts or services , and our families were pretty close .
But while I went to work for my father after graduating high school , Jimmy went to college to study mechanical engineering .
He had a natural talent for figuring out things in the physical world , but was never much good at putting them into practice .
He could design and visualize , but when it came to hands - on applications , he just was n't very talented .
Nevertheless , he was the first person I showed the JATO bottles to .
Actually , I did n't show them to anyone right away .
The campus where Jimmy took classes was almost 150 miles away , so he spent his weekdays in a rented room and only came home on the weekends .
I found the JATO's on a Wednesday , which meant I had three days before I could tell Jimmy about them .
More than enough time for me to cook up the idea of the Rocket Car .
As a matter of fact , as soon as I realized what that dull metal cylinder represented , I thought about attaching it to a car and taking a jet - propelled ride .
I spent the rest of Wednesday , Thursday and Friday planning how it could be done .
The principle certainly seemed simple enough .
Nail the rocket onto one of the junkers in my Dad 's field , point it down a straight stretch of road , and light the mother up .
Sure there 'd be minor details to be worked out , but the basic idea was fairly straightforward .
All I can say is thank God I consulted with Jimmy before actually doing anything .
If it was n't for his intervention , I 'd have probably ended up a damp spot on a highway somewhere .
Jimmy came over to the house on Saturday morning , we drove to the yard , and I showed him the rocket .
He immediately knew what it was , or at least what it seemed to be .
A solid fuel rocket , the kind they 'd used in Vietnam to give cargo planes a kick in the ass when they needed to take off from short runways .
Very simple , very straightforward .
Also very dangerous .
I described the idea of the Rocket Car to him , and at first he was pretty enthusiastic .
But after thinking the whole thing over for awhile , he not only lost his enthusiasm , but made me promise I would n't actually do anything with the JATO until he had time to check a few things out .
I agreed , mainly because I knew I 'd need Jimmy 's help if I was ever going to make the Rocket Car work .
We talked about design possibilities for the rest of the weekend , and when Jimmy went back to campus , I stashed the JATO 's in the back of a wasted milk truck rusting in the field .
When Jimmy came back the following weekend , we sat down at his kitchen table and he explained precisely why the rocket car would n't work .
It was a sobering ( and depressing ) lecture .
The main problem was control .
Jimmy explained that the JATO bottle would produce something like 2,500 pounds of thrust ( albeit for a very short time ) , which sounded like more than enough to ensure a fun ride .
Unfortunately , this huge amount of thrust would not only be unstoppable once it was started , it would probably have to be applied to a point on the car that was n't designed to handle such a such a force .
Under normal circumstances , a car gets its forward thrust from the back axle , by way of tires against the pavement .
Which means that a normal car will never exceed a certain amount of thrust due to the fact that the tires have to touch the pavement to move the car forward .
Jimmy described the whole thing using top - fuel dragsters as an example .
When the driver hits the gas , the back end of the car tries to lift into the air due to the sudden force applied to the rear axle .
But as soon as the ass end starts to lift , the tires lose traction , and the thrust decreases .
The back end drops , thrust is restored , and the process starts all over again .
So a car of a given weight using driven wheels can only get so much forward thrust .
The limiting factors are the weight , the distribution of the weight , size of the tires , and torque applied to the wheels .
The fact that a car uses driven wheels creates a self - damping system that ensures the wheels will stay on the ground ( at least most of the time ) .
The only reason dragsters and funny cars pop wheelies is that they use oversized tires that screw up the relationship between torque and traction .
Unfortunately , a rocket car has no such restraints .
A massive amount of thrust is suddenly being applied to a point on the car that was n't designed to handle it , and there 's no telling what happens next .
Maybe the front end lifts off the ground .
Maybe the rear .
Maybe the ass end would slew around sideways .
The only thing that was certain was that the car would not go in a straight line , and would continue to not go in a straight line at a very high rate of speed .
Naturally I asked how Craig Breedlove managed to drive the Spirit of America at 600 + miles an hour , but I knew the answer before I even spit the question out .
He hired a team of aerospace engineers and rocket scientists to design a car that was built to have a jet engine sticking out its ass .
After hearing this , Jimmy did n't even have to outline the rest of the reasons why my idea would n't work , but he did anyway .
There was also the fact that store - bought tires could n't handle the sort of acceleration a rocket would provide , which was why all land - speed record cars used custom - made , solid - rubber tires .
Simply spinning a regular tire at rocket - car speeds would probably create enough centrifugal force to tear it right off the rim .
And if that was n't enough , there was the problem of stopping the thing once it got rolling .
And structural stress .
And so on and so on .
By this time I 'd pretty much decided that the whole idea was stupid and suicidal , which was why I was amazed when Jimmy proceeded to tell me exactly how the rocket car could work .
TRAIN OF THOUGHT
One thing that remains constant in every re-telling of the Rocket Car legend is that it reportedly took place somewhere in the southwest United States .
I 've heard versions stating that the whole thing happened in Arizona , Nevada , New Mexico , western Texas and southwestern California , and in each case , the location seemed to be a critical part of the plot .
Which makes sense , considering the premise that the story is based on .
The Rocket Car would have to be launched on a fairly long , flat stretch of road , away from prying eyes .
The Mojave is an ideal place to find such a road , as anyone who 's ever driven across the desert will tell you .
The Darwin Award version specifies Arizona , which is covered with roads that would be ideal for the event described in the story .
But one thing that strikes me as incredibly silly about this version is the fact that the test pilot chose to test his vehicle on a road with a curve in it .
The story specifies that the cliff where the car impacted was at the " apex of a curve " , and that the test pilot ran under JATO power for 2.4 miles before hitting the turn and becoming airborne .
This suggests a pretty obvious question :
If you were going to test drive a rocket - powered car , what sort of road would you pick for the ride ?
Would you choose a section of highway less than three miles from a turn in the road that overlooked a canyon ?
I do n't think I would .
Even if Jimmy had n't been around to talk sense into me and I had attempted to drive the rocket car , I 'm sure I could 've found a stretch of highway that did n't include a hairpin turn .
The desert contains thousands of miles of highways and dirt roads , and it would 've been much harder to find the kind of road in the Darwin story than to find a nice level straightaway .
On the other hand , when Wile E. Coyote lights the big skyrocket tied to his jalopy , he always seems to be near an unexpected turn .
I guess whoever wrote the Darwin story must have assumed this was standard procedure .
Fortunately , highways are n't the only long , straight thoroughfares through the desert .
After Jimmy was through demolishing my plans to build the Rocket Car , he pointed out that the control problem could easily be overcome if the car was actually a rocket sled , running on rails rather than asphalt .
Mounting the rocket on a railroad car would not only solve the problems of control and traction , but if an abandoned stretch of track was used , traffic would n't even be an issue .
And the Mojave is covered with abandoned railroad track , most of it the old - fashioned narrow - gauge kind used for mining trains near the turn of the century .
I knew of at least three such pieces of track within five miles of town .
Finding a railroad car that would actually run on the old - fashioned track was a whole nother story , but by the time Jimmy finished explaining his idea , I already had a plan in mind to deal with that part of the equation .
The following morning I found myself bouncing across the desert in a battered four - wheel drive pickup with the remaining two members of Team Rocket Car ( my tongue is firmly in cheek when I use that term ) , Sal and Beck .
Beck and I were almost as close as Jimmy and I when we were kids , but Beck had a " wild streak " that caused most of the trouble we got into from time to time .
During high school his " wild streak " got out of control , Beck turned into " one of those dope - smoking degenerates " ( Mom 's preferred term ) and he dropped out a year shy of graduation .
Sal was Beck 's junior brother , junior not only by calendar - count but by any sort of I.Q. measurement .
Sal was n't retarded or anything , but people tended to use phrases like " not too swift " and " a few bricks short of a load " , a lot more often than usual when he was around .
Just like " dope smoking degenerate " tended to pop up in conversations that involved Beck .
Okay , so they were n't exactly Nobel Prize laureates , but I did n't have much choice in my selection of assistants .
I needed their truck .
The truck actually belonged to Beck 's father , who used it in the performance of his job .
Whatever that was .
Nobody knew for sure what Beck 's Dad did for a living but the truck was ugly and battered , sat on huge mud -grabber tires , and came with a massive 454 engine .
Beck 's father would drive the thing out of town occasionally , sometimes staying gone for days at a time .
When he returned , the truck always looked as if it had spent the entire time driving around in the desert .
If Beck knew what his father did for a living , he never said .
But Jimmy and I figured the man used his pickup for transporting something ( ahem ) back and forth from remote desert locations .
Contraband vegetation arriving at an isolated airstrip was one possibility , and people desperate to become American citizens without a lot of government interference was another .
The only relevant fact is that the truck was very good for cruising the desert , which is why we used it to visit an abandoned silver mine a few miles from town that morning .
The mine had been out of commission and the entrance boarded over for as long as any of us could remember , but at least a few brave kids had explored the interior of the shaft .
Everyone knew there was nothing of value left in the mine , with the exception of some ancient equipment that was worthless , even as scrap .
Worthless to most people , anyway .
That 's because very few people went into the mine looking for old mining equipment .
We did .
And we found some , too .
Actually , Beck himself was one of the juvenile delinquents who'd poked around in the mine years earlier , so he knew just what to expect when we pried off the old wooden planks covering the entrance .
Less than a dozen feet into the shaft was a train of ancient bucket - cars , the tiny railcars used to haul ore out of the mine while it was in use .
Probably parked so close to the entrance to discourage people from going any further .
I was n't too thrilled about entering a man -made tunnel that could cave in at any moment , but I could see from my flashlight beam that the " train " only consisted of three bucket - cars linked together .
And despite the fact that they 'd probably been parked for forty years or more , they seemed to be in reasonably good condition .
Shit lasts forever in the desert , it really does .
Beck dragged a towchain into the mine , looped it around the hitch on the last car , then used the pickup to drag the whole line of cars closer to the entrance .
When the cars were nearly clear of the overhang , I went inside and used a five - pound pony - sledge to bash the connection on the last car until it came free .
When Beck threw the pickup into gear and dragged the first two cars clear of the mine , and the metal wheels screeched so loud I thought it would bring the shaft down on my head .
Of course the wheels were frozen with rust , but they were far from destroyed .
The first thing we did when we got the bucket cars into the light of day was turn them upside - down , then slop grease onto the axles .
After a few well - placed whacks with the sledge , we got the wheels to turn .
A few more whacks , and we had them turning freely enough to push the bucket - cars up a ramp and into the back of the pickup .
Once the bucket cars were loaded , we replaced the boards over the mine entrance , then took the cars back to the scrapyard .
The Rocket Car was off to a fine start .
LUXURY AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
One aspect of the Rocket Car legend that always tickles me is that no matter how much the story varies , the make , model and year of the car is always specified .
Sure this is a nice detail to have on hand , but considering the details left out of the description , it looks ... sorta silly .
In the Darwin Award version , there 's no mention of which highway the car was on , or even whereabouts in Arizona the story took place .
And Arizona is a pretty big place .
There 's also no mention of any investigation that took place afterwards .
But despite all these oversights , the story did specify that the car was a 1967 Chevy Impala .
I think the reason this detail is always supplied is because it 's critical to make the listener think the test pilot at least looked cool when he flew into the cliff .
You 'll never hear someone tell a story about a guy in a rocket - powered K- car or a Volkswagen Beetle .
It has to be a car that deserves to have a rocket attached to it .
In the case of our Rocket Car , we gave some serious thought to not even using a car body .
As soon as we got back to the scrapyard , Beck wanted to weld one of the JATO 's to a bucket car , stick the car on a track , and light the rocket .
He was doubtless the craziest member of Team Rocket Car , and if I 'd been willing to go along with his idea , I have no doubt he'd have climbed in and lit the fuse himself .
Fortunately , they were my JATOs , so I had veto power over all the dumb ideas .
Or at least the real dumb ones .
Of course sticking a JATO on a bucket car was out of the question , but building a simple platform on a bucket - car base with a car seat bolted onto it sounded like the easiest way to build a rocket sled .
Actually , this is pretty much what the NASA rocket sleds looked like .
But this arrangement would mean that each run would be limited to a single passenger , and I only had four JATO's .
When Jimmy and I discussed the details of the project , he seemed pretty confident that the thrust from the rocket would be enough to push a four - passenger car at a reasonable speed .
And if we used a car body , we'd have a windshield , doors , and some degree of protection if anything went wrong .
Granted , a car body would n't do us much good if we hit something ( like a canyon wall ) at jet - fighter speed , but it was better than wiping out in a director 's chair at 300 miles per hour .
Despite Beck 's impatience , I got started building the Rocket Car the next day .
Our car was n't a 1967 Chevy Impala , but a 1959 Chevy Impala .
A bone - white Impala , with a red interior .
I know how bizarre that sounds , but once a story starts to mutate into a legend , there 's no telling which parts of the truth will stick .
Obviously the Chevy Impala part made the cut .
We did n't choose the `59 Impala for its aerodynamics or structural qualities , but because one was available .
My father happened to have one , resting on cinderblocks , in a forgotten corner of his lot .
Engine , transmission and wheels were all missing , sold to Jimmy 's father at some point .
The only reason this car was otherwise intact was that Chevrolet only used the 1959 style for a single year , which meant the body parts would only be usable on another 1959 Impala .
This particular car was obscure enough so that once the mechanical parts were stripped , it was pretty much useless .
And this is why what was left of my Dad's `59 Impala was left to decay in a field .
Fortunately , the leftovers were all that we needed .
Cutting the bodies from the bucket cars was a chore , but not as bad as I expected .
The thin metal of the buckets was rusted to tatters in spots , so burning through it was fairly easy .
But despite this , I still used almost an entire tank of oxy getting the bodies cut away from the bases , and I knew my Dad would be suspicious when he found I 'd used all the oxygen in an almost - full tank .
Luckily , Jimmy was able to help out in that department .
When I told him about my predicament the following weekend , he simply took my empty oxygen cylinder and swapped it with one of the dozen or so his Dad kept on hand at his body shop .
My father might notice if a brand new tank of oxygen were suddenly empty , but Jimmy 's Dad 's shop used so much gas he'd never know the difference .
Attaching the cut - away rail car bases to the Chevy frame was pretty easy too .
Jimmy stressed the importance of getting the two sets of wheels precisely aligned , but it was n't that hard .
The old Chevy frame had plenty of places for bolts and welds , so picking spots where the wheels would line up was a snap .
And since the Impala was already up on blocks , it was no problem to slide the wheel frames underneath and lift them into place with a floor jack , then weld away .
I 'm sure that these days my students would laugh like hell at the thought of me laying underneath a car with an oxyacetylene torch in my hand , but the fact is , I learned how to draw a bead and cut metal when I was 14 or 15 years old .
Growing up around a scrapyard did have certain advantages , and learning how to work with a torch was one of them .
So aligning the wheel frames and welding them to the car was a fairly straightforward process .
The propulsion unit ( hah ! ) consisted of a five - foot length of steel water pipe , welded to both the rear bucket car and the Chevy 's frame .
This might sound like overkill , but at the time I had no idea how much thrust to expect from the JATO bottle , so it seemed best to err on the side of caution .
I plugged the end of the pipe facing the front of the car with a slug of scrap steel and welded it into place , and even cut the center out of a threaded cap to screw onto the exhaust end to hold the JATO bottle securely once it was installed .
The end - cap seemed like a good idea while I was doing it , but Jimmy laughed like hell when he came in the following weekend and saw my handiwork .
He pointed at the steel cap , and said " That rocket is gonna be pushing against the car hard enough to make it fly like a bullet , and you 're afraid it 'll fall out the BACK end ? "
What can I say ?
This is one of the reasons Jimmy was doing all the brainwork .
Unfortunately , his critique was n't only limited to the job I did on the " propulsion unit " .
He also asked how I planned to stop the thing once the ride was over , and I had to admit that I did n't have the slightest idea .
TOUGH BRAKES
In the Darwin version of the Rocket Car tale , the car burned out its brakes instantly , and was eventually stopped by a cliff face .
We hoped to come up with a somewhat more elegant braking system , and we did .
But not without considerable brainwork .
The night Jimmy inspected my work on the Chevy , all four members of Team Rocket Car gathered at a neighborhood bar to discuss the considerable problem of stopping the car once it was moving .
When I started putting the car together , I assumed Jimmy would have some idea what we 'd do .
But as it turned out , he was just as clueless as the rest of us .
So we gathered at the bar in the hope that one of us could come up with a workable idea .
Of course the lack of any way to stop the Rocket Car was considered a very minor point with Beck .
He was perfectly willing to haul the car out to a long stretch of empty track , get in , fire it up , and hope he slowed down before he ran out of track .
In his eyes , worrying about something as trivial as brakes was a sign of cowardice .
Like I said , he was out of his fucking mind .
Fortunately , Beck did n't have much say about the situation , so we decided that we would n't launch the car until we had some sort of braking mechanism to slow it down .
The most popular idea was , naturally , a drogue chute .
The Spirit of America used one , as did a few types of fighter planes , top fuel dragsters , etc .
But like the optimal solutions to most of our problems , the question was where to find one .
Nobody had any idea how to go about getting a parachute .
Nobody except for me , that is .
My father actually had six Army surplus parachutes sitting in a storage shed near the office at the scrapyard , the spoils of particularly good auction years before .
Five of them were standard personnel chutes , and one was a massive cargo - drop canopy .
But Dad also knew he had six of them .
He 'd started out with a dozen , and occasionally sold one to a skydiver or army / navy store .
A good surplus parachute was worth upwards of $ 200 .
There was no telling what the cargo chute would be worth to the right buyer .
But if one were to turn up missing , Dad would certainly notice .
Of course we might have gotten away with using a parachute , then returning it once we were finished with it , but even this presented problems .
It might work okay for the first ride , but how about the second ?
I certainly knew nothing about parachute rigging .
All I was sure of was that there was a lot of cloth that had to be stuffed into a very small pack .
Besides , I 'd already stuck my neck out pretty far for the sake of the Rocket Car , and I did n't want to stick it out any further .
So I kept the existence of Dad 's parachutes to myself , and hoped someone else would come up with an alternate plan .
Using a retro-rocket was discussed briefly , but it only took Jimmy a minute to punch that idea full of holes .
Even though rigging a retro would mean nothing more than sticking a second JATO on the front of the car to oppose the one in the rear , it would mean a maximum of two rides before we ran out of JATO's .
This much was obvious .
What was n't obvious was the physics of the whole thing , which Jimmy was happy to explain .
Firing the first rocket would provide a huge forward thrust for a very short time , but a retro rocket would produce an identical thrust ( if we were lucky ) in the opposite direction , for the same duration .
Which would mean the only way to bring the car to a dead stop would be to fire the retro as soon as the thrust rocket burned out .
That would result in a 0 - to - 300 acceleration in seconds , followed by a 300 - to - 0 deceleration in the same amount of time .
Does n't sound like much fun , does it ?
And if the retro was fired a little too late , it could easily result in the whole rig traveling backwards .
Possibly at a high rate of speed .
Or even worse , the retro might be a dud .
Or the ignition system might not work .
Needless to say , we shitcanned the retro-rocket idea in a hurry .
Sal suggested outfitting the car with a huge anchor , one that could be heaved out the window at the critical moment .
The rest of us suggested that Sal shut the fuck up and get us another round of beers .
I brought up one idea I 'd been toying with , stretching a cable across the track and fitting the Rocket Car with a tailhook to slow it down .
Why not ?
After all , aircraft carriers had been using this system to stop incoming planes for years , and it seemed to work just fine .
But before I could explain the idea , Beck started laughing his ass off , then asked if I wanted to use a rubber inner - tube to catch the car , or just tie a rope between two fence - posts .
And I clearly remember how much this pissed me off .
Here was a guy willing to strap a military rocket onto his back and sit in a rusty rail - car while someone lit the fuse , but he was laughing at my ideas .
Unfortunately , he did have a point .
It was n't until years later that I found out how aircraft carriers absorbed the shock of a plane catching an arresting wire ( it involves huge pistons moving through cylinders of hydraulic fluid ) , but I knew that rigging a similar system would be next to impossible .
Putting a tailhook on the car and catching an arresting wire was simple .
But it sure as hell could n't be stationary wire .
There would have to be some system to absorb the impact of a car moving at high speeds , and we could n't come up with anything .
We went through a slew of ideas for mechanical systems , but I rejected them all because they were either too complicated , too expensive , or too impractical .
Jimmy pointed out that rocket sleds usually ended up in a pool of water , which both acted as a brake and cooled the whole contraption down .
Beck pointed out that all the narrow - gauge railroad tracks he'd ever seen were in the middle of the desert , where pools of water were pretty tough to come by .
Overall , we ended up batting exactly zero for the evening .
I remember that I was pretty damned depressed when Jimmy and I left the bar that night , despite the fact that I was pretty drunk .
Considering the progress I 'd made on the rocket car up to that point , I figured that a braking system would be a minor point .
Surely if we put all three of our heads together ( well , 3 - 1/2 , counting Sal ) we could come up with something .
But it had n't happened .
Or at least it had n't happened while we were all sitting at the bar .
Jimmy tried to blow some optimistic sunshine up my ass while we walked up the street toward our houses , saying that one of us might be able to come up with something later , once we were all sober .
I did n't consider it likely .
Beck and Sal seemed to think better when they were drunk , and they were both pretty shitfaced when we left them .
If they had n't come up with anything at the bar , chances are they never would .
And Jimmy and I were n't having any brainstorms drunk or sober .
Anyway , there 's no telling how Sal and Beck spent the rest of their evening , but the next morning my Dad woke me up by pounding on my bedroom door .
When I finally peeled my eyes open , he asked me who was delivering my car parts in the middle of the night .
I had no idea what he was talking about .
Part of my incomprehension was from a hangover , but even if I 'd spent the previous night drinking Kool Aid , I would 've been pretty confused .
So he led me out to the front porch and pointed to a bundle of four thick metal rods , tied together with twine , laying on the porch swing .
When I looked closer , I saw that they were actually a set of heavy - duty air - adjustable car shock absorbers .
Jammed under the twine was a note written in what looked like crayon on a crumpled paper bag .
It said this :
Problum solved .
Call me later
Major Tom
HEAT OF THE MOMENTUM
I stared at the note for quite awhile , trying to figure out what it meant .
At first I figured Jimmy must have left the bundle of shocks , since his father stocked such things at his body shop .
But there was no way a college student like Jimmy would misspell a common word like " problem " , drunk or sober .
And the fact that most of the words were spelled correctly pretty much eliminated Sal .
Which meant that the shock - absorber care package must have been Beck 's doing , and as soon as I realized this , I hustled the bundle into the house and stashed it in my room .
Obviously Beck 's creative juices had n't really started flowing until Jimmy and I left the previous night , and he 'd eventually come up with some sort of solution to the braking problem .
It also seemed that he had enough confidence in his idea to act on it .
At the time I had no idea what sort of solution Beck could 've come up with for our " problum " , I just hoped it turned out to be as sensible in the light of day as it seemed when Beck came up with it the night before .
The bundle of shocks I stuck under my bed were relatively new , but covered with dust and road - grime .
They obviously had n't come from an all - night auto parts store .
I guessed that Beck had been struck with a burst of twisted inspiration after Jimmy and I left , then spent the rest of the night staggering around town with his brother , a bumper jack , and a crescent wrench .
Looking for donor to contribute some hardware to our cause .
It seemed as if they 'd found one , too .
And if someone was going to wake up that morning to a car that was mysteriously missing all four shock absorbers , I hoped like hell Beck 's plan was worth it .
But I never actually asked Beck where the shocks came from , and he never volunteered the information .
I did n't consider it critical to the mission .
I did , however , call him later in the day to ask what I was supposed to do with the shocks .
His first suggestion was that I stick them up my ass .
I assumed that he was just in a bad mood from a hangover , since there was no way an assfull of shock absorbers would help to slow a fast - moving Rocket Car .
So I kept interrogating him until he finally remembered the details of his Grand Plan , and agreed to meet me at the scrapyard later on .
When he finally showed up at the gates to the yard he looked like hammered shit , but I expected as much .
Go spend a night getting drunk and stealing auto parts and see how you feel the next day .
But he was also reasonably coherent , and described his idea while we walked out to the weedy corner of the field where the Rocket Car was still perched on cinderblocks .
And I have to admit , it was good .
Real good .
Better than anything we 'd figured out up to that point , anyway .
But the best part ( to me , anyway ) was that it did n't involve me stealing anything else that my father might notice .
Beck 's idea was simple , elegant , and easy to put into practice .
I 'd install the air shocks on the Rocket Car normally , just as if the car would be riding on pavement instead of rails .
But I 'd also bolt a pair of wooden beams onto the belly of the car , runners that were placed exactly between the front and rear train wheels .
Each runner would be thick enough to reach almost all the way down to the tracks , and the bottom would be covered with rubber cut from old tires .
The effect would be that the car would roll freely while the air shocks were inflated , with the twin runners suspended inches above the steel tracks .
When it was time to stop the car , the pilot would activate a release valve which would dump the air from all four shock absorbers simultaneously .
The car would drop until its entire weight was resting on the runners , which would be pressing into the railroad tracks .
This would provide two brake shoes three feet long , pushed against the track under the weight of the car 's body , providing a huge amount of stopping - power .
And since the wheel flanges would also still be firmly on the tracks , the car would remain traveling in a straight line .
When Beck finished explaining his idea , I stood there with my mouth hanging open .
Actually we both stood there with our mouths open , but while my jaw was flopping due to surprise , Beck 's was caused by a powerful hangover that was still affecting his motor control .
I must admit , though , I was pretty impressed with his thinking .
We 'd talked about dozens of ways to stop the rocket car the previous evening , but nothing that even came close to Beck 's plan .
It was simple to build , easy to install , and stood a fair chance of working .
I knew that sooner or later I 'd have to talk to Jimmy about the whole thing , but that did n't stop me from getting to work installing the air shocks on the Chevy as soon as Beck slouched out of the scrapyard and went home .
I worked on the car for the rest of the afternoon , wanting to get as much done as I could on a Sunday , while the yard was closed .
By the end of the day , I had the shocks installed on the car and a pair of three - foot - long runners made from sections of 2 x 4 bolted together to make them thick enough to reach the rails .
All that was left to do was bolt the runners to the car frame and arrange the air hoses for the shock absorbers , and the car would be ready to test .
It was THEN that I finally called Jimmy and asked him to come down to the yard .
Talking to him sooner would 've been the sensible thing to do , but I did n't want to take a chance that he'd come up with some laughably obvious reason the brake - runner system would n't work .
At the time , my thinking on the subject was pretty clear :
There were only two ways were going to be able to stop the Rocket Car , either by using a drogue chute or by Beck 's braking system .
And although I was n't too keen on the idea of taking one of my Dad 's parachutes , I 'd do it if it was the only way to get the Rocket Car to work .
But even if we did use a drogue chute , the car would need an additional braking system anyway .
A parachute will slow a car , but it wo n't stop it .
You still need regular brakes for that .
The way I figured it , we 'd need Beck 's idea no matter what happened .
So I decided to show Jimmy the braking system I was building and see what he thought .
If he pointed out some reason why it was completely foolish , I 'd show him Dad 's parachute collection , then tell him that the brake runners were the standby system , and we were actually going to use a parachute to slow the car to reasonable speed .
It not only sounded reasonable , but it kept me from looking like a total asshole .
All my planning was unnecessary , though .
When Jimmy heard me describe the rail - braking system and saw what I 'd done to the car so far , he was very impressed .
I think he was also a little pissed off that Beck had come up with the idea , and not him .
But here 's a thought that never occurred to me back in 1978 , and to be honest , I 'm glad it did n't :
We never really had any proof that it was Beck who came up with the idea .
For all we know , it was Sal who dreamed up the notion of using runners to stop the car .
Yes , yes , I know , it 's a ridiculous thought .
Like having your pet hamster wake up one morning with a revolutionary process for splitting atoms .
After all , we 're talking about the guy who wanted the pilot of the Rocket Car to hoist a goddamned anchor out the window to slow down .
Still , you never know .
And Jimmy , if you 're reading this , I 'm sorry I even brought it up now .
I know you 'll lose some sleep over it .
But I could n't resist .
Anyway , Jimmy did give the braking system his stamp of approval , and I never had to admit that Dad had a bunch of parachutes stashed in the shed .
The only reservation Jimmy had about the system was one that should 've been obvious to me from the start : heat .
If the car were traveling as fast as we expected it to , rubber - coated planks pressing against metal rails would probably get hotter than hell .
On the other hand , this was basically the same system used by every car on the road , as well as racing cars .
Drum and disc brakes are essentially nothing more than pads or shoes pressing against moving pieces of steel to stop the car .
The only difference between their system and ours was that standard brakes pressed brake pads against steel that was spinning , while ours used steel moving in a straight line .
And even though our car would be traveling a lot faster than most , we had much more overall braking surface .
So Jimmy and I talked about ways to cool the runners for awhile , just in case heat buildup turned out to be a real problem .
Actually , I think Jimmy might have made the heat problem sound worse than it really was , just so Beck would n't get ALL the credit for solving the brake problem .
But to give credit where it 's due , we did wind up with a heat problem , so whatever Jimmy 's motivations might have been , it 's a good thing I listened to him .
Then again , if I 'd ignored him , I doubt it would 've changed the final outcome too much .
With the conceptual details taken care of , all that was left was construction .
Even though the braking and brake - cooling systems were the hardest part of the car to fabricate , it did n't take long to get them built and installed .
Bolting the runners to the car frame was quick work , and even though it took a little doing to get the air - dump valve connected to all four shock absorbers , I had plenty of materials to work with laying around the scrap yard .
After removing the valve stems from the air inlets to the shocks , I attached sections of air - compressor hose to the valves themselves .
The other ends of the hoses ran to an air valve that started life as the door - opening lever on a city bus .
With the lever in the " open " position , all four shocks could be inflated from a single air inlet near the dump lever .
Once the shocks were pressurized , releasing the lever kept them inflated until the lever was pushed again .
I first tested the air - valve system on Tuesday afternoon , and when I saw that it worked the way it was supposed to , I immediately called Beck .
He came to the yard with Sal , and the three of us took turns raising and lowering the car for almost an hour before the novelty wore off .
Despite the fact that it was n't very exciting to watch , there was something distinctly satisfying about seeing the system work the way it was supposed to .
Of course Beck was more anxious to " take the car for a spin " than ever , and he actually got a little pissed off when I pointed out that we were n't out of the woods yet .
There was still a heat problem to deal with , but this detail did n't cut much ice with Beck .
He was positive that it would n't be a problem , which meant that our next step was to take the Chevy out and light the rocket .
So rather than dwell on the heat problem , I said " Haul it out WHERE , and light the rocket with WHAT ? "
That took the wind out of his sails in a hurry .
See , we still had n't considered how we were going to ignite the JATO , but to be honest , this was n't a major sticking point .
There was a rubber plug in the end of the exhaust nozzle of the rocket I 'd inspected , and it seemed logical to assume that some sort of igniter plugged into the hole .
Probably an electrical fuse , something along the lines of the igniters used for model rockets .
Whatever fueled the rocket ( ammonium perchlorate , I later found out ) was no doubt highly flammable , and should n't be too tough to ignite .
But I knew I could come up with something better than a fuse .
A much bigger problem was the launch site .
Beck got sulky and petulant when I pointed out that we had no idea where we 'd actually run the car , but he did n't argue too much .
Even if I agreed to hoist the car onto Dad 's flatbed right then and there and drive around searching for a spot to use , I 'm sure Beck would 've realized how dumb the idea was before we even got out of the yard .
So I put Beck in charge of finding a suitable launch site , which I 'd have done even if he was n't being a royal pain in the ass and keeping me from my work .
His Dad 's four - wheel drive was the perfect vehicle for location - scouting , and he and Sal were more familiar with the surrounding desert than anyone I knew .
Beck and Sal headed for the gates deep in conversation , and I got back to work .
The brake - cooling system I ended up building was pretty cheesy , I 'll be the first to admit that .
But since we were n't even sure it was necessary , I did n't want to spend a lot of time messing with it .
I ran a length of garden hose along each wooden runner , near the point where the runner was attached to the car .
Took the ends near the front of each runner , and led them into the empty engine compartment .
I tied off the ends under the car , then punched holes along the sections near the runners with an awl .
Water entering the ends in the engine compartment would leak out through the perforations , soaking the runners and pads .
I told you it was pretty cheesy .
The only part of the cooling arrangement that even came close to sophistication was the result of a brainstorm that came to me while I was strapping a five - gallon jerry can under the hood of the Rocket Car .
I started putting the sprinkler system together with the idea that we 'd simply open a valve before launch , letting water leak out of the hoses and onto the runners for the duration of the run .
But while I was attaching the jerry can , a better method occurred to me .
Instead of attaching the garden hoses to a valve , I drilled a pair of holes directly into the top of the jerry can , and fed the hoses through the holes .
Then I drilled a third , smaller hole , and connected another hose from the jerry can to the air - dump handle for the shock absorbers .
I sealed all the hose connections with massive amounts of rubber cement , then called it quits for the day .
No word from Beck or Sal that night , so I assumed finding a launch site was n't as easy as they 'd thought it would be .
When I checked the Rocket Car the next day , the rubber cement sealant had dried to the consistency of a hockey puck , so I tested the entire system .
I filled the air shocks from Dad 's portable compressor , then closed the dump valve .
Filled the jerry can with water , and screwed the top down tight .
Said a quick prayer , and hit the dump - valve lever .
There was a slight hiss as the air rushed out of the shocks , through the dump valve .
But instead of being vented into the open , the last air - hose I 'd installed directed the escaping air into the jerry can full of water under the hood , forcing water out through the sprinkler hoses .
When I checked under the car there was an impressive puddle , and water was still jetting out of the holes in the garden hoses .
I was thrilled beyond words .
And when Jimmy saw the whole system in action a few days later , he said he was " .. really impressed with my application of Bernoulli's Principle . "
Hell , I did n't even know that the Italians built rocket cars .
AFFATUS INTERRRUPTUS
Before I go on , I think I should take a minute to explain why this whole story is getting so lengthy .
Actually , my wife says I should issue a formal apology for inflicting such a long - winded pile of shit on anyone who reads this .
And I halfway agree with her .
But I want to make you aware of one thing : I did not plan it this way .
When I decided to write down the story of the Rocket Car , I figured it would take all of two pages , maybe three .
Four at the outside .
That 's because I was working from a set of 20 - year - old recollections , and a lot of the details were missing .
I did n't realize that once I started dredging up these old memories , all sorts of bits and pieces would start to fill themselves in , whether I wanted them to or not .
Four pages became five , then six , etc. etc .
I originally planned to have the whole thing done by the beginning of April , so that it would be ready to go on the 20th anniversary of the first ( and last ) run of our Rocket Car , but April came and went , and I was still hunting and pecking .
So did May , then June .
Nothing I can do about it now .
Besides the miscellaneous details that came flooding back when I started to write this story down , the technical details of the whole project turned out to be more involved than I remembered when I started writing .
When I began , I remembered a simple 1 - 2 - 3 process that took place over the course of a few weeks , and seemed fairly simple .
But as the story progressed , I realized I had to supply a lot more detail than I originally intended , just to keep it from sounding completely stupid .
And I 'm still not sure I 've accomplished the not - sounding - stupid part .
Even though the project was executed one step at a time , it had a goofy , ill - planned , Li'l Rascals feel to it , and no amount of explaining is going to change that .
Because basically it WAS a Li'l Rascals undertaking .
The only thing missing was a sign saying " He - Man Rocket Kar Klub " over a treehouse door .
But I 'm not going to lie about the facts or try to make the whole thing sound less silly than it actually was .
If someone had been hurt or killed , or even we'd been caught trying to run a homemade rocket car through the desert , I 'm sure we'd all have ended up in the pokey .
Even if a judge were willing to overlook the instances of theft and trespassing and illegal possession of military fireworks , we'd have probably been charged with something , just on general principal .
Conspiracy To Commit Flagrant Stupidity , maybe .
If Beck had gotten his way , a charge of attempted suicide would 've been a sure thing .
But nothing like this ever happened .
Having said that , I 'd now like to issue a formal apology for inflicting such a long - winded pile of shit on you .
Sorry about that .
It wo n't happen again .
There you go , Lily .
I did it .
Happy ?
LOCATION , LOCATION , LOCATION
The idea of the Rocket Car sitting on cinderblocks in the scrapyard , just waiting for a place to run it , was driving Beck crazy .
I have to admit , I was getting anxious to take it for a test run myself , but Beck was really going nuts .
I did n't hear anything from him for the rest of the week , and I assumed it was because he had n't found a suitable launch site .
It was actually because his Dad had taken the four - wheel drive out for one of his mysterious desert jaunts , and was gone for the rest of the week .
That left Beck and Sal with only one option , driving Sal 's beat - to - shit Ford Falcon , a car that barely held its own on pavement , never mind in the desert .
Meanwhile , the Rocket Car waited in the field .
I tried to think about it as little as possible , since I did n't want to end up afflicted with the mania had gotten hold of Beck .
I worked at the scrapyard , just as I always had , trying to avoid the far corner of the lot where the Rocket Car was .
More than once I thought about what I 'd do if my Dad suddenly got a buyer for that 1959 Chevy Impala , but there was really no point worrying about such things .
If it happened , I was simply screwed .
No way to explain my way out of a situation like that .
So I simply waited .
Actually , I did get one minor detail taken care of during the delay , building igniters for the JATOs .
I removed all the taillights and turn - signal lights from the Impala ( no matter what became of the Rocket Car , signaling for a turn would n't be an issue ) and soldered two wires to each bulb .
Next I carefully cracked the glass on each bulb , leaving the filaments intact .
The bare filaments would heat to white - hot when connected to car battery , but simply laying a hot filament inside the JATO nozzle did n't seem like it would do the trick .
Maybe it would have , but since Beck and Sal still had n't found a place to use for a launch site , I had time to come up with something better .
So I pulled a dozen of the blank M - 60 rounds from the ammo belt my father kept in his office as a decoration , tore off the skinny end of each shell , and dumped out the powder inside .
I poured a little of the powder into each of seven squares of newspaper , folded the newspaper squares into packets around the filaments of the light bulbs , and trussed each one up with masking tape .
When I connected one of them to a battery to test the idea , it made an impressive little flare .
Surely enough to light the JATO .
I hoped .
When Sal and Beck still had n't reported finding a launch site by Friday morning , I even went through the trouble of putting an old car battery on the charger at the shop , installing it in the Rocket Car , and wiring it to a switch on the dashboard .
I considered painting the switch bright red , with the word IGNITION !
underneath , just because I had the time .
In retrospect I 'm glad I did n't go through the trouble , since we never used the switch anyway .
But at that point I realized that if Beck and Sal did n't find a good spot soon , I might end up hauling the car out to the nearest set of tracks and trying it out myself .
Jimmy came back from college again that weekend , just about the same time Beck 's father came back from who - knows - where with the four - wheel - drive .
During the week I had high hopes that we'd be able to launch over the weekend , but when everyone gathered at the scrapyard on Saturday afternoon , I knew it was n't going to happen .
Jimmy took a look at the sprinkler system and pronounced it workable , although I could tell he still had some grave misgivings about how well a couple of pissing garden hoses would cool down the brake runners .
I had the same misgivings myself , but the amount of heat generated would depend on so many unknown factors that is was n't something we could really plan for .
We did n't have any idea how fast the car would actually go , what shape the tracks would be in , or even how much the car weighed .
From my point of view , the sprinklers were there for only one reason :
To keep the runners from burning up like matchsticks when they hit the rails .
After all , they were made from wood .
If the sprinklers could keep the runners from turning into torches , they 'd fulfill my expectations .
While Jimmy was inspecting the rocket car and telling us what he'd found out about my JATO bottles ( which turned out to be very little ) , Sal and Beck told us about the launch locations they 'd scouted out over the week .
And the news they had was grim indeed .
Within ten miles of town there were a total of three sections of track long enough to run the rocket car on , and in my opinion they were all dead losers .
Beck and Sal knew the area well enough to realize that most of the modern wide - gauge tracks had been laid either directly on top of , or very close to , the places where narrow - gauge tracks had once existed .
So naturally they started their search at the switching yard near the city limits .
There they found an excellent set of narrow - gauge tracks roughly paralleling a shiny set of wide - gauge rails that were probably used every day .
But despite the fact that the old - style tracks stretched for miles , they ran right through a busy switching yard .
Not a good place to test a jet - propelled boxcar .
Another possibility was a set of rails that started in the desert , continued for five miles or more , and ended in a soft dirt field that would have been ideal for cushioning any crash that might happen .
Unfortunately , this set ran directly through the middle of town , and the field at the end was the Jaycees Softball Field , right across the street from the police station .
Even though Beck must 've realized we'd never go for that idea , it was obvious that he liked it .
I imagine he wanted to set the Rocket Car on the tracks across from the police station in the dead of night , then blow the horn and scream until a dozen cops came running out of the station to see what the ruckus was .
At that point he'd hang a moon out the window , then light off the JATO and blaze out of town .
Or maybe this was n't what he had in mind .
But if you knew Beck , you 'd probably agree with me .
The last location Sal and Beck found was even worse than the tracks that ran past the police station .
The Mystery Mine was a bargain - basement tourist attraction a few miles from town that promised to show visitors the INNER WORKINGS OF AN AUTHENTIC SILVER MINE .
People who paid the $ 2.50 admission were loaded aboard an ancient , rattling , mine - car and hauled through a few hundred feet of cavern , while a tour guide in a hardhat and goggles pointed at rusted pieces of machinery and chunks of rock , explaining what they were .
We 'd all been on the Mystery Mine tour at one time or another , and everyone agreed that the only thing even vaguely interesting about it was wondering if a cave - in would trap you in the bowels of the mine .
Possibly forcing you to eat the other tourists to survive .
There was an old song that used to play on the radio that described this scenario , and there was a popular joke around town about being trapped in the Mystery Mine and having to eat your way out .
A discreet sign near the mine 's entrance proclaimed that it was inspected for safety by the U.S. Bureau of Mines on a yearly basis , but everyone knew that ancient mines tended to cave in weather the U.S. Bureau of Mines said it was okay to or not .
Therefore , new folks in town were always advised not to take the Mystery Mine tour without packing a sharp knife and a salt shaker .
Cannibalism and the U.S. Bureau of Mines really were n't our problem .
But the fact that the Mystery Mine was a tourist attraction presented all SORTS of difficulties .
The land around the Mystery Mine did have plenty of narrow - gauge track , that much was true .
More than enough to suit our needs .
But it also had lots of fences , lots of lights , a couple of security guards , and a handful of vicious Dobermans that patrolled the grounds at night .
We all knew it , too .
I think Beck and Sal really just went out to the Mystery Mine to take the tour and kill an afternoon .
Jimmy and I would n't have even wasted time with the trip .
The end result was that the Rocket Car was ready to roll , but we had no place to roll it .
Beck and Sal were confident that they'd be able to find a good spot the following week ( since they were once again desert - capable ) but Jimmy and I had serious doubts .
We knew the area around town as well as anyone , and the chances of finding a good place to run the car were starting to look grim .
When Jimmy spent the weekend in town , he usually headed back to the college on Sunday evening , right after dinner .
So it surprised me when I got a call from him at 6:00 Sunday evening , asking me if I wanted to take a ride with him to " discuss a few things " .
I said sure , no trouble .
He told me to drive over to his house , and when I got there , he was already in his car .
He signaled for me to follow him , and I did .
I had no idea where we were going , but I followed anyway .
After a few minutes I saw that we were heading out of town , and I wondered what he was up to .
But I stopped wondering a little while later , when he pulled to the side of the road near the abandoned mine shaft where we 'd liberated the two ancient bucket cars .
He got out of his car , opened the trunk and took out a tire iron , then headed toward the mine entrance without a word .
When I asked what we were doing , he held up one finger in a wait - a- minute gesture .
I shut up .
Jimmy walked down the slope and stopped in front of the boards we'd re-nailed over the entrance .
Even though the sun was almost down , there was still plenty of light to see by .
I thought he'd brought the tire iron to pry off the boards near the entrance , but when I reached the place he was standing , he started walking down the tracks , away from the entrance .
Ten paces later he'd reached the point where the tracks ended , buried in sand .
He took a few more paces , then bent over and jabbed the pointy end of the tire iron into the sand .
To my surprise , it clanked .
Jimmy looked at me with a goofy little smile on his face , and when I realized what he was doing , I smiled myself .
Probably just as goofily .
He pulled the tire iron out of the sand , walked a few more paces , then stuck it into the ground again .
No clank this time .
But when he stuck it in again , a few inches to the left , he got the same metallic clank .
He was now standing a good fifty feet from the mine entrance , and at least twenty feet from the spot where we all assumed the tracks terminated .
He looked up at me , with that dumb smirk still plastered across his face , and said " So , how far out do you think these tracks actually go ? "
SAFETY FIRST ( OR SECOND )
Why none of us thought to take a look at the tracks coming out of that abandoned silver mine before this is anyone 's guess .
Beck and Sal and I had stood right on top of them when we got the bucket cars , but none of us considered the possibility that a long section of the track might still be there , only underground .
As a matter of fact " underground " is a pretty drastic term for what we found .
The tracks were actually covered by a fairly thin layer of drifted sand and dust .
The outcrop around the mine shaft broke the wind enough to keep the tracks clear near the entrance , but beyond that , the rails must have been a good place for drifting sand to pile up , and eventually cover the rails .
But Jimmy 's tire iron sank no more than an inch or two before striking metal , and we did n't so much have to dig for the rails as brush the sand off them .
We ended up walking more than a half mile from the mine entrance , Jimmy stopping occasionally to stick the tire iron into the sand , and striking metal every time .
Eventually it started getting too dark to see where we were going , so we made our way back up the slope to where the cars were parked .
I told Jimmy I 'd be back bright and early the next day to find out exactly how far the tracks ran , but Jimmy seemed confident we'd have more than enough .
He did n't seem too confident of the Rocket Car , though .
When we got back to the cars , I found that Jimmy had me follow him in my own car because he was going back to school directly from the mine entrance .
But there was still a matter he wanted to discuss , that matter being the first run of the Rocket Car .
Without a good launch site the matter could wait , but since it seemed as if we 'd found one , Jimmy figured we 'd better discuss the whole thing immediately .
It turned out that he was very worried about the first run of the car , particularly the idea of having a person inside when we fired it .
Of course I already knew there were plenty of things that could go wrong , since I 'd built the thing in a junkyard .
But when Jimmy started to lay out the possible ways a person inside the car could get hurt or killed , he made it sound a little less safe than going over Niagara Falls in a barrel .
First , we were dealing with a highly volatile chemical propellant we knew nothing about .
We did n't know how old it was , where it came from , or how it was supposed to behave .
There was actually a very real possibility that the JATO could explode like a bomb , reducing the car to flame and shrapnel in a split - second .
But even if it did work as expected , the rocket was held in place by a length of water pipe welded to the bottom half of a train car that was God only knew how old .
If any of the welds did n't hold , there was no telling what the outcome would be .
Then there was the matter of the brakes .
All we had was a setup that looked good and sounded like it might work .
But if someone inside the car found themselves going 100 + miles per and the brakes DIDN 'T work ...
The way he described the whole thing made it sound like suicidal insanity , and I started to get a little pissed off at him .
If he'd been thinking about all this shit the whole time , why had n't he SAID anything ?
As it turned out , he was n't suggesting that we scrap the project outright , just that we perform a " test run " before trying it for real .
An unmanned test run .
Rig a system to activate the brakes at some point after the JATO had burned out , point the Rocket Car down the tracks , and let it run pilotless the first time .
After all , it was n't as if we needed a man at the tiller while the car was moving .
The person we'd been referring to as the " pilot " would actually be the " passenger " , his sole duty being to hit the dump valve before the car ran out of track .
And since we had four JATOS , wasting one for the sake of safety seemed like a prudent move .
I had to admit , he made a LOT of sense .
I pointed out that Beck would probably have a bird when he found out we were n't going to let him drive the car on its maiden voyage , but we both agreed that it would n't be a major problem as long as Beck got to drive it on the first manned run .
We 'd just take a second JATO along , and if the car ran successfully the first time , Beck could take it out the second time .
If the car ended up a twisted lump of smoking metal , Beck would be happy we decided to take the precaution .
With these details settled , I said goodbye to Jimmy and headed home .
On the way I was thinking about how to kick in the braking system with nobody inside the car , but since we'd only need it for the trial run , it did n't have to be anything fancy .
The next day I was busy at the yard sorting through the latest load of junk my Dad had bought at an auction over the weekend , but I DID find time to rig the brakes for our test run .
All I did was twist a screw - eye into each brake runner , then run a length of piano wire through the openings in each eye and up through a hole in the Chevy 's floor .
I tied the ends of the wire to a short stick , and used it to prop the brake 's dump valve in the " up " position .
Then I looped a piece of rubber from a bicycle inner tube over the lever , and tied it under the valve box .
The bike tube pulled the lever toward the " dump " position , but the lever could n't move due to the stick propping it up .
I figured that once we found a good section of track , all we'd have to do was drive a spike into one of the rail - ties at the point where we wanted the brakes to kick in .
When the car passed over the spike , the spike would snag the wire , pull out the stick , and the dump valve would snap down , activating the brakes .
Now , if you 're getting tired of hearing about all the Rube Goldberg bullshit I was adding to this machine , take a minute to think about how I felt while I was doing the work .
By the time Jimmy suggested that " we " rig " some sort of automatic brake system " , I was getting mighty sick of rigging and drilling and bolting and cutting .
Let 's face it , despite the fact that we came up with a few clever ways to solve pretty tough problems , the Rocket Car was still just a pile of shit that I knocked together in a junkyard .
And I was tired of trying to figure out ways to make important things happen by using other people 's garbage .
I made up my mind that the auto - brake was the last piece of work I was going to do on the car .
If what I 'd built at that point was n't good enough , I 'd simply turn the whole mess over to Beck and let him drive the fucking thing into the Mystery Mine , or past the police station , or whatever he wanted to do .
However , there was still the matter of the launch site preparation to take care of , so on Tuesday I called Beck and told him to swing by the yard in his Dad 's pickup and get me after work .
He and Sal both showed up , and when I took them to the abandon mine and showed them how far from the entrance the tracks extended , they were ecstatic .
I did n't bother to explain that Jimmy had come up with the idea two days earlier , since they 'd probably spent Monday and Tuesday driving around in the desert looking for a decent set of tracks themselves .
I brought a tire iron along , and sat on the tailgate of the pickup while Beck drove away from the mine entrance .
Every now and then he stopped the truck , and I plunged the tire iron into the sand where the tracks should be .
And I kept striking metal over and over .
Finally the truck stopped and stayed stopped , and when I looked over my shoulder , I saw that we'd come to the end of the line .
Or at least the end of the usable line .
Exactly 1.9 miles from the mine entrance , the narrow - gauge tracks intersected a set of modern , standard - gauge tracks leading into town .
Which made sense , after I 'd thought about it awhile .
The newer tracks were probably laid on the bed of some old narrow - gauge tracks , and the rails leading toward the abandoned mine were probably a spur coming off the main tracks .
But who cared ?
We had two miles of narrow gauge track , more than enough to run the Rocket Car on .
I hoped .
Beck was thrilled over the discovery , until I explained that the buried rails would have to be cleared before we could take the car out for a test run .
He enthusiastically assured me that he and Sal would have the tracks cleared the next day , but I had my doubts .
And my doubts turned out to be well - grounded .
I did n't hear anything from Beck and Sal the next day , or the day after that .
I assumed they were in the process of clearing the tracks , and it turned out they were .
And the process turned out to be a lot harder than either of them imagined .
They started out with Beck driving the truck while Sal sat on the tailgate , dragging a street - sweepers broom along the rails .
It worked , but not as well as they expected .
After driving that two - mile stretch of track twice , Beck came up with a much better idea .
They simply broke back into the abandoned mine , grabbed the last bucket - car we'd found near the entrance , and pushed it down the length of the tracks with the bumper of the pickup .
Once the wheels loosened up , the bucket car worked like a snowplow and cleared the tracks with a single pass .
I had my doubts that this method worked as well as they claimed , but when I drove out to the abandoned mine after work on Thursday , I saw that it had .
Two rusty metal rails poked out of the hardpan , starting at the mine entrance and extending out into the distance .
When I took a closer look at the rails , I saw that they were indeed rusty as hell , but still solid .
When I banged one with a rock , I saw plenty of good steel under the rust .
Best of all , they were straight as an arrow .
For me , this was the point where the whole project made the transition from theory to reality .
I squatted next to those tracks and realized that the last obstacle had suddenly been removed , that we really were going to run the car .
And to my surprise , it did n't feel good at all .
Suddenly the whole thing seemed stupid and insane and dangerous and illegal as hell .
But by then it was way too late to stop .
COUNTING DOWN
If the track had been ready on Monday , I do n't think I could 've convinced Beck to let the maiden voyage of the rocket car wait until Jimmy came in on the weekend .
He was far too anxious to get moving on the whole thing .
As a matter of fact , the only way I was able to get him to wait as long as I did was by agreeing to start getting things ready on Friday .
After my Dad and I went home from the yard on Friday , I returned to the yard and found Sal and Beck waiting for me .
We backed the flatbed into the weedy field where the Rocket Car was docked , set up the ramps , and hoisted the car onto the flatbed with the winch .
I drove the flatbed out to the abandoned mine and down the slope to tracks , scared shitless that I 'd get the truck stuck in the soft sand .
But I made it down the slope okay , and we lowered the Rocket Car onto the tracks .
It looked perfectly at home sitting on the rails .
Like that 's were it was meant to be all the time .
But we did n't have time to stand around admiring the way the Rocket Car looked on the tracks .
Even though we were a hundred yards from a fairly secluded stretch of highway , the sight of a five - ton flatbed , a four - wheel - drive pickup , and a rocket powered `59 Chevy on railroad wheels would 've looked pretty peculiar to anyone coming down the road .
So as soon as the car was on the rails , I climbed into the Chevy 's drivers ' seat and Beck pushed me down the tracks with the pickup 's bumper until the car was close to the mine entrance .
Actually , it almost went through the boarded - up hole in the mountain .
I was sitting there enjoying the ride , halfway to the mine entrance , when I suddenly realized that hitting the dump valve would stop the car permanently .
Or at least until we went back to the scrapyard and snagged the portable compressor to re-inflate the shocks .
About a quarter mile from the mine entrance I started waving out the window and screaming for Beck to stop , and when he finally hit the brakes , I must 've been doing about forty or so .
By the time the car coasted to a stop , I was no more than fifty feet from the entrance .
Close call .
We pulled the boards from the mine entrance again , and Beck used the pickup to ease the Chevy into the mine .
Very slowly .
Once it was all the way inside , he took me back to the flatbed , and followed me back to the yard .
I parked the flatbed where it usually spent the night , we loaded the portable compressor into the pickup , and returned to the mine .
Since we did n't have a tow chain , we had to muscle the car far enough out of the mine for Beck to get the truck in front of the Chevy and push it back down the tracks .
When we got the car about a mile from the entrance , we let the car coast to a stop , Beck got out of the pickup , and Sal slipped into the driver 's seat .
Beck jumped into the Rocket Car with a maniac grin on his face , and Sal maneuvered the pickup behind the Chevy .
Beck gave us a jaunty thumbs - up , and Sal hit the gas .
We picked up speed until we were doing about fifty , and just before I was about to scream at Sal to stop , he hit the brakes .
We watched the rocket car pull away at goodly clip .
And keep going .
And keep going .
And just as I was wondering if the brake system might have malfunctioned , I saw the ass end of the Chevy pitch up slightly as Beck hit the dump lever .
Sal and I both let out the breath we'd been holding , and drove down to where the car was stopped .
When we got there , the car was resting on the runners and Beck was sitting on the hood .
Less than twenty feet from the mine entrance .
I 'll say it again : Beck was a fucking maniac .
I thought he might make up an excuse for waiting so long to stop , that the brakes did n't work or whatever , but he did n't even bother .
The runners had scraped the rust off ten feet of the rails , and when I looked under the Rocket Car , water was still squirting out of the hoses .
When I asked what the fuck was wrong with him , Beck said " Hey , I did n't feel like pushing this fucker all the way to the garage , so I let it coast most of the way .
You have a problem with that ? "
Actually , I did n't .
The " garage " he was referring to was actually the mine shaft , where we planned to stash the car until the firing test the next day .
Nobody wanted to go through the bullshit of hauling the car back to the yard , so we decided to simply push it into the mine , replace the boards , and leave it there overnight .
And after re-inflating the shocks from the compressor in the pickup , that 's exactly what we did .
But every time I looked at those two bright spots on the rails , less than twenty feet from the boards covering that mine shaft , I wondered if it would ever be a good idea to let Beck drive the thing while a rocket was pushing it .
LEFTOFF !
The first ( and last ) test run of the Rocket Car happened on Holy Saturday , 1978 .
For the non-Christians in the house , Holy Saturday is the day before Easter , a day the faithful are supposed to spend preparing for the Easter feast and quietly contemplating the Miracle of the Resurrection .
My family has been Catholic for about a thousand generations , so I suppose this put me firmly among the ranks of " The Faithful " .
Which means the Pope probably would 've frowned on my spending the day before Easter experimenting with illegal military ordnance and trespassing on private property , but I 'm also confident that nothing in the Bible covers what we were doing that Saturday morning , so I probably had some wiggle - room .
We assembled at the abandoned mine early in the morning , just before dawn .
The prefabricated story to my parents was that Jimmy and I were driving up to .... a big city in the area ( you 'll excuse me if I do n't specify which one ) , and wanted to get an early start .
Jimmy was using the same excuse for anyone at his house who was curious .
Dad was n't even going into the yard on Holy Saturday , so I had the day to myself .
I went to Jimmy 's house and found him waiting for me on the front porch , and we left for the mine .
When we arrived , I was tremendously relieved to find that Sal and Beck were already there , sitting on the hood of the pickup , which was parked near the mine entrance .
They even had the boards pulled from the mine entrance and the car pushed out into the open .
My relief was n't due to the fact that they 'd showed up ( you could n't have kept Beck away with a court order ) but because they were just sitting on the hood of the pickup , patiently waiting for Jimmy and I to arrive .
See , the night before , we 'd loaded two of the JATO 's , the portable compressor , and three five - gallon jerry cans of water into the back of Beck 's pickup , for convenience 's sake .
It was way too much stuff to haul in my car , and we figured the gear would be safe spending the night in Beck 's truck , covered with a tarp .
What had n't occurred to me until I got home was that Beck was in possession of everything he needed to test the car himself , on the sly .
I even considered taking a ride past his house around midnight to see if the truck was still there , when it occurred to me that even though he did have the ignition button on the dashboard , he had no way to light the rocket .
And I did n't think he was stupid enough to set the car up and strap himself in while Sal stuffed lit matches into the JATO , trying to get it started .
Sal would 've done it without hesitation .
But not Beck .
I 'd like to say that depriving Beck of the igniters was a piece of intelligent foresight on my part , but it was really exactly the opposite .
I 'd just forgotten them .
We had to stop at the scrapyard to get the igniters and a hundred - foot roll of field - phone wire before we went to the mine .
Anyway , I left my car parked on the shoulder of the road , and we walked down the slope to find that Beck and Sal were aching to get the test under way .
Beck shot a look at the igniters in my hand as he was getting into the truck , but it was still too dark out to read his expression .
If I had to guess , I 'd say it was an irritated one .
Beck started the truck and drove around to the front of the Rocket Car , then left it in low gear as he pushed it to the opposite end of the track , with the rest of us riding on the tailgate .
It was n't until the car was stopped at the end of the track that Jimmy looked the car over and asked what turned out to be a VERY important question .
He said " So why is the car pointing THIS way ? "
Sal and Beck and I stared at the car for a minute , and although I can't speak for the other two , I was trying to come up with something to say .
To be honest , I 'd never given it much thought .
I suppose that when the car was brought to my Dad 's scrapyard , it was hauled onto the flatbed rear - first , because the front end was further from the path winding through the yard .
When we loaded the car to bring it to the mine , winching it onto the flatbed rear - first was simply the easiest thing to do , so that 's what we did .
And when we got to the tracks , I 'd simply driven the flatbed to the end opposite the mine shaft and parked facing away from the entrance .
It seemed like a good way to avoid driving the flatbed over the tracks themselves , which might have damaged them .
So when we rolled the car down the planks and onto the tracks , it ended up facing the mine entrance .
Sure , we could 've set it on the tracks facing the opposite way , but ... nobody thought of it .
Actually , nobody even thought to think about it .
The whole process seemed simple and straightforward , even the part where we pushed the Chevy into the mine entrance and boarded it up .
I mean , you drive a car into a garage , you do n't back it in , right ?
So the three of us gave Jimmy a shrug , and I asked him what difference it made .
He walked around the car looking thoughtful , and after awhile said " None .
This is good "
But later on I figured out what he'd been thinking about .
If something went wrong with car ( specifically the brakes ) , which way would we want it to be pointing ?
If the brakes failed while it was heading away from the mine , the car would eventually run onto the wide - gauge rails at the end of our track .
And with the flatbed back in the yard , it was n't likely we'd be able to get the car off the tracks if it got stuck there .
But with the car pointed toward the mine , a brake failure would mean the car simply flew into an abandoned silver mine .
We could declare the experiment a failure , nail the boards back up , and call it a day .
Of course the equation looked a lot different with a passenger on board , but that 's why we were doing a test run first .
Ah yes , the test run .
Once Jimmy was through looking the car over , I broke the news to Beck that the first run would be unmanned .
He did n't like the sound of that a bit , even after I explained to him that it was in his best interest .
Personally , I would n't have gone near the thing unless we'd had at least one trial , but Beck 's mind did n't work that way .
He wanted to ride in the car on the first run , and it took awhile to convince him that it simply was n't going to happen .
But after a little arguing he grudgingly accepted our logic .
We took one of the JATOS out of its crate and loaded into the pipe at the rear of the car , then I had Sal drive me down the tracks toward the mine .
When the odometer had ticked off exactly a mile , I made him stop while I got out and pounded an eight - inch spike into one of the wooden ties .
The lumber was still solid enough to hold the spike well , which was nice to see , since I had no alternative plan to activate the brakes .
We drove back to the Rocket Car and found that Jimmy and Beck had already shoved one of my igniters into the JATO nozzle , attached the leads to the roll of field - phone cable with wirenuts , and were unrolling the cable away from the tracks .
I told Sal to park about fifty feet away from the Chevy , with the broad side of the truck facing the tracks .
Jimmy had mentioned the chance of the JATO exploding like a bomb when it was ignited , and I wanted to have the pickup truck between me and the JATO when it was lit .
I filled the can under the Chevy 's hood with water from one of the jerry cans , closed the hood and rigged the automatic brake .
The wire stretched between the runners was only five or six inches above the railroad ties , and it looked low enough to catch on the spike with no problem .
Beck came over to watch the whole procedure , a little miffed that the unmanned test had obviously been planned out well in advance .
But by then it was too late for him to raise any serious objections .
If the car ran okay , he'd get his ride .
If not , he'd be grate
Or so says Errol Morris .
It ’s certainly the most honest advertising I ’ve ever seen .
A bouncer in Birmingham hit me in the face with a crescent wrench five times and my wife ’s boyfriend broke my jaw with a fence post .
So if you do n’t buy a trailer from me , it ai n’t gonna hurt my feelings .
So come on down to Cullman Liquidation and get yourself a home .
Or do n’t .
I do n’t care .
A Santa Monica sushi restaurant facing federal charges for serving endangered whale meat closed its doors for good Saturday , according to a statement posted on the Hump ’s website , which called the decision a “ self - imposed punishment . ”
“ The Hump hopes that by closing its doors , it will help bring awareness to the detrimental effect that illegal whaling has on the preservation of our ocean ecosystems and species , ” reads the statement on the restaurant ’s website .
Phone calls to the restaurant and its attorney were not answered .
Federal prosecutors last week charged the owner and chef of the restaurant at the Santa Monica Airport with the illegal sale of whale meat in violation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act , a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a maximum fine of $ 200,000 .
While the restaurant immediately took responsibility once it was charged , the charges came only after an undercover sting operation that was orchestrated by animal activists and the associate producer of the Oscar - winning documentary “ The Cove . ”
The activists used a tiny video camera to record their payment of $ 600 for the omakase , or chef ’s choice , which included eight pieces of whale .
The activists bagged samples of the meat and sent them to the Marine Mammal Institute , where they were determined to be sei whale , an endangered species .
In the online posting , the Hump also vowed to make a “ substantial contribution ” to whale preservation or endangered species groups and apologized to the public for “ our illegal actions . ”

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Geologists from the University of Leicester are among four scientists - including a Nobel prize - winner - who suggest that the Earth has entered a new age of geological time .
The Age of Aquarius ?
Not quite -
It ’s the Anthropocene Epoch , say the scientists writing in the journal Environmental Science & Technology .
( web issue March 29 ; print issue April 1 )
And they add that the dawning of this new epoch may include the sixth largest mass extinction in the Earth ’s history .
Jan Zalasiewicz and Mark Williams from the University of Leicester Department of Geology ; Will Steffen , Director of the Australian National University ’s Climate Change Institute and Paul Crutzen the Nobel Prize - winning atmospheric chemist of Mainz University provide evidence for the scale of global change in their commentary in the American Chemical Society ’s ’ bi-weekly journal Environmental Science & Technology .
The scientists propose that , in just two centuries , humans have wrought such vast and unprecedented changes to our world that we actually might be ushering in a new geological time interval , and alter the planet for millions of years .
Zalasiewicz , Williams , Steffen and Crutzen contend that recent human activity , including stunning population growth , sprawling megacities and increased use of fossil fuels , have changed the planet to such an extent that we are entering what they call the Anthropocene ( New Man ) Epoch .
First proposed by Crutzen more than a decade ago , the term Anthropocene has provoked controversy .
However , as more potential consequences of human activity — such as global climate change and sharp increases in plant and animal extinctions — have emerged , Crutzen ’s term has gained support .
Currently , the worldwide geological community is formally considering whether the Anthropocene should join the Jurassic , Cambrian and other more familiar units on the Geological Time Scale .
The scientists note that getting that formal designation will likely be contentious .
But they conclude , “ However these debates will unfold , the Anthropocene represents a new phase in the history of both humankind and of the Earth , when natural forces and human forces became intertwined , so that the fate of one determines the fate of the other .
Geologically , this is a remarkable episode in the history of this planet . ”

About 1 in 4,000 infants has a brain injury known as pre- or perinatal brain lesions , mainly as a result of stroke , with risk factors involving both mothers and babies .
Children with early brain lesions that affect one side of the brain often take longer to reach early language milestones ; these delays normalize for many but persist for some .
New research has found that children 's gesturing at 18 months can identify those children who will have these later language delays .
Researchers at the University of Chicago carried out the work , which can be found in the March / April 2010 issue of the Child Development journal .
The study looked at gestures such as pointing or waving goodbye in 11 18 - month - olds as a way of predicting later vocabulary delays .
The researchers considered gesture because recent studies have found it to be a good predictor of later language abilities in typically developing children .
The children 's language comprehension was tested when they were 30 months old .
The researchers found that gesturing at 18 months ( but not early speech ) predicted which children with lesions had vocabulary delays a year later .
The results suggest that gesture may be a tool for diagnosing persistent language delay in children with brain lesions .
These findings have both diagnostic and therapeutic implications , according to the authors of the study , Susan C. Levine , Stella M. Rowley Professor of Psychology , and Susan Goldin - Meadow , Beardsley Ruml Distinguished Service Professor , both in the Department of Psychology , Comparative Human Development , and the Committee on Education at the University of Chicago .
Notes Levine : " Gesture may be a promising diagnostic tool for identifying those children with pre- or perinatal brain lesions whose language delays are likely to persist at a time when they are saying very little .
Early identification may be useful because intervention early in development may be critical to successful remediation of language delay . "
Adds Goldin - Meadow : " The fact that gesture predicts later language delay raises the possibility that gesture itself may be an effective intervention -- encouraging children with lesions to gesture in the first 18 months of life may improve their spoken vocabulary years later . "
The study was funded , in part , by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
Glyn sez , " The Love Police do an amazing job demonstrating how to get out of being searched under section 44 of the Terrorism Act .
Stopped by police outside the Tower of London , they avoid being searched , having to give their personal details and having their camera film looked at simply by stating the law , remaining calm and polite .
( Although keeping the video camera rolling probably helped too . )
The police sent an Inspector ( rather senior ) , two Sergeants , five officers and four police cars .
But in the end they walk away . "

Spring has sprung and for thousands of northwesterners , thumbs are turning green .
But for apartment or condo dwellers — like me — urban gardening can be a challenge .
Many new buildings are being outfitted with rooftop gardens for tenants ’ use , but they ’re still spendy and scarce ; most of us will have to look to home - owning friends with a few square feet to spare or vie with neighbors for a plot in high - demand community gardens .
How does a community garden work ?
Typically , the city or program ( some are run by private developers ) sets aside a patch of land — portions of parks , undeveloped lots , etc—ranging anywhere from 2,000 - 200,000 sq. ft. in size .
The land is parceled into individual plots ranging from under 100 sq. ft. to over 400 .
Individuals pay under $ 100 / year for a plot .
Each location may have different specific requirements , but they generally make sure gardeners are actually using the plot .
I ’ve heard a lot of hype in the last couple of years , and wondering where the vegetable starts on my windowsill will be planted next month got me thinking more about community gardens in the Northwest :
How common are they ?
And how competitive can they really be ?
Find this article interesting ?
Please consider making a gift to support our work .
Just a quick perusal of city gardening sites confirmed what I ’d heard through the grapevine — there are far more green thumbs than available plots , leaving some waiting for as many as five years .
Here ’s a quick run-down of where the Northwest ’s three major metropolises stand on community gardens :
Vancouver , BC ( 4.3 plots per 1,000 people ) : The Community Gardens program has expanded greatly in the last four years — from 950 plots to 2,500 across 50 gardens .
The city also has a great program helping to match garden - owners with neighbors looking for an empty patch of soil .
Portland , Oregon ( 5.2 plots per 1,000 people ) :
The city ’s Community Gardens program hosts 32 gardens , used by about 3,000 gardeners ( with another 1,000 on the waiting list ) .
Additionally , the city sponsors programs to connect urban gardeners with surplus food with families in need , and to teach youth about gardening and food production .
Seattle , WA ( 6.3 plots per 1,000 people ) : Heralded as one of the US ’s best urban gardening programs , the P - Patch program has more than 70 gardens over 23 acres—used by 3,800 urban gardeners with another 2,000 on waitlists ( which take anywhere from three months to five years ) .
Over half of the gardeners are low income , and the program donates 7 - 10 tons of fresh produce each year through Solid Ground ’s Lettuce Link program .
Yet despite all the positive press and demand , I have to question the ability of p-patches to make a large impact on our food systems .
A dedicated community garden owner on 200 square feet might produce a substantial portion of their vegetables ( see end note ) , but a hobbyist on 90 square feet may simply contribute some tasty additions to their spring and summer suppers .
And with an average of only 5 plots per 1,000 residents of the biggest Northwest cities , the programs have a long way to go before they are a major part of our food system or a solution to poor nutrition .
Instead , I think of community gardens along the same lines as food carts — maybe the measurable benefits are n’t so great , but they have an important place in a vibrant urban culture : they often fill land that would otherwise go unused ; provide green spaces in some of our cities ’ densest neighborhoods ; contribute a significant chunk of fresh , healthy produce for those who otherwise might lack access ; give kids hands - on experience to understand where food comes from and how ecosystems work ; and , as I mentioned before , add a certain je ne sais quoi to dense , urban living by providing non-homeowners with one of the more fun advantages of having a yard .
Perhaps most importantly , there ’s an enhanced sense of community when a group of neighbors get together and dig into the earth .
Certainly the Victory Gardens of both World Wars provided a morale booster to civilians who felt like they were contributing to war effort ( if Wikipedia is to be trusted — and it probably is n’t — they contributed 40 percent of the US ’s vegetable consumption ) .
Maybe community gardens provide a similar morale boost for those engaged in the slow - motion sustainability revolution .
Unfortunately , with a waiting time of at least a year , it does n’t look like a p- patch will be the answer for my veggies this year .
But it ’s good to see such enthusiasm for public green spaces .
I ’m curious to hear if any of our readers have a community garden plot — and if so , what you think about it ?

Now that trackbacks from this site are visible in our comments stream ( yes , I ’ve installed yet another commenting system — more on that in a future post ) I ’m noticing a lot of incoming links from something called Boycott Novell .
Today , I humbly ask for your help in figuring out whether or not this is what the cool kids are apparently calling “ sping ” .
Sping is a term for trackbacks to a blog containing mostly spam .
Ordinarily I would be as thrilled as any other blogger to be linked to from far and wide across the web , but what Boycott Novell is linking to here has little if anything to do with their stated mandate :
Exploring the reality behind exclusionary deals with Microsoft and their subtle ( yet severe ) implications .
Granted , the links are being posted on the news roundup section of their site .
Yet that page ( like all the others ) is firmly under the control of the author ’s agenda .
And who is the person behind Boycott Novell ?
It ’s Roy Schestowitz , and he was interviewed on FLOSS weekly late last year .
I endured the hour - plus interview yesterday and it was n’t easy — Mr. Schestowitz did n’t really answer anything to my satisfaction — in fact , at the end of the interview he even went so far as to say that the questions were n’t put to him in a way that he could answer .
It must have been a supremely frustrating experience for interviewer Jono Bacon ; he certainly conducted himself with more patience and professionalism than I would have been able to muster , given the circumstances .
To call someone a spammer / splogger ( spinger ? ) is a serious allegation , I know — but there ’s other evidence supporting this claim .
Verofakto’s blog reports at least six accounts on link sharing sites all operated by the same user , and all sharing the same obsession with anti-Novell / Microsoft news .
Schestowitz and his site have become so infamous as to inspire a site called Boycott “ Boycott Novell ” .
Now I ’m obviously no fan of Microsoft , but I ’m wondering if I should delete these Boycott Novell trackbacks , or is there some other piece of the puzzle that I ’m missing here ?
When this appeared in my inbox yesterday , courtesy of Richard Saunders ( who was kind enough to ask me if I was sitting down first ) I initially * facepalmed * , then sought about getting the original paper where this apparent break through research had appeared ( thanks to @xtaldave for the full text ) .
The paper that had apparently found homeopathy to be as effective as chemo for breast cancer ( according to Homeopathy Plus ! , yes those guys ) , was published in the International Journal of Oncology * and entitled “ Cytotoxic Effects of Ultra Diluted Remedies on Breast Cancer Cells . ”
( Full text has been removed because quackers were linking to it for nefarious purposes >
Click the link for the full pdf of the study ) .
The paper examines the effects of ultra-dilute remedies ( read: homeopathy ) on the induction of cell death in two cancer cell lines ( commercially available MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 ) and one immortalised control cell line , ( HMLE ) .
The authors use several remedies already in use for the treatment of human breast cancer developed at the P. Banerji Homeopathic Research Foundation in India , Kolkata ;
Carcinosin , 30C ; Conium maculatum , 3C ; Phytolacca decandra , 200C and Thuja occidentalis , 30C ( for an explanation of how dilute these remedies are see here ) .
All remedies were diluted in 87 % “ extra neutral alcohol ” and succussed , including the alcohol used as the control solvent .
The authors analysed each remedy with high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) to look for differences , then measured cell death in cell culture in response to increasing doses and increasing time of incubation with each remedy .
These measures include the MTT assay for cell viability , Annexin V and PI for apoptosis , FISH for DNA breakage and Western blots to measure activation of cell cycle proteins .
Technically the paper is quite well written .
The problems lie with the data .
And these problems are so massive , I wonder how they got by the reviewers .
I do n’t know whether they were dozing when they reviewed this paper , but I could immediately see some big fat gaping holes in their results .
First up a few pointers ;
“ The experiments were conducted in triplicate and repeated at least twice in each case of remedy ”
This would not get past me .
It is accepted scientific convention that experiments are done at least three times ( not two ) and also in triplicate , giving you a final “ n ” number of 9 .
These studies were done in cell culture , meaning there is plenty of material for experiments to be repeated as many times as you wish .
So why were they only done twice ?
Three is convention because it gives the study more statistical power .
Ah statistics , huh ?
There is a distinct lack of statistics in this paper , by which I mean there are none at all .
As my friend Jo said ; “ Nary a p- value nor a confidence interval to be seen ” .
Which begs the question , how can you get a paper accepted in a peer reviewed journal without doing an statistical analysis ?
Really ?
No , I mean REALLY ?
This is why I suspect the reviewers were dozing or drunk .
And by not doing any statistical analysis , you can not make any statements about whether the treatments are different to each other .
Statistics uses algorithms to calculate mathematical differences with a degree of confidence ( usually 95 % ) so that we do n’t rely on visual interpretation , which is notoriously unreliable .
But this does n’t seem to have bothered these authors , or the reviewers .
So let ’s look more closely at the results .
Firstly the HPLC .
Oh wait a sec , there are no results shown for HPLC .
And neither do the authors say “ no results shown ” .
They just make some rather confused statements about what they think they saw and move on .
What ?!
I need to see the chromatograms .
What possible reason could they have for not including this data , especially when they go on to describe it so badly in the text .
“ All four remedies had very similar HPLC chromatograms to each other , with only trace amounts of limited number of peaks .
They were not significantly distinct from the solvent and they lacked the distinct peak seen in the solvent .
So , this means that all the remedies were the same , ie .
no different to the solvent and no other peaks indicating any ingredients .
But then they contradict themselves by saying that the remedies did not have the solvent peak ?
Fail .
And then ;
“ The chromatogram of the untreated and treated solvents appeared identical , indicating that succussion did not cause chemical changes in the solvent . ”
Okay , but do n’t some homeopaths claim that succussion does have an effect on the chemical structure of the water / solvent ?
Is n’t this how they explain that homeopathy works ?
I can only guess SINCE WE CANNOT SEE THE CHROMATOGRAMS , but what you are saying is the remedies and the solvent were exactly the same , meaning they are solvent .
No surprises there .
What about the cell death studies ?
So let ’s look at the cell death studies since these constitute the crux of the study ’s aims .
That is , to determine if these ultra dilute remedies can induce cell death in cancer cell lines .
So here we have results for all three cell lines , two cancerous and one control , and they are all treated with a control ( the 87 % alcohol solvent ) or the remedies and death measured by MTT assay .
Here ’s how they describe it in the text ;
“ Interestingly , the inhibitory effects on cell viability of the remedies in both the MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells were distinctly greater for each of the doses tested than those seen in cells treated only with solvent . ”
Which translates as the treatments killed the cells better than the solvent alone .
Okay , so it looks like it did when you eye ball the histograms , but you have no evidence for this – you did n’t do stats , therefore you can not say this !
Sheesh , where did you learn to write science ?
But why not keep the fail going ;
“ MCF - 7 cells were found to be more sensitive to all four remedies than the MDA - MB - 231 cells ” .
Again no statistics , so this statement cannot be confirmed .
When you do science properly and you run statistical analysis , you are entitled to say , “ MCF - 7 cells were found to be significantly more sensitive to all four remedies than the MDA - MB - 231 cells ” .
Unless you ’re these authors , then you just get a great big FAIL stamp on your work .
Also note that they state that the control treatment ( that is the solvent ) also induced cell death in all cell types ;
“ As shown in Fig. 1A , the solvent reduced the viability of all three cell types ; the overall reduction in cells at different doses of solvent was about 30 % for MCF - 7 , 20 - 30 % for MDA - MB - 231 and 20 % for HMLE cells . ”
Ummm , hold on a sec .
This is your control treatment , which means it should not be causing cell death .
It is designed to be inert , functioning as a carrier of your treatment , in order that you can measure the impact of the treatment alone .
If your solvent or vehicle is killing your cells you have a fundamental problem .
You need to go back to the drawing board and find a different solvent to deliver your treatment .
This is a very big problem right here .
If the cell death induced by the solvent is significant , then the rest of the paper is worthless .
But because there are no stats here , there is no way to tell if death by the solvent is significant .
According to the above statement , the alcohol killed ~ 30 % of the cancer cells compared to no treatment at all .
Although this effect was increased when the treatment was present , there remains a large problem with your model if your solvent is killing the cells .
Perhaps this explains why there are no stats in this paper ?
Because they may in fact show that the “ inert ” solvent also significantly kills the cancer cells ?
Once again , there is no way for me to know this without access to the raw data , or the statistical analysis .
Man , how the hell did this embarrassment get accepted ?
Well now that I have revealed a fundamental flaw in this tripe I have lost the will to continue .
There is much more fail herein however , I mean we are only at Figure 1 remember .
So I will cover just a few more things that are also glaringly obviously wrong with this paper , then I will send a large bottle of 87 % alcohol to the editorial board and encourage them to keep up the good work of smiting the peer review process and science in general .
General lack of quantitation of results in this paper .
Figure 3 ( left ) shows fluorescent microscopy data for DNA breakage as measured by FISH assay .
But where is the quantitation of this data ?
The authors show a representative image for each treatment , and this is usually acceptable if you then measure large numbers of cells and report on such changes with numbers ( see below ) .
Further , even in the fluorescent images the authors only show a maximum of 14 cells .
What the hell can you glean from 14 cells ?
They even say ;
“ At least 200 cells from treated and untreated samples were analyzed for mitotic index and telomeric DNA signals with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope equipped with fluorescence attachment and a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 monochrome digital camera . ”
So where is this data ?
Not in this paper , I can tell you that .
Next up Western blots .
Then they move onto Western blots .
Actually this looks like the most resolved part of the paper .
They have normalised everything to beta-actin as convention goes , and they have indicated the time of exposure to treatments .
But as I mentioned earlier , if their control treatment 87 % alcohol , is killing cells , then what can we glean from this data ?
Well not much except the effect could be an additive effect of the alcohol and treatment .
There is no way to differentiate the impact of the treatment versus the control .
Flow cytometry , not quantitated either .
Sigh .
I spend most of my days doing flow cytometry , so I am pretty familiar with how it works and what are the accepted ways to present the data .
This is not one of them .
The assay they use ( Annexin V and PI ) is a common one and I use it often .
Standard procedure is to count ~ 10,000 cells for each condition , then plot your results on a graph , like this ( see left below ) .
You might also show your scatter plots as they have done above , as a nice visual demonstration of how the cells respond to the treatment , but this is not quantitation .
I ’m going to stop there .
I wo n’t even bother dealing with the discussion and conclusions , because by my analysis , they are based on flawed data .
One thing I will say about Homeopathy Plus !
yelling “ Homeopathy as good as chemotherapy for breast cancer ” is not a conclusion you can draw from this study .
For all the reasons I have addressed above as well as the really obvious point that these studies were conducted in cell culture .
This is a very different situation to a whole animal .
Cells bathing in a bath of homeopathy is very different to the processes which occur in vivo , for example the treatment must survive the low pH of the stomach , cross the gut , escape metabolism in the liver and get to the site of the cancer then do it ’s job .
This is a very complex process and very difficult to control .
Studies in cell culture can provide data about the mechanism of action of a compound , but rarely do they relate to the processes in a human .
Never extrapolate results from a culture dish to a whole animal .
You will undoubtedly be wrong and look like a fool .
Ooh , did someone say Homeopathy Plus !?
Listen to Fran Sheffield from Homeopathy Plus ! talk about how homeopathy works here ( mp3 , 3:19 ) .

JEFFERSON CITY , Mo. — A Missouri man who won a $ 258 million Powerball jackpot and plans to use some of the money to pay bills and take his children to Disney World says he has n't decided yet if he 'll quit his job at the convenience store where he bought the winning ticket .
Chris Shaw — a 29 - year - old tattooed father of three who was raised by his grandparents in rural southern Missouri — came forward Thursday as the winner of the 10th - largest Powerball jackpot ever .
Shaw said he had just $ 28.96 in his bank account and recently bought a 1998 Ford Ranger from a friend who agreed to let him pay off the $ 1,000 price $ 100 at a time .
Now , he said , he no longer has to worry about how he 'll pay his friend — or his utility bills .
" We did n't come from money .
For us it 's just going to be a huge relief to know I 'm going to be able to pay my electric bill , my gas bill , " Shaw told the Associated Press .
" It 's like a weight lifted .
I had bills at home I did n't know how they were going to be paid . "
Shaw said he bought the $ 5 ticket Wednesday at the Break Time convenience store where he works in Marshall , a central Missouri town about 80 miles east of Kansas City .
He accepted his ceremonial check at the Missouri Lottery headquarters in Jefferson City wearing a tan and red plaid shirt , a red hat and a huge grin — minus two front teeth he says he lost because he did n't take care of them but can now afford to have replaced .
" I 'm just a regular guy working paycheck to paycheck ... well not any more , " he said .
Shaw said he needed a few days to decide whether he will keep his minimum - wage job at the store where he has worked for just three weeks .
He also plans to seek advice " from people who know about money " about whether to take the jackpot in 30 payments over 29 years or the lump - sum amount of $ 124,875,122 .
His boss , Jackie Maxwell , general manager of the Missouri - based Break Time convenience store chain , was thrilled to hear Shaw had won .
" He 's just a great guy , a good employee .
When you think of a large winner like this , everyone likes to see that the person who won is somebody like Chris , " she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
Shaw — who has a 10 - year - old son , a 7 - year - old girl and a 5 - year - old girl by two different women — said he had played Missouri Scratchers lottery tickets before , winning at most $ 80 .
He checked his Powerball ticket against the state lottery 's website only after his girlfriend , Tosha Ewry , told him the winning ticket was bought at the store where he works .
When Shaw called Ewry back to tell her the news , she thought he was joking , he said .
Finally , he said he told her : " I swear on a stack of Bibles , you need to leave work and come home . "
The winning numbers were 11-34-41-49-55 , Powerball 20 .
The Power Play number was 2 .
Shaw said he looks forward to spending more time with his kids , who live with their mothers about 240 miles southeast of him in his hometown of Alton , as well as with his girlfriend 's two sons — 13 - year - old and 15 - year - old boys Shaw says he considers his own .
He plans to take them all to Disney World in Florida .
" I can be with them as much as I want now , " Shaw said .
He said his children already have been asking for new skateboards , bicycles and " just stuff that 's really hard to do when you make $ 7.25 an hour . "
Break
Time will receive $ 50,000 for selling the winning ticket .
If Shaw takes a lump - sum payment , the state income taxes due on the winnings would be about $ 6 million , state budget director Linda Luebbering said .
Le Genève - Servette HC tient son premier transfert pour la saison prochaine .
Selon la " Tribune de Genève " , le club genevois a engagé l'attaquant américain à licence suisse Eric Walsky ( 25 ans ) .
Celui - ci a été repéré voici plusieurs mois par Chris McSorley lors de l'un de ses voyages outre-Atlantique .
Originaire de l'Alaska , Walsky fait partie de l'organisation des Vancouver Canucks mais n'a jamais évolué en NHL .
Il a transité par plusieurs clubs d'AHL et d'ECHL .
Seul un contrat professionnel en NHL , voire en AHL , pourrait éventuellement lui faire renoncer à une arrivée aux Vernets .

( CNN ) -- Real men eat salads .
I know this because I am a dude .
Right now , in my fridge , I have five bottles of hot sauce , a jar of Cheez Whiz and half a pack of hot dogs .
But recently I went to lunch with a couple of buds , and I ordered a salad .
I ordered it hard .
It was a basic frissée salad with bacon , shallots and a poached egg , tossed in a light vinaigrette .
Frissée is a curly , toothsome leaf , bitter enough to balance bacon and egg but still possessed of a pleasant spring .
My friends laughed at me .
They pointed .
One ordered a burger , the other fried calamari .
I was chastised for not eating " man food . "
For those of you who are n't familiar with this gender normative term , " man food " is food that you 'd imagine a lumberjack or a cowboy or a Viking would eat .
Towers of butter - soaked pancakes .
Pots of napalm - hot chili .
Meat on a bone .
Thoroughly unsubtle , " man food " is rustic fare meant to satisfy a hearty appetite .
Quantity is prized over quality .
Calories are " fun points . "
The more " fun points , " the tastier the belly filler .
But sometimes a dude needs a change .
Specifically , a salad .
A fresh , crisp , crunchy salad .
Salads offer breathers between manly meals .
Spinach , cucumber , tomato , red onions , mushrooms , chickpeas , oil and vinegar -- that is my usual jam .
I do n't need any fancy , goopy dressings compromising my vegetables .
( What does a ranch actually taste like , anyway ? )
Sometimes , I might throw some almonds or walnuts up in there .
I 've been known to be down with blueberries and mandarin oranges .
I like bacon or grilled chicken on occasion .
I am not a fan of unnecessary carbs like croutons .
And then there are those moments I go crazy and get a frissée freakin ' salad .
I did n't evolve without help .
There was a time where , if I cut myself shaving , I 'd bleed sausage gravy .
My heart squeezed more than it pumped .
And I also grew what I call " fat wings . "
Luckily , the woman I was dating at that time did n't like any of those things .
Being able to sit in a bathtub full of buffalo wings is every dude 's birthright , but I eventually learned that being attractive for your significant other is also pretty manly .
My girlfriend was a smart woman and did n't bring up my devolving into a human biscuit .
What she did was announce that we were going to save money so that Saturday nights , we could go to the local barbecue joint and destroy some cow with our faces .
Obviously , my first thought was , " Aww , she wants me to help her lose weight . "
So I humored her .
She came home from the supermarket with a stack of plastic disposable containers .
In each , she put one potential salad ingredient .
Not only the ones that would become my favorite but kidney beans , green peppers , corn and pepperoni slices .
She created a mini-salad bar in our fridge .
It was easy , and I was told I could eat as much as I wanted .
This became my lunch and occasional dinner .
You know what ?
We saved money .
I lost weight .
Gained energy .
And my girlfriend and I , well , let 's just say we had the whoopee time .
I kept this up this salad - centric diet for months .
My friends would come over to watch a fight or brawl on the PlayStation , and I 'd meet them at the door with a salad in my hand .
The landlord would need my help with some drywall ; I 'd put my salad down .
At work , I 'd articulate corporate strategy during lunch meetings spearing cucumbers in my lucky bowl of awesome salad .
I made eating salad sexy .
I made it macho , macho .
Is it rabbit food ?
Friend , if it 's rabbit food , then that rabbit is the size of a ferocious bear .
My friends poked fun at me as I munched on my fancy salad .
It was tasty .
I love how the warm yolk from the poached egg lightly coated the frissée , adding a dimension of hardiness to a dish with such leafy bounce .
And the bacon chunks added just the right amount of fatty salt , more sturdy ballast .
I wiped my mouth .
We were out celebrating one guy 's birthday .
The other guy , an old friend from college , was " in - between gigs . "
It had been another tough year .
" Salad is not man food , " they mocked .
Oh , but it is .
I ordered a final round of beers .
Then I picked up the check .
Are salads manly ?
What is the manliest salad ?
Are you the sort of guy who would n't touch a salad if a gun was put to his head ?
Tell us in the comments whether you think salads can count as " man food . "
America 's hidden debt bombs
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
America 's total debt load is on pace to top $ 13 trillion this year , and $ 22 trillion by 2020 -- and that 's just the debt we 're counting .
What 's not being counted : potential debt bombs that do n't get factored into most budget analysis .
When anyone talks about U.S. debt , they typically refer to two numbers .
The first is the debt held by the public .
That 's money owed to those who have bought U.S. Treasurys , most notably big bond mutual funds and foreign governments .
Debt held by the public today is roughly $ 8 trillion and rising .
The second number is the money the federal government owes to government trust funds , such as those for Medicare and Social Security .
The government has used revenue collected for those programs to cover other outlays .
Currently , the debt to the trust funds is approaching $ 5 trillion .
The two combined is the total gross debt that 's accounted for .
But deficit hawks also worry about what 's not on the books .
Here is just a sampling of the unseen or underplayed obligations that could worsen the debt outlook :
Losses from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are private companies that for years had the implicit backing of the federal government .
That backing assured investors that if anything went seriously south for the companies Uncle Sam likely -- although not absolutely -- would step in .
Well , things did go south , and now both are run by the federal government .
While the implicit guarantee has become explicit for Fannie and Freddie , its treatment in the budget is up in the air .
" Our budget does n't have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on it , even though it 's owned lock , stock and barrel by the American taxpayer , " said Rudolph Penner , a former director of the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) during a conference held by the Peterson - Pew Commission on Budget Reform .
Last year , the CBO did start to account for both companies as if they were federal agencies on the budget .
But the White House Budget Office only includes some potential costs because the future of the two companies is still under consideration .
Last week , a Republican congressman introduced a bill that would require the two agencies be put on the budget .
It 's still not clear what the companies ' total hit to the federal budget will be .
Amherst Securities , a broker - dealer in residential mortgage - backed securities , estimated that the total loss on the mortgages backed by the companies could reach $ 448 billion , with a portion of that covered by reserves or assumed by outside parties .
The CBO estimated the net costs to the government could top $ 370 billion by 2020 .
These are just estimates .
But what 's clear is that Fannie and Freddie are not cheap dependents .
That 's why some argue that lawmakers should assess the potential costs of implicit government guarantees well before things go to pot .
" Their costs are largely unmeasured , unrecognized in the budget and unmanaged , " federal budget expert Marvin Phaup wrote in a recent paper .
" A troubling aspect of current policy aimed at restarting the financial markets is the likely expansion of implied guarantees to include the obligations of additional private financial institutions . "
Unfunded promises
The governments ' accrued debt to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds is known .
And making those payments -- which begin in earnest this decade -- wo n't be easy given the drop in federal revenue and the surge in government spending .
" [ Lawmakers ] need to acknowledge they have no way of funding them right now , " said tax expert Len Burman , a professor of public administration and economics at Syracuse University .
But the piece of future entitlement debt that 's not reflected under current budget protocols is what the government will have to pay into the system after its payments to the trust funds end -- which will happen by 2037 for Social Security and within the next decade for Medicare .
At that point , the programs will only be collecting enough in taxes to pay a portion of the benefits currently promised .
There will be enormous pressure on the government to make up the difference , and Uncle Sam would have to borrow a lot of money to do so .
Some budget experts like Stuart Butler , vice president for domestic and economic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation , would like to see the long - term obligations to Medicare and Social Security included in lawmakers ' annual consideration of the federal budget .
Right now , money allocated to both entitlement programs is considered " mandatory " spending and therefore the spending increases for the programs are on autopilot and the financial commitment is uncapped in future years .
True cost of tax breaks
Everybody loves tax breaks .
And there 's more than a trillion dollars of them to love .
That 's the amount of money the Treasury foregoes in annual revenue as a result of the many breaks in the tax code .
And that effectively increases the government 's need to borrow .
But that trillion - plus is n't really up for consideration during annual budget discussions .
" Tax expenditures are basically hidden , " Burman said .
No one advocates abolishing tax breaks altogether .
But Burman and others believe tax breaks should be treated as discretionary spending .
The idea is to bring them into the open so lawmakers can make a conscious decision annually about what they spend on tax breaks and recognize the costs associated with that decision .
Long - term costs of new rules
This year is the first year in which high - income investors with traditional IRAs or 401 ( k ) s -- both of which let savings grow tax - deferred until withdrawn -- will have a chance to convert their accounts into Roth IRAs , where investments grow tax - free .
The new conversion rule is scored as a revenue raiser on the federal budget over the next decade because those who convert must pay the tax owed on their traditional IRA savings the year they convert .
But long - term it 's a different story .
Since investments in the converted accounts will grow tax - free , Uncle Sam will collect less revenue than he otherwise might have had the investors kept their ever - larger savings in a traditional IRA and paid taxes on them in retirement .
" It will cost federal coffers a lot beyond the 10 - year window , " Burman said .
Michelle Obama ’s popularity has n’t gone unnoticed by British political spin-doctors .
Well before Prime Minister Gordon Brown fired the starting gun Tuesday for the Britain general election campaign , the wives of both the Labour and Conservative leaders had been playing increasingly important roles designed to enhance their partners ’ appeal to voters .
The unprecedented importance of political spouses – Tory leader David Cameron calls his wife Samantha his " secret weapon " – is just one of the ways in which the campaign resembles a US presidential election like none before .
Like a political version of the WWII film The Americanization of Emily , in which a roguish James Garner plies English rose Julie Andrews with pilfered US chocolate and nylons , Britain 's politicians are reaching across the Atlantic to woo voters .
Tactics and strategies include the use of Obama - style Internet campaigning to harness grassroots activists , negative campaigning offensives which target specific personalities , US - style presidential debates -- and political consultants on both sides who assisted the successful 2008 Obama campaign .
The focus on personalities demonstrates how British general elections have started to resemble presidential - style races rather than battles between competing power blocs , even though there is clear blue water between both of the main parties on economic issues in this campaign .
Why the change ?
UK voters want it that way .
“ This is the first election where the individual leaders have actually been as high as the policies in terms of priorities identified by voters , ” says Roger Mortimore , Head of Political Research at pollsters Ipsos MORI .
Charisma matters
No surprise then that the Tories have been hammering away at Brown , as woefully lacking the charisma and communication skills of his predecessor , Tony Blair .
Mr. Brown ’s wife , Sarah , has been playing a key role in efforts to humanize the Labour Party leader ’s often distant and dour image , introducing him at last year ’s Labour Party conference as “ My husband , my hero . "
Formerly a formidable public relations executive who chose to focus on her family and charity work after marrying Brown , her public profile has grown over the past year while her one million plus followers on the social networking site Twitter amount to six times the membership of the Labour party .
Conservative activists are hoping that her success can be emulated by Samantha Cameron , the creative director of a luxury goods company and blue - blooded descendant of King Charles II .
The postures , pronouncements and – most of all the clothes – worn by both women have become permanent daily fixtures of press coverage , something which both Cameron and Brown seem to be in no hurry to stop .
Why ?
The answer may be the crucial importance all parties are attaching to female voters , a demographic who favored Labour in the past two elections but who currently back the Conservatives in polls by 37 points to 29 .
Soccer ' mums '?
The US - experience has been influential in this regard according to Sarah Lapham , a Texas - born public relations consultant now living in London .
“ Many people believe it was a soccer mum vote which pushed Obama over the edge to win the US election , and it ’s also a factor here , ” she adds .
Sam Baker , editor - in - chief of Red Magazine , one of Britain ’s leading women ’s magazines , agrees that the influence of Michelle Obama has been a factor in the current election campaign , but adds that attempts to specifically target the votes of women have been a fixture of British politics since at least the mid 90s .
Then , " Worcester Woman " became shorthand for a type of middle - class female voter that Labour needed to win over to capture formerly solid Tory seats .
“ It is true to say though that ever since Blair , campaigns have become a lot more presidential in style and much more about personality , ” says Ms. Baker .
Similarities to last year ’s US election meanwhile also extend to cyberspace .
In particular , Labour has invested heavily in strategies to help party members access databases that allow them to contact voters and build relationships .
" Historically Labour has used technology as a form of control , ” Douglas Alexander , the party ’s election co-coordinator told the Guardian in February .
“ We would use pagers and faxes to send out messages telling people what line to take .
The key learning from the Obama campaign is to use technology to empower your supporters . "
According to Ms. Lapham , the PR executive , the ways in which both of the main parties have deployed new social media mirrors the way they are approaching the campaign as a whole .
While Labour ’s approach has been more “ issue specific , ” the Conservatives have sought to capitalize on the popularity of their leader through " Webcameron , " a video blog which has featured him talking to voters while being filmed doing chores at home in the family kitchen .
Next week will see the advent of Britain ’s most conspicuous import from American elections – televised debates .
UK debates ?
Obama vs. Obama
Brown , Cameron , and Nick Clegg , the leader of the Liberal Democrats , will go head to head on April 15 in the first of three separately themed encounters , starting with domestic affairs .
In a bid to get in shape , both the Tories and Labour have once again reached across the Atlantic to borrow some of Barack Obama 's election - winning know - how
The Tories are being assisted by Anita Dunn , a former White House communications director , and Bill Knapp , a former adviser to both Obama and Bill Clinton .
Labour has signed up Joel Benenson , Obama 's lead campaign pollster and strategist , as well as Michael Sheehan , a speech coach who also worked on the Obama campaign .
Sheehan specializes in “ loosening up ” politicians who lack charisma under the television lights , such as John Kerry , the failed 2004 Democrat presidential candidate .
Most observers in the UK say he has his work cut out for him .

A Tennessee student has accused his school of discrimination after he was told to go home and change out of a t - shirt bearing the word ‘ gay ’ .
Cole Goforth , 15 , went to Greenbrier High School wearing a shirt that read “ I Heart Lady Gay Gay ” , a play on the name of bisexual singer Lady Gaga .
The openly gay student says the school has tolerated him wearing similar shirts in the past .
He and his mother Julie Gordon say his freedom of speech has been violated .
“ I just think my sexuality is n’t widely accepted around here , so of course they are going to single me out , ” Cole told UPI .
Danny
Weeks , assistant director of the school board , said : “ We ’ve had a few disruptions the last few days , and we thought the slogan on that shirt would continue to escalate those incidents that had occurred . ”
The school has said that Ms Gordon is welcome to appeal against its dress code .
Lady Gaga used Twitter to commend the student , calling him “ an inspiration ” .
She wrote : “ I love you Cole , you just be yourself .
You ’re perfect the way God made you . ”
The 73 - year - old actor , who disclosed his cancer last October , appeared to be in good spirits as he arrived for the ceremony on Hollywood Boulevard in front of the Egyptian Theater .
He appeared having lost a significant amount of weight ; his face , shaded partly by a newsboy cap , appeared gaunt and a heavy jacket hung off his body .
Months after revealing that he was battling prostate cancer , Dennis Hopper was back in front of the cameras on Friday morning when he received the 2,403th star on Hollywood ’s Walk of Fame .
Joseph Mannis , Hopper ’s lawyer , has said that the actor is too weak to participate in a deposition for a divorce case with his wife .
Friday ’s appearance , however , was approved by Hopper ’s doctor , who described the ceremony in court documents as a positive experience for the actor .
According to the documents , the physician also said Hopper weighs about 100 pounds .
The atmosphere at the ceremony was cheerful .
Hundreds of fans crowded behind metal barricades to snap pictures and cheer for the actor as Leron Gubler , the president and chief executive of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce , listed Hopper ’s numerous credits , which include " Rebel Without a Cause , " " Easy Rider , " ( which he co-wrote , directed and starred in ) " Blue Velvet " and " Speed . "
Also in attendance were a number of Hopper ’s family members , including his young daughter Galen , who was celebrating her seventh birthday .
Throughout the proceedings she bounced to her feet to cheer for her father , later posing with her arms around his neck .
Before taking the stage , Hopper listened to tributes from actor Viggo Mortensen and film producer Mark Canton .
Also in attendance were “ Easy Rider ” co-star Jack Nicholson , " Blue Velvet " director David Lynch and philanthropist Eli Broad .
“ In the short attention span of most moviegoers and critics , he is someone who has seemed to regularly rise out of the ashes of self - inflicted chaos , surprising us with his originality and wit as an artist and defying the odds by somehow staying alive physically and professionally , ” said Mortensen , who greeted Hopper with a large kiss on the cheek .
The two costarred in 1991 ’s “ The Indian Runner ” and 1993 ’s “ Boiling Point . ”
Hopper was helped up to the stage by aides .
His speech was slightly labored but his words were clear and heartfelt .
After introducing his family , the actor shared a poignant moment to explain why he had bandages on his arm and above his eye .
“ I want to thank the paparazzi , ” he began , “ because yesterday I got up — I ’ve been working for this day , to look as good as possible to look as strong as possible . ”
He explained that when leaving his house on Thursday , he heard someone yell his name .
He thought it was a friend but it was actually the paparazzi .
When he turned around , he lost his balance , falling directly on his face due to lack of " muscles , " he said .
“ So I got pretty screwed up , ” he said .
“ Anyway , I know you have a tough job , but sometimes maybe you ought to be a little more sensitive . ”
Hopper has become a tabloid staple since January , when he filed for divorce after 14 years of marriage to his wife , Victoria .
A much publicized battle has ensued between the couple , with Victoria claiming in court filings that Hopper is trying to rob her of her inheritance .
Hopper has denied the claim .
After the ceremony , Hopper ’s closest friends milled about before heading to a private luncheon .
Broad , who hugged Hopper for a few moments , reinforced his friend ’s message that the paparazzi should respect people ’s privacy .
“ I think Dennis is a great person , a great asset to the film industry , to the art world and to Los Angeles , ” he said .
“ So you ca n’t pay attention to what some of these tabloid stories are about .
He ’s a great friend . ”
The two became close through the art world , and Broad revealed that the Museum of Contemporary Art in Downtown Los Angeles will have its own Hopper exhibit this summer .
Actor Clifton Collins Jr. , whose grandfather Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez was a studio contract player with Hopper , said he was glad Hopper addressed the tabloid situation .
“ The tabloids can be pretty mean and insensitive , ” he said .
“ It ’s like , come on .
You love his work , why do you want to kick a man when he ’s down ?
Why not give him some love and some hope and support him and appreciate what he ’s given us ? ”

27 - year old James Swan was so incensed after his mother told him to quiet down his World of Warcraft playing that he choked her , before ramming his own head through a wall .
According to Kotaku , Swan , of Manatee , Florida , was playing World of Warcraft while drinking on the 11th February , when his 50 - year old mother interrupted his play session to tell him to hush up because her three grandchildren were sleeping .
Police say that after Swan ignored the simple request , his mother put a hand on his shoulder , at which point he stood up , grabbed his mother by the hair and threw her across the room .
According to a police report released by the Bradenton Herald , she managed to get into the kitchen to dial 911 .
Swan then ripped the phone off the wall , and plunged his head into the hole where it had been .
He then threw his mother to the ground and started choking her .
Seeing the struggle , Swan ’s grandfather took a gun into the room , where , still holstered , the gun misfired , grazing James Swan ’s ear .
Of course , it is impossible to shift the blame entirely on the game , but it is certainly part of the issue .
No one was seriously injured .
And now Swan is stewing in a cell .
NITRO , W.VA . — Jack Woodall worked at the plant for 30 years .
In his first year and part of the second , he made weedkiller .
That 's the way it worked .
The new guys at the plant had to make the weedkiller .
It was a rite of passage .
First they mixed the chemicals , then dried them to form a powder or cake .
Then the powder was bagged and sent away .
At the end of each day , they had to clean .
They swept the extra powder into bins so it could be taken to landfills and burned , Woodall says .
They hosed the equipment from top to bottom , washing the extra chemicals into the sewer .
[ See photos of Nitro , W. Va . ]
The fumes from the chemicals were noxious .
They caused workers ' skin to blister .
To protect their faces , Woodall and his coworkers were given jars of cream .
That did n't help very much .
This was in 1961 and part of 1962 .
Today , Woodall still smells the chemicals .
He smells them coming from his skin when he sweats , and in the summer his pillowcases turn yellow where the fabric touches his cheek .
" I know the smell anywhere , " he says .
" I know the old dioxin smell . "
The plant was owned by Monsanto and was in a sprawling compound along the edge of the Kanawha River about 15 miles northwest of Charleston , the state capital .
Monsanto made all sorts of chemicals there , including the weedkiller with the chemical name 2,4,5 - T .
With so many different materials being combined , there were always byproducts , and dioxin was one of them .
Dioxin is best known for being a contaminant in Agent Orange , a herbicide used in Vietnam .
The military sprayed it widely to clear the jungles .
The Vietnamese refer to it as " the last ghost " of the war .
More than half a million Vietnamese children have been born with birth defects .
Agent Orange has been linked to leukemia in American Vietnam veterans .
The United States has its ghosts , too .
For the better part of 30 years , Nitro has been grappling with the legacy of dioxin .
The plant is long gone , leaving a vacant lot , part gravel and part pavement , with weeds — weeds , of all things — growing here and there in the cracks .
In one direction , an old water tower , once white but now covered with rust , watches over the town ; in the other direction , the long smokestacks of the John E. Amos Coal Plant in the neighboring town of Poca rise in the distance .
Cleanup .
The only things that hint of what was here are signs that say " No Trespassing .
Solutia , Inc. " Monsanto spun off Solutia as a separate company in 1997 .
It inherited many of the problems Monsanto left behind .
Solutia is about to start work on a four - to - five - year project to keep any of the chemicals that are still in the soil at the Nitro plant site from getting into the water .
The Environmental Protection Agency has been in and out of Nitro for nearly half a century .
In the mid-1980s , under EPA orders , Monsanto investigated part of the site and , after finding soil contaminated with dioxin , removed about 500 gallons of soil , the EPA says .
More than a decade later , investigators turned to the water .
The state and the EPA found that two rivers and one creek were contaminated .
They homed in on a 14 - mile stretch of the Kanawha near the old site .
Starting in 2004 , Monsanto began testing fish , such as bass and catfish and other bottom feeders , in the river and sampling the water and the sediment of the riverbed .
Monsanto sent the results to the EPA last year .
Now the agency has to decide what to do .
It is not just that site .
There 's an old landfill of the type Woodall described , where Monsanto and other local businesses dumped waste , on Heizer Creek about a mile northeast of Poca , where he lives .
The company stopped using that particular site in 1960 , a year before Woodall started working .
The EPA investigated in the 1980s and found contamination .
Monsanto tried to clean it up .
In 1998 , the EPA came back , sampled again , and found more dioxin .
According to the EPA , the cleanup is ongoing .
Altogether , this town and the surrounding area have four active cleanup sites — three from Monsanto , the other from a company called Fike Chemical .
As hard as it is to clean up soil , at least there 's a chance .
With people , there 's no such possibility .
In 1991 , Woodall retired after 30 years of service , and Monsanto gave him a plaque with a photo of the site in a wooden frame .
After the herbicide job , he had worked at the site as an insulator and machinist .
The workers were a family .
About a year after he retired , Woodall developed colon cancer .
Maybe dioxin had something to do with it ; maybe it did n't .
But thousands of Nitro residents or former residents are part of a class action lawsuit that alleges the company polluted the town with dioxin .
Woodall , having worked at the plant and lived in Nitro , is a class member of the suit .
Another 161 lawsuits from residents claim dioxin has caused their cancers .
Monsanto says the cases lack merit .
" We will defend ourselves vigorously , " says spokesman Bob Pierce .
Elevated risk .
When Woodall started at the plant , it 's fair to say not much was known about dioxin 's long - term effects .
Yes , it burned the skin and smelled foul .
But the United States did n't formally start studying it until 1962 , and it was n't really until after the 1970s , after Vietnam and a major chemical accident near the town of Seveso , Italy , that data started to come out .
In the 1976 accident in Seveso , a plant released dioxin .
Since then , researchers have studied residents of the area and found elevated risks of certain cancers and spikes in infertility accompanying increased exposure to dioxin .
But there and elsewhere , controversy has dogged the science .
The EPA has worked for the better part of two decades to issue a comprehensive report on the health hazards posed by the chemical .
It has been delayed by squabbles between agencies and by concerns among some scientists that the risks were overstated .
Lisa Jackson , the EPA administrator , could kick the can down the road , but she said in an interview last year that tackling dioxin is one of her priorities .
Since then , the EPA has completed a draft of that long - delayed report ; it 's currently being peer - reviewed , and the agency hopes to release a final draft this year .
By itself , it wo n't prompt any new rules .
But it will give the clearest look yet at what dioxin does to the body .
" The real evolution in the science is that we have a deeper under­stand­ing not only that it is toxic but of how it gets into the body and how it accumulates in the body , " says Paul Anastas , head of the EPA 's Office of Research and Development .
Meanwhile , in January , the EPA proposed a rule that would greatly reduce the level of dioxin allowed in soil near homes .
As the EPA 's experience shows , it 's not easy to deal with chemicals after they 're released .
In Nitro , it 's even more complicated .
The fact that Nitro exists at all is because of chemicals .
The town was essentially built from scratch in 1918 to make ammunition for World War I .
The name Nitro comes from nitro­cellulose , a chemical .
The ­military designed the town to accommodate 18,000 workers .
After the war , some of the factories switched to producing rubber , and in the 1940s Monsanto bought a site to make agricultural chemicals .
For decades , the plant gave people jobs and salaries .
For workers like Woodall , it 's hard to hate something like that .
But the former workers are n't the only ones affected .
In Nitro , townspeople know not to eat fish from the local waters .
They 've received letters from health authorities warning them of the risks .
That 's something scientists have tracked for a while .
" For most people , more than 90 percent of the daily intake of dioxin and dioxinlike compounds comes from food , primarily meat , dairy products , and fish , " says Tom Sinks , deputy director of the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry .
Several years ago , a local law firm , the Calwell Practice , started conducting dioxin tests inside people 's homes .
Samples also were taken from public schools and a community center .
The firm says elevated levels of dioxin were found .
Several government agencies reviewed the results and concluded that the dioxin levels " do not pose a health problem . "
" What in the world could you do to clean up Nitro ? " asks Woodall , who let the lawyers test inside his home .
" You just have to let the judge and the lawyers and the company fight it out .
I have no idea what they 're trying to do . "
Dioxin is one of only a handful of chemicals the EPA has banned from industrial manufacturing , yet it is still produced as a byproduct in many plants .
And maybe its longevity is a warning .
An effort is underway in Congress to update the Toxic Substances Control Act , which governs human - created chemicals .
When it was passed in 1976 , it grandfathered in tens of thousands of chemicals , meaning none of them had to be approved for safety .
Now there 's a push to shift the burden to industry , to make manufacturers prove that chemicals are safe before they 're created on a big scale .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
| || ( Dagbladet ) : Det er ikke første gang at NSB svikter Anne Moe ( 28 ) .
19:07 skulle hun sette seg på toget til Gjøvik .
Men etter at all tog ble stoppet inntil videre på grunn av en kommunikasjonsfeil hos Jernbaneverket , ble det køståing i stedet .
- Jeg skal jo på påskeferie til familie og venner som alle andre , sier hun med ski og kofferten pakket klar til avreise .
- Skriv at jeg er skikkelig forbanna på NSB , legger hun til og ser alvorlig på Dagbladet .
Måtte stoppeLike etter klokken 1830 ble alle tog i Norge stanset .
Det melder NSB selv i en pressemelding .
Årsaken er en feil på radiosambandet mellom togene og togledersentralene .
Feilen ble utbedret klokken 21.15 .
Og et kvarter seinere var togene igang igjen .
- Passasjerene må vente seg store forsinkelser og uregelmessigheter i togtidene .
Vi beklager på det sterkeste .
Jeg har aldri opplevd at alle togene i hele Norge har stanset opp , sier Kjell Bakken , pressevakt i Jernbaneverket , til Dagbladet .
Nå vil Jernbarnevernet gå igjennom hva som kan ha skjedd .
- Vi vil gjøre en nøye gjennomgang .
En slik togstans er ikke akseptabel , sier Bakken .
Uten kommunikasjonssystemet som lå nede tidligere i kveld , er det farlig å kjøre tog , og ikke lov å kjøre tog , opplyser informasjonssjef Preben Colstrup til Dagbladet .
- Dette rammer alle som kjører med tog .
Det kan være alt fra 10 000 til 100 000 , sier Colstrup .
Feilen lokalisertGSM -R-systemet ble tatt i bruk for fem år siden etter en gradvis utbygging .
Systemet kom på plass etter Åsta- ulykken , og togene kan ikke kjøre uten at dette fungerer .
Rundt klokken 20 ble feilen lokalisert til en strømforsyning i serveren til operasjonssentralen i Trondheim .
UInder stansen prøvde NSB å sette inn alternativ transport , men kunne ikke garantere når samtlige tog i Norge kan erstattes med buss og drosje .
—
Det vil ta tid å få transporten på plass .
Kunder som kan benytte annen offentlig kommunikasjon , bes gjøre dette , skriver NSB på sine nettsider .
Enkelte tog som kjørte på linjer med lite trafikk , fikk kjøre videre til endestasjonen før feilen var utbedret .
Blant dem var Bergnsbanen .
Togene i Oslo - området måtte imidlertid vente helt til klokken 21.30 før de var i gang igjen .
Ikke første gang
Allerede på vei fra Skøyen til Oslo fikk Anne Moe en forsmak på togkaoset som ventet på Jernbanetorget .
- Det var problemer på strekningen fra Skøyen til Oslo .
Jeg ble nødt til å ta taxi .
Da jeg kom hit var det full stopp , sier hun .
Nå må hun ta taxi til Gjøvik .
For NSBs regning .
Men det er ikke første gang .
For det er ikke lenge siden Anne Moe selv la ut hele 3000 kroner for taxitur til Gjøvik .
Pengene fikk hun igjen av NSB .
- Tenk hva du kunne gjort av vedlikehold og utbedringer med de pengene NSB nå bruker på rekvisisjoner og erstatning for tapte reiser .
Jeg stiller meg jo noen spørsmål om ikke pengene kunne vært brukt på noe annet , sier hun .
Svarer for NSB
Litt lenger borte på Oslo S , ikke langt unna tidtavla , står en gruppe mennesker rundt Per-Christian Hanslien .
Han skulle egentlig vært på toget til Årnes og jobbet .
- Jeg vet ingen verdens ting , jeg står selv og venter på et tog , hører Dagbladet konduktøren si til flere sinte reisende .
- Jeg er på jobb , retter han Dagbladet i det ringen av fortvilte mennesker ikke lenger er så stor .
- Det er jo kjempeuheldig at dette skjer nå .
Men vær så snill og skriv positivt om NSB , da .
- Hvordan er det å stå å svare på spørsmål fra reisende nå etter en vinter med togkaos ?
- Det er litt ...
Det er helt greit .
Man gjør alt man kan gjøre , sier Hanslien .

ABOARD A U.S. MILITARY AIRCRAFT ( Reuters ) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates criticized the Internet group Wikileaks on Tuesday over its release of a video showing a 2007 U.S. helicopter attack that killed a dozen people in Baghdad , including two Reuters news staff .
This image captured from a classified U.S. military video footage shows a van being attacked by U.S. Apache helicopters that killed a dozen people in Baghdad , including two Reuters news staff on July 12 , 2007 and released to Reuters on April 5 , 2010 by WikiLeaks , a group that promotes leaking to fight government and corporate corruption .

The group , which says it promotes leaks to fight government and corporate corruption , released the video without providing any context explaining the situation , Gates said .
“ These people can put out anything they want , and they ’re never held accountable for it .
There ’s no before and there ’s no after , ” Gates said .
The stark helicopter gunsight video of the July 12 , 2007 , attack has been widely viewed around the world on the Internet since its release on April 5 .
Some international law and human rights experts say the Apache helicopter crew in the footage may have acted illegally .
The video includes an audio track of a helicopter crew conversation .
Many have been shocked by the images and some of the fliers ’ comments .
The U.S. military said an investigation shortly after the incident found U.S. forces were unaware of the presence of news staff and thought they were engaging armed insurgents , mistaking a camera for a rocket - propelled grenade launcher .
“ We take these things seriously , ” Gates said , in reference to civilian casualties .
The Reuters staff killed in the attack were photographer Namir Noor - Eldeen , 22 , and his assistant and driver Saeed Chamagh , 40 .
Wikileaks disputed Gates ’ contention the video failed to provide context .
In an e-mail , it accused the U.S. military of making “ numerous false or misleading statements , ” including the contention there was an active firefight between U.S. forces and those killed .
“ Classified records which we will shortly release show that there was a report of small arms fire at 9:50 a.m. , somewhere in the suburb of New Baghdad , shooter and location UNIDENTIFIED .
There is no reference to U.S. forces having been hit by the fire .
The same records report that at 10:18 , 28 minutes later , the crowd was seen and the killing commenced . ”
The e-mail was unsigned but was sent from the press office e-mail of Wikileaks .

Benefiting from hot air ( Image : Lehtikuva OY / Rex Features )
The hot gases passing through a vehicle ’s exhaust could be tapped to generate power , using “ cuffs ” made from a new carbon - nanotube - based material .
The “ thermocell ” produces electricity at a similar cost per watt as commercial solar cells .
All around us there are opportunities to soak up wasted heat and convert it into electricity , says Ray Baughman , who works on thermocells with colleagues at the University of Texas at Dallas .
Car exhaust pipes and power stations are just two forms of technology that waste a lot of heat and could be improved by building thermocells into their designs to recover lost energy .
However , to date the most effective thermocells have been based around expensive platinum electrodes , making them impractical .
Baughman and colleagues have now shown that cheaper carbon nanotubes can be used instead , because the nanotubes pack a huge surface area into a tiny volume , and electrons transfer quickly between the electrolyte and nanotube electrodes .
They have made thermocells three times as efficient as any before .

Energy flow
The basic design is simple .
Each thermocell contains two electrodes , positioned at either end of a temperature gradient : for example , one right next to a hot pipe and the other closer to the surrounding cooler air .
In between is a chemical mix , in which the heat encourages chemical reactions that push electrons around an external circuit .
Ions in the mix shed electrons at the hotter electrode and pick up electrons at the cooler one to complete the circuit .
One of the team ’s thermocell designs is intended to be wrapped around a hot pipe , inspired by the fact that heat leaks out from such structures in many situations , such as chemical factories and power plants .
“ You could harvest energy from the tailpipe of a car , ” adds Baughman .
The “ hot ” electrode wrapped around the pipe is surrounded by a heat - resistant layer , which is itself encased in a ‘ cold ’ electrode .
An aqueous solution can move through pores in the heat - resistant layer , allowing ions to circulate between the reactions at the two electrodes .
In tests , a prototype thermocell functioned well for 90 days .
With an electrode temperature difference of 60 °C it produced energy for $ 5.14 per watt based on materials costs for the prototype – comparable with that of mass - produced silicon solar cells .

Researchers have urged women to have a chlamydia test every time they have a new sexual partner , even if it was just a few months since their last test , because screening alone is unlikely to cut their chances of pelvic disease .
Experts from London hospitals set up a trial using 2,529 sexually active female students from 20 London universities and colleges with an average age of 21 , and samples were either tested straight away or stored and tested 12 months later .
Of the women tested straight away , those found to have chlamydia were treated and all results were then checked against the number of women developing pelvic inflammatory disease over the next 12 months .
A total of 68 ( 5.4 % ) of 1,254 women screened immediately were found to have chlamydia , and 75 ( 5.9 % ) out of the 1,265 screened a year later also had it .
Fifteen ( 1.3 % ) of the women screened immediately went on to develop pelvic inflammatory disease , compared with 23 ( 1.9 % ) of those tested the following year .
Writing online in the British Medical Journal , the researchers said : “ Although some evidence suggests that screening for chlamydia reduces rates of pelvic inflammatory disease , especially in women with chlamydial infection at baseline , the effectiveness of a single chlamydia test in preventing pelvic inflammatory disease over 12 months may have been overestimated . ”
Republican Meg Whitman spent $ 27 million on her campaign for governor in the first 11 weeks of the year , setting a record - shattering pace with a prime - time television ad blitz to introduce herself to voters and attack her GOP opponent , according to a disclosure statement she filed Monday .
Whitman , the billionaire ex-chief of EBay , has spent $ 46 million since joining the race early last year , seven times more than either of her main rivals .
Steve Poizner , the Republican state insurance commissioner , has been punished incessantly by Whitman ’s “ Ca n’t Trust Steve ” ads on shows such as “ American Idol , ” and lagged nearly 50 points behind her in last week ’s Field Poll .
“ Our campaign ’s budget is designed for victory , ” said Whitman spokesman Tucker Bounds .
“ And we ’re seeing positive results . ”
Poizner spent $ 3 million for the reporting period that ran from Jan. 1 to March 17 , but he has almost stopped raising money , collecting only $ 95,000 .
A former Silicon Valley entrepreneur who like Whitman has been pouring personal wealth into his campaign , Poizner began running television ads this month .
But he ’s had far fewer than Whitman and says he will wait until closer to the primary to unload a war chest of $ 14.9 million .
“ We ’ve focused much more on policy and grass - roots events , ” said Poizner spokesman Jarrod Agen .
“ Meg Whitman wants to make this election about money because she ’s wrong on the issues . ”
Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown , the likely Democratic nominee who has no serious primary challenger , has conserved his money .
He has spent only $ 142,000 this year for a small staff , consultants and office expenses , his filing shows .
In an appeal to donors on his campaign website , Brown said the “ spending binge to purchase California ’s airwaves is shocking .
. . .
I need your help .
The opposition has unlimited money to drown out those who disagree with them . ”
Brown reported having $ 14 million in the bank after raising slightly more than $ 2 million this year .
He raised $ 25,900 each , the maximum he can collect for the primary , from Los Angeles musician Herb Alpert , Alpert ’s wife , Lani , and the L.A. - based Bikram ’s Yoga College of India .
Brown is a yoga fan .
The attorney general , who was recently videotaped exhorting union leaders to “ attack ” on his behalf , also received $ 25,900 each from unions representing pipe fitters , carpenters , sheet metal workers and other trades .
Democratic independent expenditure groups formed to help Brown have been hard - pressed for money .
One sponsored by the Democratic Governors Assn. had received $ 200,000 .
A union - backed group , Level the Playing Field , raised $ 227,000 , but campaign manager Sean Clegg said it expected another $ 200,000 this week from the painters union to pay for a TV ad with a caricature of Whitman called the “ Meg - a - Tar . ”
In the race for state attorney general , former Facebook executive Chris Kelly has a fundraising edge in the Democratic primary .
He gave his campaign $ 4 million .
He ended the reporting period with $ 3.4 million .
San Francisco Dist .
Atty .
Kamala Harris brought in $ 413,900 this year and had a total of $ 1.3 million .
Another contender , former Los Angeles City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo , reported raising $ 124,500 this year and had $ 1.1 million .
Assemblyman Pedro Nava ( D- Santa Barbara ) reported raising $ 36,100 this year and had $ 43,900 in the bank .
Republican Steve Cooley , district attorney of Los Angeles County , reported raising $ 395,900 , with $ 297,200 still in the bank .
Sen . Tom Harman ( R - Huntington Beach ) had $ 239,900 in the bank .
The race to see who will be California ’s next lieutenant governor has generated a new frenzy of fundraising and , in one case , some deep campaign debt , candidates reported Monday .
Tapping into the power of the Internet has allowed San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom to build a competitive war chest for his campaign even though he announced his candidacy March 12 .
Thanks to contributions that poured in through the web - based fundraising site ActBlue , Newsom reported raising $ 267,200 with $ 255,500 left in the bank .
He raised more than twice as much this year as the other leading Democratic contender , Los Angeles City Councilwoman Janice Hahn , who brought in $ 105,400 .
Hahn reported $ 263,800 in her campaign account .
On the Republican side , Sen. Abel Maldonado ( R - Santa Maria ) reported raising $ 173,900 this year and having $ 73,400 in the bank .
But Maldonado has spent $ 615,000 this year , much of it on mailers , and had $ 514,400 in unpaid bills .
Sen . Sam Aanestad of Grass Valley reported raising $ 89,400 and having $ 28,300 on hand .

Los ministros de la Segunda Sala de la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación declararon infundado un último recurso que promovió el ex gobernador de Quintana Roo , Mario Villanueva , en contra de su extradición a Estados Unidos , país donde es requerido para ser juzgado por diversos delitos relacionados con el narcotráfico .
Desde el 25 de noviembre de 2009 , los ministros de la Primera Sala le negaron un amparo en contra de su extradición , en el que la defensa impugnó la Ley de Extradición Internacional .
En un hecho inusual , la defensa de Villanueva promovió un nuevo recurso de queja en los primeros días de enero del presente año , que fue desechado por el presidente de la Corte , Guillermo Ortiz Mayagoitia , sin siquiera darle entrada al mismo , por considerarlo improcedente .
Decisión inconforme Nuevamente , descontento con esta decisión , el ex gobernador promovió un recurso de reclamación en contra de la decisión del presidente de la Corte , el cual fue declarado infundado por los ministros de la Segunda Sala .
De acuerdo con el expediente del caso , la defensa de Villanueva pretendía que la Corte interpretara un artículo de la Constitución , el 23 , que no presentó ni defendió en el momento procesal oportuno , y que , carecía de toda validez , sobre todo dado que la sentencia mediante la cual se le negó el amparo para evitar su extradición a Estados Unidos ya es cosa juzgada .
EU solicitó la extradición de Villanueva para ser juzgado por operaciones de narcotráfico y lavado de dinero , ante las órdenes de aprehensión giradas en su contra por la Corte Federal del Distrito Sur de Nueva York .
A Villanueva Madrid se le acusa en EU de asociación delictuosa para importar y poseer cocaína con fines de distribución ; así como de sociedad criminal para dirigir transacciones financieras que implican ganancias por narcotráfico y soborno , con la intención de promover la realización de esa actividad .
Eco-terrorists ' plot to blow up IBM headquarters ' thwarted in routine traffic stop

Eco-terrorists allegedly plotting to blow up the IBM HQ in Zurich have been arrested
A routine traffic - stop in Switzerland has allegedly thwarted eco-terrorists from blowing up the site of the £ 55 million nano - technology HQ of IBM in Europe .
The three members – two men and a woman – of the Italian terrorist group Il Silvestre were stopped just a few miles from their target with their explosive device primed and ready to go .
Italians Costantino Ragusa and Silvia Guerini , together with Italian - Swiss Luca Bernasconi , were arrested and jailed after a search of their vehicle revealed the bomb .
Guerini and Constantino – the 33 - year - old leader of Il Silvestre - already have convictions for eco-terrorism offences and have served jail terms .
The group describes itself as anarchist and is opposed to all forms of micro-technology as well as nuclear power and weapons .
Swiss police said today that their car was halted on the night of April 15 at Langnau en-route to the technology centre at Rueschlikon , near Zurich .
The site is due to be opened next year and already has some of the most complex and advanced computer equipment in the world installed in it .
' A large quantity of explosives was found , ' said a police spokesman .
He said the amount of explosive would have caused far more devastation than the Ruetli explosions of 2007 .
The Ruetli meadow near Lake Lucerne was the scene of small bombs detonated near the homes of politicians in that year .
IBM spokeswoman Susan Orozco confirmed ' an incident ' but would not say more .
The Swiss Federal Prosecutor 's Office in Berne confirmed the arrest and said the investigation is ' ongoing ' .
The IBM facility that the Il Silvestre group was targeting is still under construction .
When finished , it will contain the most state - of - the - art facilities in Europe for nano - and - bio - technological research , with the probability of billions of pounds in profit for IBM .
Investigators are quizzing the suspects on whether the planned attack is part of a new co-ordinated wave of terror against such facilities on the continent .
Swiss media reported that the intended bombing was planned to coincide with a secret meeting of European anarchists on April 16 and 17 in the Swiss town of Winterthur .
Some newspapers speculated it was being planned to bring attention to the imprisonment of Il Silvestre member Marco Camenisch , currently in jail for the murder of a Swiss border guard .
Guerini and Constantino were in jail with him in 2006 and joined in a hunger strike .
Il Silvestre was spawned in the Tuscan countryside and is now considered to be one of the rising terror groups in Europe with a rigid cell structure , access to explosives and a membership that has no qualms about killing to achieve its goals .
It is considered as one of the successor groups to the lethal Red Brigades that scorched Italy in 70’s and 80’s .

" We are not a party to this lawsuit .
However , we stand behind our Android operating system and the partners who have helped us to develop it . "
We were wondering when Google would have something to say about Apple 's patent lawsuit against HTC , since the majority of the claims appear to implicate Android itself , and while the knives are n't out yet , we just got a short - but - sweet statement from a spokesperson :
We 're quite curious to see whether this means Google will contribute money and / or manpower to HTC 's legal defense -- we'd bet we 'll see some of Eric Schmidt 's crew at the table when this thing finally hits a courtroom .
In related news , HTC 's posted up a short , more formal version of the statement we received yesterday , saying that it " believes that consumer choice is a key component to success in the smartphone industry , " and that it does n't think the suit " poses a short - term material impact to its business . "
That makes sense , seeing as it'll be weeks before HTC even files a response to the suit , and months -- if not years -- before it 's resolved .
We 'll see how it goes .

According to several researchers , manta rays are often seen jumping out of the water , as high as 2 feet , and then returning to the sea .
Scientists are not sure why this jump takes place - it is just one of the many things yet to discover about the manta .

A smaller variety , called Mobula , jumps more frequently than any other kind of manta-ray .
In the summer of 2005 , Paul and Michael Albert documented these fantastic creatures at the sea of Cortez ( Baja California ) , one of the largest concentrations of Manta Rays in the world .
“ The Flying Mobulas of the Sea of Cortez ” , is the amazing article they wrote after their experience with hundreds of jumping rays .

In the last two years , some members of Congress have tried to limit the impact of the court decisions by introducing legislation known as the Clean Water Restoration Act .
It has been approved by a Senate committee but not yet introduced this session in the House .
The legislation tries to resolve these problems by , in part , removing the word “ navigable ” from the law and restoring regulators ’ authority over all waters that were regulated before the Supreme Court decisions .
But a broad coalition of industries has often successfully lobbied to prevent the full Congress from voting on such proposals by telling farmers and small - business owners that the new legislation would permit the government to regulate rain puddles and small ponds and layer new regulations on how they dispose of waste .
“ The game plan is to emphasize the scary possibilities , ” said one member of the Waters Advocacy Coalition , which has fought the legislation and is supported by the American Farm Bureau Federation , the National Association of Home Builders and other groups representing industries affected by the Clean Water Act .
“ If you can get Glenn Beck to say that government storm troopers are going to invade your property , farmers in the Midwest will light up their congressmen ’s switchboards , ” said the coalition member , who asked not to be identified because he thought his descriptions would anger other coalition participants .
Mr. Beck , a conservative commentator on Fox News , spoke at length against the Clean Water Restoration Act in December .
The American Land Rights Association , another organization opposed to legislation , wrote last June that people should “ Deluge your senators with calls , faxes and e-mails . ”
A news release the same month from the American Farm Bureau Federation warned that “ even rainwater would be regulated . ”
“ If you erase the word ‘ navigable ’ from the law , it erases any limitation on the federal government ’s reach , ” said Mr. Parrish of the American Farm Bureau Federation .
“ It could be a gutter , a roadside ditch or a rain puddle .
But under the new law , the government gets control over it . ”

Legislators say these statements are misleading and intended to create panic .
“ These claims just are n’t true , ” said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin , Democrat of Maryland .
He helped push the bill through the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee .
“ This bill , ” he said , “ is solely aimed at restoring the law to what it covered before the Supreme Court decisions . ”

Quick Tips
To clean a glass pipe , you 'll first need to gather your supplies .
Before you clean your glass pipe , decide if you want to harvest the black gold : resin .
Grab your glass pipe and force some sea salt into the crevices , then place the pipe in the plastic bag or container and submerge the pipe in rubbing alcohol .
Shake the bag violently while pretending to be electrocuted .
Use your cotton swabs and pipe cleaners to get any extra debris out of your piece .
Now rinse the bowl under hot water one last time .
I just love smoking dried tobacco leaves with my intricately designed glass pipe .
I ’ve been meaning to clean it lately , but after I relax with a good heaping glass pipe full of green , white , and purple tobacco ( with little red hairs ) , I always end up ransacking the fridge and grazing on cupboard fare – my good intentions lost as I chew and stare into space .
Eventually I knew I had to have a clean pipe , as the sides were caked with resin and it excited my gag reflex .
It made my habit feel dirty – like marijuana use .
I learned how to clean a glass pipe from a man with extremely long , unkempt hair , a faded tie - dye shirt , and ancient sandals .
He is our town ’s greatest tobacco enthusiast .
He showed me how to clean a pipe quickly , using only common household ingredients – the very same ingredients that go into expensive commercial products that are used to clean glass pipes .
There are many “ how to clean pipe ” pages on the Internet – but they are all written by degenerate hippies with clouded minds .
I , on the other hand , am a responsible young Republican , and if you follow the directions below , you will have a clean pipe .
Steps to Cleaning a Pipe
To clean a glass pipe , you ’ll first need to gather your supplies .
You ’ll need a bottle of isopropyl alcohol ( rubbing alcohol ) , sea salt , a plastic sandwich bag , pipe cleaners , rubber gloves ( only because it ’s gross ) , and cotton swabs .
You could replace the plastic bag with any plastic , ceramic , or metal container if you like .
You can get all this for around six dollars at any grocery store .
Commercial glass pipe cleaners can cost anywhere from twenty to sixty dollars .
In most cities , $ 60 can get you some top quality tobacco .
Before you clean your glass pipe , decide if you want to harvest the black gold : resin .
The resin from tobacco smoke , though somewhat disgusting , can be even more beautiful than smoking regular tobacco .
But of course not – you ’re a noble individual with pride and dignity .
Harvesting the resin is below you ( unless you ’re out of tobacco ) .
Let ’s just continue with our discussion on how to clean a glass pipe .
Grab your glass pipe and force some sea salt into the crevices , then place the pipe in the plastic bag or container and submerge the pipe in rubbing alcohol .
The rubbing alcohol will help dissolve the resin ’s hold on your glass pipe , while the sea salt adds friction and helps scour the inside of the pipe .
There are many ways to clean a glass pipe , but this one ’s efficacy becomes apparent quickly .
Shake the bag violently while pretending to be electrocuted .
I usually keep adding sea salt as it dissolves into the developing black murk .
You may have to rinse with hot water and repeat this step a few times to clean your glass pipe thoroughly .
To get more leverage , take the glass pipe out of the bag , cover all the holes , and shake it how you ’re not supposed to shake a baby .
If you do n’t need your pipe immediately ( papers , alternate glass pipe ) , you can save yourself some effort and just let it soak overnight .
Use your cotton swabs and pipe cleaners to get any extra debris out of your piece .
When I ’m done shaking and rinsing this disturbingly phallic glass pipe , I usually have to use a cotton swab to clear the mouth piece ( urethra ? ) .
Now rinse the bowl under hot water one last time .
You have now learned how to clean a glass pipe .
If the sight of your clean pipe gets your mouth watering for tobacco right away , get rid of the moisture with a blow dryer .
Use a lighter to harden and dry any resin that is left in the pipe .
Slide your cursor over the picture ( right ) and behold .
I have cleaned my glass pipe cheaply in less than 15 minutes .
The Future of Medical Marijuana and Marijuana Legalization
The past three presidents of the United States have all admitted to using marijuana recreationally in their formative years , and they probably lied about the extent of their use .
Had they been pulled over while cruising to Taco John ’s or wherever with their marijuana , their futures ( and ours ) could have been vastly different .
But they did n’t get caught .
They became presidents who were satisfied with the current draconian marijuana laws that rob ordinary people of their futures and besmirch their reputations .
What is permissible for Bush , Obama , and Clinton should be OK for common citizens .
Currently , there are fifteen states that support medical marijuana and plenty others are pushing legislation through .
This is a natural stepping stone to legalization , but getting these bills passed should n’t be looked at as a means to an end ; it is an urgent cause in its own right .
A friend of mine has Multiple Sclerosis – a disease that could be a much lighter burden if she could just get high now and then .
Marijuana , for reasons still unknown , does n’t just mask the pain , it actually treats the painful lesions associated with MS .
Whether you enjoy a clean glass pipe full of “ tobacco ” or not , now is the time to make noise .
Write to your local and state representatives .
Do n’t allow our politicians to waste your tax dollars .
Do n’t allow them to keep marijuana away from cancer and AIDS patients .
Politicians care about one thing only : getting elected .
They are worried that if they support legalization in any form , they will lose the powerful backing of law enforcement and those that profit from incarceration .
We need to show them that if they do n’t do the right thing , they will lose the popular vote .
Alternative Ways to Clean Glass Pipes
Efferdent .
It ’s not just for your grandmother ’s glass pipe ( or dentures ) anymore !
You can clean your glass pipe by soaking it in Efferdent overnight .
The sludge will slide off your glass pipe in much the same fashion it does false teeth .
You can order Efferdent from Amazon if you ’re …incapacitated .
Boiling water .
When I first learned how to clean a glass pipe , this was the method I used .
Sure , it works , but it is messy , stinky ( even with the oven vent on high ) and it leaves a thin sticky residue on the pot and on your glass pipe that comes off only with labored rinsing and dark threats .
Commercial Cleaners .
Generally , these glass pipe cleaners will work just as well and sometimes better than my aforementioned method ; however , you do n’t want this bottle just sitting around anywhere , lest your puritanical relations condemn you to hell forever .
Reasoned Argument .
You ’re wondering how to clean a pipe without supplies ?
Try using logic and advanced persuasion on the pipe .
This is how Obama used to clean his glass pipe – resin sludge is no match for his nuanced arguments and devastating charisma .
President Obama criticized a controversial new immigration bill in Arizona on Friday , calling it " misguided . "
" Our failure to act responsible at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others .
That includes , for example , the recent efforts in Arizona which threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans , as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe , " the president said at a naturalization ceremony for members of the military .
" In fact , I 've instructed members of my administration to closely monitor the situation and examine the civil rights and other implications of this legislation .
But if we continue to fail to act at the federal level , we will continue to see misguided efforts opening up around the country . "
He added , " As a nation , as a people , we can choose a different future - a future that keeps faith with our history , with our heritage , and with the hope that America has always inspired in the hearts of people all over the world . "

The fight over divestment is coming to a head in Berkeley .
The student Senate is expected to vote on Wednesday to possibly override the Student President ’s veto of the divestment bill .
As can be expected both sides have been rallying their supporters .
Following notable endorsements from Desmond Tutu , Noam Chomsky and Naomi Klein , an ad appeared in the Daily Californian today with signatures from over 260 Jewish supporters of the divestment action .
Below after the jump is a handy resource put together by Jewish Voice for Peace outlining all the support the bill has received , including from Benjamin Netanyahu ’s own sister - in - law .
Perhaps most impressive so far is this speech which Professor Judith Butler will give to students tomorrow in support of the bill .
The speech entitled " You Will Not Be Alone " has been published on the Nation ’s website , and we repost here in full :
Let us begin with the assumption that it is very hard to hear the debate under consideration here .
One hears someone saying something , and one fears that they are saying another thing .
It is hard to trust words , or indeed to know what words actually mean .
So that is a sign that there is a certain fear in the room , and also , a certain suspicion about the intentions that speakers have and a fear about the implications of both words and deeds .
Of course , tonight you do not need a lecture on rhetoric from me , but perhaps , if you have a moment , it might be possible to pause and to consider reflectively what is actually at stake in this vote , and what is not .
Let me introduce myself first as a Jewish faculty member here at Berkeley , on the advisory board of Jewish Voice for Peace , on the US executive committee of Faculty for Israeli - Palestinian Peace , a global organization , a member of the Russell Tribunal on Human Rights in Palestine , and a board member of the Freedom Theatre in Jenin .
I am at work on a book which considers Jewish criticisms of state violence , Jewish views of co-habitation , and the importance of ‘ remembrance ’ in both Jewish and Palestinian philosophic and poetic traditions .
The first thing I want to say is that there is hardly a Jewish dinner table left in this country–or indeed in Europe and much of Israel–in which there is not enormous disagreement about the status of the occupation , Israeli military aggression and the future of Zionism , binationalism and citizenship in the lands called Israel and Palestine .
There is no one Jewish voice , and in recent years , there are increasing differences among us , as is evident by the multiplication of Jewish groups that oppose the occupation and which actively criticize and oppose Israeli military policy and aggression .
In the US and Israel alone these groups include : Jewish Voice for Peace , American Jews for a Just Peace , Jews Against the Occupation , Boycott from Within , New Profile , Anarchists Against the Wall , Women in Black , Who Profits ? , Btselem , Zochrot , Black Laundry , Jews for a Free Palestine ( Bay Area ) , No Time to Celebrate and more .
The emergence of J Street was an important effort to establish an alternative voice to AIPAC , and though J street has opposed the bill you have before you , the younger generation of that very organization has actively contested the politics of its leadership .
So even there you have splits , division and disagreement .
So if someone says that it offends " the Jews " to oppose the occupation , then you have to consider how many Jews are already against the occupation , and whether you want to be with them or against them .
If someone says that " Jews " have one voice on this matter , you might consider whether there is something wrong with imagining Jews as a single force , with one view , undivided .
It is not true .
The sponsors of Monday evening ’s round table at Hillel made sure not to include voices with which they disagree .
And even now , as demonstrations in Israel increase in number and volume against the illegal seizure of Palestinian lands , we see a burgeoning coalition of those who seek to oppose unjust military rule , the illegal confiscation of lands , and who hold to the norms of international law even when nations refuse to honor those norms .
What I learned as a Jewish kid in my synagogue –which was no bastion of radicalism –was that it was imperative to speak out against social injustice .
I was told to have the courage to speak out , and to speak strongly , even when people accuse you of breaking with the common understanding , even when they threaten to censor you or punish you .
The worst injustice , I learned , was to remain silent in the face of criminal injustice .
And this tradition of Jewish social ethics was crucial to the fights against Nazism , fascism and every form of discrimination , and it became especially important in the fight to establish the rights of refugees after the Second World War .
Of course , there are no strict analogies between the Second World War and the contemporary situation , and there are no strict analogies between South Africa and Israel , but there are general frameworks for thinking about co-habitation , the right to live free of external military aggression , the rights of refugees , and these form the basis of many international laws that Jews and non-Jews have sought to embrace in order to live in a more just world , one that is more just not just for one nation or for another , but for all populations , regardless of nationality and citizenship .
If some of us hope that Israel will comply with international law , it is precisely so that one people can live among other peoples in peace and in freedom .
It does not de-legitimate Israel to ask for its compliance with international law .
Indeed , compliance with international law is the best way to gain legitimacy , respect and an enduring place among the peoples of the world .
Of course , we could argue on what political forms Israel and Palestine must take in order for international law to be honored .
But that is not the question that is before you this evening .
We have lots of time to consider that question , and I invite you to join me to do that in a clear - minded way in the future .
But consider this closely : the bill you have before you does not ask that you take a view on Israel .
I know that it certainly seems like it does , since the discussion has been all about that .
But it actually makes two points that are crucial to consider .
The first is simply this : there are two companies that not only are invested in the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands and peoples , but who profit from that occupation , and which are sustained in part by funds invested by the University of California .
They are General Electric and United Technologies .
They produce aircraft designed to bomb and kill , and they have bombed and killed civilians , as has been amply demonstrated by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch .
You are being asked to divest funds from these two companies .
You are NOT being asked to divest funds from every company that does business with Israel .
And you are not being asked to resolve to divest funds from Israeli business or citizens on the basis of their citizenship or national belonging .
You are being asked only to call for a divestment from specific companies that make military weapons that kill civilians .
That is the bottom line .
If the newspapers or others seek to make inflammatory remarks and to say that this is an attack on Israel , or an attack on Jews , or an upsurge of anti-Semitism , or an act that displays insensitivity toward the feelings of some of our students , then there is really only one answer that you can provide , as I see it .
Do we let ourselves be intimidated into not standing up for what is right ?
It is simply unethical for UC to invest in such companies when they profit from the killing of civilians under conditions of a sustained military occupation that is manifestly illegal according to international law .
The killing of civilians is a war crime .
By voting yes , you say that you do not want the funds of this university to be invested in war crimes , and that you hold to this principle regardless of who commits the war crime or against whom it is committed .
Of course , you should clearly ask whether you would apply the same standards to any other occupation or destructive military situation where war crimes occur .
And I note that the bill before you is committed to developing a policy that would divest from all companies engaged in war crimes .
In this way , it contains within it both a universal claim and a universalizing trajectory .
It recommends explicitly " additional divestment policies to keep university investments out of companies aiding war crimes throughout the world , such as those taking place in Morocco , the Congo , and other places as determined by the resolutions of the United Nations and other leading human rights organizations . "
Israel is not singled out .
It is , if anything , the occupation that is singled out , and there are many Israelis who would tell you that Israel must be separated from its illegal occupation .
This is clearly why the divestment call is selective : it does not call for divestment from any and every Israeli company ; on the contrary , it calls for divestment from two corporations where the links to war crimes are well - documented .
Let this then be a precedent for a more robust policy of ethical investment that would be applied to any company in which UC invests .
This is the beginning of a sequence , one that both sides to this dispute clearly want .
Israel is not to be singled out as a nation to be boycotted –and let us note that Israel itself is not boycotted by this resolution .
But neither is Israel ’s occupation to be held exempt from international standards .
If you want to say that the historical understanding of Israel ’s genesis gives it an exceptional standing in the world , then you disagree with those early Zionist thinkers , Martin Buber and Judah Magnes among them , who thought that Israel must not only live in equality with other nations , but must also exemplify principles of equality and social justice in its actions and policies .
There is nothing about the history of Israel or of the Jewish people that sanctions war crimes or asks us to suspend our judgment about war crimes in this instance .
We can argue about the occupation at length , but I am not sure we can ever find a justification on the basis of international law for the deprivation of millions of people of their right to self - determination and their lack of protection against police and military harassment and destructiveness .
But again , we can have that discussion , and we do not have to conclude it here in order to understand the specific choice that we face .
You do n’t have to give a final view on the occupation in order to agree that investing in companies that commit war crimes is absolutely wrong , and that in saying this , you join Jews , Muslims , Hindus , Christians and so many other peoples from diverse religious and secular traditions who believe that international governance , justice and peace demand compliance with international law and human rights and the opposition to war crimes .
You say that you do not want our money going into bombs and helicopters and military materiel that destroys civilian life .
You do not want it in this context , and you do not want it in any context .
Part of me wants to joke–where would international human rights be without the Jews !
We helped to make those rights , at Nuremberg and again in Jerusalem , so what does it mean that there are those who tell you that it is insensitive to Jewishness to come out in favor of international law and human rights ?
It is a lie–and what a monstrous view of what it means to be Jewish .
It disgraces the profound traditions of social justice that have emerged from the struggle against fascism and the struggles against racism ; it effaces the tradition of ta-ayush , living together , the ethical relation to the non-Jew which is the substance of Jewish ethics , and it effaces the value that is given to life no matter the religion or race of those who live .
You do not need to establish that the struggle against this occupation is the same as the historical struggle against apartheid to know that each struggle has its dignity and its absolute value , and that oppression in its myriad forms do not have to be absolutely identical to be equally wrong .
For the record , the occupation and apartheid constitute two different versions of settler colonialism , but we do not need a full understanding of this convergence and divergence to settle the question before us today .
Nothing in the bill before you depends on the seamless character of that analogy .
In voting for this resolution , you stand with progressive Jews everywhere and with broad principles of social justice , which means , that you stand with those who wish to stand not just with their own kind but with all of humanity , and who do this , in part , both because of the religious and non-religious values they follow .
Lastly , let me say this .
You may feel fear in voting for this resolution .
I was frightened coming here this evening .
You may fear that you will seem anti-Semitic , that you cannot handle the appearance of being insensitive to Israel ’s needs for self - defense , insensitive to the history of Jewish suffering .
Perhaps it is best to remember the words of Primo Levi who survived a brutal internment at Auschwitz when he had the courage to oppose the Israeli bombings of southern Lebanon in the early 1980s .
He openly criticized Menachem Begin , who directed the bombing of civilian centers , and he received letters asking him whether he cared at all about the spilling of Jewish blood .
He wrote :
I reply that the blood spilled pains me just as much as the blood spilled by all other human beings .
But there are still harrowing letters .
And I am tormented by them , because I know that Israel was founded by people like me , only less fortunate than me .
Men with a number from Auschwitz tattooed on their arms , with no home nor homeland , escaping from the horrors of the Second World War who found in Israel a home and a homeland .
I know all this .
But I also know that this is Begin ’s favourite defence .
And I deny any validity to this defence .
As the Israeli historian Idith Zertal makes clear , do not use this most atrocious historical suffering to legitimate military destructiveness–it is a cruel and twisted use of the history of suffering to defend the affliction of suffering on others .
To struggle against fear in the name of social justice is part of a long and venerable Jewish tradition ; it is non-nationalist , that is true , and it is committed not just to my freedom , but to all of our freedoms .
So let us remember that there is no one Jew , not even one Israel , and that those who say that there are seek to intimidate or contain your powers of criticism .
By voting for this resolution , you are entering a debate that is already underway , that is crucial for the materialization of justice , one which involves having the courage to speak out against injustice , something I learned as a young person , but something we each have to learn time and again .
I understand that it is not easy to speak out in this way .
But if you struggle against voicelessness to speak out for what is right , then you are in the middle of that struggle against oppression and for freedom , a struggle that knows that there is no freedom for one until there is freedom for all .
There are those who will surely accuse you of hatred , but perhaps those accusations are the enactment of hatred .
The point is not to enter that cycle of threat and fear and hatred –that is the hellish cycle of war itself .
The point is to leave the discourse of war and to affirm what is right .
You will not be alone .
You will be speaking in unison with others , and you will , actually , be making a step toward the realization of peace –the principles of non-violence and co-habitation that alone can serve as the foundation of peace .
You will have the support of a growing and dynamic movement , inter- generational and global , by speaking against the military destruction of innocent lives and against the corporate profit that depends on that destruction .
You will stand with us , and we will most surely stand with you .
“ I like big bucks and I cannot lie , ” they sang .
“ You mortgage brothers ca n’t deny .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
We ’re not making it up .
According to documents released as part of a Congressional investigation , bankers from the failed Washington Mutual rewrote the lyrics to 1992 ’s “ Baby Got Back ” to celebrate their dominance of the mortgage lending market .

An apparent exhibit of misplaced hubris , Washington Mutual would later become the largest failed savings bank in US history , in part due to their exuberance in extending risky loans .
The bankers also staged a mock funeral for another big subprime mortgage lender — Countrywide Financial — which would also need a huge infusion of cash and was picked up by banking behemoth Bank of America in the wake of the 2008 crash .
Bankers sang about “ big bucks ” at their 2006 Kauai , Hawaii retreat .
As if the lyrics themselves were n’t enough , the bankers ’ chorus was apparently accompanied by cheerleaders who moved in time to the music , and wads and wads of flying fake cash .
Politico notes more of the Wamu anthem ’s words , as detailed in the documents :
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ That when the dough rolls in like you ’re printinÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ your own cash /
And you gotta make a splash /
You just spends /
Like it never ends /
Cuz you gotta have that big new Benz /
All of that bling you ’re wearin ’ /
Shining so bright peoples starin ’ /
It ’s crazy , I gotta ski Aspen / That ’s all I ’m askin ’ Ã¢â‚¬Â 

It did n’t turn out that way .
On Sept. 26 , 2008 , the Wall Street Journal crowed , “ In what is by far the largest bank failure in U.S. history , federal regulators seized Washington Mutual Inc. and struck a deal to sell the bulk of its operations to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . ”
Still , Washington Mutual ’s former chief executive ( above right ) made off with a bundle : Kerry Killinger took in a whopping $ 100 million between 2003 and 2008 .

Human overpopulation drives the environmental crisis
Rewind forty years and a few days to the very first Earth Day in 1970 .
One topic was on everybody ’s mind : the growing human population .
Scientists and environmentalists , eyeing exponentially increasing numbers , made dire predictions about mass famine and warfare as humanity outstripped the planet ’s ability to provide space and resources .
At the time , the human population numbered 3.6 billion .
Today , though nearly twice that number walk our Earth , discussion of the “ population problem ” has fallen by the wayside .
Instead , we talk about renewable energy , electric cars , and reusable shopping bags — politically much safer than the hot buttons of family planning and birth rates .
And , since thus far we ’ve eluded a major population crash , we ’ve allowed that doomsday fear to slip off our collective radar as though our ignorance will make overpopulation disappear .
There ’s only one problem with this logic of avoidance : Overpopulation is the problem .
Every environmental issue humanity faces is exacerbated by our numbers .
Nearly seven billion people must find food , water , and shelter every day .
To varying degrees , we each consume fossil fuels and emit carbon dioxide .
And we each have a reproductive drive — which is why our numbers are expected to swell to nine billion by 2050 ( another 40 years from that first Earth Day ) .
If you ’re like me , you believe that current levels of global inequality are ethically wrong — why does he drive a Hummer in Boston while she hauls water up a Kenyan hillside three times a day ? — but you also are n’t too keen on giving up the trappings of your resource - intensive lifestyle .
Hey , I need my laptop powered up all day , and it ’s hard to pass up those California - grown strawberries at the grocery store .
But in the long term , our planet can only support about 1.5 to 2 billion people — roughly a quarter of our current population , or a fifth of where we ’re going — living at our consumption levels .
Look around you .
Think of your family .
Imagine three out of every four people , gone .
No wonder we ’d rather fret over deforestation and wind farms .
Thinking of how far we ’ve overshot carrying capacity ( the number of people the planet can support in perpetuity ) is scary .
Thinking of how far we will yet go before that 2050 population peak ?
Even scarier .
But the good news is , it ’s a lot less scary than what our parents heard a few decades ago .
Industrializing countries go through a demographic transition as per capita wealth increases .
Infant mortality drops with better health care , and parents have fewer children , shrinking family size and arresting population growth .
Most of Europe and the United States took about a century to pass through the transition in the 1800s .
Today , the switch to “ replacement rate ” reproductive levels ( about 2.1 births per woman ) seems to be happening faster ( on the order of twenty years ) in developing countries .
In some places , though , women still have five or six children in their lifetimes .
Western medicine , often freely given to save innocent children born into unthinkable circumstances , saves more lives , but also leads to a population boom while social mores ( the number of children families choose to have , for example ) struggle to keep up .
I ’m not arguing that Bill Gates stop looking for a malaria cure , or that we halt food donations — only that we must consider the demographic consequences of our actions .
Educating women should be part of every aid effort .
( Women who finish school are more likely to hold jobs and earn wages that make additional pregnancies and the attendant time out of the breadwinning workforce less attractive . )
And we should strive to make birth control accessible to everyone .
Yes , there are some religious qualms about this , but the arguably higher moral calling is the preservation of existing human life .
That means considering the long - term wellbeing of all humanity , not agonizing over the possibilities of children not yet conceived .
Measures like educating women and providing access to family planning are all about empowering people with choice .
We ’ve seen , time and again , these simple actions halting population growth .
And , if we can get those last few conservative bastions to stop trying to outbreed one another and instead take a global perspective ( yes , I know that ’s asking a lot ) then we will be able to halt population growth .
Coming back down again is a much different matter .
We ’ve seen through China ’s example ( the infamous one - child policy that ’s produced a glut of restless , unwed young men ) that top - down legislation does n’t work .
But neither does staying the course , particularly in a society that emphasizes the importance of growth and relies on an increasing supply of workers to sustain it ( and the elderly , who , with more medical advances , are leading longer , healthier lives ) .
We must transition the frenetic pace of our society into longer - term acceptance of the status quo .
Perhaps we do need to turn more towards “ values ” — experiences , time with friends and family — than fortunes .
Only after a change of viewpoint can we accept a diminishment in our overexploitation of Earth ’s resources .
For surely those resources are overexploited .
While I ’m not going to wax Malthusian with predictions of imminent catastrophe , the warning signs are all there .
Our climate is being driven dangerously far from the norm we evolved under .
Fossil fuel resources are running out .
The human population is farther above carrying capacity than ever before .
The potential for human tragedy is greater than ever .
Here at MIT , we ’re trained to believe in ourselves and our technology to win the day .
Certainly , in the past , innovation has saved us .
The Industrial Revolution amped up productivity and the Green Revolution doubled our food supply ( both relying heavily on fossil fuels ) .
Yet rather than exercising restraint and adapting to new limitations , we have used these advances as a springboard to create more demand .
On the shaky foundation of nonrenewable resources , we ’ve built an edifice of humanity nearly seven billion strong .
Even if there were an easy way down , it would be impossible for our present society to see it .
We ’ve buried our heads in the sand — looking for more oil , perhaps ? — and attempted to ignore the root problem by pointing fingers at the details .
But today , the population trajectory does seem to be leveling off , and a peak is in sight .
Let ’s put the population problem back on our agenda , and honor our faith in innovation by letting the great minds think out loud .

Mumbai , officially named Bombay until 1995﻿﻿ , is the financial capital of India and the home of India 's Bollywood film industry .
Also called India 's " Maximum City , " Mumbai is known for its extreme standards of living , fast - paced lifestyle , and the making ( or breaking ) of dreams .
It 's a cosmopolitan and increasingly westernized city that 's an important base for industry and foreign trade .
Mumbai's interesting history saw it controlled by the Portuguese for 125 years until , incredibly , it was given to the British as part of a wedding dowry .
Catherine Braganza ( the Princess of Portugal ) married Charles II ( the King of England ) in 1662 , and the city was included as a dowry gift .
At the time , it was group of seven islands .
The British firstly developed Mumbai as a port , before embarking on extensive urban construction works in the early 1800s .
After India obtained Independence in 1947 and the British departed , a population boom followed , brought about by the lure of wealth and opportunities unavailable elsewhere in the country .

Read more about daily life in Mumbai .
Despite its overcrowding and other problems , Mumbai remains one of the safest cities in India , especially for women .
Normal standards of care should , however , be taken , especially after dark .
Mumbai traffic , on the other hand , is horrendous .
Roads are extremely congested , horns continually blare , and people overtake from both sides at whim .
You should be particularly careful when crossing the road , and do n't attempt to drive yourself .
Avoid traveling on the local trains during rush hours , as there have been instances of people getting crushed or falling out of trains .
Be careful of pickpockets in tourist areas , such as the Colaba Causeway market .
Begging is also a problem in tourist areas and at traffic lights .
As always in India , it 's important not to drink the water in Mumbai .
Instead , buy readily available and inexpensive bottled water to keep healthy .

Pregnant women , drunk people and " those who are sleep deprived " should not watch 3 - D television because of potential health issues , electronics manufacturer Samsung says on its Web site .
The company also says people at risk for stroke or epileptic seizures should consult a medical professional before watching TV in three dimensions .
Samsung and Panasonic began selling the first 3 - D TVs in the U.S. last month .
The warnings come as other TV manufacturers are set to debut 3 - D home entertainment systems this year .
When watching 3 - D TV , users wear special glasses with lenses that open and close rapidly to produce an image that appears to leap off of the screen .
Some of Samsung 's warnings apply to everyone :
" Viewing 3D television may also cause motion sickness , perceptual after effects , disorientation , eye strain and decreased postural stability , " the Web site message says .
" It is recommended that users take frequent breaks to lessen the potential of these effects .
If your eyes show signs of fatigue or dryness or if you have any of the above symptoms , immediately discontinue use of this device and do not resume using it for at least thirty minutes after the symptoms have subsided . "
The TV maker also says wearing its 3 - D glasses in normal situations , when you 're not watching 3 - D TV , " may be physically harmful to you and may weaken your eyesight . "
The warning suggests that some 3 - D TV viewers could become so disoriented that they could fall and hurt themselves :
" Viewing in 3 - D may cause disorientation for some viewers , " the warning says .
" Accordingly , DO NOT place your TV television near open stairwells , cables , balconies , or other objects that can be tripped over , run into , knocked down , broken or fallen over . "

Is This Treadmill Girl On Drugs ?
( Video )
I ’m not exactly sure what is worse .
The strange treadmill dance being performed by this female , or the fact that she is performing the dance to the late - 90s hit “ Barbie Girl ” by Aqua .
I feel bad for the two individuals beside her .
How do you even concentrate when someone right next to you is hopping , twisting and twirling around like a crazed crackhead ?
I think it is fair to say that the only thing which would have made this clip even more entertaining was if it had ended like any of these painful treadmill experiences .

High achievers do many things well , particularly when they ’re convinced that excellence requires their utmost performance .
Low achievers , however , have a hard time getting motivated and often find themselves coughing in the dust of the high achievers ’ hustle .
But like so many generalizations , this one has a limit .
A new study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology uncovered a variable that knocks this scenario on its head , and it has everything to do with what makes low achievers tick .
Researchers conducted multiple studies to evaluate how participants ’ attitudes toward achievement influenced their performance .
In one study , participants were “ primed ” with high - achievement words ( related to winning , excellence , etc. ) flashed on a computer screen .
Each word appeared only for an instant , too fast for conscious deliberation .
Participants with high - achievement motivation performed significantly better on tasks after being primed with the words than those with low - achievement motivation .
In another study , participants completing a verbal proficiency task ( word - search puzzles ) were interrupted , and then given a choice to either resume the task or switch to a task they perceived as more enjoyable .
Those with high - achievement motivation were significantly more likely to return to the verbal task than the low achievers .
The results of those studies are predictable and buttress what we generally know about high and low achievers .
But the final study was different .
Participants were primed with high - achievement words ( e.g. excel , compete , win ) and then asked to complete a word - search puzzle .
But instead of describing the task as a serious test of verbal proficiency , the researchers called it “ fun . ”
The results : participants with high - achievement motivation did significantly worse on the task than low achievers .
The study authors believe that when high achievers are primed to achieve excellence , the idea that a task is “ fun ” undercuts their desire to excel .
If something is enjoyable and fun , how could it possibly be a credible gauge of achievement ?
Conversely , low achievers who are similarly primed with achievement words perceive a “ fun ” task as worthwhile .
Not only is their motivation to perform improved , so is their ability .
This intriguing twist says much about why one - size - fits - all educational strategies so often fail .
For students motivated to achieve excellence , making tasks entertaining may actually undermine their performance .
Likewise , for those not normally motivated to achieve , describing a task as urgent and serious yields the predictable result .
It also sheds light on the “ lazy genius ” phenomenon .
Everyone has known someone who is remarkably intelligent but gets mediocre grades and does n’t seem to care .
Clearly , low - achievers are not necessarily less intelligent or less capable than high - achievers ; instead , they just do n’t respond well to status quo motivational cues .
A jolt of enjoyment could turn that around .

RUNAWAY population growth will end the dream for many young Australians of ever owning their own home , says federal Labor backbencher Kelvin Thomson .
Mr Thomson has defied his party by saying Australia ’s population should be capped at 26 million , disagreeing with his Government ’s projection of 36 million by 2050 .
Representing the inner Melbourne electorate of Wills , which is made up of 30 per cent immigrants , Mr Thomson believes Australia ’s annual intake of migrants should be cut to 70,000 .
Under the Rudd Government , migration has jumped to around 300,000 a year compared to 126,000 under the Howard Government .
Mr Thomson said tackling population growth was necessary to stop the dreams of owning your own from fading away .
“ Rising house prices and rising interest rates are leading to falling housing affordability and make it impossible for young Australians to own a home of their own , ” he said .
He said the appointment of Tony Bourke as Minister for Population was a step in the right direction .
“ I believe Australia needs to have a population policy … but we still have quite a distance to go , ” he said .
“ We need to take steps to stabilise our population . ”
He said the Rudd Government should abolish the baby bonus , which costs around $ 1.4 billion annually , and put that money to educating and training young Australians and equipping them with skills .
“ The Government has not been supporting university places , apprenticeships and TAFEs in the way it needs to for over a decade now , ” he said .
“ We ’ve had these things flatlining and we need to put greater investment into these areas . ”
In an address to federal Parliament last August , Mr Thomson outlined a 14 - point plan for population reform which called for an end to the open door policy which allows New Zealanders to move here .
In the speech he said the open - ended uncapped program made it impossible for Australia or New Zealand to implement a population policy .
He also called for a cut in the skilled migration program , sending overseas students home for two years for a cooling - off period before being eligible for permanent residence and increasing Australia ’s foreign aid .

I recall once reading a paper in which the author adduced as evidence of the vibrant state of Nietzsche studies the fact that there are now three specialist journals for Nietzsche articles -- Nietzsche - Studien , Journal of Nietzsche Studies , and New Nietzsche Studies -- not to mention three English - speaking professional organizations : the North American Nietzsche Society ( NANS ) , the Friedrich Nietzsche Society of Great Britain ( FNS ) , and the Nietzsche Society , another American - based Nietzsche group , aligned with the Society for Phenomenology & Existential Philosophy .
My reaction to this evidence , by contrast , was the opposite : the reason there is a proliferation of specialty Nietzsche forums is because the field is populated with mediocrities and incompetents , who can't perform in ordinary scholarly and philosophical contexts .
Because the majority of those who write on Nietzsche do n't do work that is publishable in legitimate journals that feature important work on Nietzsche -- European Journal of Philosophy , Philosophy & Phenomenological Research , Journal of the History of Philosophy , History of Philosophy Quarterly , Journal of the History of Ideas ( not to mention Philosophical Review and Ethics ! ) -- it is necessary to create " specialty " journals that have almost no scholarly or philosophical standards in which the vast amount of rubbish on Nietzsche can find a place .
The field of Kant studies , a robust scholarly field , provides a striking point of contrast : most of the leading Kant scholars publish in the journals just mentioned , and the up - and - coming young scholars try to do the same .
One does not find in Kant studies a proliferation of " specialized "
Kant journals that publish nothing but ( third - rate ) work on Kant .
There is , to be sure , one specialty journal , Kant - Studien , about which I know little , though I hope it is better than Nietzsche - Studien , which apart from publishing occasional , useful philological and intellectual history pieces , rarely features anything philosophically substantial .
( One philosopher who submitted to them tells me his piece was rebuffed because it featured that " Anglo - Saxon " tendency to focus on " coherence " and " arguments . "
Imagine that ! )
Harsh talk , I know , but readers of this blog are used to it .
I am particularly incensed by what 's become of the North American Nietzsche Society ( NANS ) under the direction of Richard Schacht of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
Schacht 's 1983 book on Nietzsche ( Routledge ) did much to raise the level of Nietzsche studies in English - speaking philosophy -- kudos and gratitude to Professor Schacht for that important contribution -- but as the de facto dictator of NANS , he has , for mysterious reasons , pandered to mediocrities , putting them on committees , including their papers in NANS programs , and so on .
Since I know that Schacht 's view of this work is not much different from my own , I have found his posture peculiar : instead of using NANS to advance philosophically substantial Nietzsche studies , he has , in the service of " inclusiveness , " legitimized weak work and promoted the careers of scholars who do not do work up to the high standards he has set .
What 's worse is that the effort has been pointless .
During the 1990s , New Nietzsche Studies was launched by " the Nietzsche Society , " the other group for American Nietzsche " scholars " [ sic ] affiliated with SPEP , the primary organization for those interested in European philosophy who are n't very good at philosophy .
( Anyone with doubts on this score should take a look at , e.g. , Babette Babich 's Nietzsche 's Philosophy of Science , a book apparently written on the premise that it is not necessary to have any knowledge of philosophy of science to nonetheless explain Nietzsche's .
Babich is a key figure in the Nietzsche Society and its journal New Nietzsche Studies ; she was also the target of Samuel Wheeler 's recent , amusing remarks in a NDPR book review : " Babette Babich ’s [ essay ] consists largely of assertions about analytic philosophy and citations of other people ’s assertions .
A reader somewhat familiar with both traditions will be puzzled as to why some of these assertions are taken to be true . " )
Do n't misunderstand the point of this little polemic : obviously a professional organization must represent both the very best and the solid laborers in the field .
The problem with NANS is that it has also chosen to " include " -- indeed , gone out of its way to include - -" scholars " who , if they worked on Kant or Descartes or Plato , would n't be able to get on a professional program at a scholarly meeting .
The straw that broke this camel 's back , however , was the latest announcement from " on high " that Jim Conant of the University of Chicago is to be the new head of the Program Committee .
( It appears that Professor Schacht makes these decisions unilaterally . )
Conant replaced Alan Schrift , who at least had written a lot on Nietzsche .
Conant , by contrast , has published only one substantial paper on Nietzsche since beginning his teaching career 15 years ago -- in a book edited by none other than Dick Schacht !
The paper , a reading of Nietzsche 's Schopenhauer as Educator , was part of Conant 's doctoral thesis , so it 's one he 's been working on for more than 15 years .
Yet this one paper is , itself , a problematic piece of work .
As I wrote in my review of the Schacht collection in Mind :
More than 1,250 Ontario tax collectors will get a severance package worth up to $ 45,000 each despite the fact they wo n’t be losing their jobs .
The move , part of the province ’s plan to harmonize sales taxes with Ottawa , will see the provincial collectors become federal employees , triggering a payout critics said amounted to tens of thousands of dollars to change business cards .
The opposition parties said it shows how wrong - headed the HST is , but Premier Dalton McGuinty said the province is simply honouring an existing collective agreement .
“ There ’s an important part of our brand as a province , as a government , when we do business with each other and when we do business with the world , is that when we give you our word , our word is our word , ” McGuinty said after an unrelated event in Listowel , Ont .
“ I guess the alternative is we could introduce legislation in the house and say : ‘ Look , you signed a deal and we signed a deal ( but ) it ’s no longer convenient for us to respect that deal . ’
“ Where does that take you ? ”
Earlier this week , the Ministry of Revenue quietly announced the buyouts for more than 1,250 provincial collectors who will now work for Ottawa .
It says the province had signed an agreement with the Canada Revenue Agency outlining “ opportunities with the CRA for all Ontario government employees impacted by harmonization . ”
“ Essentially all employees will be made offers of employment to a CRA office in the same geographic location , ” the release said .
The plan to harmonize sales taxes was introduced in Ontario ’s budget last March , when Finance Minister Dwight Duncan said jobs in the public sector would be cut by five per cent over the next three years as the government struggled with a record deficit .
Duncan said about 2,000 Revenue Ministry workers would become federal employees under a deal with Ottawa , while the remaining 1,400 jobs would be phased out over the three - year period through attrition and other measures .
What the move really amounts to is giving a hefty six - month severance package to bureaucrats to simply change job titles , said Progressive Conservative critic Ted Arnott .
“ Apparently , they ’ll continue to work in the same office , they ’re not going to miss a day of work , and they ’re being paid up to $ 45,000 to change their business cards , ” Arnott said in the legislature .
“ Could you explain to my constituents in Wellington - Halton Hills _ many of whom are working two part - time jobs to make ends meet , many of whom dream of making $ 45,000 a year but are n’t _ why tax collectors are being handed that much when they are n’t even missing a single day of work ? ”
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the windfalls just went to show “ how wrong - headed ” the HST policy really was .
“ It really does show that the government did n’t think this out very well , ” she said .
Duncan said Thursday the severance clause was introduced into the collective agreement by the Conservatives when they were in power , adding the transfer is an appropriate arrangement that will result in savings in the future .
“ We thought it important to ensure that for those 1,251 employees , many of them in the Durham region , many of them in places where unemployment is a challenge , we would respect the collective agreement that ’s been in place for many years . ”
While he said he understood that some people who lost their jobs and received no severance may be upset about the payments , Duncan , like McGuinty , said it was important for the province to honour its word and “ the word of successive governments in Ontario . ”

Ontario employees who accept job offers will join CRA in two phases — the first on Nov. 25 , 2010 and the second on March 1 , 2012 .
A spokeswoman for Revenue Minister John Wilkinson said the total cost of the severance packages was still unknown and will depend on the number of employees who accept the job offer .
All employees who move to the CRA are entitled to legislated severance pay in the amount of one week per year of service to a maximum of 26 weeks .

Indeed , apart from farming , music was Hughes ’s most consuming passion .
It pained him that he was so identified with the 80s alterna - pop of his teen films , since that music represented but a thimbleful of the many genres and idioms he enjoyed .
His iTunes library filled several hard drives , and he planned the playlists for his sons ’ weddings as carefully as he had the soundtracks for his movies .
In recent years , he took to dispensing pre-loaded iPods to people he liked , much as he ’d assiduously compiled mix tapes for Ringwald and Broderick in the old days .
The last time he ever saw Hughes , in November 2008 , Chris Candy , John Candy ’s 25 - year - old son , was the recipient of such an iPod , “ an incredibly eclectic four - gig , thousand - song mix tape , basically , ” Candy says .
“ I have a local radio show on a college station in L.A. , and when John passed away , I just put that iPod on ‘ shuffle ’ and let it play as my tribute to him . ”
It was this iPod , returned on loan , that the Hughes family used as background music for Hughes ’s funeral .
Last Picture
The evening of Wednesday , August 5 , 2009 , was a happy one for Hughes .
He and Nancy had arrived in New York from Chicago in time to drop in on James and his wife , have dinner , and take lots of photographs and video of their new grandson .
Hughes was conversationally “ on fire ” that night , James says , “ in the best possible mood . ”
After dinner , parents bade good - bye to son and daughter - in - law with plans to meet again the next day .
The morning of August 6 , Nancy awoke in her Manhattan hotel room to find her husband ’s side of the bed empty , which was not unusual .
It was Hughes ’s custom to get up early and enjoy a morning constitutional when staying in New York .
The routine provided him with an opportunity to get a head start on his relentless observing , sketching , and note - taking .
James was eagerly awaiting the chance to talk with his father about the death of the great screenwriter Budd Schulberg , whose obituary was in the papers that morning .
Both Hugheses were fans of A Face in the Crowd , the connoisseur ’s choice over Schulberg ’s more celebrated On the Waterfront , and surely , James thought , a compelling John Hughes riff on the life and oeuvre of Schulberg was forthcoming .
But then the terrible news reached James , as it had already reached Nancy , and would soon reach John III back in Illinois : Hughes had collapsed on a sidewalk a few blocks from the hotel .
He was rushed to Roosevelt Hospital , near Lincoln Center , and pronounced dead of a heart attack .
His death was completely unexpected .
Though he had been a chain - smoker for most of his adult life ( Tareytons in his adman days , low - tar Carltons thereafter ) , he had finally kicked the habit in 2001 .
He had displayed no recent signs of ill health .
“ I lost two people with his death , ” John III says .
“ I lost my father , which comes with its own territory .
But , really , that was second to losing him as a friend , collaborator , and mentor to my children . ”
Says James ,
“ You almost wanted to pick up the phone to talk about John Hughes ’s dying with him . ”
The notebook that Hughes was carrying with him when he died , a red Smythson Panama , contained no new entry for August 6 , though August 5 was filled with a detailed description of the hotel — as if setting the scene in a screenplay — and warm notes about his visit with his grandson .
The family also recovered the camera that Hughes had been carrying on his last walk .
It contained a few photographs he ’d taken that very morning : neatly composed streetscapes .
“ It ’s some small comfort to us that we know from the spot where the ambulance arrived , and from where his last picture was taken , that it was a small distance — that it was sudden , ” James says .
More comforting still , James says , is that , “ when he passed away , he was doing something he loved .
He was out note - taking and observing ” — even if the notes were mental and photographic rather than pen-to - paper .
The point is : John Hughes never stopped writing until his heart stopped beating .

Linux Mint 8 ( aka Helena ) is the latest version of the popular , desktop - oriented distribution .
Helena was actually released late last year , but I ’ve just gotten around to reviewing it .
As with prior releases of Mint , Helena is based on the latest version of Ubuntu , which in this case is Karmic Koala .
For this review , I ’ll go through the features of Mint 8 that I consider to be good , not so good and those that I think are bad .
But before reviewing a running Linux Mint 8 , let ’s see what the installer has to offer .
Installation :
If you have installed earlier versions of Mint and Ubuntu , you wo n’t fine any major feature enhancements in the installer .
It still does not support setting up LVM and RAID .
All the journaling filesystems – ext3 , ext4 , xfs , jfs , reiserfs – are supported , with ext4 as the default .
Full disk encryption is not supported .
This installer , however , allows you to encrypt your home directory .
That home directory is not even on its own partition , but is created within the root directory ( within the single root partition ) .
Encrypting the home directory is a nice feature , but as a real security measure , it does very little to enhance the overall physical security posture of the system .
You may choose to encrypt /home
Ok , that ’s it with the installer and the installation process .
There ’s not really very much to write about it .
How about the running system ?
Let ’s start with the good .
What ’s Good ?
The Mint team has been doing everything they can to make their distro as user - friendly as possible .
And it just keeps getting better with every release .
For starters , insert an audio CD , and the system will respond with a dialog box prompting you to play the CD with Rhythmbox , the default audio player .
You get the same response when you insert a DVD video .
This time , however , you are prompted to play it with Totem , and with libdvdcss2 installed , Totem will play all your encrypted DVD videos .
In contrast , Totem installed on ALT Linux 5 Ark Desktop , on Simply Linux 5 , and other distros I ’ve reviewed will not play commercial ( encrypted ) DVD videos out of the box .
As with all recent releases of Linux distros , hardware detection is excellent , and the system will detect and automatically configure a connected printer .
My Gear Head webcam works .
Linux Mint 8 makes it very easy to search for and install an application right from the menu .
One of the options the system presents to you when you type the name of an application into the filter box is to install it , that is , if the application is not already installed .
Aside from being able to search for and install software from the menu , Mint 8 offers other avenues to manage applications on the system .
Synaptic , the graphical interface to the package manager , and the Linux command line are the two well known package installation avenues .
A third software management tool is mintInstall , also known as the Software Manager .
This is similar to Ubuntu ’s software manager , but with more mature features .
Keep in mind that there are certain applications that you can install using Synaptic or from a shell terminal that are not available from mintInstall ( Software Manager ) .
Software Manager
From the featured applications window of the Software Manager , you can install some of the most popular applications available in the repos .
Software Manager ’s featured applications
The default ( and only ) browser installed is Mozilla Firefox ( version 3.5.3 ) , and it packs all the plugins it needs to render multimedia applications – flash , Java , quicktime , etc .
What ’s not so good ( or not too bad ) ?
Like Ubuntu 9.10 , the distro it is derived from , Linux Mint 8 comes with ufw , the Uncomplicated Firewall , running out of the box .
However , unlike Ubuntu , Helena pre-installs Gufw , the graphical interface to ufw .
Which is a good thing for those not familiar with setting up IPTables via ufw ’s uncomplicated interface .
What ’s not so good is that Gufw is disabled out of the box .
This does not in any way affect the default configuration of ufw , but it is always nice to have these tools properly configured for inexperienced users .
One of the nicest features of Pardus is the Kaptan application .
What Kaptan is is a first - time , welcome application that gives a user the opportunity to customize a fresh installation of the distro .
It can also be called up at any time after installation .
mintWelcome , Linux Mint ’s welcome application , is an attempt at that , but it does not offer the same features that you ’ll find on Kaptan .
In addition to the list of items on mintWelcome , here are three that I ’ll love to see added :
Customize your desktop
Enable Network Time Protocol
Enable Gufw , the graphical firewall manager

But the officer found that , while he was legally able to seize the device , the evidence he found could n't necessarily be used in court .
As hand - held electronic devices grow more ubiquitous , the information they store , from photos and text messages to call histories , is playing an increasingly larger role in criminal cases .
But digital evidence , like all evidence called during trials , must be tested , and two recent Ontario court rulings underscore what has long been true in wiretap cases : police can tap your phone lines , but that does n't mean what they hear will be admissible in court .
This fall , Toronto defence lawyer Darren Sederoff argued the warrantless search leading to the discovery of a text message infringed his client 's ( Section 8 ) Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure .
The judge agreed .
In his legal arguments , Sederoff cited a pre-trial ruling earlier this year by Superior Court Justice Brian Trafford , who found police had improperly seized a cellphone belonging to a murder suspect .
" A cellphone was the functional equivalent of a locked briefcase in today 's technologically sophisticated world , " Trafford wrote in his June 17 , 2009 , ruling .
The court case involving a text message began July 27 , 2007 , around 12:30 a.m. when police pulled over a Hyundai on Front St .
Officers began to investigate " what appeared to be a stolen car " and found a loaded firearm wedged behind the back seat , Crown attorney Glen Crisp said .
One of the four people arrested was Ishamar Savory , 24 , a former Scarborough high school football star .
Charged with gun possession , Savory was taken to 52 Division while one of the arresting officers , Const .
John Antonelli , searched his iPAQ , a hand - held device that functions as a cellphone .
It was on and was n't password - protected .
" I was verifying certain information on the cellphone to ensure it was his , " Antonelli testified during pre-trial arguments before a jury was picked .
He told court he did " three or four clicks " and the following text message appeared : " I was on the block I had a small ting 4 u holla do n't get excited a small ting best I can do . "
Antonelli told court he believed the word " ting " related to a firearm .
The officer said he did n't think he needed a search warrant .
During pre-trial legal arguments Sederoff argued that what happened was a " systematic disregard of privacy rights , " adding with a hand - held device there is an even " higher reasonable expectation of privacy " than with a cellphone .
Crisp argued Antonelli's search of the iPAQ was lawful because it was " cursory " and he was not " looking through every single piece of information that was available . "
He noted case law says police do n't need a warrant to search a wallet .
Superior Court Justice Thomas Lederer , however , agreed with Sederoff , citing Trafford 's decision in June that said while police have power to seize a cellphone it " does not include a power to examine the contents of the cellphone without a prior judicial authorization , absent exigent circumstances . "

Despite their rulings , Lederer and Trafford turned down defence motions to exclude evidence taken from the cellphone .
Lederer found the conduct of the officer who retrieved the text " was not on the serious end of the scale , " nor did he act in " bad faith .
" Nonetheless , the jury did n't hear expert opinion about the text message after it was excluded on other legal grounds .
Savory and another man were convicted of gun possession .
The next number is 9 .
The numbers correspond to the Roman numerals hidden in English number names :
In the UK , the Metropolitan Police teamed up with Caparo to create this concept police car , the Caparo T1 RRV .
It can go from 0 to 100 mph in 5 seconds .
It sports 575 hp at 10,500 rpm from a 3.5L V8 engine and a top speed of 200 mph .
It was designed to patrol the M25 Highway .

For many years Rapidshare was considered to be a safe way for people to download copyrighted content without having to face repercussions .
Recently , however , the company has been actively going after users that upload copyrighted files through the service by terminating accounts .
In common with BitTorrent and other file - sharing services , Rapidshare has steadily increased its user base in recent years .
The site has hundreds of millions of visitors each month and is listed among the 50 most - used sites on the Internet .
Like most file - hosting services , Rapidshare is hosting a wide range of music , movies and music files that are distributed without the consent of the rightsholders .
This has dragged the company ’s bosses into several lawsuits with copyright holders already , most recently they were ordered to proactively filter 148 book titles to avoid jail time and huge fines .
Although it is no secret that many people use Rapidshare to distribute copyrighted content , the site ’s users have remained largely untouched until recently .
Over the last few weeks , however , reports are coming in from users who ’ve had their accounts terminated for uploading copyrighted files .
From the emails being sent out , it is clear that Rapidshare is taking a more aggressive stance towards ‘ infringing ’ users .
Additional information from inside Rapidshare confirms that distributers of copyrighted material are indeed targeted more that before .
There is little doubt that this active termination policy is the result of ever - increasing pressure from copyright holders .
At the same time , these actions might very well be the end of Rapidshare ’s limitless expansion , as users will quickly move over to competing file - hosting services upon hearing this news .
Update :
In addition to real terminations there have been reports of scam emails .
However , we have additional information which proves without a doubt that Rapidhare is indeed targeting distributors of copyrighted material more aggressively by terminating their accounts .
We will publish this in the coming days .
We removed the quotes from the email we posted here earlier to avoid confusion .
Update : A Rapidshare spokesperson just confirmed that they are indeed terminating accounts of copyright infringers .
“ I can confirm that we reserve the right to terminate the accounts of users that do not act according to our terms and conditions , ” we were told .
Update :
To clarify what happened .
Last week we received confidential information that Rapidshare will take on a new direction ( this info comes from Rapidshare ) .
Among other things , it included information that Rapidshare was going to target infringers more aggressively .
Then , yesterday we were sent a termination email by a reader .
We assumed that this was connected to the information we received earlier and posted this article .
As it turns out , we cannot verify if this email is the scam one or the legit one , but Rapidshare says that the email we posted here earlier was fake .
The email has been removed by us because it looked similar to the fake emails .
But , there is no doubt that Rapidshare is taking a more aggressive approach towards copyright infringers .
More on this later .
Update :
There is no doubt that the email we posted here earlier was fake .
The bit about Rapidshare storing privacy sensitive information in its users for “ legal reasons ” is not true .
We apologize to Rapidshare for posting this ( we should have been more careful ) , but stand behind the part that Rapidshare is targeting copyright infringers more aggressively .
Update : New info at Rapidshare Aims To Convert Pirates Into Customers .

Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood , a weekend bicyclist , might consider keeping his head down and his helmet on .
A backlash is brewing over his new bicycling policy .
LaHood says the government is going to give bicycling - and walking , too - the same importance as automobiles in transportation planning and the selection of projects for federal money .
The former Republican congressman quietly announced the " sea change " in transportation policy last month .
" This is the end of favoring motorized transportation at the expense of non-motorized , " he wrote in his government blog .
Not so fast , say some conservatives and industries dependent on trucking .
A manufacturers ' blog called the policy " nonsensical . "
One congressman suggested LaHood was on drugs .
The new policy is an extension of the Obama administration 's livability initiative , which regards the creation of alternatives to driving - buses , streetcars , trolleys and trains , as well as biking and walking - as central to solving the nation 's transportation woes .
LaHood 's blog was accompanied by a DOT policy statement urging states and transportation agencies to treat " walking and bicycling as equals with other transportation modes . "
It recommends , among other things , including biking and walking lanes on bridges and clearing snow from bike paths .

A gift of $ 17 makes a difference .
Transportation secretary is normally a quiet post , a Cabinet backwater .
But LaHood has been the administration 's point man on an array of high - profile issues , from high - speed trains and distracted drivers to runaway Toyotas .
The new policy has vaulted LaHood to superstar status in the bicycling world .
Bike blogs are bubbling with praise .
A post on Ridemonkey.com calls him " cycling 's man of the century . "
The Adventure Cycling Association 's
Web site calls LaHood " our hero . "
" LaHood went out on a limb for cyclists , " Joe Lindsey wrote on Bicycling.com .
" He said stuff no Transportation secretary 's ever said , and is backing it up with action . "
The policy has also been embraced by environmentalists and many urban planners .
Word of the policy change is still filtering out beyond the bicycling and transportation communities , but the initial reaction from conservatives and industry has been hostile .
The National Association of Manufacturers ' blog , Shopfloor.org , called the policy " dumb and irresponsible . "
" LaHood 's pedal parity is nonsensical for a modern industrial nation , " said the blog .
" We do n't call it sacrilege , but radical is a fair description .
It is indeed a sea change in federal transportation policy that could have profound implications for the U.S. economy and the 80 percent of freight that moves by truck . "
LaHood said he has been surprised by the response .
" It did n't seem that controversial to me , " he wrote in a second blog item .
" After all , I did n't say they should have the only voice .
Just a voice . "
At a recent House hearing , Rep. Steve LaTourette , R - Ohio , suggested jokingly to a Transportation Department official that one explanation for the new policy is that the secretary 's thinking has been clouded by drugs .
" Is that a typo ? " LaTourette asked .
" If it 's not a typo , is there still mandatory drug testing at the department ? "
The new policy is not a regulation and , therefore , not mandatory , Transportation undersecretary for policy Roy Kienitz responded to LaTourette .
But it 's LaHood 's view " that the federal government should not take the position that roads and trains are real transportation and walking and biking is not , " Kienitz said .
" His view is it 's all real transportation , and we should consider it based on what benefits it can bring for the amount of money we spend . "
That did n't satisfy LaTourette .
" So is it his thought that perhaps we 're going to have , like , rickshaws carrying cargo from state to state , or people with backpacks ? " asked the congressman .
Bicycling advocates have been blasting LaTourette .
Andy Clarke , president of the League of American Bicyclists , with 300,000 affiliated members , called his comments " a little childish . "
LaTourette said in an interview that he thinks bike paths , bike lanes and projects that make communities more walkable are fine but should n't be funded with money raised by a gasoline tax paid by motorists .
The federal gas tax pays for most highway and transit aid , although lately general Treasury funds have been used to supplement the programs .
LaHood noted that LaTourette supports federal funds for a bike path in his district .
" The point is , on his Web site he 's bragging about the fact that he got some money for a bike path , " LaHood said .
" He knows people in his district like them . "
LaHood , 64 , said he and his wife have biked on weekends for years .
Three days before his announcement of the new policy , LaHood stood on a table to speak to a gathering of hundreds of bike enthusiasts in Washington .
He drew cheers when he vowed the Obama administration will put affordable housing next to walking and biking paths .
" I 'm not going to apologize for any of it , " he said in the interview .
" I think this is what the people want . "

Attempts to stem used game sales at GameStop have just turned into a legal headache for the retailer who thrives on selling pre-owned video games .
The company has just been hit with a lawsuit over " deceptive and misleading " sales practices .
Advertisement
According to a class action suit spotted by IGN , GameStop is being sued for " fraudulently , unfairly , unlawfully and deceptively [ misleading ] consumers at the time of their purchase to believe that the game comes with free downloadable content , when it fact , it does not . "
Basically , the suit is being filed over the fact that downloadable content — characters , maps , gameplay modes — are promised on the box , but are not available to second hand buyers , unbeknownst to those consumers .
The suit names games that feature prominent downloadable content designed to be used by the " original purchaser , " such as Dragon Age : Origins , Battlefield : Bad Company 2 and Mass Effect 2 , among others .
All but one of the games mentioned in the suit are published or distributed by Electronic Arts , which is leading the charge against used game sales with its " Project Ten Dollar " initiative , which now seems more successful than ever in the fight against used game sales .
Advertisement
The plaintiff in the case , James Collins , argues that the problem was compounded by GameStop 's limited window in which it will accept returns on games .
In short , Collins felt screwed by the promise of downloadable quests , which ultimately cost him an extra $ 15 , and his inability to get his $ 54.99 back .

arus Lyons called students this week from a comfortable place .
Rick Owens prayed from a popular pulpit .
Good thing , too .
It might have been different .
Lyons could , after all , have urged his students to bow before Muhammad , to open their hearts and minds to the words of the Buddha .
Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts .
Yeah , Owens might have told Bessemer 's troubled boys to emulate Balrama , the brother of Krishna .
He 's a fine role model and husband , an all - around good guy and god .
That would have been educational .
As it was this week , Lyons led an apparently successful and obviously inspirational altar call during a required assembly in the Bessemer school system .
Owens raised the bar , praying to the students that Jesus Christ is the only way .
Surprising ?
No .
There will always be prayer in schools , as they say , as long as there are algebra tests .
And around these parts there will always be a call to freedom of faith in schools , city council meetings and school boards .
As long as you worship the right way .
It would have been different , I suppose , if Lyons had told students to attune themselves to the natural rhythm of life forces through the phases of the moon , as a Wiccan might .
It would have been different if Owens prayed to Hanuman the monkey god , or a sacred caterpillar known as Malacos the tent worm .
The only way to salvation , young pupae , is to follow the transformation of the tent worm .
Mate , build your cocoons and emerge as moths .
Follow the light until ... ZAP !
I say teach your children well in whatever your faith may have .
But do n't teach mine .
We are arrogant and ignorant when we presume our beliefs are the only ones worth teaching .
We might even be un-American .
Because freedom of religion is freedom
from
religion .
Pray to my God .
Pray to your moth .
But not in public schools .
It 's not just Bessemer 's issue .
The Birmingham City Council has been challenged for its prayer policy , too .
No wonder why .
So far this year 15 prayers have opened council meetings , and 15 have been Christian prayers .
There is barely even denominational diversity .
Ten of those prayers came from Baptists , one from the chaplain at Miles College , and one each from A.M.E. , Presbyterian and Full Gospel ministers .
One came far out on a limb , from a Catholic priest .
Hoover School Board President Donna Frazier also wants to return to verbal prayers before meetings , backtracking on a year - long policy of silent prayers .
And why not ?
Just start with a prayer to Jesus and move on to Muhammad or Mother Earth .
We 'll get to Ram , 7th incarnation of Vishnu , before we reach Tom Cruise and Confucius .
Maybe we 'll get back to Malacos the tent worm .
Right before the next school board appointment .
Teach your children about the worm , if that 's what you believe .
Let me teach my own .

The uTorrent development team officially released the long awaited version 2.0 of their popular application today .
The release hopes to optimize the download experience for uTorrent users while eliminating the need for ISPs to manage , block or limit BitTorrent traffic .
u Torrent for Windows saw its first public release in September 2005 and soon became the most widely used BitTorrent applications .
The client is used by more than 50 million users worldwide and this number continues to rise .
Today , uTorrent version 2.0 was officially released .
This new release is built to be more network friendly thanks to the Micro Transport Protocol ( uTP ) which aims to mitigate network congestion caused by poorly configured BitTorrent clients .
uTP is a new and improved implementation of the BitTorrent protocol which is designed to be more network friendly than its predecessor .
The current implementation often causes interference with other applications .
This is one of the main reasons why ISPs try to slow it down , or even stop it altogether .
uTP aims to solve this problem .
Simon Morris , BitTorrent ’s VP of Product Management is quite proud of the end result , and told TorrentFreak that most ISPs have also responded positively to the implementation of the uTP protocol .
“ In general the ISPs who we have explained the technology to have been quite pleasantly surprised .
There are occasional noisy skeptics who think its something evil , but they are generally poor confused souls who are more interested in selling a centralized vision of the internet rather than the distributed egalitarian system we have today , ” Morris said .
“ I ’m excited about uTP finally arriving at a full scale deployment on the internet and I really hope that ISPs take the time to understand the potential benefits to them before they take decisions about how to manage this new class of traffic on their networks , ” he added .
Aside from being gentle to the ISP ’s networks , uTorrent 2.0 might also have a beneficial effect on the download speeds of individual users .
Since there is less congestion , uTorrent users will experience no slowdowns in web - browsing .
Less congestion and a more efficient use of the network may eventually result in faster download speeds , which means that it will be a win-win situation for both ISPs and uTorrent users .
Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are facing a mini-rebellion against their message on healthcare reform .
Every GOP lawmaker rejected the Democrats ’ bill last month , but the party is now split on whether to call for a full repeal of the new law .
ADVERTISEMENT
Dozens of Republican lawmakers have signed on to bills that would repeal 100 percent of the health overhaul .
The repeal effort on Capitol Hill is led in part by conservative Rep. Steve King ( R - Iowa ) on the House side and Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) in the upper chamber .
With Congress back in session next week , King and Rep. ( R- Minn . ) riled up supporters of an " ObamaCare " repeal at a campaign rally Wednesday afternoon .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ( R ) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( R ) , who are considered possible 2012 presidential candidates , both attended the event in Minnesota .
King told The Hill on Tuesday that he intends to press his leadership to sign on to a call for a full repeal .
In the days following the enactment of Obama ’s sweeping healthcare reform measure , Senate Minority Leader ( R - Ky . ) and House Minority Leader ( R - Ohio ) agreed to pursue a “ repeal and replace ” strategy as lawmakers headed home for the Easter recess .
That has frustrated King and other conservatives .
“ Sell the repeal idea .
We can debate the replace idea .
That ’s what I would like to see our leadership do , ” King said .
In a recent memo , listed eight items that the GOP conference would fight to repeal , but the Ohio lawmaker stopped short of calling for a full repeal .
Presidentlast month dared Republicans to campaign on a repeal message , urging them to “ go for it .
” Democrats , including Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Chris Van Hollen ( Md. ) , have noted that the new law includes politically popular provisions that go into effect this year , including a $ 250 rebate for some Medicare beneficiaries .
Van Hollen told The Hill in an interview that the DCCC is keeping close track of which Republicans call for a repeal of the new health law .
Of the 15 senators co-sponsoring DeMint ’s repeal bill , four are running for reelection this year .
They include Sen. Bob Bennett ( R - Utah ) , who is facing a tough primary race , and Sen . ( R - La . ) .
King asserts that Republican leaders need to be clear on what they would do on Obama ’s health law if they took control of Congress .
“ I talked to some of the leaders in the Tea Party groups , who ask to make sure that we define this repeal as 100 percent repeal .
They are not going to have any patience with equivocation , ” the lawmaker said .
But other Republicans do not share all of King ’s criticisms on “ repeal and replace . ” Rep. Bob Inglis ( R - S.C. ) , who is facing a primary challenge , is open to endorsing " repeal , replace and reform " alternatives .
“ I ’m willing to run that high - octane level that Steve is running , but I know that people in the [ GOP ] conference that wo n’t want to run at that high - octane level .
They want to repeal , but they want to make a statement about what they would do , " Inglis said .
Three Republican bills to repeal “ ObamaCare , ” offered by Reps. Dan Burton ( Ind. ) , ( S.C. ) and Phil Roe ( Tenn. ) , include language to replace parts of , or the entire , law .
King will not sign on to any legislation that would partially repeal the bill , in part because he believes it will divide Republicans .
“ I did n’t want to confuse the message on repeal by adding the word ‘ replace ’ because there ’s a question mark that hangs on ‘ replace , ’ which is , ‘ What would you replace it with ? ’ and then the discussion gets drug down [ sic ] into something that all Republicans are not going to agree on , ” King said .
That message was echoed by an aide to a like - minded GOP senator , who predicted that most Republican members running for reelection in 2010 would return from recess advocating a full repeal strategy after hearing from their constituents .
King and Inglis agreed that their leaders will soon have to address the issue by backing a legislative solution .
Neither Boehner nor his deputy GOP whip , Eric Cantor Eric Ivan CantorThe Hill 's Campaign Report : Florida hangs in the balance Eric Cantor teams up with former rival Dave Brat in supporting GOP candidate in former district Bottom line MORE ( Va. ) , has co-sponsored a bill that addresses the issue of repeal .
But both leaders did sign the conservative Club for Growth ’s petition to repeal the healthcare law , as did six GOP senators and 59 House Republicans .
Meanwhile , 67 GOP lawmakers and 283 candidates for office signed the Club ’s pledge to “ the people of my district / state to sponsor and support legislation to repeal any federal healthcare takeover passed in 2010 , and replace it with real reforms that lower healthcare costs without growing government . ”
Of the top three House Republicans , only GOP Conference Chairman Mike Pence ( Ind. ) signed both the Club ’s “ Repeal It ” pledge and co-sponsored King ’s repeal bill .
A House GOP leadership aide explained that once leaders return from recess , they will discuss how to proceed , but there should be no question that they are committed to repealing the healthcare law .
“ The message is simple .
Republicans will fight to repeal this government takeover of healthcare and replace it with solutions focused on lower costs .
As for next steps on legislation , the leaders will confer with our members and make those decisions , ” the aide added .
King holds out hope he can convince Boehner to endorse his approach .
He claimed that if Boehner can convince his colleagues to swear off earmarks — as the minority leader did last month — he can unify the GOP conference on repeal legislation .
King said , “ It should be absolutely clear that if you can bring the conference to swear off earmarks , we can bring a resolution that every one of us is in favor of 100 percent repeal of ObamaCare and we can put a discharge petition down in a matter of a month . ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - People who eat plenty of fish oil and other omega - 3 fatty acids could cut their risk of colon cancer , new research hints .
Studies in animals and a couple of small trials in people suggest that fish oil supplementation can fight inflammation and may have cancer - fighting properties , Dr. Sangmi Kim of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , and colleagues note .
But so far studies looking at the diets of larger groups of people have had equivocal results .
To investigate further , Kim and colleagues examined the relationship between polyunsaturated fatty acid intake and bowel cancer risk in 1,503 whites ( including 716 colon cancer patients and 787 healthy controls ) and 369 African Americans ( 213 with colon cancer , 156 controls ) .
Among whites , the researchers found , those in the top fourth based on their omega - 3 consumption had half the risk of colon cancer compared to those in the bottom fourth .
When the researchers looked separately at the two main fatty acids contained in fish oil -- eicosapentaenoic acids and docosahexaenoic acids -- they found risk also fell with increasing intake .
When the researchers looked at whites and blacks together , they also found a reduced risk of colon cancer with increasing omega 3 intake ; separate analysis of the black study participants did n’t find this relationship .
They also found that people who consumed more omega - 6 fatty acids in relation to omega - 3s were more likely to have colon cancer , although omega - 6 intake in and of itself did n’t affect risk .
In addition to fish oils , omega - 3 fatty acid sources include seed oils , such as walnut oil and flax - seed oils , and leafy green vegetables .
People in the US typically eat more omega - 6 fatty acids than omega - 3s ; top sources include palm oil , soybean oil , and sunflower oil .
The researchers also found an “ unexpected ” association between higher omega - 3 intake and colon cancer in African - Americans , but urged caution in interpreting this finding , which they say “ may have been due to chance . ”
Nevertheless , they conclude , “ whether the possible benefit from this dietary modification varies by race warrants further evaluation . ”

US President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart , Dmitry Medvedev , have signed a landmark nuclear arms treaty in the Czech capital , Prague .
The treaty commits the former Cold War enemies to each reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 - 30 % lower than the previous ceiling .
Mr Obama said it was an important milestone , but " just one step on a longer journey " of nuclear disarmament .
Mr Medvedev said the deal would create safer conditions throughout the world .
If ratified by lawmakers in both countries , the treaty will replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( Start ) of 1991 , which has expired .
Missile defence
The US and Russian leaders signed the New Start treaty at a ceremony attended by hundreds of officials in the lavishly decorated Spanish Hall of Prague Castle , the Czech president 's residence .
TREATY LIMITS
Warheads : 1,550 ( 74 % lower than the 1991 Start Treaty and 30 % lower than the figure of 2,200 that each side was meant to reach by 2012 under the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty ( Sort ) ) Launchers : 700 deployed intercontinental and submarine - launched ballistic missiles , and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments
New limit on delivery systems less than half current ceiling of 1,600
US and Russian nuclear arsenals Global map of nuclear arsenals Q&A : New Start Read your comments
Under the pact , each side is allowed a maximum of 1,550 warheads , about 30 % lower than the 2002 Moscow Treaty .
It also limits the number of deployed delivery vehicles - ballistic missiles and heavy bombers - to no more than 700 .
However , each bomber counts as one warhead irrespective of the fact that it might carry multiple bombs or missiles .
Speaking after the signing ceremony , President Obama said the treaty demonstrated that both countries had halted the deterioration of their relations , which had prevented agreement on mutually important issues in the past .
" When the United States and Russia are not able to work together on big issues , it 's not good for either of our nations , nor is it good for the world .
Together we 've stopped that drift and proven the benefits of co-operation , " he added .
Mr Obama said the pact was " an important milestone for nuclear security and non-proliferation " and set the stage for further arms cuts .
" While the New Start treaty is an important first step forward , it is just one step on a longer journey .
This treaty will set the stage for further cuts , and going forward , we hope to pursue discussions with Russia on reducing both our strategic and tactical weapons , including non-deployed weapons . "

He said the talks - beginning this summer - would cover missile defence , threat assessments , and the completion of a joint assessment of emerging ballistic missiles .
For his part , President Medvedev said the negotiating process had not been simple , but the treaty represented a " win-win situation " that would enhance strategic stability and bilateral relations .
" The result we have obtained is good , " he said .
" We have got a document that fully maintains the balance of interests between Russia and the US .
The main thing is that there are no victors or losers here . "
But Mr Medvedev said disagreements remained between Moscow and Washington over US plans for a missile defence shield , which have been modified by Mr Obama .
ANALYSIS By Jonathan Marcus , BBC News , Prague Numbers here are not hugely important though in the sense that these arsenals are still far in excess of what might be needed to deter each other or , for that matter , any other potential nuclear competitor .
This agreement really is a starting benchmark ; a formal treaty that sets the scene for much more significant reductions in the future .
Indeed , much of the new agreement 's importance is in its collateral benefits .
It marks an important improvement in US - Russia relations and it gives President Obama in particular an important boost ahead of next month 's review conference for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
Bolstering this agreement , which is the central pillar of efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons , is a high priority for him .
Nuclear milestone on a long road On Tuesday , Russia 's foreign minister warned that it could abandon the New Start treaty " if a quantitative and qualitative build - up of the US strategic anti-missile potential begins to significantly affect the efficiency of Russia 's strategic forces " .
It was Moscow 's concerns over Washington 's plans to base interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar station in the Czech Republic that helped delay the new treaty .
President Obama shelved the idea in September , although new plans include ground - based interceptor missiles in Romania .
The White House has said it hopes and expects the US Senate to ratify the New Start treaty this year .
Senate ratification requires 67 votes , which means it must include Republicans .
The Russian lower house of parliament must also approve the treaty , but as long as the Kremlin supports it , ratification there is expected to be a formality .
During private talks before the signing ceremony , Mr Obama and Mr Medvedev also discussed Iran 's nuclear programme .
The US wants the UN Security Council to approve tougher sanctions against Tehran , over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment .
" Unfortunately Tehran is not reacting to an array of constructive compromise proposals .
We cannot close our eyes to this , " Mr Medvedev said afterwards .
Disarmament vision BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus , who is in Prague , says the real significance of this deal is that it marks a warming of US - Russian ties and heralds , perhaps , tougher Russian action on Iran 's nuclear programme .

It also gives Mr Obama a disarmament success that he hopes will strengthen his hand at next month 's review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , our correspondent says .
An overhaul of the 40 - year - old pact is seen as the central pillar of the US president 's efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons .
However , much more significant cuts in long - range nuclear weapons could take years of negotiation with the Russians , who do not share Mr Obama 's ambitious disarmament vision , our correspondent says .
Nuclear weapons are in fact looming larger in Russia 's security equation at a time when their role in US strategic thinking is becoming more circumscribed , he adds .
On Tuesday , President Obama unveiled the new Nuclear Posture Review , which narrows the circumstances in which the US would use nuclear weapons .
" The United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations , " it said .
Countries which the US regards not complying with the NPT , including Iran and North Korea , will not be spared a nuclear response .
North Korea pulled out of the NPT in 2003 , while the US claims Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons , which Tehran denies .
Mr Obama also pledged not to develop any new nuclear weapons , a move pushed through in the face of resistance by the Pentagon .

A second whistleblower speaks .
As the topic of physical delivery has gained prominent attention recently , it is crucial to complete the circle and show how this weakest link in the PM market is ( ab) used by the big boys : Phibro and Warren Buffet .
Pay particular attention to the analogues between the methods employed in the 90's commodity market and how the PM ( and equity ) market is being gamed currently .
And to think that each new generation of traders believes it has discovered something new ...
( All emphasis below is ours )
Background
As a market maker in silver options from 1989 to 2000 I was present during both the 1994 and 1997 silver events .
They were seminal in my education of gamesmanship in trading and how probabilities can come up short .
Prior to going out on my own , I traded at a small market making firm .
When a trader finished training there , he had top - tier options knowledge but was not educated in whom the players were , the fundamentals of the markets , and how probabilities were useless when information was asymmetric .
That was n’t their business , they taught option ’s theory .
Since I had drunk the kool - aid , I thought fundamentals and gamesmanship were useless in the face of the almighty Standard Deviation model .
That was a mistake .
Phibro Early Exercise
In April 1994 , the Thursday before Easter , the trading day ended with a rather unusual run up of 15 cents near the close to finish at 435ish around noon .
Options expired that day at 4 pm but we were n’t anywhere near the closest strikes ( 425 and 450 ) so most of us left .
It was a 4 day weekend in the U.S. but silver traded globally , albeit il - liquidly in Asia .
Comex would n’t open until next Tuesday .
My education in gamesmanship started that afternoon at JFK airport as I was waiting for a flight , my first vacation in 5 years .
My backer paged me at the airport to inform me that someone was exercising the K 450 calls .
I scoffed thinking it was a retail sap that was talked into exercising some 5 lot piece by an overzealous broker .
“ Great I said , let them , the options are out of the money . ”
And I hung up
10 minutes later he had me paged again .
“ You do n’t understand , it ’s Phibro exercising . ”
Again I naively said , “ So what , they are energy guys . ”
But I was curious , “ How many ? “ I asked .
“ All of them , five thousand , he replied .
Now I was really curious , but still woefully ignorant that it was I who was the sap at the table .
“ Why would they do that ? ” and he explained it to me .
I nearly shit myself and bent over in the cab vomiting on the ride back .
Cancelling my trip , I headed back to the office to assess the reality of what would happen , probabilities were no longer important .
Survival was important .
I had no money and was trading on a $ 25 k note lent to me by my backer .
We covered by buying futures on my entire short open Interest equivalent of EXPIRED OUT OF THE MONEY OPTIONS in Singapore with a dealing firm .
We did this prior to even actually knowing if I was exercised , probabilities be damned .
How did I know they exercised ?
The price covered at was $ 462 ; that is how .
The 450s were already in the money by 12 cents .
Phibro exercised all 5 k lots .
I had a fraction of that but big enough to be carried out on a stretcher had the rest of my position not bailed me out / performed on Tuesday next week .
The weird part was , the market stabilized that Tuesday and did not run to “ infinity ” as it could easily have .
We found out later it was because Phibro ’s exercise was a no - no and Warren Buffet ordered them to shut the trade down as it was too big of a potential scandal .
Especially in light of his coming to Solly ’s rescue and lending his good name to fix their most recent Treasury scandal .
A couple head ’s rolled there if I remember correctly .
My guess was that the client was a Buffet or Soros type .
Someone that would only go to Phibro , as these guys were the best at preventing information leakage , and always aligned themselves with client interests , where as if IB had an order and acted in dual capacity as a dealer , he would potentially front - run the order or stop it out poorly on an exit .
Phibro did n’t take other side of their client ’s orders .
They ran with them , and took care of the clients first .
Phibro got a big order for a client to buy silver , one that had to be handled expertly , and filled over time , no information leakage would be tolerated .
These guys were a prop desk that took orders as brokers once in a while .
They accumulated options for their own account ( K 450C ) to piggyback but not front - run the client .
They must have bought futures for themselves as well as the client with his permission .
They beat the VWAP by gunning the market on light volumes 1 hour before a 4 day US holiday .
[ TD : compare and contrast with the daily patterns seen every single day in the endless move up in the S&P ]
They exercised the 450 Calls that day and then lifted the offers of the 1 or 2 OTC metals dealers left open during Singapore hours , running them over during illiquid markets .
Never Again !
I became infatuated with Phibro gamesmanship and made it a point to understand that particular type of player .
Libertarian Darwinist that I was I did not blame them .
At the time
It was a buyer - beware market for big businesses and they did nothing wrong .
They took risk and they are n’t bigger than the market .
I wanted to play with the big boys , and that was the price .
For me it was about learning how to read the signs and not be on the wrong side of one of those events again , even if I was not privy to their meetings .
Here is some of what I learned :
In metals ( and energy and anything else with an OTC market ) the IB firms have dealing desks along GS , MS , Republic , JPMorgan , Scotia Mocatta , all were essentially broker dealers in precious metals .
All had clients : miners who hedged production and hedge funds who speculated OTC .
They provided liquidity by taking the other side of their client ’s trade and “ back - to - backing ” them in the futures markets or held onto them in their prop books as counterparty because of something else they saw .
Their client left resting orders with them in the IB ’s Central Limit Order Book ( CLOB ) which served as good information to trade around for the IB .
Sometimes they front - ran the client , other times they go for stops to force the client to puke .
Sometimes they ’d just make markets , depending on many things .
It was poker to them .
Sometimes they ’d just make markets , depending on many things .
It was poker to them .
Phibro was different .
These were smart guys but they were n’t a dealing bank .
They exploited imbalances in markets and took positions .
They had ideas .
They also took orders for heavyweights who needed absolute discretion .
They did not make it their business to fleece their own clients and instead aligned their interests .
And they made the banks look like pikers when a client came to them with an order .
For the next 4
Years I paid attention to how those dealing banks and phibro played the markets .
It was all about gamesmanship , Bayesian probability , and knowing your counterparty ’s motivation with these guys .
Information and misinformation .
Some methods :
How I.B firms would use a thinly traded floor to print the price that would trigger a massive stop loss in the OTC markets and bury their own clients .
Or how they would buy for their own accounts in front of resting limit orders for clients and simply use their clients to stop themselves out if the market printed thru their buy levels .
Or how they would use dual representation to show loudly they were buyers on one side of the ring , while they were selling quietly upstairs to other OTC dealers .
Trading with themselves in multiple entities , etc .
An IB with a Commodity Index was in heaven .
Prop trading , captive client flow from IB deals and OTC dealing and Brokerage .
The good ones knew how to integrate and hedge macro risks , whether to front run their own index clients or get out off their way .
“ Chinese walls ” did not exist in Commods .
Commods were mostly self regulated and that lead to predatory yet mostly legal behaviour .
Some of these were necessary to protect their interests with such a small number of players .
Some were possibly unethical , but most were legal .
Their clients were all big boys who left resting orders with the IBs at their own risk .
Clients themselves had to resort to some of the same tricks to keep the IB desks honest , like Coming in backwards , “ spoofing ” , leaving buy stops to get sell orders filled .
The alternative for these clients was to put massive orders in the floor where liquidity was subjective , non continuous and information leakage was massive .
1997 - Warren Buffet .
I got my chance to not get run over in 1997 , when Warren Buffet gave an order to Phibro to buy silver .
Short version .
Here is what went down .
Buffet gives
Phibro the order - fact
Phibro begins filling it as a broker using various OTC dealers as counterparties , and letting the I.B dealers sweat getting out of the risk .
- fact
Phibro buys options for their own account ( no exercise game this time tho ) - fact
Phibro buys futures for their own account .
– not confirmed .
One by one the IB dealers start to catch on that this is no ordinary order Phibro is handling .
They back away and liquidity gets harder to find .- fact
Other bigger hedge funds in the small circle of professionals , and other smart firms start getting long . - fact
Silver starts getting delivered from the Comex vaults .
Some of it actually removed .
Some of it just “ covered with a sheet ” for removal .
But ounces begin to be removed from the warehouse .
Phibro was rumored to be taking delivery and beginning to telegraph fear in the markets to start spoofing the VWAP .
Rumor was they had a warehouse in Red Hook where they stored it .
Never confirmed .
Point here is , the saps for the last part of this play were the producers and refiners who were complacently net short and dependent on above ground silver to satisfy delivery requests .
Producers had been over - hedging for years in this market , as silver was cheap and they had business cash flow issues .
It was their habit to sell forward production not yet available to them .
And if forced to , they would lease already above ground silver and make delivery , collateralizing it with silver yet to be mined .
Their positions were habitually synthetically long the contango as they rolled their deliverable production further and further out the curve in an attempt to squeeze much needed cash ( cost of carry ) for their businesses .
The net effect was that sometimes they had to borrow silver for prompt delivery while they rolled their production hedge back further .
– my interpretation of what I learned .
May not be accurate to the “ T ” , am not a physical guy .
Example : in 1995 a miner has silver due above ground in 1997 .
He hedges it in Z - 1997 contract .
Z 1997 comes and if he does n’t have that silver available for some other reason ; he covers the short and rolls it back .
How much he needs to do this is a function of his obligations , cash flows , and his greed for carry .
If leases are cheap , he will seek to capture all the contango and lease it until he gets the silver available .
If lease rates go up , it is not unlike a miner strike .
Silver is needed for delivery now , and term risk becomes the issue .
Contango collapses and market goes backwardated .
He will be forced to sell the contango to get that prompt silver short back if he cannot make delivery .
He has to defer delivery .
These guys were dependent on the specs NOT taking delivery for years .
Specs did n’t have balance sheets to take and store physical metal .
Specs usually were the weak hands at futures expiry .
.
But then …..
Entities that stored silver in bank vaults ( like the Republic vault ) begin to remove silver from the available pool for leasing .
This made the “ easy money ” portion of production financing no longer easy .
Think : smart money getting the word that a squeeze was on and playing along with it .
Phibro ( and others ) start selling the contango in the futures market to prepare to take delivery of even more contracts .
Or at least put pressure on the producers who had front month shorts they would have to make a decision on delivering .
Phibro KNEW that the producers had to sell the spreads to get their shorts back .
But they could n’t lift their shorts altogether as part of their financing deals with their bankers .
Their own positions were now breaking down in every way except flat price .
The market really did n’t move much .
This let them stay in denial .
Buffet announces he is long and intends to take delivery of silver .
Contango collapses .
Market spikes to 7.40 .
Rumor is gov’t intercedes and asks Buffet to not do this , it would break the industry .
( Kind of like how the exchange begged the gov’t to help it shut down the Hunt Bros . )
He says ok , and agrees to lend then their silver back to them .
Essentially charging them 40 % interest to delay delivery for a year .
What to look for :
Find the overleveraged / extended party - and you will find the weak hand at the table .
( Producers in 1997 )
Tail wags dog : if the pricing venue trades smaller volume than the OTC , then manipulate price with small volumes to execute trades with big volumes favorably .
( OTC vs Comex floor )
Divide and conquer - if counterparties are undercapitalized and / or fragmented , then it will be easier to get them to move like a herd .
( happens in options ALL THE TIME at expiration )
Manipulate data- take delivery of metal , take risk off books , manipulate MTM data .
Create an exit strategy - a good catalyst like Easter weekend , an announcement by an investor etc. or develop a market and grow your own bigger fool .
ie – retail .
Comments -
So many points to make here :
Institutions That Kill Enterprise
Animals long held in captivity fare poorly when released into the wild .
Call it the Free Willy Curse .
( Keiko , the famous orca , died a year after being released into the Norwegian Sea ; sadly , he beached himself after bouts of lethargy and loss of appetite . )
Arnold Kling argues that many government workers fear the Free Willy Curse :
… if I am totally dependent on my employer for a job ( that is , my next best alternative is something with a much lower wage rate ) , then I must behave very submissively toward my employer .
How many people are in such a position ?
Government workers strike me as an obvious example–many of them would be unable to earn as much in the private sector , particularly now .
So they would tend to be highly submissive .
Fearing lethargy and loss of appetite in the open market , bureaucratic time - servers entrench , erect barriers , and obsequiously bow to their superiors in the GS 13 - 15 pay grade .
They care less about serving their customers than they do about respecting the Chain of Command .
Such elective submission reminds me of a post Scott Adams wrote back in November on the Dilbert blog .
He said bad management spurs entrepreneurship :
Imagine a world where managers always recognized and rewarded their most capable people .
It would be hard for a rational employee to leave a great job for a ten percent chance of creating something even greater .
But leaving a boss who is Satan ’s learning - challenged little brother is relatively easy .
And if the general economy is n’t serving up wonderful job opportunities at other companies ( thanks in part to bad management ) then you can see why people gravitate toward starting their own companies …
Big companies with bad managers are the ideal breeding ground for entrepreneurs .
Google offers a lot of resources and free time to retain its talent because Page and Brin know their best engineers have an entrepreneurial itch .
Some of these engineers still leave ( I ’m looking at you , Patri ! ) but some stay and instead work to develop their new ideas in house .
Bad management inspires the entrepreneur , but the threat of exit also disciplines management .
But with governance , we see the opposite effect .
Let ’s suppose there were an innovative , enterprising policy maker , fresh to the Beltway .
As soon as he finds he is supervised by an army of morons and Captain Joy Kill , what will he do ?
Can he exit and start his own company to offer a better service at a lower cost ?
No , no .
In government , bad management whips skill and effort into submission because that skill has no where to go .
There is no threat of exit .
Over the last few years , the Free Willy Curse has gone viral .
What is to be done ?
2129 : Cameron vs Clegg on Immigration : Cameron pledges to bring immigration down to manageable levels with only " tens of thousands " rather than hundreds of thousands entering Britain .
Clegg describes
Tory plans to " cap " immigration figures as giving false hope because numbers of European immigrants cannot be limited .
Cameron says that Clegg 's " amnesty " for illegal immigrants who have been here for ten years would be disastrous .
For the first time tonight Brown says he agrees .
Clegg is becoming increasingly frustrated .
He says to Cameron : " Why do n't we save time and say that whatever you say about our policies is wrong ? "
Watching the scrap with a smile Brown pronounces : " They are both wrong . "
A few years back , two left - leaning writers , Andy and Lana Wachowski , adapted the story of Guy Fawkes , a Catholic radical who is remembered primarily for his failed attempt , on November 5 , 1605 , to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill King James I . The Wachowski brothers movie , V for Vendetta , made Fawkes the hero and presented the British crown as an oppressive dictatorship that was meant to echo , at least in technique , certain aspects of the administration of George W. Bush , down to the hooded prisoners , the orange jump suits and the unapologetic embrace of harsh interrogation techniques .
The meaning of Fawkes is , of course , not fixed .
The Wachowski brothers ’ retelling of the Fawkes ’ story was later embraced by libertarian supporters of Ron Paul .
During the 2008 campaign , “ Remember , Remember The Fifth of November ” became a rallying cry for Paul boosters , who shared at least some of the revolutionary fire of both Fawkes and the Wachowskis .
On November 5 , 2007 , Guy Fawkes Day , Paul supporters raised more than $ 4 million online .
Now , the Fawkes mythology has come full circle .
The Republican Governors Association has embraced the symbolism of Fawkes , launching a rather striking website , RememberNovember.com , with a video that showcases far more Hollywood savvy than one can usually expect from Republicans .
Again , the Fawkes tale has been twisted a bit .
This time , President Obama plays the roll of King James , the Democratic leadership is Parliament , and the Republican Party represents the aggrieved Catholic mass .
[ vodpod id=Video.3481355&w=425&h=350&fv= ]
The politics and substance aside , this strikes me as a remarkable bit of political messaging , not just for its cinematic quality .
The RGA , under the control of Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , is clearly stepping out of the stodgy , safe territory it normally inhabits .
It is aiming to tap into the vast well of anti-government fury now coursing through the nation .
Who would have guessed that Barbour would embrace the symbolic value of the same would - be mass murderer as the Wachowski brothers ?
One other note , RGA message wizards have intentionally not circulated this video on YouTube or made an embed version of it publicly available .
( Swampland asked for , and was granted , special dispensation . )
They want people to view it on their site , RememberNovember.com , in the hopes of building a grassroots army .
UPDATE : I notice quite a bit of electronic dust this post has stirred up on the interwebbing .
A couple points : First , as I suggest in the post , the tale of Fawkes has been so thoroughly appropriated by so many that it is just not right to associate the latest appropriators with the intent of the original criminal in 1605 .
The RGA is not calling for a violent uprising here .
It is tapping into well - established online anti-government memes .
( Remember 1984 . )
The Wachowski brothers , who were themselves referencing a comic book adaptation of the Fawkes story , were not calling for violence when they made their movie .
Ron Paul supporters were not calling for violence when they decided to raise $ 4 million in 2007 .
To suggest that this is what the RGA is doing now is , it seems to me , overly simplistic and inflammatory .
Second , there has been some speculation in the comments that the RGA fed me the Fawkes reference .
They did not .
But the connection is not exactly a stretch for anyone who has closely followed Republican politics online ( and yes , here I am counting Paul as a Republican ) .
Aside from the Remember November refrain , the classical music , the near - apocalyptic crises messages , the suggestions of totalitarian intent , the imagery of Castro and marching soldiers , the sound of a ticking clock all points to a well established online narrative , where Fawkes thrives as a sort of folk hero for all ideologies .
These sorts of videos are made to go viral .
They are intended to be edgy , provocative .
They are meant to tap into running passions , online story lines .
This one is very successful at accomplishing its viral mission .
AIPAC : We ’ll Take Over the UC Berkeley Student Government
by Cecilie Surasky
Why bother with moral persuasion when you can just threaten to take over government . . everywhere ?
On March 18 , UC Berkeley ’s student senate voted 16 to 4 in favor of divesting from companies that profit from the Israeli occupation .
A week later , in a move oddly predicted by AIPAC ’s Jonathan Kessler at AIPAC ’s policy conference , the vote was vetoed by the student senate president .
( Students hope the senate will overturn the veto next Wednesday . )
When asked about fighting the Berkeley pro-divest initiative , Kessler said , “ We ’re going to make sure that pro-Israel students take over the student government and reverse the vote .
. . .
This is how AIPAC operates in our nation ’s capital .
This is how AIPAC must operate on our nation ’s campuses . ”
Kessler is at 3:58 in video below .
Student elections are happening now at UC Berkeley and you can bet everyone ’s looking for the AIPAC - Manchurian candidate , if such a thing exists .

We can all exist in racist systems and you do not have to be racist or consciously racist in order to participate in these systems .
And I think it ’s quite evident when you look at the outcome of the war on drugs , systemic racism is about the laws that are on the books , it is about the types of enforcement that happens , it ’s about how many officers get designated to some communities more than others , that yields racial disparities in their outcomes , it does n’t have to do with litigating each and every one individual officer .
And that is really the issue that is at play .
One of the things that I wanted to discuss is we have to stop asking about how if white supremacy in policing exists , and I think we need to start figuring out how we can better determine the scale of this problem , how big is this issue . ”

Advertisement Cold weather is believed to have caused one of Britain 's oldest trees - known as the Great Oak at the Gates of the Dead - to split down the middle .
The 1,200 - year - old oak , near Chirk , Wrexham , has a 34ft ( 10 m ) circumference trunk and is thought to date back to the reign of King Egbert in 802 .
It is near the site of the Battle of Crogen in 1165 when the tree is thought to have been spared by King Henry II .
Local historian Mark Williams said he was " devastated " .
Mr Williams and fellow historian Deryn Poppit discovered the damage on Tuesday .
' Great shame '
He added : " It seems to be a victim of the very cold weather .
" The tree is on marshy ground in a basin with a stream running down nearby .
" With the stream overflowing because of melting snow , the water must have settled around the trunk and it looks as if this has caused it to split .
" It 's a great shame that this has happened after the tree managed to survive for so long .
We 're really devastated . "
The tree was spared when King Henry II had his men cut down the Ceiriog Woods in 1165 before he met - and was defeated - by Owain Gwynedd in the Battle of Crogen .
A plaque marking the battle was unveiled last year after Mr Williams and Mr Poppit campaigned to have the site officially recognised .
Last month the tree was featured on BBC1's Countryfile .
Mr Williams added : " Although some parts of the tree were rotten , some of it was still as strong as an oak .
" At some stage in its history , it appears to have been struck by lightning . "
After hearing about the damage , Mike McKenna , director of the Chirk wood - based panel producer , Kronospan , has offered to try and preserve the oak .
He said he had asked a specialist firm of arboriculturalists to carry out an assessment , adding : " If there 's something positive that can be done , we 'll do our best to help . "

Mixed signals about the global economy have triggered an unexpected fall in investor confidence , a report shows today .
The Investment and Financial Services Association CoreData Investor Sentiment index fell to 2.9 points in the first quarter of 2010 from a reading of 7.4 points the final quarter of 2009 .
The index had risen three of the four quarters in 2009 .
“ The index shows an unexpected decline in investor sentiment , given the markets have continued on an upward trajectory since the end of 2009 , ” said analyst Kristen Paech at market intelligence and consultancy firm CoreData .
Australian stocks have rebounded 55 per cent since their March 2009 lows , while the economy has effectively skirted the financial crisis , posting 0.9 per cent growth in the fourth quarter .
The benchmark ASX 200 share index has risen for each of the past six weeks , placing it marginally back into positive territory for 2010 , prior to today 's trading .
Prospects for the local economy may hinge on how fast house prices rise and whether the pace prompts further interest rate rises by the Reserve Bank .
Home prices surged an average of 13.6 per cent in state capitals in 2009 .

Hot Bikes !
No , no , no… .
This is n’t another article about “ Bike Theft .
If that ’s the sort of “ nastiness ’ that you ’re into , then you can click open an extra window HERE with details of some dirty deeds on Queen West here in Toronto .
Or you can consider how Myths can become bigger than the Man by skipping straight to the new comic book about Igor ‘ The Terrible ’ Kenk .
What we ’re really talking about here actually , is a truly naughty kind of nastiness .
A kink that not very many people have likely ever even considered before …
If you ’re feeling impulsive , then just CLICK HERE for a quick peek at some very soft - core Dutch “ Bike Porn ” !
Otherwise , here ’s the setup for the sex scene below …
I ’m not normally drawn in by pervy headlines , but it all started with a piece of ‘ news ’ where a man in the U.K was somehow caught “ simulating ” sex with his bike …
Alright
… So that ’s pretty freakin ’ perverted , so let ’s not even bother going there .
Then , I was reading about the , ‘ ecological ’ benefits of “ Green Sex Toys ” .
At first , this all seemed to be more about producing toys ( uhm products ) that are really more environmentally friendly to manufacture , and as a result , Non-Toxic for their “ users ” .
Since I ’m a firm supporter of the more expensive silicon based products out there ( for all sorts of health and safety reasons ) , it horrified me to think of what types of nasty toxins and pathogens those cheap , toxic , plastics and PVC’s and other “ rubber ” compounds could be introducing into some peoples most delicate tissues .
Anyhow , it turns out that the “ Green Toy ” label does n’t just apply to materials , but also to the toy designs that offer hand - cranked power to eliminate batteries .
Anyhow , I ’ll leave you to do your own research in that area , in the privacy of your home .
Speaking of good hard cranking though , let ’s get back to our Hot Bikes idea .
So all these articles have reminded me of a woman that I knew years ago ( names withheld to protect privacy ) , who had a bike named “ Mike ” which she she rode with great glee .
Mike sported a well worn seat ( Brooks , I believe it was ) that featured a rather long and slender ‘ saddle horn ’ .
I still recall thinking to myself that it seemed like her seat was adjusted to a very odd angle , and that it was also the smoothest , most well polished old leather saddle that I ’d ever seen , but since her boyfriend was a bike mechanic I just presumed that surely this was just the way she liked to have her seat setup .
I once asked him about this , since not only was he a pretty innovative bike mechanic , but also a great metal sculpture , and “ Mike ” was stored in the same workshop where we would toss back many a Sleeman Lager while talking about all manner of Social and Cycling issues .
In fact it was in that same well equipped shop / studio where I was first inspired to start undertaking more challenging repairs on my own bike .
But I digress .
Let it suffice to say that there was absolutely nothing too sacred or taboo that we could n’t talk about down there , but curiously when it came to “ Mike ” he would just scowl in the bikes general direction , and say “ She likes that bike way more than me ” .
Awhile later that Summer , I recall seeing Charlotte ( oops ! ) and Mike together on the Martin Goodman Trail .
Actually she zipped right past me as I was relaxing on a trailside bench , and this is where I first noticed her unique riding style …
Suddenly I fully understood her preference for such an unusually long seatpost , and the oddly / upwardly tilted horn .
She seemed VERY pleased as she pumped away in a most energetic fashion , with full leg extensions that caused her hips to rock back an forth .
Rather than try to describe this to you , I ’ll offer you this Dutch video that perfectly re-creates the results …
I ’m certain .
Perhaps I might even inspire a few of you to pull out your Allen keys and crescent wrenches and try your hand at abit of ‘ bike maintenance ’ yourselves ?
I mean , could there possibly be a greener toy for you to enjoy riding around on ?

Enlarge By Maciej Czoska , AP Adam Buczynski carries a dog found floating on an ice floe Tuesday , 15 miles off the Polish Baltic Sea coast in Gdynia .
Buczynski , a sailor from the ship Baltica , pulled the dog from the ice floe .
WARSAW ( AP ) 
A frightened , shivering dog was rescued after floating 75 miles on an ice floe down Poland 's Vistula River and into the Baltic Sea , officials said Thursday .
Now his saviors just have to figure out who really owns him .
Four people have already claimed him , but so far rescuers say there 's been no wagging tail of joy from the miracle dog they nicknamed " Baltic . "
PAW PRINT POST : Dogs and cats reign in this community
The dog's frozen odyssey came as Poland suffers through a winter cold snap .
Temperatures have dipped to below minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit .
The thick - furred male dog was found adrift Monday 15 miles out in the Baltic Sea by the crew of the Baltica , a Polish ship of ocean scientists carrying out research .
Researcher Natalia Drgas said Thursday that the rescue was difficult and at one point it seemed the dog had drowned .
" It was really a tough struggle .
It kept slipping into the water and crawling back on top of the ice .
At one point it vanished underwater , under the ship and we thought it was the end , but it emerged again and crawled on an ice sheet , " Drgas said .
At that point , the crew lowered a pontoon down to the water and a crewmember managed to grab the dog by the scruff of his neck and pull him to safety .
Too weak to shake off the frigid water , Baltic was dried and wrapped in blankets .
After he warmed up , he was massaged , fed and soon got on his feet to seek company , Drgas said .
A firefighter in Grudziadz , on the Vistula river 60 miles inland from the Bay of Gdansk , told the Associated Press the dog was spotted Saturday floating on ice through the city .
Firefighters tried to save him but could not approach the dog due to shifting ice sheets , said the officer , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The Baltica crew , now moored in the port city of Gdynia , has been searching for the dog's owners , ship captain Jerzy Wosachlo said .
So far four people have claimed him , but Baltic has not claimed any of them back , Drgas said .
The dog did n't welcome the first two people to come for him , keeping his distance and showing no recognition toward a couple on Wednesday and a woman on Thursday who both said he was theirs .
Two other would - be owners were still en route to Gdynia for a possible reunion .
Once in port , the brown - and - black mongrel was taken to a veterinarian , who found him in surprisingly good condition and estimated his age at around 5 or 6 years old .
Veterinarian Aleksandra Lawniczak said the 44 - pound dog was clearly frightened but in strikingly good shape and had suffered no frostbite .
A dog with thick fur and a layer of fat can survive such cold conditions for as long as eight days if it has water to drink , Lawniczak said .
She described Baltic as a friendly dog who was clearly well treated before getting lost .
Wosachlo said the research team is prepared to adopt Baltic if his original owner is never found .

A mother was jailed yesterday for child cruelty after her 13 - month - old son 's charred body was found strapped in his buggy in front of a fire .
Tracey Sutherland ( 39 ) confessed to neglecting her son , Alexander , who was found by police with charring to his body , soiled clothing stuck to him and apparent bruising to the body and forehead .
Manchester Crown Court heard that Sutherland had dialled 999 , telling the call handler she was alone , and had a dead baby at her house .
The child had extensive nappy rash with faeces and urine on his body when he was found by officers at the family home in Baguley , Manchester , on November 10 last year — which was his mother 's birthday .
But a pathologist 's report said no direct link could be found between the mother 's neglect and the tot 's death .
The family was known to social services , who were criticised by Judge Clement Goldstone QC for their “ startling lack of urgency ” in dealing with the risk to Alexander .
Sutherland pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to child cruelty by neglect between October 29 and November 10 last year .
She displayed no reaction as she was jailed for 27 months by Judge Goldstone .

Churches have come under attack in Malaysia amid rising tensions A Malaysian Muslim magazine has apologised after two of its journalists pretended to be Roman Catholics and took Holy Communion in a church .
Al - Islam said it had not intended to insult Christians with an article describing how the journalists received and later spat out communion wafers .
They were allegedly investigating reports that Muslims were illegally converting to Christianity .
Christians complained after charges against the reporters were dropped .
The Archbishop of Kuala Lumpur , Murphy Pakiam , said the two men had desecrated the Church , and the lack of charges appeared to legitimise their behaviour .
" The journalists have displayed utmost disrespect for the Catholic community when they admit receiving and spitting out the Holy Communion , " he told a press conference .
He said the incident " does not augur well on inter- religious harmony and peace " in Malaysia .
It is the latest in a series of incidents raising religious tensions in the Muslim - majority country .
Ignorance ?
The monthly Malay - language al - Islam magazine indicated the men spat out the communion wafers because it took a photograph of them partially bitten .
" Al - Islam magazine apologises ... because the article had unintentionally hurt the feelings of Christians , especially Catholics , " it said on its website Utusan Karya .
" It is also not the intention of al - Islam to insult the Christian religion nor to desecrate their house of worship . "
The government 's top lawyer , Attorney - General Abdul Gani Patail , said the pair had not understood the significance of the wafer .
" The actions of the two reporters may have hurt the feelings of the people but I was satisfied that they did not intend to offend anyone .
It was an act of sheer ignorance , " he said in a statement .
" Therefore in view of the circumstances at that particular time and in the interest of justice , peace and harmony , I decided not to press any charges against them . "
The journalists said they had found no evidence of the illegal conversion of Muslims .
Catholics believe the communion wafer is transformed into the body of Christ during the celebration of Mass .
While non-Catholics can attend Mass , the Church does not allow those who are not baptised to receive the communion wafer .
The BBC's Jennifer Pak in Malaysia says that non-Muslims feel their right to practise religion freely has come under threat in a country dominated by Muslims .
Protests against a court ruling in December that non-Muslims could use the word " Allah " led the government to appeal against the judgement .
Arson attacks then followed , mainly targeting churches , and wild boar 's heads were placed at mosques .
Pigs are considered unclean by Muslims and their presence would be taken as an insult .
Malays , who are required to be Muslim in Malaysia , make up a majority of the country 's population alongside substantial Chinese and Indian minorities .
The Malaysian constitution gives primacy to Islam but allows the free practice of other faiths .

SALT LAKE CITY --
The woman at the center of the latest scandal to rock the Utah State Capitol is speaking out , and she says House Majority Leader Kevin Garn did not tell all .
Garn shocked lawmakers Thursday night with a startling admission at the close of this years ' legislative session .
He said he went into a hot tub , naked , with a 15 - year - old girl in 1983 , and later paid her $ 150,000 to keep quiet .
" While this payment felt like extortion , I also felt like I should take her word that the money would help her heal .
She agreed to keep this 25 - year - old incident confidential .
Now that this issue has come up again , it 's become apparent to me that this payment was a mistake , " Garn said .

Utah politicians react to Garn confession A stunning admission came late Thursday night as the Utah Legislature wrapped up its session .
The shock , and the fallout , continued Friday .
A woman identifying herself as Cheryl Maher called and e-mailed KSL Newsradio Friday from New Hampshire .
She said she worked for Garn 's businesses and as his babysitter .
" Back in 2002 , I was the walking dead , " Maher said .
" I was a mess .
I was in a horrible marriage . "
She said there was a lot Garn did n't admit .
Of the hot tub incident , Maher told City Weekly , " Let 's just say this : he really loves to massage . "
Maher said she chose to go public to help others .
" I came forward because , for me , I want to speak the truth about my life .
My adventures in life will be helping other women that will be in crisis , " Maher said .
In an e-mail , she said Garn was her Sunday school teacher when she was in fourth grade .
Later , when she worked for him , Garn would stare at her , take her to lunch and shopping , and finally to a hot tub -- after stopping first for alcohol .
" So , this was n't just one incident .
This was a series of things that happened over months and months , " Maher said .
" It was a relationship that was going on that was completely inappropriate . "
Republican lawmakers we talked to say they 're waiting for Garn to make his own decision whether to stay in office .
But one Republican , Kirk Jowers of the Hinckley , was bothered by last night 's standing ovation in the house .
Sympathy is probably warranted , he said , but cheering is not .

SEOUL , South Korea —
Officials investigating the mysterious sinking of a South Korean warship in waters disputed by North Korea believe that the ship was hit and torn apart by an “ external explosion , ” the government announced Friday .
Its first official statement on the cause of the sinking came amid rising official and private speculation over a possible North Korean involvement .
“ It was highly likely that it was an external , rather than internal , explosion , ” Yoon Duk - yong , head of the government team of military and private investigators , said at a nationally televised news conference .
The news conference came a day after the stern of the ship was lifted out of the water , allowing investigators to look more closely at the damage .
Officials also found 36 dead sailors inside , bringing the death toll to 38 .
Eight sailors remain missing , while 58 were rescued the night the ship sank .

How many ways can a star go “ kaboom ! ” ?
It might depend on what kind of galaxy the star lives in , astronomers said last week .
For the last 20 years , astronomers seeking to measure the cosmos have used a special type of exploding star , known as Type 1a supernovas , as distance markers .
They are thought to result when stars known as white dwarfs grow beyond a certain weight limit , setting off a thermonuclear cataclysm that is not only bright enough to be seen across the universe but is also remarkably uniform from one supernova to the next .
Using them , two teams of astronomers a little more than a decade ago reached the startling and now widely held conclusion that some “ dark energy ” was speeding up the expansion of the universe .
But astronomers , to their embarrassment , have not been able to agree on how the white dwarf gains its fatal weight and explodes , whether by slowly grabbing material from a neighboring star or by crashing into another white dwarf .
In a telephone news conference on Wednesday and a paper published Thursday in the journal Nature , Marat Gilfanov and his colleague , Akos Bogdan , both of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching , Germany , said that for at least one class of galaxies in the universe , the roundish conglomerations of older , redder stars known as ellipticals , these supernovas are mostly produced by collisions .

04/06/2010 : Do I Still Remember How to do This ?
Hi !
I 'm back .
I do n't know for how long , but I missed talking with you guys in chunks of more than 140 characters !
I 've been off writing shows ( Dollhouse , Caprica ) , and speaking to young writers and pitching pilots and writing freelance eps of wonderful shows and generally recharging my blogbatteries !
Is everyone out there watching Community ?
I love this show and it's a master class on new and fresh ways to tell jokes .
And on how to actually be about something at the same time .
You can tell that the episodes are conceived in the same way you guys should be conceiving your spec scripts -- they start with something to say and then the humor comes out of that .
I guarantee you that they did not start working on the latest episode by thinking of funny things that could happen in a pottery class .
They started by thinking about their characters , what they believe , and where they 're weakest .
Find your characters ' vulnerable spots and poke them and you 'll find a story .
The idea that Jeff was over - praised as a child , resulting in a self - image that needs correction is not hilarious .
It 's grounded and real -- which allows for more license when writing the jokes .
For example , the writers were able to go to the surreal place of having Jeff 's childhood memories change retroactively at the end of the episode only because we were invested in an emotional change that we really bought .
You have to be really careful with surrealism because it can make an audience check out unless careful groundwork has been laid .
A lot depends on the show you chose to spec ( or the tone you 're looking for in your spec pilot ) , but in general I would recommend that you should be able to produce a non-funny answer to the question , " what is your script about ? "

But the way that character takes action to address the problem -- now you 've got a whole vista of comic possibilities that the viewers are going to actually empathize with .
And that 's golden .

Today marks the 40th anniversary of Earth Day .
Approximately 1 billion people will participate in Earth Day celebrations this month , and today alone countless people will plant trees , clean up rivers , pledge not to use plastic bags and decide to walk rather than drive .
All of this helps , of course , but it 's not going to save the planet .
To be truly " green " , we 've got to make our diets more environmentally friendly by kicking the meat habit and going vegan .
An apple a day can help keep environmental destruction away .
Our most serious environmental problems – climate change , overexploited natural resources , deforestation , wasted land , water and air pollution – as well as today 's most serious health problems , including heart disease and cancer , are all directly linked to the consumption of meat , eggs and dairy products .
A 2006 United Nations report revealed that the livestock sector generates more greenhouse gases than all the cars , trucks , trains , planes and ships in the world combined .
The report attributed 18 % of annual worldwide greenhouse - gas emissions to farmed animals , but new research indicates that the figure actually could be much higher .
In Livestock and Climate Change , the Worldwatch Institute estimates that raising animals for food actually accounts for 51 % of all greenhouse - gas emissions .
The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations estimates that 30 % of the Earth 's ice - free land is now involved – either directly or indirectly – in livestock production .
Huge swaths of forests are being bulldozed to make more room for animals and the crops that feed them .
According to Greenpeace , all the wild animals and trees in more than 2.9 m acres of rain forest were destroyed in one year 's crop season in order to grow crops that are used to feed chickens and other animals on factory farms .
Some activists will be showering in the street today behind a curtain that reads , " 1 kg of meat = 1 year of showers .
Clean your conscience : go vegan " .
That 's because between watering the crops that farmed animals eat , providing drinking water for billions of animals each year and cleaning away the filth on factory farms and in trucks and slaughterhouses , the farmed - animal industry places a serious strain on our water supply .
A totally vegetarian diet can be produced with only 1,100 litres of water per day , while producing a diet that includes meat requires more than 15,000 litres of water per day .
Then there 's the energy required to operate factory farms , feedlots , slaughterhouses and trucks that transport animals .
The respected environmental magazine E noted in 2002 that more than one - third of all fossil fuels produced in the US are used to raise animals for food .
That 's not all .
Our meat - based diet is partly to blame for world hunger , because land , water and other resources that could be used to grow food for human beings are used to grow crops for farmed animals instead .
It takes up to 16 pounds of grain to produce just one pound of meat .
It 's time to face what some may consider an inconvenient truth : our meat , egg and dairy habits are destroying the planet .
Let 's not forget about being environmentalists the moment we sit down to eat .
If we are to halt climate change and environmental destruction while stopping animal suffering and improving our health , we must celebrate Earth Day every day – at every meal .

Library • Ban Tha Song Yang , Myanmar Architects : TYIN Tegnestue
Year Completion year of this architecture project Year : 2009
In January 2009 TYIN invited 15 norwegian architect students from NTNU to participate in a workshop at the Safe Haven Orphanage .
The workshop was led by Associate Professor Hans Skotte and architect Sami Rintala .
The most immediate needs at the orphanage was a library and a new sanitary building .
TYIN worked on a bathhouse , together with the Karen workers from Noh Bo , while the workshop participants put their efforts into the library .
The concrete base of the library is cast on a bed of large rocks gathered on - site .
Walls made of plastered concrete blocks cools the building during the day , while the open bamboo facade gives a good ventilation .
Iron wood makes up the solid frame construction and serves as comfortable floor for the children to play on .
The bookshelves run along the concrete walls in their full height , and the floor is left unfurnished to give room for different activities .
The entrance , creates a comfortable buffer between the outdoors and indoors and divides the ground floor into a small computer area on one side and a larger library room on the other .
The most important thing to Tasanee is that her children are provided food and education .
In the library the children at Safe Haven Orphanage now have a space to do homework , use a computer with internet and read books written in different languages .
The new building has also attained the important role of a gathering space and is frequently used for play , games and crafts .
That NTNU , as an educational institution , contributes to workshops like this is of great importance .
It creates a unique opportunity for young , skilled students to engage real problems and make decisions with real consequences .

Black holes may be ' missing dark matter '
A new study suggests the mysterious substance called dark matter could be made up of black holes .
Dark matter is a theoretical substance that makes up 25 % of the total mass of the universe , preventing galaxies from flying apart as they spin .
But despite decades of research scientists still do n't know exactly what it is .
Writing in the pre-publication blog arXiv.org , Professor Paul Frampton of the University of North Carolina claims the missing mass might be primitive intermediate - sized black holes - too small to see , but too big to evaporate due to Hawking radiation .
Frampton says none of the particles in the standard model of particle physics have the properties needed to be dark matter , that is electrically neutral , long - lived and slow moving .
" Despite a decade spent searching , nobody 's produced a sample of dark matter , " he writes .
So Frampton has taken a different approach .
Estimating disorder
He first determined what the entropy , or measure of disorder , of the universe should be .
Using that as an upper limit , he then estimated the lower limit by adding together the entropy in all the known black holes in the universe .
He assumed that there 's a supermassive black hole at the centre of every galaxy .
" The difference must be coming from something else , " says Frampton .
" There 's not enough visible matter to account for the missing entropy so what 's left must be the entropy of the missing dark matter .
" Primordial intermediate size black holes could be responsible for this . "
But how could so many black holes have formed so early in the history of the universe ?
Double inflation
Frampton argues , something not included in current inflation theory , which describes how the early universe grew , must have caused matter to clump together at this scale to form the extra black holes .
He says there must have been two periods of inflation .
" The first led to the large scale structure of the universe we see , and the second to the clumping that created large numbers of intermediate sized black holes . "
But Professor Warwick Couch of Swinburne University in Melbourne says most cosmologists believe there has only ever been a single period of inflation .
Couch also questions Frampton 's claim that none of the particles in the standard model have the properties needed to be dark matter .
" That 's controversial and the fact that millions are being spent on dark matter experiments looking for WIMPs ( Weakly Interactive Massive Particles ) shows there could be dark particles we do n't know about , " he says .
Still Couch says black holes do introduce disorder into the universe , and entropy is a measure of disorder in systems .
" It also forces us to question what dark matter might be .
We think of it as unseen particles , but what if those particles are just black holes ?
" And if Frampton 's figures are correct , they do show a discrepancy between the number of black holes we know about , and the number there should be based on entropy .
Crouch says cosmologists do n't usually think of the universe in terms of entropy , but it is a good way of dealing with large numbers on a cosmic scale .

Guido watches his sugar & we are both border - line porky , so a flourless cookie is just the ticket .
I used organic PB from our favorite store ( Costco ) , Splenda , egg and a splash of Pure Vanilla .
I did n't flatten the first batch ( got the idea from the reviews that they spread ) well , those first ones were ball cookies !
Next 3 batches I did the fork dipped in Splenda thing , and the results were delightful .
I doubled recipe and it made 4 large trays of smallish cookies .

These cookies are 5 - star cookies when made right .
I gave the recipe 4 stars for lack of specificity .
There are a few things that need to happen for these cookies to be delicious .
1 . Use the right kind of peanut butter .
Natural peanuts - only peanut butter just wo n't give the right consistency or flavor .
Use a conventional peanut butter or a no - stir natural one ( the kind with palm oil added for emulsification ) .
2 . Add a little salt , ESPECIALLY if your peanut butter is unsalted .
This makes a world of difference in flavor .
3 . Be sure to use a large or extra - large egg .
4 . Use less sugar !
This goes along with # 3 above .
Too much sugar in a recipe will cause the egg not to set which leads to a runny mess on your cookie sheet .
3/4 cup of sugar is more than enough to make the cookies super sweet but still allows the egg to set properly .
If you take all these things into account , these cookies will knock your socks off !
I used crunchy peanut butter , 3/ 4 cup of brown sugar , a pinch of salt and one large egg and I was SO in love with these .
In fact , I liked them WAY more than conventional peanut butter cookies .
These are peanut butter heaven .

I added three tbs of flour and 1/2 a tps of vanilla .
Sort of defeats the " no flour " idea , but necessary .
I wonder if two eggs might make them a bit less " fragile . "
I rolled them into balls the size of quarters .
Cooked them until splits appear .
That are perfect bite - size treats that way !

Summary
In 2004 we accused President Bush of using " dubious statistics " to support his claim that limiting malpractice awards to injured patients could save the economy between $ 60 billion and $ 108 billion per year .
Ever since , we ’ve said most independent research indicated little if any savings from limiting malpractice liability , and just a few weeks ago we quoted the Congressional Budget Office as saying that only negligible savings could be expected .
Now CBO has revised its opinion , based on new evidence .
Citing recent studies , including two new economic papers published only last month , CBO concludes that limiting malpractice liability would reduce total national health care spending by about one - half of 1 percent , or about $ 11 billion this year .
That would save taxpayers about $ 41 billion over the next decade in lower Medicare , Medicaid and other federal spending for health care .
That ’s still not close to what Bush claimed five years ago , and what some Republicans are still claiming .
But it ’s a significant point in favor of a health care proposal that is generally opposed by Democrats .
Analysis
Republicans have complained repeatedly that Democratic health care proposals do n’t include any limits on damage awards in malpractice lawsuits or other " tort reform " measures .
And they claim the savings to taxpayers and the economy could be enormous .
House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio , for example , said in a recent interview with the conservative news site Newsmax.com :
Rep. Boehner , Oct. 2 : We could save over $ 100 billion a year in less medicine being practiced if in fact we were to have real reform of medical malpractice laws .
That $ 100 billion figure still nowhere close to being accurate , even given the new evidence .
We debunked it in 2004 , when President Bush was making similar claims for his own plan to cap malpractice awards .
He said limiting awards could save as much as $ 108 billion a year in overall health care spending .
But he based his claim mainly on a single 1996 study by two Stanford economists who said caps on damage awards could hold down overall medical costs by 5 percent to 9 percent by reducing " defensive medical practices . "
The Standford study was based only on the cost of treating patients hospitalized for cardiac problems , however .
Other researchers found little or no evidence of savings in other areas of medicine .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in January 2004 that , overall , it found " no statistically significant difference in per capita health care spending between states with and without limits on malpractice torts . "
But CBO continued to study the question .
Five years of additional research have produced new evidence that has prompted CBO to reach a somewhat different conclusion .
In an Oct. 9 letter to Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah , CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf said that a package of changes including limits on malpractice awards " would reduce total national health care spending by about 0.5 percent ( about $ 11 billion in 2009 ) . "
That figure includes a 0.2 percent reduction just from lower premiums for malpractice insurance paid by medical professionals .
And it includes an additional 0.3 percent in reduced costs of medical tests , imaging and other medical services .
( For a full list of the typical " tort reform " measures CBO studied , click below . )
[ EET ] CBO : Typical proposals have included :
A cap of $ 250,000 on awards for noneconomic damages ;
A cap on awards for punitive damages of $ 500,000 or two times the award for economic damages , whichever is greater ;
Modification of the “ collateral source ” rule to allow evidence of income from such sources as health and life insurance , workers ’ compensation , and automobile insurance to be introduced at trials or to require that such income be subtracted from awards decided by juries ;
A statute of limitations — one year for adults and three years for children — from the date of discovery of an injury ; and
Replacement of joint - and - several liability with a fair - share rule , under which a defendant in a lawsuit would be liable only for the percentage of the final award that was equal to his or her share of responsibility for the injury . [ / EET ]
CBO cited , for example , a 2007 study published in the journal Health Afffairs by a team of researchers from the University of California , Los Angeles ; Dartmouth Medical School ; and Harvard University .
They studied Medicare payments between 1993 and 2001 , and found that higher malpractice costs were associated with doctors ordering up increased tests , and especially expensive imaging services .
They found that a 10 percent increase in average malpractice payments per physician within a state " was associated with a 1.0 percent increase in Medicare payment for total physician services and a 2.2 percent increase in the imaging component of these services . "
A more recent study by economists from the University of Southern California and the RAND Corporation , published just last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research , found that growth in malpractice payments had added as much as 5 percent to the total growth of medical spending over the past decade .
This research examined rising jury awards for malpractice in 125 U.S. counties , and compared those awards to hospital costs and Medicare costs in those counties over more than a decade .
The economists found that between 1991 and 2002 , medical expenditures grew by 34 percent while malpractice payments grew by 65 percent .
Their data , they said , " would imply that , over this period , the growth in malpractice payments added 5.1 % to the growth in medical expenditures , or about 15 % of the total growth . "
Yet another study , also published just last month by NBER , examined data from private health insurance plans covering more than 10 million non-elderly workers , and spanning the years 1998 through 2006 .
It found that limiting malpractice liability reduced health insurance premiums paid by 1 percent to 2 percent .
" The results are the first direct evidence that tort reform reduces healthcare costs in aggregate , " stated the authors , a team of researchers from the University of Texas Law School , Northwestern University ’s Kellogg School of Management , and Northwestern University ’s School of Law .
Tax and Save
A 0.5 percent reduction in medical spending would save the federal government $ 41 billion in spending over the next decade for federal medical programs , including Medicare , Medicaid , the Children ’s Health Insurance Program and the Federal Employees Health Benefits program that covers 8 million federal workers , CBO said .
Furthermore , it would result indirectly in an additional $ 13 billion in tax revenues being collected .
This would happen as private employers realize savings in the cost of providing non-taxable health benefits to their workers and pay higher taxable wages instead , CBO said .
( Standard economic theory holds that employers pay whatever combination of wages and benefits is required to attract the workforce they need . )
The combination of lower federal medical spending and higher federal tax revenues would produce a $ 54 billion reduction in the projected federal deficit over 10 years , CBO said .
CBO noted that savings would be even greater if not for the fact that many states have already imposed their own changes .
CBO said about one - third of the states already have caps on noneconomic damages , and about two - thirds have imposed other measures being proposed at the federal level .
Because of this , CBO said , " a significant fraction of the potential cost savings has already been realized . "
Health Effects ?
It ’s still an open question whether limiting liability saves lives .
" Some recent research has found that tort reform may adversely affect such outcomes , but other studies have concluded otherwise , " CBO said .
The new UCLA / Rand study mentioned earlier found that a 10 percent reduction in costs related to medical malpractice liability would increase the nation ’s overall mortality rate by 0.2 percent .
It concluded that the savings in money would not be worth the cost in lives .
But another study published in the March issue of the Journal of Health Economics , by health economists from Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , concluded that " tort reforms " do n’t have any significant effect on patient outcomes .
So while there is now clear evidence that limiting malpractice liability can save money , it ’s not nearly as much as some proponents have claimed .
And on the question of whether patients would suffer , the jury is still out .

London , England ( CNN ) --
A letter written by Adolf Hitler in 1931 expressing hope for a " truly cordial relationship " between Britain and Germany was sold Tuesday , fetching £ 9,600 ( about $ 14,400 ) at an auction .
The buyer was not identified and no details were released about the transaction , in line with policy at Bonhams ' auction house in London .
The one - page letter was addressed to Sefton Delmer , a British journalist , in which Hitler expressed hopes of a new friendship between the two countries to replace the " unhappy war - psychosis " that existed after the First World War :
Hitler wrote the letter 16 months before he became chancellor and seized power in 1933 .
In the letter he said : " I hope ... that out of this crisis a new readiness will grow up in Britain to submit the past twelve years to a reappraisal .
I should be happy , if as a result of this the unhappy war - psychosis could be overcome on such a scale as to permit the realization of the truly cordial relationship between the British and the German peoples so eagerly desired by myself and my movement .
" For I believe that the crisis now breaking in on us can only be solved by the closest political collaboration of those nations who see in the re-establishment of a natural European balance of power the first precondition to dealing with those great world problems under which Britain too suffers today . "
Andrew Roberts , the British military and political historian , said the letter was a classic example of Hitler trying to lull Western democracies into a state of appeasement .
Roberts said Hitler was saying there were underlying interests between Britain and Germany and that he wrote many such letters .
" He refers to 12 years which would make it 1919 , the year the Versailles Treaty was signed ... appeasement was his central message until the outbreak of war .
Sefton Delmer would not have been taken in by any of this , " said Roberts .
Auctioneers at Bonhams in London said the letter has remained in Delmer 's family until now but they could not release the name of the person selling it .
Delmer was the Berlin correspondent of the Daily Express at the time when Hitler wrote the letter .
He was born in Berlin and spent the first 15 years of his life there before his family were expatriated to the U.K .
He is reported to be the first British journalist to interview Hitler , who he later described as a rather ordinary - looking man with hair that had been arranged too carefully .

America ’s two most beloved pastimes — baseball and listening to brawny white dudes yarl over vague approximations of “ rock ” — have long coexisted in harmony , but rarely have they converged as beautifully as Scott Stapp ’s new theme song for the Florida Marlins , “ Marlins Will Soar . ”
Pillaging his own “ You Will Soar ” ( from his 2005 solo release , The Great Divide — as if you needed us to tell you that ! ) ,
Creed 's front - poet pays tribute to what is apparently his favorite major - league baseball team in the whole wide world by reworking his already - inspirational lyrics into things that are both inspirational and vaguely baseball - related .
So that means taking verses like this :
“ I wish I could take you away
To a place of mystery
We will travel there on sands of time
To listen …to fairy tales
We will listen to fairy tales ! ”

And then transposing them to stuff about baseball , which Stapp apparently accomplished by simply thinking about random things that have to do with baseball , and then just singing those things .
Hey , why gild the lily ?
Here ’s a transcript :
Let ’s play ball , it ’s game day
We want strikeouts , base hits , double plays
Take the field , hear the roar of the crowd
Come on Marlins , make us proud

Keep hoping and dreaming and you will soar
With a little faith and love , you will soar
One strike , two strikes , swing away
A diving catch , a stolen base
A perfect game , a triple play
Another play - off race — YES !
World Series chance we ’ll [ unintelligible scream ]

The video adds even deeper shades of meaning by providing shots of baseball - related things , possibly even the very things that Scott Stapp is singing about , while he ’s singing about them .
After watching it , you should have little doubt that Scott Stapp is indeed singing about the Florida Marlins , a team that plays the game of baseball .

Three Democratic senators today asked the Federal Trade Commission to take a look at Facebook 's controversial new information sharing policies , arguing that the massively popular social network overstepped its bounds when it began sharing user data with other websites .
" We 've asked the FTC to promulgate some rules , " said Sen. Chuck Schumer .
The New York Democrat said the lines between public and private are blurring as cyberspace develops , but he said of Facebook 's new information sharing policy : " You know a violation when you see one and this is one of those . "
Information on private matters , such as sexual orientation , intended by Facebook users to be shared only among friends , might now find a wider audience , said Sens .
Al Franken , D - Minn. , and Michael Bennet , D - Colo. , at a Capitol Hill press conference with Schumer .
Franken said Facebook has changed its privacy rules " in midstream . "
The tools Facebook is providing users to opt out of the information sharing programs are needlessly complicated and hard to figure out , the senators contended .
" I could go into how you opt out but we only have so much time , " Franken said .
Facebook should change the rules so users have to proactively opt into the information sharing program , the senators said .
Schumer said he learned about the new rules from his daughter , who is in law school .
The senator said he 's noticed no difference on his own Facebook page , which , he assured reporters , " is very boring . "
" I can attest to that , " deadpanned Franken , who made his living as a comedian before entering the Senate .

Collins said that she supports some of the provisions in the bill but has concerns about the way Democrats have handled it , specifically their decision to cut off talks with Republican negotiators before a bipartisan deal was reached .
But Collins has declined to pledge in a public letter that she would vote to filibuster the reform bill unless Democrats make amends .
It is unclear if any other Republicans senators have declined to sign the letter .
Collins ’s stance is a significant setback to McConnell , who wants to force Democrats to return to the negotiating table .
A senior Democratic aide said that Reid will go forward with his plan to bring Wall Street reform to the floor next week .
A senior Republican lawmaker confirmed that McConnell had circulated a letter among fellow Republicans promising that the entire GOP conference would vote against a motion to proceed to the reform bill unless Democrats resume negotiations .
“ The only way we can get in the room is to show Democrats that they ca n’t ram a bill through the Senate , ” said the lawmaker .
A senior GOP aide framed it in a more benign way .
“ It ’s a letter urging a bipartisan approach to a final financial regulation bill , ” said the aide .
Collins may change her mind but without her support , Republicans have significantly less leverage to persuade Democrats to redraft the bill advanced by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) .
McConnell has taken a strong stance against Dodd ’s bill because he argues it would enable future bailouts of massive financial institutions .
“ Its authors claim that the bill gives the government the authority to wind down failing firms with no exposure to the taxpayer , ” McConnell said in a speech Wednesday .
“ But as a factual matter , the bill creates bailout funds , authorizes bailouts , allows for back - door bailouts from the FDIC , Treasury and the Fed , and even expands the scope of future bailouts . "
A GOP aide speculated that McConnell may soon approach Reid with his suggestions for improving the bill , even though McConnell is in a weaker position than if he had the votes to block it .

In a series of impassioned conversations , over the telephone and in the Oval Office , she conveyed her frustration to the president , according to four people familiar with the talks .
If she and Harry Reid , the Senate Democratic leader , were going to stick out their necks for Mr. Obama ’s top legislative priority , Ms. Pelosi wanted assurances that the president would too .
The President stuck out his neck .
He led the charge .
He dusted off his bully pulpit , outmaneuvered the hapless opposition ( 90 - minute Q&A , Blair House summit ) , and hammered the truth home at town - hall after town - hall .
And all the while , in the halls of Congress , the Speaker twisted & cajoled .
They became a tag - team of sorts .
" The two of them became real partners , " said one person close to both .
" The main thing was Pelosi sticking with it and doing the quiet work of bringing people back to saying , ‘ We ’re doing this , ’ " said John D. Podesta , a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton .
" It was almost illusionist , drawing your attention to something that is n’t important , so that you ’re not watching what ’s happening , which really is important . "
When the history of health care reform is written , President Obama 's name will be trumpeted , as well it should be , as the driving force that got the ball rolling , kept the ball rolling , and got it done .
But I for one will also remember another driving force -- one that helped shepherd this battered and bleeding sheep of a bill through the legislative slaughterhouse called Congress .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi .

Israeli police believe former prime minister Ehud Olmert is the prime suspect in a burgeoning corruption investigation surrounding a major property development in Jerusalem , the Israeli press reported today .
Olmert , 63 , cut short a trip to Europe and flew home yesterday in the face of growing questions about his role in the Holyland scandal , in which prosecutors believe hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes were paid during the planning and construction of apartment blocks .
Yesterday police arrested a former Jerusalem mayor , Uri Lupoliansky , in connection with the case .
He is being held on remand , together with six others , one of whom is a long - time confidant of Olmert .
None has yet been charged .
Israeli media said police believed Olmert was the main suspect , although they gave no formal comment on the case .
The case is focused on the time Olmert was mayor of Jerusalem , when Lupoliansky was his deputy .
Olmert was forced to step down as prime minister last year in the face of mounting corruption allegations and is being tried on separate corruption charges – although that trial was halted as soon as the Holyland scandal emerged this month .
Olmert has not been charged or questioned by police in the case and has protested his innocence .
" I reject the innuendo and the suspicions it implies .
They are baseless , " he said .
The Holyland towers , which are under construction , were built despite widespread local protest and , standing on a prominent hillside in the city , are widely seen as an eyesore .
According to Israeli press reports , police have found documents that appear to show massive bribes were paid over many years to allow the project to go ahead , allowing developers to benefit from reduced taxes and administrative fees and to avoid the usual planning restrictions .
Lupolianksy 's lawyer yesterday denied the allegations .
The body of a middle - age man was discovered near a capital region trail Sunday morning , the second in three days .
Saanich police closed portions of Colquitz River Park  around a footbridge and along the 3800 - block of Interurban Road  from about 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. while they investigated .
They have ruled out foul play and turned their investigation over to the B.C. Coroners Service .
Police would not comment on whether the death was a suicide .

The mans name will not be released until next of kin have been notified .
His was the second body found near the popular Galloping Goose Trail in less than 48 hours .
On Friday , West Shore RCMP discovered the body of a young woman near the trail bridge between Atkins Avenue and Wale Road .
That death was deemed a homicide and no arrests have been made .
Police said the deaths are not connected .

Michigan State Police guard a home , center rear , on Tomer Street in Clayton , Mich . on Sunday afternoon after an FBI raid of a home of a suspected militia leader .
Madalyn Ruggiero | The Associated Press
A local militia group that twice helped Washtenaw County sheriff 's deputies search for missing people had discussed killing a law enforcement officer , then attacking officers who attended the funeral , a federal indictment alleges .
Instead , militia members say the Hutaree militia group was raided Saturday night by federal law enforcement agents during a memorial service in the Ann Arbor area for one of its members .
Asked about that particular raid , FBI spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold said this afternoon , " I can't confirm or deny the events of the arrests . "
Berchtold said five arrests were made in the Washtenaw / Lenawee county area .
Nine members of Hutaree - described by authorities as an anti-government extremist organization - have been indicted on charges of attempting to use weapons of mass destruction .
All are in custody .
At least one member charged lives in Washtenaw County .
Hutaree members , who trained in Lenawee County , where the group has a small headquarters , " conspired to levy war against the United States , " the indictment says .
The indictments were unsealed this morning , two days after FBI agents conducted raids in southeast Michigan , Ohio and Indiana .
Among those charged are six Michigan residents , two Ohio residents and one Indiana resident .
According to the indictment , the leader of Hutaree , David Brian Stone ( known as RD ) , was plotting to kill an unspecified member of law enforcement , then attack law enforcement vehicles in the funeral procession motorcade with Improvised Explosive Devices ( IEDs ) .
Militia members say that Stone also is the group 's pastor .
According to the indictment , his son , Joshua Matthew Stone , provided materials to manufacture such devices .
David Stone had researched the devices on the Internet and emailed diagrams of them to someone he thought could build them , the indictment alleges .
Charged in the indictment are :
David Brian Stone ( RD ) of Clayton , Mich .
David Brian Stone Jr. ( Junior ) of Adrian ( the son of David Brian Stone )
Joshua Matthew Stone ( Josh ) of Clayton ( the son of David Brian Stone )
Tina Mae Stone of Clayton ( the wife of David Brian Stone )
Joshua John Clough ( Azzurlin ) of Blissfield
Michael David Meeks ( Mikey ) of Manchester Township
Thomas William Piatek of Whiting , Ind .
Khristopher T. Sickles ( Pale Horse ) of Sandusky , Ohio
Jacob J. Ward ( Jake ) of Huron , Ohio
All are charged with seditious conspiracy , attempting to use weapons of mass destruction and two counts possessing a firearm during a crime of violence .
Some face additional charges .
If convicted , they could spend the rest of their lives in prison .
The indicted suspects include ( clockwise from top left ) : David Stone Sr. , David Stone Jr. , Tina Stone , Joshua Clough , Jacob Ward , Kristopher Sickles , Thomas Piatek and Michael Meeks .
Joshua Stone , sought since the raids , was arrested tonight in Hillsdale County , the FBI said at 9 p.m.
Details of the arrest were not released .
Seven others are being held without bail after making their first appearances in federal court in Detroit this morning .
Arraignment and bond hearings for the seven were set for 1 p.m. Wednesday .
Local militia leader Jimmy Schiel told AnnArbor.com on Sunday that five Hutaree members were taken into custody during Saturday 's raid .
Eight Hutaree members were at the memorial service , he said .
Schiel , who is not a Hutaree member , did n't know who organized the service .
He was invited , but did not attend .
He spoke to a Hutaree member who was there , he said .
Donna Stone , 44 , of Adrian , divorced David Stone , Sr. three years ago after he started taking the movement too far , she said during an interview prior to today 's court hearing .
He lured her son , 19 - year - old David Stone , Jr. into Hutaree , she said .
" He dragged a lot of innocent people down with him , " she said .
" It started to get worse when they were talking about the world 's gonna end and the Bible . "
Law enforcement agents raided David Stone 's trailer in Dover Township in Lenawee County about 7 p.m.
Saturday , looking for bombs and explosives , she said .
The indictment says Stone established a rank structure for the unit and created words that only Hutaree members would understand for " various military formations and maneuvers . "
David Stone Jr.'s fiancee , Brittany Bryant , 18 , of Adrian , said at least 10 FBI agents raided her home Saturday night .
They told her to leave her 6 - month - old on the couch and come outside , she said .
" They had guns pointing at my head when I opened the door , " said Bryant , who also attended the court hearing .
" They were looking for weapons , documents , anything they could find for evidence . "

Stone 's ex-wife , cries as she talks to members of the media outside the federal courthouse on Monday .

Michael Meeks , of Manchester Township , was among three Hutaree members to participate recently in the search for a missing Bridgewater Township woman on Jan. 13 .
About six militia members assisted in that search after Bridgewater Township Supervisor Jolea Mull contacted Schiel and asked for help from the militia .
They worked with sheriff 's deputies , firefighters and other volunteers .
A Hutaree member also assisted in a search for a missing Bridgewater Township man on Feb. 17 .
AnnArbor.com reported Thursday that Hutaree members were involved in those searches .
Meeks ' family members could not be reached for comment on Sunday .
The indictment says Hutaree advocates violence against local , state and federal law enforcement .
Members are sometimes recognizable by their tiger stripe camouflage uniforms with a distinct shoulder patch that contains a black cross , two brown vertical pillars that form the letter " H " with the black cross , two red spears , a brown " V " shape at the base of the cross symbolizing the supporting hands of Hutaree , and the initials " CCR . "
At least four of the group 's members live in Washtenaw County , including three in Manchester Township .
Another member lives in Scio Township .
The unit trains with AR - 15s .
The group claims to have between 25 and 30 members .
It had a unit in Texas that disbanded a year ago that had at least six members , militia members said .
Since at least 2008 , members have been meeting regularly and conducting military - style training in Lenawee County to prepare for " war with their enemy , " the indictment says .
The documents describe enemies as state and local law enforcement officers who are deemed “ foot soldiers of the federal government , ” as well as federal law enforcement officers and anyone who does not share their beliefs .
According to the indictment , the group had also discussed , " killing a member of law enforcement after a traffic stop , killing a member of law enforcement and his or her family at home , ambushing a member of law enforcement in rural communities , ( and ) luring a member of law enforcement with a false 911 emergency call and then killing him or her . "
After the attack , Hutaree members would retreat to one of several " rally points " to wage war against the government and be prepared to defend with " trip - wired and command detonated anti-personnel improvised explosive devices , ambushes , and prepared fighting positions , " the indictment says .
That action , Hutaree believed , would serve as a catalyst for a more widespread uprising against the government , the indictment says .
According to the indictment , several Hutaree members attempted to travel to Kentucky for a summit of militia groups on Feb .
6 . David Brian
Stone solicited a person to provide four IEDs to take to the summit , the indictment alleges .
The indictment also alleges that Stone and David Brian Stone Jr. taught other Hutaree members how to make and use explosives .
This photo from the Hutaree website shows members training .
The training is held in secret locations and is closed to the public .
It 's unclear whether Hutaree was capable of executing any of their alleged plans .
The indictment does not detail what was recovered during the raids .
U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade of the Eastern District of Michigan said in a statement that the Hutaree had " planned a covert reconnaissance operation for April , which had the potential of placing an unsuspecting member of the public at risk . "
Because of the risk to the public and law enforcement , it " demanded intervention , " McQuade said .
According to the indictment , anyone who " happened upon the ( reconnaissance ) exercise " who did not comply with Hutaree members ' demands could be killed .
Michael Lackomar , a spokesman for the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia , which was not targeted in the raids , said today that there 's a " sense of relief " in the militia movement that the law enforcement operation appears to be limited to Hutaree .
He has received phone calls from militia members across the country who have been on alert , he said .
The raid has effectively dismantled Hutaree , he said .
" This is a devastating raid , " he said .
" Anybody that 's left from the group is probably gonna be keeping a low profile for a long , long time . "
Lackomar said he views Hutaree as a cult .
His group had a falling out with Hutaree in February 2007 , he said , because his unit 's members would n't follow Hutaree 's leaders .
" They wanted to take control of the militia movement as a whole , " he said .
" They wanted us to become subservient to their unit . "
The arrests come as watchdog groups including the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center have expressed concerns about the growth of the militia movement .
In the past year and a half , the number of militia groups in the United States has quadrupled to 200 , the ADL said .
The growth of the movement has been attributed to fears of economic collapse and the potential for a crackdown on gun rights under the Obama administration , watchdog groups say .
Andrew Arena , the FBI 's special agent in charge in Detroit , said in a prepared statement , " This is an example of radical and fringe extremist groups which can be found throughout our society .
The FBI takes such extremist groups seriously , especially those who would target innocent citizens and the law enforcement officers who protect the citizens of the United States . "

In the United States you 're not allowed to talk about class differences .
In fact , only two groups are allowed to be class - conscious in the United States .
One of them is the business community , which is rabidly class - conscious .
When you read their literature , it 's all full of the danger of the masses and their rising power and how we have to defeat them .
It 's kind of vulgar , inverted Marxism .
The other group is the high planning sectors of the government .
They talk the same way — how we have to worry about the rising aspirations of the common man and the impoverished masses who are seeking to improve standards and harming the business climate .
So they can be class - conscious .
They have a job to do .
But it 's extremely important to make other people , the rest of the population , believe that there is no such thing as class .
We 're all just equal , we 're all Americans , we live in harmony , we all work together , everything is great .
Sir Alex Ferguson today defended Manchester United 's transfer policy following the signing of the unheralded Mexican striker Javier Hernández .
In a tacit admission that the club were no longer prepared to splash out on big name players , the United manager said : " Players like Hernández we have been historically very , very good at developing .
This is what this club has always done .
" Every summer you will have big name players who are made available by agents .
Last summer it was [ Franck ] Ribéry and [ Karim ] Benzema . "
He said of Benzema , who eventually went from Lyon to Real Madrid for £ 25 m : " We were in for one as you know and at 21 he was the right age but as I said before we did n't think we would get value for the transfer fee . "
Ferguson said they moved now for Hernández because if he had had a good World Cup his fee , which was undisclosed , would have shot up .
The Guardian revealed today that United had turned down the chance to sign the prolific Spain striker , David Villa , 28 , who would have cost up to £ 40 m , because they felt they could not afford such a sum for a player looking for his last contract .
" Occasionally we do go into the transfer market for mature players , " insisted Ferguson . " [ Dimitar ]
Berbatov was 27 when he came to us but you have to ask yourself if when a 27 - year - old fulfils his contract for five years he will have little resale value . "
In today ’s Programming Praxis exercise we have to implement a Binary Search Tree .
Let ’s get started , shall we ?
We need two imports :
import Control .
Monad import System .
Random
The data structure is your run -of - the - mill binary tree .
data BTree k v = Node k v ( BTree k v ) ( BTree k v ) | Empty
Finding an element is pretty straightforward .
Just keep taking the correct branch until we exhaust the tree or find what we want .
find :: ( k -> k -> Ordering ) -> k -> BTree k v ->
Maybe v find _ _ Empty =
Nothing find cmp k ( Node k ' v ' l r ) = case cmp k k ' of EQ -> Just v ' LT -> find cmp k l GT -> find cmp k r
Inserting works the same way as find : move to the correct position and insert or replace the new value .
insert :: ( k -> k -> Ordering ) -> k -> v ->
BTree k v ->
BTree k v insert _ k v Empty = Node k v Empty Empty insert cmp k v ( Node k ' v ' l r ) = case cmp k k ' of EQ ->
Node k v l r LT ->
Node k ' v ' ( insert cmp k v l ) r GT ->
Node k ' v ' l ( insert cmp k v r )
Since the deletion algorithm calls for a random number , delete is an IO action .
You can consider using unsafePerformIO to hide this ( I did in my first draft ) , but I decided to stick with the honest , safer ( though less convenient ) version .
Alternatively you could accept the occasional imbalance and just always start on the left .
delete :: ( k -> k -> Ordering ) -> k -> BTree k v ->
IO ( BTree k v ) delete _ _ Empty = return Empty delete cmp k t@ ( Node k ' v ' l r ) = case cmp k k ' of EQ -> fmap ( flip deroot t . ( == 0 ) ) $ randomRIO ( 0 , 1 :: Int ) LT -> fmap ( flip ( Node k ' v ') r ) $ delete cmp k l GT -> fmap ( Node k ' v ' l ) $ delete cmp k r
For the deroot function we use a slightly different approach than the Scheme version .
I ’m not sure how that version deals with the case of one of the two branches being empty , but here they are explicitly included in the patterns .
The rot - left and rot - right functions are rewritten as patterns .
deroot :: Bool -> BTree k v ->
BTree k v deroot _ Empty = Empty deroot _ ( Node _ _ l Empty ) = l deroot _ ( Node _ _ Empty r ) = r deroot True ( Node k v l ( Node rk rv rl rr ) ) =
Node rk rv ( deroot False $ Node k v l rl ) rr deroot _ ( Node k v ( Node lk lv ll lr ) r ) =
Node lk lv ll ( deroot True $ Node k v lr r )
Converting the search tree to a list is trivial .
toList :: BTree k v -> [ ( k , v ) ] toList Empty = [ ] toList ( Node k v l r ) = toList l ++ ( k , v ) : toList r
And , as always , a test to see if everything is working correctly :
main :: IO ( ) main = do let t = foldr ( uncurry $ insert compare ) Empty $ [ ( n , n ) | n <- [ 4 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 2 ] ] print $ toList t print $ find compare 3 t print $ find compare 9 t print .
toList =<< foldM ( flip $ delete compare ) t [ 4 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 1 ]

In Washington , even a snowstorm is a political event .
The record snowstorms that have blanketed the capital and shut down cities across the Mid-Atlantic have already sparked a new round of sparring between supporters and skeptics in the global - warming debate .
As city residents trudge through blizzards and shovel out stranded cars , climate - change skeptics have been tossing verbal snowballs at those arguing that the planet is heating up and that human activity is to blame .
Myron Ebell , director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute ( CEI ) and a global warming skeptic , acknowledged that one weather event is not enough to prove or disprove the climate - change thesis , but noted that “ global - warming alarmists ” tend to take any severe - weather incident - heat waves , cold snaps , droughts and floods - as evidence supporting their position .
Mr. Ebell noted that the Washington area is enduring a colder winter than usual .
The region typically gets a lot of precipitation this time of year , but it does not typically produce such heavy snowfall .
On the defensive , climate - change experts dismiss the idea that a temporary cold snap and a pair of freakish snowstorms undermine what they say are clear long - term trends .
The severity of the recent weather , they say , in fact supports the global - warming argument .
Joseph Romm , senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and Jeff Masters , director of meteorology for the Weather Underground , a Web - based forecasting site , said in a teleconference for reporters Thursday that the recent weather patterns do not refute the global - warming thesis .
“ Scientific literature predicts that you will see more intense weather , ” said Mr. Romm .
Global - warming backers note that the same skeptics who point to Washington ’s snowfall rarely bring up the weather in Vancouver , where an unseasonably warm spell has complicated efforts to guarantee enough snow for some events as the Winter Olympic Games that open Friday .
“ It may in fact rain during the Olympics , ” Mr. Romm said .
He said global temperatures and trends have to be studied over the longer term to determine the possibility of global warming .
Those trends , he said , do show that the world is in the midst of a significant warming trend .
“ Weather is not climate , ” he said .
Added Mr. Masters ,
“ There is a huge amount of natural variability in the climate system . ”
But lawmakers on Capitol Hill who have questioned the climate - change theory have used the snow to make hay .
Sen. James M. Inhofe , Oklahoma Republican and perhaps the Senate ’s leading global - warming skeptic , took to the Senate floor Thursday to denounce the Obama administration ’s climate policies .
He noted during his remarks the igloo his family had built on the Mall .
The snow house bore the sign “ Al Gore ’s new home ” - a shot at the former vice president and leading climate - change activist .
Asked about the igloo later on Fox News , Mr. Inhofe observed , “ Some people just ca n’t take a joke . ”
Climate - change skeptics such as Mr. Inhofe have been on the offensive in recent months after a series of leaked e-mails showed leading climate - change researchers apparently discussing how to manipulate the scientific data to strengthen the case for global warming .
In another incident , a major U.N. study included a major error on the rate of glacier melting and had not been “ peer - reviewed ” by other scientists prior to its publication .
Mr. Romm defended the extensive U.N. study , while acknowledging the glacier - melting error had slipped through .
“ It is very difficult for [ the report ] to be error - free , ” he said , and argued the wealth of climate - change research being published indicate that the problem is real .
But CEI ’s Mr. Ebell said the recent incidents had contributed to a large loss of credibility for the global - warming theory .
“ These are claims that are being shown to be without scientific basis , ” Mr. Ebell said .

World 's cleverest man turns down $ 1 million prize after solving one of mathematics ' greatest puzzles
No need for greed : A rare photo of bearded and reclusive genius Dr Grigory Perelman
A Russian awarded $ 1 million ( £ 666,000 ) for solving one of the most intractable problems in mathematics said yesterday that he does not want the money .
Said to be the world 's cleverest man , Dr Grigory Perelman , 44 , lives as a recluse in a bare cockroach - infested flat in St Petersburg .
He said through the closed door : ' I have all I want . '
The prize was given by the U.S. Clay Mathematics Institute for solving the Poincare Conjecture , which baffled mathematicians for a century .
Dr Perelman posted his solution on the internet .
Four years ago , the maths genius failed to turn up to receive his prestigious Fields Medal from the International Mathematical Union for solving the problem .
At the time he stated : ' I 'm not interested in money or fame .
I do n't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo .
' I 'm not a hero of mathematics .
I 'm not even that successful , that is why I do n't want to have everybody looking at me . '
Neighbour Vera Petrovna said : ' I was once in his flat and I was astounded .
He only has a table , a stool and a bed with a dirty mattress which was left by previous owners - alcoholics who sold the flat to him .
' We are trying to get rid of cockroaches in our block , but they hide in his flat . '
It was in 2002 that Perelman , then a researcher at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in St. Petersburg , began posting papers online suggesting he had solved the Poincare Conjecture , one of seven major mathematical puzzles for which the Clay Institute is offering $ 1 million each .
Rigorous tests proved he was correct .
The topological conundrum essentially states that any three - dimensional space without holes in it is equivalent to a stretched sphere .
The puzzle was more than 100 years old when Perelman solved it - and could help determine the shape of the universe .
After 2003 Perelman gave up his job at the Steklov Institute .
Friends have been reported as saying he has resigned from mathematics altogether - finding the subject too painful to discuss .

The Dwarven Computer is finally complete !
I 've tested it and it functions as expected , though its performance is really lousy .
You can see my design manuscript at http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AdISzBuNg6ZWZGd0d2t4YjlfMjJ0ejlzc2dnaA&hl=en
This monumental build contains 672 pumps , 2000 logs , 8500 mechanisms and thousands of other assort bits and knobs like doors and rock blocks .
Point of Interest : Dwarven Computer ( 1036 Early Winter → onwards )
This shot shows you the overview of the computer 's pressure sensor deck .
All the pressure plates are installed on this deck for simplicity .
Most of the logic has been installed on the other decks .
Yellow gears represent gears that are disengaged by default .
Grey gears are not linked to any pressure plates .
Blue gears are engages by default .
Unfortunately I did n't have enough cobaltite to make all the blue gears on the upper deck so I used orthoclase instead .
This monumental build contains 672 pumps , 2000 logs , 8500 mechanisms and thousands of other assort bits and knobs like doors and rock blocks .
I believe this is the first programmable digital computer that anyone has built in DF .
I believe it is turing complete , for anyone who cares .

The Fed 's favorite house price indicator from First American CoreLogic ’s LoanPerformance ...
From LoanPerformance : Home Price Index Shows First Annual Increase in Over Three Years , But Shadow Inventory and End of Tax Credit Program May Result in Further Declines
National home prices , including distressed sales , increased by 0.3 percent in February 2010 compared to February 2009 , according to First American CoreLogic and its LoanPerformance Home Price Index ( HPI ) .
This was an improvement over January ’s year - over - year price decline of 0.5 percent .
Excluding distressed sales , year - over - year prices increased in February by 0.6 percent ; an improvement over the January non-distressed HPI which fell by 1.1 percent year - over - year .
On a month - over - month basis , the national average home price index fell by 2.0 percent in February 2010 compared to January 2010 , which was steeper than the previous one - month decline of 1.6 percent from December to January .
Prices are typically weak in the winter months , so seasonal effects may be driving this one - month change .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
After a modest increase this spring and summer , the national single - family combined index is projected to decline by 3.4 percent from February 2010 to February 2011 assuming the expiration of current Federal Housing Stimulus programs .
This graph shows the national LoanPerformance data since 1976 .
January 2000 = 100 .
The index is up 0.3 % over the last year , and off 30.6 % from the peak .
House prices are off 4.9 % from the recent peak in August 2009 ( although some of the decline is seasonal ) .
With all the distressed sales and government programs , it is hard to separate the seasonal factors from other distortions .
However I expect that we will see lower prices on this index later this year - as does CoreLogic ( from the press release ) :

Thanks to the increasingly absurd , bought - and - paid for Supreme Court , corporations are now people but real people can be declared Orwellian ' un - persons ' with but a stroke of a pen .
This is an unconstitutional power given POTUS by SCROTUS but has no basis in law .
Everything you were told in school with respect to the Bill of Rights , habeas corpus , the rule of law , the right to trial , the right to be confronted by your accusers -- all of that is by the boards , ' repealed ' , rendered moot , defunct with yet another idiotic , stupid and dead wrong decision by the most subversive , traitorous ' Supreme Court ' in history .
Moreover , the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that government officials are immune from lawsuits because -- at the time -- it was unclear whether abusing prisoners at Guantanamo was illegal .
Let me help them out on this one : every ' prisoner ' held in Guantanamo is held in violation of every treaty and international principle to which the U.S. is obliged .
This affront to the rule of law must not stand !
It is more repugnant than the so - called ' Intolerable Acts ' which motivated the colonial separation from England .
Can we have that revolution now ?
As everyone knows by now , SCROTUS recently declared corporations -- mere words on paper -- to be ' real people ' having rights that are NOW denied to you who are living , breathing real people .
This is intolerable and absurd .
The Supreme Court should be dismissed !
One wonders now what additional bullshit must the government try to pull over on us before it is declared illegitimate by a ' people 's tribunal ' and eventually replaced a real government representing REAL people not ' legal abstractions ' and the ambitions of the Military / Industrial complex ?
In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ’s refusal Monday to review a lower court ’s dismissal of a case brought by four British former Guantanamo prisoners against former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld , the detainees ’ lawyers charged Tuesday that the country ’s highest court evidently believes that " torture and religious humiliation are permissible tools for a government to use . "
[....]
Channeling their predecessors in the George W. Bush administration , Obama Justice Department lawyers argued in this case that there is no constitutional right not to be tortured or otherwise abused in a U.S. prison abroad .
The Obama administration had asked the court not to hear the case .
By agreeing , the court let stand an earlier opinion by the D.C. Circuit Court , which found that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- a statute that applies by its terms to all " persons " -- did not apply to detainees at Guantanamo , effectively ruling that the detainees are not persons at all for purposes of U.S. law .
The lower court also dismissed the detainees ’ claims under the Alien Tort Statute and the Geneva Conventions , finding defendants immune on the basis that " torture is a foreseeable consequence of the military ’s detention of suspected enemy combatants .
" -- US : Guantanamo Prisoners Not ‘ Persons ’ , Anti-War Dot Com
In Orwellian terms , an 'unperson is a person who has been vaporized perhaps not literally by the state but nevertheless robbed of his / her natural rights , records of ever having existed .
This erasure of personhood itself consists of removing all references to the person in existing books , the destruction of photographs , in fact , any documentary proof of existence at any time , i.e , no trace or evidence is to be found in the historical record .
Even close friends or relatives are ' expected ' to forget that an ' un - person ' ever existed .
The very mention of the unperson 's name becomes a ' thought crime ' .
The concept is not so far - fetched .
Consider the Stalinist practice of erasing from photographs the images of convicted ' enemies ' of the state .
That individuals -- real persons -- may be subject to this treatment by the ' state ' -- itself a mere abstraction -- is double - plus absurd and more so when corporations are given the rights that , by right , belong only to real , living , breathing , biological human beings .
Revolution now !
1984 might not have been late in arriving as is often thought .
It 's implementation may have been complicated but only temporarily delayed by the arrival of the internet .
Certainly , the Reagan administration was poised t9o concentrate , consolidate the conventional and broadcast media into very few and controllable hands .
But for the internet and independent blogs , it is this Reagan legacy of concentrated , biased right wing media that you would depend upon for information .
That should scare you !
If it does not , you 're reading the wrong article .
Meanwhile , we should not be surprised that the ' conventional ' media has yet to grasp the many harms done the world by Reagan , Bush and Bush .
The conventional media still speaks another language !
Newspeak ?
In George Orwell 's 1984 , life is lived in a state of perpetual war .
The U.S. has been at war in one form or another since the beginning of World War II .
In 1984 an oligarchical society is defined by it having voided the rights of citizens which it accomplishes with pervasive government surveillance , mind control , and a ' ministry of truth ' .
This has been accomplished in the U.S. with the repeal of the Communications
Act of 1934 which had established the recently defunct notion that the ' air waves ' are owned collectively by the people !
That is no longer the law of the land and consolidation of broadcastd and print media into very few hands is the result .
The internet , we suspect , will eventually be brought under the control of Big Bro , so enjoy it while you can !

There was a time when every other post on Clusterstock was a synopsis of commentary from a ‘ name - brand ’ economist .
There was a time when we all shared links to the latest pronouncements from Ivy League econ departments .
There was a time when countdowns were chanted into each PPI or ISM release .
And in the midst of all this armchair econophilia , a short , dark and handsome NYU professor with a name like a famous magician captured our hearts .
It was 2008 – and in our certainty about the lack of certainty , America fell in love with the new breed of Rockstar Economists .
As recently as a year ago , The Great Roubini ’s traveling prognostication show was pulling in 6 figures per engagement and publishers were hunting down any theorist with an oddly - colored animal to base a string of predictions on .
Economists were one - downing each other with plummeting targets on a host of surveys and measures in an effort to make Abelson ’s column or even earn a trip to Englewood Cliffs for a Squawk Box appearance .
A mythical , beard - stroking wizard named Charles Nenner was regularly appearing on CNBC , making ludicrous statements about his spoon - bending predictive powers with a straight face while the enthralled anchors strained to keep themselves from rubbing his head and making wishes .
The Rockstar Economists were photographed paparazzi - style with their arms around models , chillin’ hard at ski lodges from Aspen to Davos .
Their every email missive was blogged and tweeted and re-blogged and re-tweeted .
Each TV appearance was dissected and harvested for meme - worthy nuggets and the prophetic visions on which their brands had been built .
It was good to be an economist – some would even say it was sexy .
But no more .
We ’ve lost interest in the diviners of our economic destiny .
Because not only did most economists miss the crisis , they committed the even more pernicious sin of missing the recovery , essentially taking the Dismal Science to quadriplegic status from its prior condition of being merely hobbled .
Whether the future holds a double dip or an expansion , we ’ve learned that economists ’ tools and methods will hardly show us the path , let alone provide us with a coherent navigation .
Enough has been written on the failure of economics by those in a better position to critique the discipline than I .
I ’ll simply state that Economist Punditry is the Appendix of Financial Television – always there , normally harmless and almost completely ignored – until it explodes .
And like the treatment of appendicitis , most of the offending organs of television economics should be removed from the air before they can do any fatal damage .
I know how I spent my last few Thanksgivings – listening to my aunts and uncles debate the virtues of The Austrian School or quibble over the prospects of a successful Keynesian Solution to our current woes .
These are people who would n’t pick up a book about money unless Donald Trump was on the cover .
Something tells me the topic of this years ’ conversation will be quite different .
The public is no longer infatuated with academics dressed in bedazzled jumpsuits , throwing out targets like bingo numbers .
And we will not miss them .
A Bollywood filmmaker has issued a lucrative challenge to horror movie fans : a US $ 10,000 ( $ 11,200 ) reward for anyone who can watch his latest supernatural thriller , alone , in a cinema until the closing credits .
Ram Gopal Varma's Phoonk 2 , a sequel to his 2008 film of the same name , is about an evil spirit that traumatizes a family .
" Anyone who says the movie cannot scare him is going to be put in a theatre by himself , " Varma told reporters in Mumbai at an event to promote the movie .
Cheating taxi riders out of big bucks is way too E-Z .
Thousands of cabbies are ignoring their required E - ZPass tags , taking the snail ’s - pace cash lanes at the city ’s toll crossings — a ploy that jacks up riders ’ fares by an estimated $ 750,000 a year .
Meanwhile , taxi officials have dropped the ball on enforcing the E - ZPass requirement — costing the city millions more in lost fines .
MOST TAXI DRIVERS DO RIGHT THING , POST FINDS
For 10 consecutive workdays , The Post observed an average of 56 cabs taking the cash lanes at the Queens - Midtown Tunnel between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m .
“ This goes on all the time , ” one veteran tunnel officer said .
“ [ At ] the cash lanes , especially during rush hour , there could be a seven - minute wait .
That meter is ticking . ”
For duped riders , the result is a higher fare — a consequence some cabbies openly admitted .
“ How can we make money if we [ do n’t ] ? ” said Satish Kumar , after being confronted by an undercover reporter .
“ I ’m a new driver anyway , and I do n’t have E - ZPass , yet . ”
The Post took 12 undercover rides through the tunnel , and two of the drivers used the cash lanes .
One of the hacks , Registre Francois , insisted that his E - ZPass was “ not working . ”
“ I do n’t want to go through the trouble of getting it to work , ” he said .
At the MTA ’s five major bridges and tunnels , the cash toll is $ 5.50 , but the E - ZPass discount drops the price to $ 4.57 .
Either way , the customer pays the toll , which is figured into the final fare and ultimately increases the tip amount .
And then there ’s the indirect cost to riders — the one that cabbies profit from .
Waiting at the longer cash lanes during slow - moving traffic could cost a rider an additional 40 cents for each minute the cab is n’t moving over 12 mph .
Factoring in a seven - minute wait at a rush - hour toll plaza and a 20 - percent tip , a trip from Chelsea to Greenpoint using the Queens - Midtown Tunnel would cost a rider an extra $ 3.40 .
Using that figure , The Post calculated the total annual extra cost to riders whose cabs would take the most popular tolled crossings : the Queens - Midtown and Brooklyn - Battery tunnels and the former Triborough Bridge ( now called the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge ) .
It comes to $ 750,000 a year in overcharges — and that ’s just at those three crossings at rush hour during the five - day work week .
Lax enforcement compounds the problem , hurting the city ’s pocketbook because potential fines are n’t being collected .
If the Taxi and Limousine Commission hit only the 56 daily offenders spotted by The Post with a $ 50 fine , the city would rake in an additional $ 1,040,250 a year in revenue .
Taxi officials said they need to choose between enforcing the E - ZPass rule and others , such as the ban on cellphone use and regulations against refusing fares .
“ While our rotation of enforcement priorities does not allow us to be at the bridge and tunnel plazas every day , we get to them as often as we can , and our targeted operations are effective , ” said TLC spokesman Allan Fromberg .
Hacks have a host of excuses for not using E - ZPasses .
“ The biggest one is ‘ I got stuck in the cash lane , ’ ” said Lt. Mike Friscia , a veteran TLC enforcement officer .
“ But that ’s rarely the case . ”
At a recent TLC cash - lane enforcement sting on the RFK Bridge , a team of officers nailed 50 drivers from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m .
“ Sounds like a rip - off , ” said one of the scofflaw cabbies ’ passengers , Adam Mincham .
“ I just came off a long flight and was looking to get home . ”
The driver , Rafel Polanco , was sent a summons in the mail .
He claimed his E - ZPass transponder was broken .
Another scammed rider , a California tourist , figured out the ruse when her driver was pulled over .
“ It helps them charge a bigger tip ! ” she said .

This undated photo provided by the National Park Service shows Iceberg Lake at Glacier National Park , Mt. Scientists on Wednesday , April 7 , 2010 said that Glacier National Park has lost two more of its namesake moving icefields to climate change , which is shrinking the rivers of ice until they grind to a halt .

( AP ) -- Glacier National
Park has lost two more of its namesake moving icefields to climate change , which is shrinking the rivers of ice until they grind to a halt , a government researcher said Wednesday .
Warmer temperatures have reduced the number of named glaciers in the northwestern Montana park to 25 , said Dan Fagre said , an ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey .
He warned many of the rest of the glaciers may be gone by the end of the decade .
" It 's continual , " Fagre said .
" When we 're measuring glacier margins , by the time we go home the glacier is already smaller than what we 've measured . "
The meltoff shows the climate is changing , but does not show exactly what is causing temperatures to go up , Fagre said .
The park 's glaciers have been slowly melting away since about 1850 , when the centuries - long Little Ice Age ended .
They once numbered as many as 150 , and 37 of those glaciers eventually were named .
A glacier needs to be 25 acres to qualify for the title .
If it shrinks any smaller , it does not always stop moving right away .
A smaller mass of ice on a steep slope would still continue to grind its way through the Rocky Mountains .
Glacier melting has accelerated in recent decades as global temperatures have increased .
Over the past century , Glacier National Park 's mean summer temperature has risen by about 3 degrees Fahrenheit .

Most zombie survival plans involve barricading yourself up or climbing to the top of a structure and destroying the stairs .
Well have fun starving to death in a fog of rotting stench while the dead shriek at you .
Above all , you want to stay mobile .
If zombies are on the move , a properly - balled person can smash through a small crowd of them .
If you let them pack in around you , you 're either in a machine gun nest or about to die .
It 's fun to think of places to loot , but the truth is , once the city 's employees are undead , no one is around to put out fires .
And if your city is n't on fire , that 's because the people who work the flood control facilities are also undead and it's now underwater .
Basically , once you hear a newscaster say anything remotely close to " rabies victims " or " the attacker was earlier declared dead by doctors , " get the fuck out of the city .
You can take the highway , but only if you want to spend three days in traffic and then several years as a living corpse trying to bite people from your seat belt .
This is really the sweet spot of any apocalypse -- you against a world of zombies .
You should n't have to worry so much about food if you 're out and mobile .
Food will be everywhere since no one is alive to eat it .
Practically every structure you come across will be the scene of a less successful Last - Man - on - Earth and stocked with their overly ambitious food supply .
Do n't worry about ammunition either .
Even if you were lucky enough to get to the shooting range or the gun store before everyone else thought of it , you 'll be out of bullets long before the zombies are out of zombies .
Also , if anyone tells you they can stare down an army of undead and isolate headshot targets , keep asking them questions .
I have a feeling they also have a 25 - inch dick and they once crashed their motorcycle and swear - to - God flew 300 feet .
While John Rambo up there is using his gun to call nearby swarms of walking dead , you 'll want something more along the lines of a crowbar or a hatchet .
They can destroy an undead skull , fit in one hand and are handy for other things like going through doors and barricades .
Practical advice aside , you 'll really want to make it your own .
Get crazy with it .
Without electricity or other humans , all you have to do is read the occasional book and kill the dead .
Above all , do n't stare at your belt and contemplate suicide like a masturbating celebrity .
Build an elaborate trap or make a list of objects that you have n't killed zombies with yet .
The best final thought you can have is , " That would have been so awesome if it had worked .
" Robots control when our toilets flush , when our paper towels are dispensed and how graham crackers are made .
Our toys have been smarter than us for years : my Tivo knew I 'd like
“ The law is so inflexible , ” said Judge Corriero , now executive director of Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City and the author of “ Judging Children as Children : A Proposal for a Juvenile Justice System . ”
The 2006 book calls for a justice system that reduces future crime rates by nurturing those who can learn from their mistakes , instead of turning them into career criminals .

That was his aim , he said , when he presided over the special court known as the Manhattan Youth Part , his views shaped by his own childhood .
The son of a longshoreman and a factory seamstress , he grew up in a tenement across the street from the Tombs — the Manhattan House of Detention — and was schooled by both Roman Catholic missionaries in Chinatown and the Mulberry Street Boys .
While he avoided serious trouble , he saw how easily a careless choice could lead to culpability instead of accomplishment .
The neighborhood pressures were not so different decades later , when Mr. Wu hung out at video arcades while his mother worked long hours in a garment factory and his father cooked at Chinese restaurants out of state .
A friend from that period recalls seeing a shoe print on the teenager ’s back from a street beating .
He looked to his pals for self - defense that turned predatory .
In December 1995 , he and two other teenagers , one of them pretending to have a gun , took a jacket from a young boy .
In two episodes in April 1996 , he and others robbed elderly men of money , knocking one down and punching another ; he took part in a fourth mugging that June , records show .
“ I ’m sorry and I really hope that you will forgive me for all the pain and trouble I made them go through , ” the teenager said when he was sentenced .
The judge called the case a tragedy , according to the court transcript .
“ But this is not the end , ” he told the youth , who had scored in the 98th percentile in mathematics .
“ This is really the beginning of a new period for you .
I want you to educate yourself .
Continue to read , follow the rules . ”
“ You will want to get a job and become a meaningful , constructive member of society to help your family , ” he added .
“ I will be there to make sure that you can . ”
These authors are all geniuses just based on their works alone .
When you consider they invented words within those novels that are now in our day - to - day vernacular " ¦ well , it 's enough to make a humble blogger feel a little inadequate .
1. " Bump "  first appeared in Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet .
Shakespeare coined a ridiculous number of words , actually , although some historians and linguists think certain words just get attributed to Shakespeare even if he did n't really invent them .
2. " Runcible spoon "  was created for The Owl and the Pussycat by author Edward Lear .
He had no particular meaning for the word runcible " “ Lear also referred to " a runcible hat , "  a " runcible cat , "  a " runcible goose "  and a " runcible wall . " 
But since it has entered somewhat common vernacular , " runcible spoon "  sometimes refers to a grapefruit spoon , a spork , or a sort of flattened ladle ( which is what it looks like in the illustration that accompanies the poem ) .
3 . The same goes for the vorpal sword from Alice in Wonderland .
Actually , Lewis Carroll is famous for his invented words .
He does n't quite have as many under his belt as Mr. Shakespeare ( if you can believe all of those ) , but other words that were n't in our dictionaries until they were pulled out of his head include chortle , galumph and burble .
4 . According to at least one source , Jane Austen invented the phrase " dinner party . " 
5 . If you have a Tween in your life , you can thank J.R.R .
Tolkien that you have something to define them with .
In The Fellowship of the Ring , Tolkien claimed a Tween was a Hobbit between the ages of 20 and 33 ( 33 being when Hobbits come of age ) .
There 's some debate as to whether the word existed prior to this reference or not , however " “ the Oxford English Dictionary does not give him credit .
6 . It 's long been believed the name " Wendy "  did n't exist until J.M. Barrie pulled it out of thin air for Peter Pan , however , it was definitely used as a nickname for " Gwendolyn "  prior to Barrie 's tale about the boy who would n't grow up .
It 's safe to say that the name started to become quite popular and common post - Peter .
7 . It may be hard to believe , but the word " quark "  first appeared in James Joyce 's Finnegans Wake .
Scientist Murray Gell - Mann had been thinking about calling the unit " kwork , "  but when he found the invented word in the Joyce classic , he knew he had discovered the spelling he wanted to use .
Here 's what he had to say about it :
In 1963 , when I assigned the name " quark " to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon , I had the sound first , without the spelling , which could have been " ˜kwork ' .
Then , in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans Wake , by James Joyce , I came across the word " quark " in the phrase " Three quarks for Muster Mark " .
Since " ˜quark ' ( meaning , for one thing , the cry of the gull ) was clearly intended to rhyme with " ˜Mark ' , as well as " ˜bark ' and other such words , I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as " ˜kwork ' .
But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker .
Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once , like the " portmanteau " words in " ˜Through the Looking - Glass ' .
From time to time , phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar .
I argued , therefore , that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry " ˜Three quarks for Muster Mark ' might be ' Three quarts for Mister Mark ' , in which case the pronunciation " ˜kwork ' would not be totally unjustified .
In any case , the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in nature .
8. " Nerd "  may be a common insult ( or term of endearment , depending on your tone , I suppose ) these days , but before Dr. Seuss published it in 1950's
If I Ran the Zoo , people had to make do with " square "  and " drip "  instead .
At least , they did according to Newsweek , which ran an article in 1951 defining the new slang term .
9 . I bet if you think about " nymphet "  long enough , you can come up with the book it came from .
I 'll give you a second " ¦ lalala .
OK , time 's up .
It 's Nabokov 's Lolita of course .
Here 's where it first appears in the book : " Now I wish to introduce the following idea .
Between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who , to certain bewitched travelers , twice or many times older than they , reveal their true nature which is not human , but nymphic ( that is , demoniac ) ; and these chosen creatures I propose to designate as " ˜nymphets . '
10 . I would n't be writing this if cyberspace did n't exist , so I guess in a roundabout way , I have sci - fi writer William Gibson to thank .
I mean , sort of .
He did n't invent cyberspace itself , obviously , just the word for it .
It first appeared in his novel Neuromancer in 1984 .
The Biggest Celebrity Losers
Even celebrity home prices have hit rock bottom .
1. Suzanne Somers Was : $ 35 million Now : $ 12.9 million Along with hubbie Alan Hamel , Somers has been working on this huge , 65 - acre desert compound outside Palm Springs since 1977 .
" Les Baux de Palm Springs " mixes the charm of the French countryside with Hollywood touches like Zebra skin rugs ( lots of 'em ) and massive chandeliers .
Even after dropping the price by more than $ 22 million this property is still on the market , with the current price " available upon request " .

2. Nicolas Cage Was : $ 35 million Now : $ 17.5 million
Are there any mega- celebrities out there who live in simple , tasteful homes ?
Certainly not Nicolas Cage , whose old - Hollywood tudor in Bel Air reminds us of the sprawling Xanadu compound from " Citizen Kane " .
Actually , it 's not so much the house as the crap it 's filled with .
Anyone want a life - sized Mickey Mouse ?
How about a boulder - sized amethyst geode ?
The good news is that the property is now being offered at a 50 % discount .
Anyone got seventeen - and - a - half million bucks lying around ?
UPDATE : Is this house about to be auctioned off on the courthouse steps ?
Has Cage defaulted on his mortgage ?

3. Eddie Murphy Was : $ 30 million Now : $ 14.99 million Eddie Murphy 's seven - bedroom Englewood , NJ mansion known as " Bubble Hill " may be only ten minutes outside of Manhattan , but that does n't mean he 's had an easy time finding a buyer .
Bubble Hill has been on the market for at least 5 years .
Pro : it 's got a bowling alley and a recording studio .
Cons : $ 200 k a year in property taxes .
UPDATE : Looks like this house keeps dropping !
12.75 million and falling fast .

4. Mel Gibson Was : $ 39.5 million Now : $ 29.5 million Another celebrity gets divorced , another mega-Tudor hits the market !
This Greenwich , CT mansion was designed by architect Charles Lewis Bowman and built in 1926 .
It 's actually a very tasteful home ( we 're glaring at you , Nic Cage ) , if you can get over the fact that Mel Gibson has a reputation for being a huge prick .
You know you 're a jerk when you drop the price of your house by $ 10 million but still nobody wants to buy it .
UPDATE : Looks like somebody finally bought this place , though the purchase price remains undisclosed .

5. Hugh Hefner Was : $ 27.995 million Now : $ 18 million
Why did it take nearly 6 months and a ten million dollar price drop to sell this home ?
Are there not enough wealthy , single men out there who would pay almost anything for a pimp shack adjacent to the Playboy Mansion ?
Let me repeat that : you can literally stroll over to the Playboy Mansion in your silk pj's for a round of Texas Hold ' Em with the bunnies .
We truly live in strange times .

6. 50 Cent Was : $ 18.5 million Now : $ 10.9 million Mike Tyson. 50 Cent .
You .
What , you do n't think you can fill shoes that big ?
50 Cent reportedly spent $ 10 million on renovations alone fixing up this Farmington , CT mega-mansion that he purchased from Mike Tyson 's ex-wife .
I guess there are n't many people looking for 52 rooms ... one real estate agent went on record saying he'd be surprised if this place sells for more than $ 5 million .

7. Richard Gere Was : $ 17.995 million Now : $ 11 million
It 's no secret that Julian Schnabel 's Palazzo Chupi units at 360 West 11th Street in Manhattan 's West Village have sold poorly .
( The units that have sold at all ! )
Only one big - name sucker took the plunge : Richard Gere .
But the star of " Pretty Woman " and " Chicago " never even moved in before the apartment was re-listed at nearly $ 18 million .
More than a year - and several price drops - later , the place finally sold for $ 11 million .

8. Burt Reynolds Was : $ 15 million Now : $ 8.995 million
This old stallion may not regularly trim his famously thick body hair , but he certainly knows how to trim the asking price on his Hobe Sound , FL mansion .
The listing has already dropped by about 40 % , but without a buyer look for it to continue heading southward .
This Mediterranean - style compound borders a wildlife refuge , so watch out for alligators if you take a tour .

9. Meg Ryan Was : $ 19.5 million Now : $ 14.2 million Unlike Meg Ryan 's reconstructed nose , her 1931 Spanish - style estate is practically flawless .
A real movie star house , with ocean views and all that good stuff .
Celebrity couples David & Victoria Beckham and Ben Affleck & Jennifer Garner reportedly took tours of the house , but no one was willing to fork over nearly $ 20 million .
For $ 5 million less , though , it 's hard to believe that this house is going to be on the market for very long .

10 . Alex Rodriguez Was : $ 14.9 million Now : $ 10 million A - Rod had to drop the price of his Trump Park Avenue apartment by $ 4 million before it sold , but even a price drop of nearly $ 5 million on his Coral Gables home has n't lit a fire under buyers ' checkbooks .
Why sell ?
Looks like Rodriguez is trying to focus on baseball for once , rather than his well - known extracurricular activities .
Or maybe the price of a hot dog and a beer at the new Yankee Stadium is just a little too steep ?

11 . Dylan McDermott Was : $ 11 million Now : $ 6.9 million
By all accounts a beautiful residence , McDermott has had major trouble selling this Spanish hacienda - style home in Brentwood , even with a steep price cut .
McDermott picked up the house back in 1999 from Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas , who bought it in 1997 from Michelle Pfeiffer and David E. Kelly ( creator of " The Practice " , in which McDermott had a starring role ) .
I 'm not saying I 've got the cash , but I 'd love to live in this house .

12 . Elle Macpherson Was : $ 15.5 million Now : $ 12.2 million
The falling price on this seven - story Notting Hill , London residence proves that even the UK is being hit hard by the housing crisis .
The Victorian property was built in the 1850s and has six bedrooms .
It was first listed in the summer of 2008 .

13 . Curt Schilling Was : $ 8 million Now : $ 5 million
This house has a history of selling for less than what its sports superstar owners would like to charge .
When Drew Bledsoe owned this Medfield , MA home he tried to unload it for $ 9 million , but eventually had to settle for $ 4.5 from fellow Boston - area hero Curt Schilling .
Schilling had been trying to get rid of it for $ 8 million , then dropped the price to $ 5 million .
Update : the price has dropped again to $ 4.5 million .
I guess that 's really what this house is worth ?

14 . Dan Marino Was : $ 15.9 million Now : $ 13.5 million Marino never won a Super Bowl , and he is n't much of a real estate champion either .
He 's been trying to unload his Weston , FL compound for nearly four years , dropping the price and throwing in freebies like $ 1.5 million worth of designer furniture and a signed football .
A signed football ?
Wow !
That 's worth , like ... four hundred bucks .

The jury took less than two hours to clear Harvey A teacher who struck a pupil with a dumbbell has been acquitted of attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent .
Peter Harvey , 50 , hit the 14 - year - old with a 3 kg ( 6.6 lb ) weight at All Saints ' Roman Catholic School , Mansfield , in July 2009 , a jury heard .
The boy , who said he could not recall the attack , suffered a fractured skull .
The science teacher had previously admitted a charge of causing grievous bodily harm .
Harvey had returned to work after being signed off with depression and stress for several months .
But the court heard he had been mocked by pupils moments before the attack .

The jury at Nottingham Crown Court took less than two hours to clear the father - of - two .
Afterwards , a spokeswoman for Harvey told a media conference the teacher said he " wanted to thank people for the tremendous report we have received " .
" They include many past pupils , friends , neighbours and members of St John 's church .
I want to thank my wife and family for their love and care . "
The court heard that he shouted " die , die , die " as he bludgeoned the boy with the weight after the pupil swore at him .
It emerged during the four - day trial that pupils at the school were trying to wind up Harvey so his reaction could be caught on a camcorder being used secretly by a girl in the class .
The footage was then to be passed around the school as a way of " humiliating " the teacher .
' Common sense '
His lawyer argued Harvey was in such a state when he battered the boy , a known trouble - maker , he could not have possibly intended to kill or seriously harm him .
The judge said he would not send the teacher to jail for grievous bodily harm without intent - which he had admitted .
Harvey spent eight months on remand awaiting trial before being bailed earlier this month .

Years of abuse led teacher to attack Teachers ' face fight with stress '
Call to control mobiles in school Judge Michael Stokes QC said : " Common sense has prevailed now we have heard all the evidence . "
Turning to Harvey , the judge said : " I 'm not going to send you to prison for this offence .
" I 'm not even going to impose a suspended sentence .
" That would be wrong given that you have already served a sentence longer than can be lawfully suspended . "
He added : " This court is looking to impose a community order which will assist you with the problems that you have had . "
After the attack Harvey , who had just gone back to work after several months off with stress , told police he thought he had killed the boy .
Transcripts of an interview with detectives were read out in court .
Harvey said : " I can't remember it too well but I do recall it was like watching it on television , like it was not actually happening to me .
" I can remember the boy swearing and when that happened I was not really there . "
' Really peaceful '
Harvey added : " We went through the door into the prep room and I remember standing over him with this metal weight and I remember hitting him twice .
" Something happened and I 'm sure I dropped it .
I remember feeling really peaceful . "
Harvey bowed his head as the jury of six men and six women returned its unanimous verdict of not guilty .

After hearing the judge 's comments , he left by a side exit and will return to court to be sentenced for grievous bodily harm on 21 May .
Afterwards , Ch Insp Paul Winter , of Nottinghamshire Police , described the investigation as " extremely complicated " , needing to be handled in a " highly sensitive way by officers with specialist skills . "
He added : " We acknowledge the decision of the jury and hope that today 's verdict will bring some degree of closure to all those involved and allow them to move on with their lives . "
Rob Skelton of Nottinghamshire County Council said : " This was a very difficult case but it was highly unusual .
" Schools are normally very safe places .
What occurred was out of the ordinary and totally unexpected , particularly in this school which enjoys a good reputation locally . "
He added that the governing body of All Saints School would now deal with Mr Harvey 's employment issues under its own internal procedures .

In order to keep myself accountable , I have a half - session with a personal trainer once a month to take my weight and measurements , so I can better track my efforts as I work toward getting myself into better shape .
While my lifestyle is fairly healthy overall , it could still use some improvement , and I am trying to get rid of a pesky 7 pounds .
Instead of relying on exercise myths to help me achieve my desired level of fitness , though , I asked my personal trainer , who also has certifications in exercise science and in nutrition , what I could do to have more effective workouts .
Here are 10 things she told me I could do to increase the benefits I get from exercising :
Increase the intensity :
When you start out , it is best to begin with a low - intensity workout .
However , as you build your endurance , you should up the intensity of your workout .
You will see better results , especially in terms of weight loss with a moderate to high intensity aerobic workout .
Limit your workout length :
You do n’t need to work out in 60 minutes chunks .
Indeed , my trainer says that it ’s better to work out at a higher intensity for 20 to 30 minutes .
She says not to go beyond 40 minutes in a work out session , since beyond that the benefits are n’t as great .
Slow lifting : Instead of releasing quickly after lifting slowly , release slowly as well .
You should concentrate more on your form , and on working the muscles .
Maximize your moves by counting to five for each direction .
You should also gradually add weight and reps as you are able , being careful to avoid so much weight that your form suffers .
Combine exercises : Instead of just doing one exercise at a time , look for ways to combine , so that you can get a full body workout in one session .
For instance , you can combine bicep curls with lunges .
You can also do exercises like push - ups and dead lifts and rows that work more than one muscle group at a time .
Circuits :
If you do reps , do n’t do them all at once .
Instead of doing a rep , resting , and doing another rep , do other exercises in between .
Allow your muscles some recovery time by doing a rep , moving on to another exercise , doing a rep , moving on to a third exercise , and so forth .
Moving from exercise to exercise in a circuit can actually help you add a touch of cardio to your strength training as well as increase the effectiveness of your weight lifting .
Add an element of balance : Instead of sitting down , or using something to help you remain stable , you can add an element of balance .
Try doing over the head lifts with hand weights on one foot , switching feet as you switch arms .
You can also incorporate a stability ball or board into your workout , forcing you to work your core muscles along with the rest of your body .
Mix up your routine :
Your body gets used to the same things .
Every few weeks change your routine .
You can also mix things up during the week .
I do strength two or three times a week , as suggested by my trainer , and cardio three or four times a week .
Find exercises that you enjoy , and rotate them in .
I like swimming , but I vary the cario routine with stationary bike , belly dancing and kickboxing .
Stay hydrated :
Make sure you are getting plenty of water throughout the day .
Drinking a great deal just before you exercise is not the best option , since it can take two hours for your body to absorb the water .
You can take sips throughout your workout , though .
But your best bet is to get in the habit of drinking water throughout the day .
Do n’t neglect the protein : Many people forget the importance of protein .
If you are working out , you need to have the amino acids that provide building blocks for muscles .
While you do n’t need to eat a ton of protein , you should make sure you are getting some from lean sources , like legumes , fish and chicken .
You can also get protein from shakes .
Eat carbs :
If you want the energy to do workouts that are more effective , you need some carbs .
This does n’t mean that your workout will be enhanced by a bunch of sugar , though .
Good nutrition from carbs means focusing on fruits and vegetables and whole grains for most of your carb sources .
If you drink a protein shake , add a banana , which is a great source of healthy carbs .
Finally , my trainer recommends that I incorporate some sort of flexibility exercise every day — just five or 10 minutes .
I like to do yoga , but there are other regimens you can do .
And do n’t forget the rest and relaxation ( or meditation ) can also help your body ’s overall effectiveness as a system .

DETROIT --
Being nominated for the Lady Byng Trophy implies that the player is passive and not overly physical .
That is not the case with Detroit Red Wings forward Pavel Datsyuk , who has managed to combine the criteria of “ sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct ’’ along with an element of grit to dominate the balloting for the award in recent years .
Datsyuk was named a finalist again Wednesday .
He has an opportunity to become the first player in NHL history to win the trophy in five consecutive seasons .
With his lightning quick hands , Datsyuk has become a master of stripping opponents of the puck without drawing many penalties .
He has a penchant for throwing his shoulder into would - be checkers to maintain puck possession .
He had only 18 penalty minutes , along with 27 goals and 70 points , in 80 games in the regular season .
Martin St. Louis of Tampa Bay and Brad Richards of Dallas are the other finalists .
The winner will be announced June 23 at the NHL Awards Show in Las Vegas .
Only one other player , Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers , has won the award four years in a row ( 1927 - 28 to 1930 - 31 ) .
Boucher won it seven times in eight seasons .
Detroit goaltender Jimmy Howard is expected to be named a finalist Thursday for the Calder Trophy as top rookie .
On Friday , Nicklas Lidstrom has a chance to be a finalist for the Norris Trophy as best defenseman , which he has won six times .
Greetings producer - led Fold !
I ’d just like to let everyone know that I like Conan WAY better than Leno .
Always have .
I ’d also like to let everyone know that Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindoff have done a fine job with LOST , with or without Abrams .

The world 's smallest microlaser
( Nanowerk News ) ETH - Zurich physicists have developed a new kind of laser that shatters the boundaries of possibility : it is by far the smallest electrically pumped laser in the world and one day could revolutionize chip technology ( " Microcavity Laser Oscillating in a Circuit - Based Resonator " ) .
The centerpiece of the new microlaser is the electric resonator , consisting of two semi-circular capacitors that are connected via an inductor ( here , a scanning electron microscope image ) .
The color intensity represents the strength of the electrical field ; the color itself , the respective polarity .
( Photo : ETH Zurich )
It took a good one and a half years from the idea to its inception ; a time when Christoph Walther , a PhD student in the Quantum Optoelectronics Group at ETH Zurich , spent days and nights in the FIRST lab .
This was because ETH Zurichs state - of - the - art clean - room facility provided him with the ideal conditions to set a new record in laser technology : the physicist teamed up with four colleagues and developed the smallest electrically pumped laser in the world to date .
Much smaller than the wavelength
It s 30 micrometers long  that s 30 millionths of a meter  eight micrometers high and has a wavelength of 200 micrometers .
This makes the laser considerably smaller than the wavelength of the light it emits  a scientific first .
After all , lasers normally cant be smaller than their wavelength , the reason being that in conventional lasers light waves cause an optic resonator to oscillate  much like acoustic waves do to the soundbox of a guitar .
In doing so , the light waves basically travel back and forth between two mirrors .
The principle only works if the mirrors are larger than the wavelength of the laser .
Consequently , normal lasers are limited in terms of their size .
Other researchers have endeavored to push the boundaries ;
 But by developing a completely new laser concept we were able to go quite a way below the limit , says Christoph Walther .
Inspired by electronics
In developing their laser concept , Christoph Walther and some of his team mates under his supervisor Jérôme Faist , professor and head of ETH Zurichs Institute of Quantum Electronics , were inspired by electronics .
 Instead of the usual optic resonators , we use an electrical resonant circuit made up of an inductor and two capacitors , explains Walther .
The light is effectively captured  in it and induced into self - sustaining electromagnetic oscillations on the spot using an optical amplifier .
Had sex .
Those two little words can sure elicit a reaction depending on when and where they 're uttered .
But what does " had sex " mean , anyway ?
It seems that no one knows .
In a new study from the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University , researchers found no consensus on what " had sex " means .
They conducted a random , telephone survey of 204 men and 282 women living in Indiana .
The respondents ranged in age from 18 to 96 .
Most were heterosexual .
Though 95 % said penile - vaginal intercourse was having sex , 11 % said it was n't sex if there is no ejaculation .
Thirty percent said that oral sex was not having sex .
Twenty percent said anal sex was not having sex .
Among older men ( age 65 and older ) , 23 % did not consider penile - vaginal intercourse to be sex .
" There 's a vagueness of what sex is in our culture and media , " said Dr. William L. Yarber , a co-author of the study , in a news release .
" If people do n't consider certain behaviors sex , they might not think sexual health messages about risk pertain to them . "
The confusion over what constitutes sex is also a problem for researchers working in the area of sex education and sexual health .
" The essence of misclassification is simple -- people are either incorrectly classified as having sex or incorrectly classified as not having sex , " the authors wrote .
Misclassification can cause some problems in interpersonal relationships , too -- if you know what I mean .
The study is published in the current issue of the journal Sexual Health .

" Freedom " has long been a right - wing rallying cry for self - identified patriots ranging from John Birchers to tea party protesters to increasingly extreme members of the Republican establishment .
They 're particularly passionate about the freedom to own and openly carry guns and freedom from federal taxation ( but not necessarily federal benefits ) .
Otherwise , their most consistent attachments to freedom tend to be rhetorical , unless freedom means restricting reproductive choice , same - sex relationships , medical marijuana , or sexually explicit speech and permitting discrimination against people who do not acknowledge Jesus as their savior .
For some prominent conservatives -- like John McCain , Mitt Romney , Sarah Palin , and Dick Cheney -- freedom also entails the establishment of a national security state empowered to arrest and imprison summarily people suspected of terrorism and to spy on people suspected of nothing in particular , thanks to a ubiquitous but largely invisible surveillance system .
There are , of course , exceptions to this statism .
The CATO Institute , generally associated with the right because of its commitment to free markets , is equally , if less notoriously , committed to civil liberty .
CATO is unusual in its consistent libertarianism , which means , however , that ( like Reason magazine ) , it is a creature of neither the right nor the left .
A recent CATO report estimates that some 14 percent of Americans also qualify as libertarian , meaning that they 're fiscally conservative and socially liberal ( although it 's unclear if fiscal conservatives who believe " the less government the better " are willing to surrender their own government benefits , from Pell grants to Medicare ) .
Libertarians are labile voters , " torn between their aversion to the Republican 's social conservatism and the Democrat 's fiscal irresponsibility , " CATO asserts ; they shifted away from George Bush in 2004 and toward John McCain in '08 .
McCain was an odd choice for libertarians considering his abysmal record on civil liberty .
" Straight talk for me but not for thee , " might have been his motto ( to paraphrase Nat Hentoff ) ; he was no friend of the First Amendment , supporting a constitutional amendment banning flag burning , restrictions on indecency as well as political speech , and declaring America a Christian nation .
That libertarians preferred him to Obama suggests that fiscal conservativism ( or at least the image of it ) was more important to them than social liberalism , or civil liberty .
Before assuming the presidency and adopting key Bush - Cheney national security policies , Obama looked like a civil libertarian ; indeed his claim to civil libertarianism was a lot stronger than the claims of Bush - era Republicans to fiscal conservatism .
But libertarians focused on government spending are not likely to turn left .
What if they focused on the increasingly powerful national security state ?
They 'd find opposition to it ( however ineffectual ) from liberal Democrats , outnumbered by centrists in their own party as well as Republicans .
Smeared as freedom hating socialists , Nazis , or terrorist sympathizers , liberals ( and some Democrats ) are generally more critical of the imperial presidency ( even with a Democrat in the White House ) than their opponents on the right .
Food blog Cheap , Healthy , Good is all about stretching food frugality very , very far , while keeping the meals tasty and leftover - friendly .
An older post illustrates how one roast chicken can make 17 meals for a total of $ 26 .

Blogger and serious home economist Kristen Swensson bought a 7 - pound Purdue roaster chicken for $ 6.92 , less than $ 20 worth of other supplies over a week , and gave herself some rules for cooking dinners and lunches .
Swensson went for no repeats or very similar dishes on the menu , used as many pantry goods as possible , and tried to add as little fat as possible to the plates .
How'd it turn out ?
Victory , for the most part .
I ended up cooking five distinct , delicious , largely healthy dinners with PLENTY of leftovers .
And miracle of miracles , there were no duds in the group .
( Thanks , online reviewers ! )
However , I did go $ 0.86 over budget .
I 'm okay with that , though .
Between what we consumed each night and ate for lunch the next day , that $ 25.86 made 17 full meals , which works out to $ 1.52 each .
That 's less than a cup of Starbucks coffee , so … aces .

Enthusiast motherboards have been sporting an increasing number of PCI Express x16 slots lately , so this was bound to happen .
Expreview has nabbed a photo of an upcoming Gigabyte motherboard with nothing but physical PCIe x16 slots in its expansion area .
The image reveals a GA - X58A - UDP7 model number between the last two slots , but Expreview refers to the board as the GA - X58A - UD9 .
In either case , you can probably expect to see this puppy at the very top of Gigabyte ’s lineup .
In addition to the PCIe x16 slots , we can spot six DIMM slots , no less than 10 internal Serial ATA ports , and a prodigiously large network of heatsinks and heat pipes that covers much of the rest of the board .
We would n’t be surprised if the I/ O area included eSATA connectivity on top of all that , although the photo only shows a top view of the board .
Oh , and unsurprisingly , Gigabyte has received certification for both CrossFire and SLI multi-GPU configurations .
Considering the sheer number of PCIe slots , those big heatsinks may well be concealing at least one of Nvidia ’s NF200 PCI Express chips , which would imply support for three - way SLI configs .
We ’d wager that not all of the physical PCIe x16 slots on the motherboard have a full 16 lanes of connectivity running through them , however .

Monkeys pay more attention to females than to males , according to research .
Scientists studying wild vervet monkeys in South Africa found that the animals were better able to learn a task when it was demonstrated by a female .
The team compared animals ' responses to demonstrations of a simple box - opening task , which was demonstrated either by a dominant male or female monkey .
Their findings are described in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Biologist Erica van de Waal , from the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland , and her team , studied six neighbouring groups of wild vervet monkeys in South Africa 's Loskop Dam Nature Reserve .
They gave the monkeys boxes containing fruit , which had doors on each differently coloured end .
During an initial demonstration , the researchers blocked one of the doors , so there was only one correct way to solve the box - opening puzzle and access the fruit reward .
In pictures : Monkeys pay more attention to females
For three of the groups , a dominant male monkey was selected as a " model " to demonstrate the task and for the other three a dominant female was chosen .
" The models learned by trial and error how to open the box , " explained Ms van de Waal .
" Once they understood how to pull or slide the door open we let them perform 25 demonstrations . "
After this " demonstration phase " , the other monkeys were far more likely to try - and to succeed in - opening the fruit box if their demonstrator was a female .
" We found that bystanders paid significantly more attention to female than male models , " said Ms van de Waal .
" [ This ] seemed to be the only factor influencing this social learning . "
Social bonds
Watching and learning from dominant females could be advantageous for the monkeys .
While males tend to wander and find mates in other groups , females usually return to the group in which they were born .
" Females are core group members with higher social status than males , and more knowledge about food resources in the home range , " explained Ms van de Waal .
She said the results revealed valuable insights into " the evolution of traditions and culture in species living in stable groups , including humans " .
" To our knowledge , [ this is ] the first experimental field evidence for social learning in primates , " she added .
" Experiments on social learning have been conducted mainly in captivity and it is time to know if the results are the same on wild animals . "

During a special media event held today in Cupertino , Apple unveiled details about the next major update to the iPhone OS that powers its iPhone , iPod touch , and iPad mobile devices .
Slated to arrive sometime this summer for the iPhone and iPod touch , the update will give developers access to over 1,500 new APIs to improve and extend the capabilities of their apps , as well as give users over 100 new features like multitasking and improved enterprise support .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs detailed seven major new features that he described as " tentpoles " for the OS .
Addressing the number one request of most users is a new app multitasking system .
Jobs explained that implementing multitasking is easy if battery life and application performance is n't a concern , but Apple has taken its time to develop a system that it says avoids these common pitfalls .
" We were n't the first to this party , but we 're going to be the best , " Jobs said .
Multitasking
Senior vice president of iPhone software engineering Scott Forstall offered up more details .
Apple looked at thousands of apps to determine what services apps would most need to keep running while in the background .
" In iPhone OS 4 , we 're providing those services as APIs to developers , " Forstall said .
That way , iPhone OS can manage those services to best optimize battery life and performance .
Pandora founder Tim Westergren was on hand to demonstrate a version of Pandora that took advantage of these APIs , showing off one of the most sought - after uses for multitasking .
Westergren played streaming music from Pandora while switching over to iTunes to buy a song he liked , and the stream kept playing as he shopped .
Other potential uses for background processes were demonstrated or discussed , such as keeping Skype active to receive VoIP calls , or allowing GPS apps like TomTom to continually track your location .
Forstall also discussed an alternative to continuous GPS tracking , which can wear down the battery .
An app such as Loopt or Foursquare can register to be notified when an iPhone detects that it has switched to a different cell tower .
The app can then be activated and the GPS hardware polled for your new location .
Noting privacy concerns , Forstall revealed a system - wide notification that reveals which apps have requested location data .
That will prevent any app from using your location data without your knowledge , and should discourage any developer from trying to do so .
In addition to audio , VoIP , and background location , Forstall also discussed some other background services that developers can add to their apps such as push notifications , local notifications , task completion , and fast - app switching .
This last feature lets any application freeze its state so that it idles without using any CPU resources .
When the app is switched back to the foreground , it continues running as if nothing happened .
Folders
Apple detailed some new features for the iPhone OS 's Springboard launcher .
You can add custom backgrounds for both the lock screen and the home screen , just as you can on the iPad .
For those with a growing library of apps looking for a new way to organize them , iPhone OS now has folders .
Apps can be dragged on top of each other to create a folder , and other apps can be added .
Folders can be placed in the Dock for quick access to a group of apps , as well .
With folders , users can cram up to 2,000 apps onto their devices .
Mail
Mail will get a number of longed - for improvements in iPhone OS 4.0 .
Apple has finally added a unified inbox to Mail , so those of you setting up multiple e-mail accounts on your iPhone can see all your mail at once without switching accounts .
Business users will likely applaud the ability to add more than one Exchange account .
And Apple made switching between different inboxes much faster .
Other improvements include a threaded message view , which keeps related replies together , and the ability to open mail attachments if you have an app installed that can handle a particular file type .
iBooks for the iPhone and iPod touch
Apple is also making a version of iBooks that will work on iPhone and iPod touch .
It 's essentially a miniature version of iBooks for iPad , replete with the bookshelf and access to the iBookstore .
You 'll be able to access the same library of books from any of your iDevices , and bookmarks and last pages will wireless sync between them .
Enterprise
Jobs noted that 80 percent of Fortune 100 companies are using iPhones in some way with the blessing of their IT departments .
One new enterprise - friendly goody coming in iPhone OS 4.0 is new data encryption features .
Users will be able to encrypt their e-mail and attachments using a PIN code .
And developers will have an API to encrypt data within their own apps .
i Phone OS 4.0 will also give IT admins mobile device management , and they 'll be able to distribute apps wirelessly to mobile devices without relying on iTunes syncing .
In addition to multiple Exchange account capabilities , Apple is adding Exchange Server 2010 support .
And there 's also support for SSL - encrypted VPN sessions with Juniper and Cisco infrastructures .
" Game Center "
Apple is building its own " social gaming network , " akin to Open Feint and Ngmoco 's Plus+ , that developers can include support for in their games .
In addition to leaderboards and achievements , it will offer a standardized way for players to " challenge " each other to best one another 's scores .
Apple is including a feature to automatically find other players of similar ability with a particular game , sparing novices the embarrassment of being trampled by a more experienced player .
Open Feint , Plus+ , and other networks have a dedicated following among some developers ( and certainly many players ) , so whether or not Game Center will see wide adoption is uncertain .
But during a Q&A following the presentation , Jobs noted that developers had asked for Apple to develop its own social network .
" There 's no money to be made and no advantage to us to having a social gaming network , so everyone should just say ' great , less work for me ' , " he said .
iAd
Jobs spent a good chunk of the event discussing the seventh " tentpole " — a centralized mobile ad network called ( as rumored ) " iAd . "
Developers will have APIs to add support for ads into their apps , and Apple ( via its acquisition of Quattro Wireless ) will handle all the necessary ad sales .
The ads will help support free apps , and developers will get an " industry standard " 60 percent of ad revenue .
Jobs noted that Apple will soon have as many as 100 million mobile devices running iPhone OS in the wild , offering as many as 1 billion advertising opportunities per day .
" This is a pretty serious opportunity , " Jobs noted , while saying that a lot of current mobile advertising " just sucks . "
Jobs said that iAd will offer advertisers a way to add the " emotion " that video ads on TV often have , but that Web and mobile advertising currently lacks .
That includes building interactive ads using HTML5 , CSS3 , and JavaScript .
He then demoed ads that Apple built to show off what iAd could do , including ones for Toy Story 3 , Air Jordans , and Target .
Perhaps the best announced feature of iAds , though , is that it does n't take you outside of the app you 're using to view the ads .
Dismiss the ad whenever you want , and you 're right back where you left off .
Availability
i Phone OS 4.0 will be available this summer for iPhone and iPod touch .
The latest devices — the iPhone 3GS and the 3rd - gen iPod touch — will get all the features mentioned today and more .
The previous generation — iPhone 3G and 2nd - gen iPod touch — should get " most " of the features , but unfortunately that does n't include multitasking ( Boo ! ) .
The original iPhone and iPod touch will get nothing and like it .
i Pad owners , which already have a few of the features in iPhone OS 4.0 , will be able to upgrade in the fall .
Developers can download a preview of iPhone OS 4.0 starting today , to get access to the 1,500 new APIs and begin the process of adding support for the new features before 4.0 launches this summer .
Other tidbits
During the announcement , Jobs also briefly detailed some impressive sales numbers for the first few days of the iPad 's availability .
So far , Apple has sold 450,000 iPads .
Users have purchased over 3.5 million iPad apps and 600,000 e-books from the iBookstore .
The number of iPad- specific apps in the App Store is over 3,500 and counting .
During the Q&A session , Jobs reiterated Apple 's position on adding Flash or Java support for its mobile devices .
In a word , " no , " it 's not happening .
The iPad also came up .
The response to the iPad has been " beyond belief " according to SVP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller .
Jobs said that he received several thousand e-mails praising the device , and that he is n't worried about competitors moving in anytime soon , either .
" If our competitors ever produce a competitive product to iPad , they 'll be hoping they can get 3,500 apps after the first year , and we 've seen that in less than a week , " he said .
In its efforts to keep Congress funding huge military budgets in the 1980s , the Reagan administration exaggerated the threat from the Soviet Union ’s military projects , newly published documents show .
Documents posted online Thursday at the National Security Archives chronicle a Soviet physicist ’s efforts to dispel claims about the USSR ’s secretive weapons programs by bringing US officials to Russia to examine top - secret weapons sites .

Those tours , which took place around 1987 , “ showed that the Reagan administration had exaggerated Soviet capabilities and also that the Soviet military machine was not as technologically advanced as had been thought , ” the National Security Archives stated in a press release .
Those documents were first brought to light in a recent book by David E. Hoffman , The Dead Hand .
The book chronicles the Soviet effort to build a system for an “ automatic retaliatory nuclear strike on the United States . ”
But , as the released documents show , that effort , as well as other weapons programs , were never near fruition .
The National Security Archives states :
The Pentagon published a glossy annual booklet , Soviet Military Power , a propaganda piece designed to help boost congressional support for ReaganÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s military spending .
The fourth edition , published in April , 1985 , contained the claim that the Soviets had Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ two ground - based lasers that are capable of attacking satellites in various orbits .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â In Soviet Military Power , the Pentagon included an artistsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ conception , a black - and - white pencil sketch , showing what purported to be the Saryshagan proving ground .
A building with a dome on top was shown firing a white laser beam into the heavens [ see picture above ] .
“ In fact , the long , expensive search to build laser weapons against targets in space had , up to this point , totally fizzled , ” the Archives press release states .
“ The Soviets had not given up hope , but the glossy Pentagon booklet took old failures and hyped them into new threats . ”

Many historians argue that the Reagan administration ’s hyping of the Soviet threat and its efforts to build the space - based Strategic Defense Initiative ( “ Star Wars ” ) amounted to a “ bluff ” that was nonetheless successful in pushing the Soviet Union into backing off from the Cold War .
The newly - released documents show just how truly incapable the Soviet Union was of matching US military power , despite its ambitious projects .
The documents show that Soviet physicist Yevgeny Velikhov , who had brought US officials to a number of Soviet military sites , had tried to persuade the central committee of the Communist Party to allow Americans to tour the testing facility at Saryshagan , which was at the heart of US claims about a Soviet space missile plan .

The documents show the Soviet government rejected the request , but not because it was trying to hide a major new military capability .
Rather , “ the American visitors would quickly realize the Soviet equipment was really quite old , ” the National Security Archives state .
“ The only thing to hide at Sary Shagan was the painful truth : Soviet technology was way behind . ”
Mr. Gardner ’s lawyer , Andrew Parnes , said he would make a new appeal to the State Supreme Court , which previously upheld the death sentence , arguing that his client did not receive proper help with experts and research before his sentencing and that execution after such a long wait would be cruel and unusual punishment .

Mr. Gardner also has the right within the next seven days to ask the Board of Pardons to commute his sentence to life in prison .
For decades , Utah let condemned prisoners choose whether to die by hanging or the firing squad , then more recently between lethal injection and a firing squad .
In 2004 , the Legislature ended the practice , making lethal injections standard .
But to avoid legal complications , the state has allowed pre-existing prisoners who had selected the firing squad to remain with that option if they want .
Mr. Gardner picked the firing squad at the time of his initial death sentence in 1985 .
In two later court appearances he seemed to have had a change of heart , switching his choice to lethal injection .
But in 1996 — the same year that the last prisoner in Utah , and the country , was executed with bullets — he said he had switched only out of concern for his children , who were then young , and that he had always preferred death by gunfire .
“ I like the firing squad , ” he told The Deseret News at the time .
“ It ’s so much easier ... and there ’s no mistakes . ”
In a telephone interview Friday , Mr. Parnes said that he would not comment on Mr. Gardner ’s reasons for “ his personal decision . ”
Bill Watterson is a celebrity , known for his drawings of the impish Calvin and his sidekick stuffed tiger friend , Hobbes .
But before he became wildly famous for his cartoon strip , he drew editorial cartoons for Sun Newspapers in the early to mid 1980s .
When I became editor in 1983 of several east side editions of Sun , the retiring editor introduced me to Bill one day , when he walked into the newspaper office to hand in his weekly drawing .
For the next two years while I was there , he dutifully drove from Chagrin Falls to the newspaper office in Solon .
We rarely spoke , although he was always pleasant .
Sometimes he just dropped off the cartoon with the receptionist .
None of us guessed back then that his career would take off like a 747 , although those of us in the newsroom agreed that he had exceptional talent .
His cartoons were frequently funny and sometimes poignant .
Occasionally they rubbed readers the wrong way .
We were sorry to see Bill leave our fold but were thrilled to see his Calvin and Hobbes characters become household names .
Luckily , we were able to retrieve some of his drawings that he did for Sun from our microfilm archives .

Ford Motor Co. is getting ready to retire the full - sized Crown Victoria sedan and , with it , the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor that is the most widely used police car in America .
Ford is n't about to give up on that market and all the sales -- and the prestige -- that it brings .
So it has unveiled an all - new Police Interceptor to replace the venerable Crown Vic in 2011 .
The new Police Interceptor , a variation of the full - sized Taurus sedan , will be a front - or all - wheel drive car powered by a choice of two V6 engines .
Ford promises its police customers wo n't want for power or performance , though , but they will save money on gas compared to the big rear - wheel - drive Crown Vic. Competition 's already heating up .
General Motors is getting ready roll out the Chevrolet Caprice PPV , a police - only model imported from Australia , and a start - up company , Carbon Motors , is preparing its own diesel - powered police - specific model .
Click through the gallery for more on how the new Ford Police Interceptor stacks up .
The MPAA and RIAA have submitted their master plan for enforcing copyright to the new Office of Intellectual Property Enforcement .
As the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Richard Esguerra points out , it 's a startlingly distopian work of science fiction .
The entertainment industry calls for :
spyware on your computer that detects and deletes infringing materials ;
mandatory censorware on all Internet connections to interdict transfers of infringing material ;
border searches of personal media players , laptops and thumb - drives ;
international bullying to force other countries to implement the same policies ;
and free copyright enforcement provided by Fed cops and agencies ( including the Department of Homeland Security ! ) .
There 's a technical term for this in policy circles .
I believe it 's " Totally insane . "
There are several technologies and methods that can be used by network administrators and providers … these include [ consumer ] tools for managing copyright infringement from the home ( based on tools used to protect consumers from viruses and malware ) .
In other words , the entertainment industry thinks consumers should voluntarily install software that constantly scans our computers and identifies ( and perhaps deletes ) files found to be " infringing . "
It 's hard to believe the industry thinks savvy , security - conscious consumers would voluntarily do so .
But those who remember the Sony BMG rootkit debacle know that the entertainment industry is all too willing to sacrifice consumers at the altar of copyright enforcement .
The Entertainment Industry 's Dystopia of the Future

A humanoid robot will visit space for the first time in September aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery , NASA announced Wednesday .
The Robonaut 2 , which was co-developed by NASA with General Motors , will serve as an assistant to the humans on board the International Space Station , using the same tools developed for astronauts .
While plain old robots , such as the Mars Phoenix Lander , are a major part of NASA 's operations , humanoid robots are a different story .
There is significant science - fiction appeal to the idea of humanoid robotic helpers for humans , but does the idea makes more than literary sense ?
Yes , said Jeffrey Hoffman , an MIT aerospace professor and former astronaut .
" I'm a very strong believer in human - robotic interaction .
You can build up a synergy to accomplish what neither humans nor robots could accomplish on their own , " Hoffman said .
" That 's the inspiration behind Robonaut . "
Many successful robots , like Kiva 's product - distribution robots or the military 's little helpers look nothing like humans .
And some space researchers like MIT historian and policy analyst David Mindell do n't think humanoid robots are a very good idea .
But the International Space Station may be the perfect place for a humanoid robot .
" It 's incredibly important that Robonaut have a humanoid form factor because he 's being sent into space , and it 's incredibly expensive , and he has to do a lot to pay himself off , " said former roboticist Daniel Wilson ( author of How to Build a Robot Army ) .
" It has to be able to pick up any tool that an astronaut could use and go outside . "
Wilson argued that space was a uniquely good environment to showcase both the versatility of people and a general - purpose humanoid robot .
" You can't bring a tool to solve every single problem .
There 's no way .
Astronauts can't haul all that shit up there .
It 's like , ' I have a screwdriver and my brain , and I need to solve the problem , and I do n't know what the problem is before I leave the planet , ' " Wilson said .
" You can use the humanoid to leverage all those tools . "
James Hughes , who studies emerging technologies at Trinity University , suggested that humanoid robots may provide a nice middle ground between hardcore human spaceflight evangelists and those who would rather see robotic missions .
Most space watchers feel that the human programs are what drives interest and funding in exploration , while scientific investigation will be driven by robots .
" A humanoid robot splits the difference .
You get some of the advantages of both and hopefully it will be a nice compromise between the two , " said Hughes .
" But it may not satisfy either side . "
The Robonaut project began in 1996 and the first version of the bot came out in 2000 .
In 2006 , NASA 's Dexterous Robotics Laboratory at Johnson Space Center teamed up with GM to design the new robot .
" It is very safe to say that the United States and NASA possess the state of the art in robotic dexterity , " said Nic Radford , the Robonaut deputy project manager .
" The ideas are limitless . "
The bot will be phased into operation in three stages .
First , it 'll operate only from a fixed position inside the International Space Station .
Then , it 'll be allowed to move about inside , and finally within a few years , it will be allowed to do extravehicular activities .
" It 's really going more to an autonomous system , " Radford said .
" Right now , it has a task - based system built up of behaviors .
We program in a task and based on the sensory input that it receives , it 's able to make decisions on what it 's going to do next . "
The opportunity to test on the robot in orbit has Radford , Wilson and Hoffman excited .
" This has been a dream of our group for a long time , " Radford said .

The NTSB emailed a press release about 1 PM PDT today stating “ NTSB has launched an investigation to determine why a commercial jetliner and a small light airplane came within an estimated 300 feet of colliding over San Francisco on Saturday . ”
While much of this event has been made by news media , a review of the San Francisco tower tape shows that both aircraft were in contact with the tower and followed their instructions .
Transcripts of the ATC audio suggests that neither aircraft was in danger , though the aircraft may have been a little closer to each other — a loss of separation in FAA parlance — than permitted .
Note : I 've edited the ATC audio to remove non-relevant communications .
[ Follow - up article : New NTSB Rules May Increase Reports of Near Mid-Air Collisions ] .
The rules for separation vary depending upon where an aircraft is located .
These aircraft were both operating in the Class B airspace that surrounds San Francisco and other large airports .
In Class B airspace , VFR aircraft , such as the light plane , must be separated from jet aircraft by one of the following three criteria :
1. 1 1/2 miles horizontal separation , or
2. 500 feet vertical separation , or
3. Visual separation .
In this case , the controller was relying upon # 3 visual separation .
Once the rules for visual separation are met , aircraft are allowed to come as close to each other they would like , as long as they do not collide with each other .
In this case , whether there was a loss of separation depends upon whether the controller completed the requirements for visual separation before the aircraft came within 500 feet vertically of each other .
The NTSB should be able to make this determination after they compare audio transcripts with aircraft radar tracks .
The instructions for controllers to establish visual separation are as follows :
A pilot sees another aircraft and is instructed to maintain visual separation from the aircraft as follows :
( a) Tell the pilot about the other aircraft including position , direction and , unless it is obvious , the other aircraft 's intention .
( b) Obtain acknowledgment from the pilot that the other aircraft is in sight .
( c) Instruct the pilot to maintain visual separation from that aircraft .
(d) Advise the pilot if the radar targets appear likely to converge .
NOTE -
Issue this advisory in conjunction with the instruction to maintain visual separation , or thereafter if the controller subsequently becomes aware that the targets are merging .
(e) If the aircraft are on converging courses , inform the other aircraft of the traffic and that visual separation is being applied .
( f) If the pilot advises he / she has the traffic in sight and will maintain visual separation from it ( the pilot must use that entire phrase ) , the controller need only “ approve ” the operation instead of restating the instructions .
At San Francisco , the light aircraft was at approximately 1500 feet when the tower controller advised its pilot “ 70 Echo , Traffic off the departure end climbing out of 500 heavy triple 7 . ” The light aircraft advised that it had the Boeing 777 in sight and the controller instructed “ Maintain visual separation , pass behind that aircraft . ”
Once that conversation was completed , the controller established visual separation between the aircraft and they were then legally permitted to come as close to each other as they chose .
At issue however , will be whether the controller completed his conversation with the light aircraft before it came within 500 feet vertically of the United Boeing 777 .
If the aircraft were less than 500 feet apart before he completed the conversation establishing visual separation , than he probably had what controllers call “ a deal , ” an error which led to aircraft coming closer together than permitted .
If he completed the conversation in time , than it seems unlikely that any rules were broken .
Note that a 777 typically climbs out at about 2,500 feet per minute .
Thus if the controller truly initiated the visual separation instructions when the 777 was at 500 feet , he had 12 seconds to complete the conversation before the aircraft reached 1000 feet .
So if no rules were broken , why was the event reported ?
According to the NTSB , the United aircraft ’s TCAS unit issued a conflict resolution .
This occurs when it detects a potential collision and issues instructions to climb or descend .
Any time a conflict resolution is issued , United company rules require the pilot to file a report to the company ’s Flight Safety Awareness Program within 24 hours .
Those reports are reviewed within a week by company management , the pilot ’s union and the NTSB .
And that is probably what triggered the current investigation .
I ’ve attached my transcript of the audio below .
Note that today ’s NTSB press release incorrectly stated that the light plane was “ an Aeronca 11 AC ( N9270E ) , ” and this mistake is being repeated in most news reports .
According to a pilot I contacted who was familiar with the incident , the light aircraft was actually N9870E , a Cessna 182 , which is confirmed by the San Francisco tower audio .
I exchanged email with the NTSB public relations department today and they replied that they will notify the NTSB investigator assigned to the case .
In the transcript , SFO tower is the tower controller .

My Times in Black and White : Race and Power at the New York Times by Gerald M. Boyd , with an afterword by Robin D. Stone Lawrence Hill , 402 pp. , $ 26.95
Gerald Boyd was a classic specimen of the self - made man .
Born poor , he worked and studied his way up out of poverty under the guidance of his widowed grandmother .
Childhood was work and study , study and work , and though they do not always guarantee success , for Gerald Boyd they did just what movies , books , and professional moralizers said they would do , probably because his widowed grandmother contributed a lot of wisdom , love , and iron to the self - making ; and in his early fifties Gerald Boyd became managing editor of The New York Times .
This was the second most important job in the newsroom of one of the world ’s better newspapers .
He was the first black ever to reach such a dazzling position in the Times hierarchy , and the gaudiest job of all — the executive editorship — seemed within his reach almost until the very moment he was fired .
The firing occurred in the spring of 2003 in a bizarre seizure of office politics , and , as such things will , it left Boyd anything but well disposed toward his former employer and colleagues .
He has written a good book filled with ill feeling toward the Times , many of its editors , and a variety of colleagues who turned against him under pressure or simply because they wanted him to fail and be damned .
Written during the three years between his firing and his death from cancer in 2006 , the book is now published posthumously with the help of his wife , Robin Stone .
Lovers of newspaper gossip will find it delightfully indiscreet about self - serving treacheries hatched in the newsroom by people simultaneously engaged in high - minded pursuit of all the news that ’s fit to print .
Times folk , especially of the management class , will not be delighted by his account of their awkward struggle with the race problem or Boyd ’s suggestion that bigotry was one of the causes of his downfall .
There were other causes , however , and when all are combined , they present a picture of a runaway newsroom that left the paper ’s top editorial caste — and even its owners — suddenly powerless to control events .
In the plainest possible terms , what happened in the newsroom was a successful workers ’ uprising against the bosses , in which the workers won and the bosses were humiliated .
What may strike the reader as oddest of all about the several curiosities of this rebellion is that it had almost nothing to do with the paper ’s editorial policy or its news coverage .
When it was over , the Times ‘s news management had changed hands , but the paper went right on being the same New York Times it had been before .
What had happened was not a revolution of ideas , but …
Cats are famous for their relaxing effect on people , but in a country like Japan , where space is an issue , having a pet is problematic .
That ’s when cat cafes come into play .
For a modest fee of between $ 5 and $ 8 Japanese animal lovers can enjoy their usual coffee surrounded by dozens of playful cats .
Spending an hour in the company of cats can work wonders on the human mind , and when you ’re as stressed as Japanese business - men , even more so .
Many of them ca n’t fit a household pet into their busy schedules , so they opt for a relaxing one - hour break in the company of purring felines .
It might seem like an oddity to us , but ever since the first cat cafe opened in 2004 , in Osaka , this sort of establishment has become mainstream in Japan .
While you can pet the cats and pay with them , you must obey a very simple set of rules regarding hygiene .
In order to prevent infection OF THE CATS , customers have to wear disposable socks and slippers , as well as wash their hands with antiseptic .

LONDON – A lecture given by Israel 's Deputy Ambassador to Britain Talya Lador - Fresher at the University of Manchester deteriorated Wednesday into violence when pro-Palestinian protesters stormed at the diplomat in an attempted attack .
The protesters were waiting for Lador - Fresher outside the lecture hall , but this did not deter her from entering as planned .
Immediately upon her exit , the protesters lunged at the diplomat , prompting security guards to whisk her back into the hall .
Following a consultation on the site , it was decided to escort her out of the premises in a police car .

The deputy ambassador was removed from the hall and into the police vehicle .
However , this did not block the protesters , who surrounded the car and climbed on the hood , trying to break the windshield .
Lador - Fresher ultimately was taken away from the scene safe and sound .
The deputy ambassador said that there the event certainly was unpleasant , and noted that it does not bode well for the academic debate in Britain on the Middle East .
Israeli Ambassador to Britain Ron Prosor praised his deputy for her determination and fighting spirit and emphasized that the embassy expects a sweeping denunciation of the event from the local authorities and universities in Britain .
" This is a lawlessness whose damaging effects are already being felt in the short term , and whose effects in the long term may be irreversible , " Prosor said .
Lador - Fresher 's lecture at the university was delayed by a few weeks out of concerns for her safety after information was received that violent protests were being organized .
As a result , the ambassador turned to the university faculty to reschedule the lecture .

The current quarrel over school funding sounds familiar to old - timers .
Just as in the 1980s , school boards are laying off teachers and closing schools , while the education minister says they 've never had it so good .

Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
The Liberals have consistently argued that education gets more money every year , and that the teachers and trustees are misrepresenting the situation in their endless demands for ever more funding .
Their " shortfalls , " we 're told , reflect only their endless wish list of inessentials .
One way to judge the merits of the dispute is simply to look at the average operating grant per student in constant dollars .
( The amount varies from district to district , but we 're talking about the provincial average . )
Is inflation confusing the true level of funding ?
That 's too simple , says John Malcolmson .
He 's the CUPE research representative for the kindergarten to Grade 12 ( K - 12 ) sector , and has decades of experience in studying school funding .
A yardstick based on the consumer price index , he observes , does n't work for education : " School districts do n't buy groceries . "
What 's more , schools are spending money differently from 10 years ago as needs have changed for various education services .
Dealing with ' structural funding shortfalls '
In a March 15 briefing note to CUPE and other staff - support unions in K - 12 , Malcolmson defined " structural funding shortfalls " in the schools :
They occur , he said , " where available district revenue falls chronically and persistently below that required to fund and maintain publicly mandated programs . "
He based that definition on information from David Green , president of the B.C. Association of School Business Officers , and Joan Axford , secretary - treasurer of School District 63 ( Saanich ) .
To explain school funding problems in general , and Saanich schools ' problems in particular , Axford has created two memorable PowerPoint shows .
( Look for them in the right - hand column of the Saanich district home page . )
[ This paragraph was revised at 5:00 p.m . April 29 to correct an error in attributing the source of the definition .
-- CK ]
One , on " Learning from the Past , " is a brilliant and concise history of school funding since the 1980s .
The other , " Public Budget Meeting Presentation , " was made to the board on April 21 .
It shows the provincial picture and then uses Saanich as an example of structural shortfall .
Axford shows that education in 1991 took 26 per cent of the provincial budget ; in 2000 - 01 it fell to 20 per cent , and this year it 's just 15 per cent .
Per - student funding seems to have gone up from $ 7,097 in 2005 - 06 to $ 8,381 in 2010 - 11 .
But with cost pressures factored in , the operating grant per student has actually fallen from $ 6,409 in 2005 to $ 6,289 in 2010 - 11 .
Saanich has seen a steady decline in student enrolments : the district lost just over 1,000 students between 2002 -03 and 2006 - 07 , and expects to lose almost 1,200 more between 2007 - 08 and 2013 - 14 .
Axford estimates that a fall of 200 students reduces costs by $ 690,000 .
But the funding allocation is reduced by $ 1,348,000 -- leaving the district with a net shortfall of $ 707,000 .
One impact : since 2004 - 05 , Saanich has lost 38 full - time equivalent teachers due to enrolment decline , but almost 16 FTE teachers to cover the cost of structural deficit reductions .
Selling the family jewels
SHOULD YOUR TAXES HELP FUND PRIVATE SCHOOLS ?
Back in the 1960s , W.A.C.
Bennett absolutely refused to put tax money into private schools .
It was a matter of principle :
If you did n't like the public schools , you could pay the whole shot to put your kids in something better .
In 1977 , his son Bill reversed that policy and began subsidizing families who thought the public schools were n't good enough ( or religious enough ) to suit their kids .
It bought a lot of votes , and it still does .
That subsidy by 2008 - 2009 was supporting over 54,000 students in Group 1 private schools at 50 per cent of their local public - school district 's per-pupil spending .
Another 14,000 were in Group 2 schools receiving 35 per cent of that spending .
( They call themselves " independent schools , " but they 're clearly dependent on their subsidies . )
All told , B.C. taxpayers spent just over $ 200 million in 2008 - 2009 to support 319 private schools , plus another $ 41 million to private " distributed learning " schools and $ 25.4 million in special education grants to qualifying students in Group 1 and Group 2 schools .
The BCTF says funding to private schools has risen by 34 per cent while public - school funding has risen by just 13 per cent .
The Ministry of Education defends this by saying , " To educate the 69,913 independent school students in the public system would cost $ 531 million in operating grants to public school districts ( based on the average 2008 / 09 school district per student operating grant of $ 7,595 ) .
This is $ 275 million more than the total current operating grants allocated to independent schools . "
In principle , those students have every right to an education in the public system , and we would have to find the money for them if they enrolled .
In practice , thousands would stay in the private schools and their parents would just be out of pocket a few thousand extra dollars every year .
In the meantime , putting a quarter - billion dollars and a few thousand more kids back into the public system would solve a lot of problems .
– C.K .
Having built up financial reserves over years , Saanich has been using those reserves to balance its budget since 2003 .
It 's an ongoing process : school closures in 2005 - 06 and 2006 - 07 generated almost a million dollars in savings .
All told , the district has just over a million dollars in reserves this year .
But it 's been selling the family jewels just to pay the bills .
Saanich still faces continuing cost pressures for 2010 - 11 that total $ 1.36 million , including HST ( $ 102,000 ) , carbon offset tax ( $ 83,000 ) and B.C. Hydro rate increases ( $ 26,000 ) .
Other costs beyond board control : MSP premiums ( $ 55,000 ) , teacher salary increases ( $ 609,000 ) and teacher pension rates ( $ 311,000 ) .
These cost pressures since 2006 - 07 have produced a wide gap between cost increase per pupil and government funding to cover that increase .
This year , the cost increase was $ 2,024 per pupil , and Victoria raised funding by just $ 454 .
Next year will see another increase , of $ 2,245 , with only $ 458 more in government funding .
Between revenue decline , cost pressures , enrolment decline and loss of reserves , Axford estimates that Saanich 's total structural funding shortfall in 2010 - 11 will be $ 3,342,515 .
Since 2000 - 01 , Axford says , the 10 - year shortfall for Saanich has totaled $ 13.67 million .
Meeting next year 's shortfall could involve cuts to student services such as learning assistance , education assistant time , and speech and language therapy .
It could also mean cuts to libraries , reading programs , and non-enrolling teachers in middle and secondary schools -- presumably including most teacher - librarians .
Saanich is worth considering not because it's an extreme case , but because it 's fairly typical .
CUPE 's John Malcolmson says 52 of our 60 school districts are dealing with falling enrolments this year .
Much room for improvement
The public system also suffers from another financial drain .
Some $ 200 million dollars in tax money is funneled into subsidizing private education instead of public schools .
Whether that 's an efficient allocation of education dollars is up for fierce debate ( see sidebar ) .
When polled last month , 65 per cent of British Columbians said public funding of private schools should end .
And more than 81 per cent said the provincial government is not doing enough to fund public education .
For all the government 's bragging about the excellence of our schools and their high funding , its own documents reveal some abysmal failures .
According to page 19 of the B.C. budget for education , from 2008 / 09 to 2010 / 11 , adult British Columbians ( aged 16 to 65 ) who could read at " level 3 " in 2005 was just 60 per cent .
With luck , that number may have risen to 69 per cent this year .
( Level 3 is defined as " the desired threshold for coping with the increasing skill demands of a knowledge economy and society . " )
In other words , a minimum of 31 per cent of adult British Columbians can't read well enough to understand this article .
That 's about 880,000 of us .
It does not speak well for a government that made literacy the first of its Five Great Goals .
On page 13 of the same document , the ministry says that in 2006 - 07 , 80 per cent of high school students had graduated within six years of entering Grade 8 .
Its target for this year is 83 per cent .
In other words , we are sending at least 17 per cent of our young people into a tough job market without high school completion .
For Aboriginal students , the graduation rate in 2006 - 07 was 48 per cent .
The Liberals hope to see that rise to 60 per cent this year .
So we are willing to let two out of every five Aboriginal kids go into the world without even the paper shield of a Dogwood Certificate .
( In 2007 - 08 , we had just over 60,000 Aboriginal students .
So 24,000 of them will have to survive without high school graduation . )
After a decade of structural shortfalls , perhaps it 's no wonder we 're doing badly .
But we were n't doing much better even in the relatively good years of the 1990s .
Most of the students in that decade had , after all , been hurt by the cuts of the Socred restraint era , when Bill Bennett downloaded unwelcome costs onto the kids then in school .
Until we decide as a province that education is a true and continuing priority , the schools will go on suffering a financial brownout : enough money to function , at the cost of the poorest families .
And that in turn will cause an intellectual and economic brownout for all of us that will continue indefinitely into the 21st century .
The average sperm count in healthy men worldwide has dropped by half in the last 50 years , according to a Danish review of 61 studies including 14,947 men .
Experts say the study , directed by Dr. Niels E. Skakkebaek of the University of Copenhagen , lends credence to speculation that environmental pollutants may damage production of sperm cells .
Conflicting results have emerged from previous studies .
Skakkebaek , whose findings are published in the Sept. 12 issue of the British Medical Journal , said his review was the first to collect worldwide statistics and limit the analysis to healthy men .
“ I think there is cause for concern , ” said Dr. Richard Sharpe , a respected reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh .
“ If there is something in our environment having an effect that is drastic enough to decrease sperm count by 50 % , we should know what this factor is . ”

Dr. Sherman Silber , an infertility specialist at St. Luke ’s Hospital in St. Louis , cautioned against jumping to conclusions .
He said he has not found a decline in average sperm count among patients at his clinic in the last 20 years .
Three Hayward men are scheduled to be arraigned on assault and hate crime charges in San Francisco next week for allegedly shooting a man they thought was gay with a BB gun .
The Feb. 26 incident took place at about 10 p.m. outside a Mission District bar at 16th and Guerrero streets , according to police .
The 27 - year - old San Francisco man had just come out of the bar when he was shot once in the cheek by suspects in a nearby car , which then drove off , police spokesman Officer Samson Chan said .
The man was not seriously injured and called police , and while officers were interviewing him outside the bar , he spotted the same vehicle again driving by , Chan said .
Police pulled the car over and found three men inside with a “ rifle - style ” BB gun and a video camera , which investigators later discovered had recorded the shooting , according to Chan .
The three men , Shafiq Hashemi , 21 , Sayed Bassam , 21 , and Mohammad Habibzada , 24 , the driver , were arrested .
According to Chan , they allegedly admitted to the crime .
“ The suspects did make a confession , basically stating that they came to San Francisco to target gay people , ” he said .
Prosecutors have since charged all three men with assault with a deadly weapon , hate crimes and attempted mayhem , a charge relating to the possibility of a disabling or disfiguring injury .
The men appeared in San Francisco Superior Court Thursday but arraignment and plea entry were postponed until March 12 , according to the district attorney ’s office .
They remain out of custody after posting $ 50,000 bail .
Anyone who may have been a victim of a similar incident is asked to contact the Police Department ’s hate crimes unit at ( 415 ) 553-1133 .

Skeptic , Be Not Proud
One of the perks of basing conclusions on evidence rather than whims or emotions is that you tend be right more often .
Yes , that sounds like an arrogant thing to say , but face it ... the reason we 're skeptics is because we love the truth and we 're constantly searching to refine it .
That tends to make us more informed on any topic than the general public who often seem to go with the flow and not question what they 're told .
I 'm generalizing , but you get the point .
Be that as it may , it 's easy to take pride in this fact .
" Hey , I 've done the research , and I 'm right a lot of the time !
Look at me !!! "
Saying it like that may seem ridiculous , but it 's not far from what I 've been observing lately .
I believe that such an attitude is not only counterproductive , it also ignores the best thing about being a skeptic , and that is ... being able to freely say " Oops , I was wrong about that . "
In our search for the truth , we have to make many provisional conclusions .
If some of them are n't wrong , we 're not doing the thinking required to be an active skeptic .
We should be wrong more often , and most important , when we are , we should CROW IT FROM THE RAFTERS .
What separates skeptics from non-skeptics is n't that we 're right more often , it 's that we 're wrong more often .
Maybe not in actuality , but if we 're to lead a science - based life , we have to be " proud " of the fact that most of what we know is possibly wrong .
" Here 's my best guess " is all we can ever say , because that 's all we 'll ever know .
Now , our " best guesses " are in fact , THE best guesses .
Unless we 've missed something or succumbed to bias , they best explain the available evidence .
But being proud of that makes it more difficult to embrace the pure simple joy of being unapologetically wrong .
And really , we need more of that .
Arrogance is never going to get people to think , but saying " Huh , I was wrong about that " can .
So here 's my challenge to you : in the comments below , post a story of how you were wrong .
And to be fair , I 'll start .
My problem is that I 'm wrong so often , I 'm not sure which example to give . ;)
Ok , here 's one :
I 've been flying since I was very little , and of course , curiosity lead me to wonder why planes fly .
I did some cursory research , and found out about the Bernoulli effect .
Planes fly because wings are curved on the top , which causes air to travel farther on the top of the wing than the bottom , and this causes lift .
Here 's a concise explanation from the Connecticut government .
For years , I 'd tell people about this , including my own kids .
It 's a nice simple lesson , it makes sense , and it 's also incorrect .
Well , maybe not completely , but we now know that the Bernoulli effect does not adequately explain why planes fly .
William Beaty wrote this excellent explanation of the problem in 1996 .
He discusses not only the complexity of flight , but goes on to show how the desire to be " right " without be willing to admit that you 're wrong gets in the way of science .
Winning an argument does not equal being correct .
So , I state PROUDLY that I was wrong about the Bernoulli effect .
I 'm glad to have increased my knowledge of the subject , and to be able to share that knowledge with others .
And if you care to argue with me about the Bernoulli effect , be prepared for something : I 'm not going to argue back .
I have no stake in whether I 'm correct or not .
All I can state is that based on the evidence I 've seen , my layman 's position is that Beaty 's explanation best fits the data .
And being a skeptic , I 'm happy to say that I was wrong .
I hope that you can be too .
The science writer Simon Singh is fighting to defend his right to freedom of speech .
And he 's far from alone as companies from around the world are increasingly trying to use England 's libel laws to quash academic critics
Earlier this week , a mild - mannered freelance science writer stood on the steps of London 's imposing Royal Courts of Justice and declared his determination , come what may , to stand up for free speech against what he and an ever - swelling contingent of scientists , public figures and celebrities believe is the oppressive burden of the UK 's libel laws .
Simon Singh , science writer and co-author of a book about alternative medicine , provoked a libel suit from the British Chiropractic Association ( BCA ) ­after a piece was published in the Guardian 's comment pages .
He may now make history .
In the venerable stone building , three of England 's most senior judges listened to his case and are now deliberating over its merits .
The line - up of Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge , Master of the Rolls Lord Neuberger and Lord Justice Sedley has led some commentators to believe the issues around ­science writing and libel are suddenly being taken very seriously indeed in ­legal circles .
Many hope that the judges ' ruling , when it comes , will loosen what they argue are draconian restrictions on freedom of speech .
Singh is still in the early stages of the libel suit , fighting over the meaning of the words he used about the BCA , whom he accused of supporting " bogus " treatments for children .
Mr Justice Eady , in a preliminary ruling that ­provoked a storm of protest , ruled that what Singh wrote was fact , not comment , and that to justify it , he would have to prove the association 's members were dishonest .
Singh says he never ­intended that ­interpretation .
The big guns in the court of appeal must now decide whether Eady 's interpretation should stand .
Amid all the outrage over the use of superinjunctions by companies such as Trafigura to try to prevent media and even parliamentary discussion of ­attempted legal gags , attention has turned to attempts to silence ­scientists .
Singh is by no means waging a lone battle .
In October 2007 in Washington DC , a heart expert from Shropshire had an earnest conversation with a reporter from the little - known US medical website Heartwire .
The reporter , Shelley Wood , could see that if what Dr Peter Wilmshurst was saying was true , she had an important story on her hands .
Wilmshurst had designed a trial for a Delaware - based company called NMT Medical , to find out whether closing small holes in the heart using their ­device would stop people suffering from migraine headaches .
But the UK trial , christened Mist 1 , was a failure : the migraines did not go away – and Wilmshurst , who was strongly critical of the conduct of the research , had a theory as to why .
He suggested that the problem might be not with the concept but the device itself .
Although it had been ­implanted in tens of thousands of ­people , it was possibly not as effective in closing holes as had been thought .
Two years later , he is facing a libel ­action in the English courts brought by the device manufacturer , NMT Medical , that could lose him his home .
Wilmshurst , who has a history of whistle - blowing , is the sort of doctor who will never back down .
He says he believes NMT has " got themselves in out of their depth .
I do n't have any money .
I have got half a house and no other money . "
The campaigning group Healthwatch has started a fund to pay his legal costs .
" It is an important issue , " Wilmshurst says .
" The English high court is being used to silence people .
I gave a lecture in America that was picked up by a medical journalist there , and she put something on a website .
Yet the website and the journalist are not being sued . "
NMT Medical denies it is sueing in England because of the tough UK libel laws : " This case is not about libel ­tourism at all , " says its chief operating officer , Rick Davis .
" Our suit was not brought in any way because of any ­scientific views that Dr Wilmshurst holds .
He has accused NMT of research fraud , and we believe he did that maliciously . "
For Wilmshurst , this is not just a question of freedom of speech , but public access to information .
He is ­angry that he and a colleague working with him at the Royal Shrewsbury ­hospital were not allowed to see the detailed " line " data ( as opposed to summaries ) to work out why the trial failed to alleviate migraine .
" These things are important ; we learn from what we publish .
Someone else may come along and design a study that is flawed because they have n't been given the full information from other studies , and it may put patients at risk . "
Many of the scientific libel cases are in the medical field – probably because of the strong passions the needs of ­patients evoke , and the big money to be made from new treatments .
And while Wilmshurst went beyond the normal academic cut - and - thrust of weighing and debating evidence with other scientists , the Liberal Democrat MP Evan Harris says libel blight is now threatening even scientists who merely publish the results of their investigations in respected ( and peer - reviewed ) ­scientific journals .
These journals offer rights of reply , discussion columns and have corrections policies .
They have high standards of proof and are held in high regard within the scientific and academic world .
And yet , say many of their editors , they too feel direct or insidious pressure from corporations and groups with vested interests not to publish papers that might prove damaging .
" It is what is not published or has to be omitted ­because of a lawyer 's letter , " Harris says .
" I support Peter Wilmshurst and the many other cases currently being fought , but the biggest problem has ­always been the stuff that does n't even get published because of the fear . "
Harris says peer - reviewed journals should have an automatic public interest defence if they are accused of libel , or should enjoy some sort of qualified privilege .
After all , scientists have ­always played a critical role in the monitoring of complex technological and medical advances .
Fifty years ago , it was a whistle - blowing scientist , Frances Kelsey , who stood up to ­pressure from the manufacturer of Thalidomide and ­refused to approve a licence for the drug in the US .
She wanted more proof that it would not harm the foetus , and was proved horribly right in her suspicions when hundreds of ­deformed babies began to be born in Europe .
Today 's embattled scientist may be tomorrow 's hero .
Another case currently arousing concern involves Swedish linguistic and phonetics experts ­Francisco ­Lacerda and Anders Erikkson , who in 2007 wrote a paper criticising the ­technology used in lie detectors .
­Published in the UK by the highly ­specialised , peer - reviewed International Journal of Speech , Language and the Law ( IJSLL ) , they alleged that , ­scientifically , the " layered voice ­analysis " technology in lie detectors currently being trialled by UK local ­authorities trying to catch benefit cheats is " at the astrology end of the spectrum " .
Lacerda and Erikkson are not being sued by the Israeli manufacturer , Nemesysco .
Swedish law would not ­allow them to be sued in Sweden , but the British publishers of the paper , Equinox , withdrew it ­under the threat of a libel suit in the English courts .
Janet Joyce , managing ­director of the IJSLL , preferred not to talk about the crisis , saying she had " decided not to revisit that dreadful experience again " .
But Lacerda was a lot more forthcoming .
" We thought it was in our mission as scientists to ­disclose this type of thing – to explain why it can't work , " he said .
They included a direct ­attack on the company and the ­credentials of the ­inventor of the ­technology , Amir ­Liberman .
Lacerda admits it was " a little bit on the edge for a scientific paper " , which had the take - no - prisoners title , Charlatanry in Speech Science : A Problem to Be Taken Seriously .
Nonetheless , support for Lacerda and Erikkson has been vocal , particularly in Sweden where the law is more liberal than in the UK .
In May , the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences stated : " Incidents of this kind are a threat to research freedom and , by extension , to the free dissemination of information in society .
Threats to sue must not be used to restrict scientific discussion . "
Liberman , the device 's inventor , takes a different view .
He tells me he would not have resorted to law if ­Lacerda and Erikkson had stuck to ­science .
" Now , " he says bitterly , " if you research my name on the internet , after the first few items you find I 'm a charlatan .
What a great legacy for my kids . "
Ironically , his legal action has brought the Swedish paper far more attention than if he had never threatened to sue .
But Liberman assures me that , according to the English legal ­system , there is a clear case of defamation .
" We can certainly press charges .
Scientists should be more ­concerned about the way they treat others : their word is taken at more than face value because they are scientists . "
This is precisely why libel reform campaigners such as Index on Censorship and the Libel Reform Campaign – which counts writers , artists and entertainers among its supporters , from Jonathan Ross to novelist Monica Ali to comedians Stephen Fry and Shazia Mirza – wish to take up the cases of ­scientists .
And the publicity the cause has been attracting may already be forcing companies to think twice .
Last week , GE Healthcare dropped its libel suit against Henrik Thomsen , a Danish radiologist at Copenhagen University who had publicly linked one of its drugs to a chronically disabling condition , saying that it did not mean to stifle academic debate .
Thomsen had given a presentation to a small group of doctors and scientists at the Randolph hotel in Oxford in 2007 .
He was anxious to warn them of the potential dangers of a drug called Omniscan , given routinely to kidney patients to enhance MRI scans and make them easier to read .
Twenty ­patients at his university hospital had developed nephrogenic systemic ­fibrosis ( NSF ) , a condition in which the skin swells and tightens .
Some ended up in wheelchairs as a result , and one died .
Thomsen and his colleagues ­believed the drug , which contained a toxic metal called gadolinium , was directly linked to the incapacitating ­illness of their patients .
In an agreed statement last week , he reiterated his view that Omniscan was to blame .
" I stand by my publicly ­expressed opinion , based on my ­experience and research on published papers , that there is an association ­between the chemical formulation of gadolinium - based contrast agents and NSF , " he said .
But Thomsen added he had never intended to suggest GE Healthcare had marketed the drug knowing it might cause NSF .
This , said the company , was the reason for the ­libel suit .
" GE Healthcare objected to statements made by Professor Thomsen which it interpreted as suggesting it had known from the outset that ­Omniscan caused NSF , " the company said , while welcoming " a principled debate " over safety issues .
Thomsen will be much relieved .
The cost and the time libel actions take make them prohibitive for most people .
Singh has already spent well over £ 100,000 on his own defence , and the bestselling science writer and broadcaster admits he is better able to afford it than most people .
The costs of libel cases regularly reach hundreds of thousands of pounds – often far exceeding the payouts .
" A libel ­tribunal would be one solution , " Singh suggests .
" And that goes for both sides .
If the BCA lose this case , it is going to be horrific for them .
If people want to sue for libel , that 's fine , but it should n't be so traumatic or expensive . "
Padraig Reidy , of Index on Censorship , agrees there is a need for defamation laws : " Special pleading for medical and science writing is neither desirable nor implementable , " he says .
But in his view , medical and science writers would be sufficiently protected if the UK was to introduce a stronger public interest defence – one strand of a 10 - point strategy that Index and other libel reform groups are proposing .
" The case of Peter Wilmshurst presents a perfect storm of the problems with England 's libel laws , " Reidy says .
Wilmshurst is " a man being sued for a quote published on a website that should be outside English jurisdiction , by a company very few people had ever heard of , who now says he could be ruined for speaking out in the public interest as he saw it " .
The Libel Reform Campaign appears to be making headway .
Its leaders are in discussions with the Ministry of ­Justice ( Jack Straw has set up a working party ) , and the House of Commons ­culture , media and sport select ­committee has just proposed measures to limit libel tourism , boost the public - interest defence , cut costs and require corporations that sue individuals to prove actual damage to business .
Any changes will come too late for Singh , Wilmshurst and others with cases already lumbering along – but ­scientists of the future may find it a ­little easier to speak their minds .
Via Stephen Trimble over at the DEW Line blog , is this post from defense analyst James Hasik who makes the case for killing the F - 35 .
As we ’ve learned is the cause of most human errors , Gates made his decision to go all - in on the F - 35 on the basis of incomplete information , Hasik writes .
Now , the F - 35 is not justly hugely over budget but development is over a year behind schedule and slowing .
Hasik points to cost as the most obvious F - 35 vulnerability .
After an eight year absence , deficit hawks have returned to Washington and their budget cutting knives are out .
“ Any bipartisan commission for balancing the federal budget , as announced just last month , will not be able to avoid recommending military spending cuts , and the JSF is simply the unavoidably biggest part of the investment accounts , ” he writes .
The F - 35 also faces a tough road ahead with the program ’s overseas partners who see their own fiscal houses sagging under ominous debt loads .
It ’s when Hasik ’s analysis ventures into back of the envelope net assessment territory that I find it most compelling .
He contends that the F - 35 is not militarily vital .
“ Several years ago , I asked the head of strategy at a European aircraft manufacturer why his company had no obvious plans for a fighter beyond the current model .
“ All our customers , ” he said , “ have enough fighters for chasing Cessnas for the next fifty years . ”
The next generation of unmanned strike aircraft is alluring , but the air sovereignty mission is just not so compelling today .
For frankly , there ’s just no threat anywhere that calls for such a huge fleet of land - based fighter aircraft . ”
Hasik points out that the Air Force , Navy and Marines combined make up the world ’s largest air armada .
Then he looks at possible contenders .
Russia :
“ The next largest armadas is probably Russia ’s , with almost 2200 aircraft .
Even if Russia were a plausible opponent , the rest of NATO has its air force outnumbered even without the US on board .
And given Russia ’s long - term finances and demographics , that number will be shrinking . ”
China :
“ China ’s air fleet is of comparable size — read , smaller than America ’s — but it ’s also remarkably unimpressive .
China ’s most numerous jet fighter is a copy of the MiG - 21 .
Then again , one does n’t fight the Chinese without necessarily having either the Japanese or the Taiwanese — and their significant air forces — on board . ”
The rest :
“ Sidestepping India ( another implausible opponent ) , the next largest air force is North Korea ’s : more than 600 aircraft on paper , but not so many that are flyable or fueled .
Besides , South Korea has over 500 aircraft , and of far better quality in men and materiel .
Iran ?
Not half that many flyable machines . ”
Hasik figures the U.S. has at least a ten year window before any potential foe could build a fighter fleet that poses a real challenge .
Money freed up from the F - 35 should go to building a fighter that can best anything the Chinese are likely to build over the next few decades .
As Trimble says , it ’s worth a read .

This week , I 'll show you a few keyboard related tricks for editing in Xcode , including setting up multiple copy - and - paste buffers by adjusting the key mappings , switching tabs on or off for autocomplete and other text editing quirks in Xcode like understanding why the " End " key does n't move to the end of the line on the Mac .
Key bindings , the cursor and Emacs
Standard text editing on the Mac obeys many more keyboard commands than most casual users realize .
This is because the key bindings on the Mac derive from NeXTStep which chose to implement ( where possible ) a large number of the Emacs key bindings .
First developed in the 1970's , Emacs was designed for keyboards that lacked cursor and forward delete keys and computers that lacked a mouse .
And , like its spiritual enemy in the world of text editing , Vi , Emacs was never a program to update its key bindings to stay current .
What this means is that text editing applications that use the standard Cocoa text editor — like TextEdit.app — and other more sophisticated text editors that support the operating system 's default key bindings — like Xcode — support most of the Emacs key controls for navigating and editing — like Ctrl - F and Ctrl - B for forward and backward by one character or Ctrl - A and Ctrl - E for jump to the start or end of the paragraph .
Of course , most of this is pointless to ordinary users since the standard cursor and home keys will do this in a far less cryptic way .
For those of you who still scream at Xcode when the Home key does n't move to the start of the line or get annoyed that the cursor does n't move when using PageUp / PageDown , here 's a quick refresher :
Key or combination Action ↑ cursor up ↓ cursor down ← cursor left → cursor right Command ← cursor to start of line Command → cursor to end of line Option ← cursor to start of previous word Option → cursor to end of previous word Control ← cursor to start of previous camel - case component ( Xcode only — otherwise it works like Command ←)
Control → cursor to end of previous camel - case component ( Xcode only — otherwise it works like Command → ) PageUp or Control ↑ scroll up one page , without moving the cursor PageDown or Control ↓ scroll down one page , without moving the cursor Home scroll to top of document , without moving the cursor End scroll to end of document , without moving the cursor Option - Page Up scroll up one page , moving cursor to center of new location Option - PageDown scroll down one page , moving cursor to center of new location Command ↑ move cursor to start of document Command ↓ move cursor to end of document Option ↑ move cursor to start of the paragraph ( except in Xcode where it does nothing )
Option ↓ move cursor to end of the paragraph ( except in Xcode where it does nothing )
Due to the importance of the Home / End / PageUp / PageDown keys in text editing , I have no respect for Apple 's choice to start shipping keyboards without these keys by default on new computers .
I wish there was a little more sense to these bindings .
There almost are a few rules — like Control , Option and Command represent small , medium and largest increments in any direction and combinations involving the cursor keys move the cursor but Home / End / PageUp / PageDown combinations just scroll without moving the cursor — but sadly there are enough violations of these rules that you must simple learn them all by rote .
The ability to scroll the document without moving the cursor when desired on the Mac is an ability that I sorely miss when I 'm stuck using Visual Studio or other development environments — in these other environment , my cursor always gets stranded when I quickly glance at another point in the document , whereas on the Mac I can just tap a left or right arrow to return to where I was .
Kill and yank
A side effect of bringing Emacs key bindings into Xcode though is that a few Emacs commands that do n't have common Macintosh equivalents are brought in as well .
This includes kill and yank .
Kill and yank are Ctrl -K and Ctrl - Y by default .
In most respects , kill and yank work like cut and paste .
Kill something and it gets stored in your kill buffer , yank and the contents of your kill buffer are inserted at the current insertion point .
If you have no selection , kill will delete from the cursor to the end of the line , otherwise it will only delete the selection .
There are a few differences compared to cut - and - paste : you can't yank between applications ( each application has its own , non-shared kill ring ) and they store pure text only ( no styled text , images or other copyable data ) .
In their default setup , kill and yank are like a second - rate extra cut - and - paste option .
But correctly configured , you can have as many separate cut buffers as you want .
Setting up kill - and - yank
The first configuration change you need to make is to set up a binding for yankAndSelect : instead of ordinary yank : .
We do this because yank : will only ever insert the most recently killed text whereas yankAndSelect : allows you to cycle through all stored buffers .
You can do this in the " Xcode Preferences → Key Bindings → Text Key Bindings " but I prefer to make the binding System - wide by using the " / Developer / Applications / Utilities / Property List Editor.app " to create a file at " ~/ Library / KeyBindings / DefaultKeyBinding.dict " that overrides the yank : command with a yankAndSelect : command .
The key string is actually caret-y , not Ctrl - Y .
You may need to create the KeyBindings
directory in your Library directory as it is not there by default .
Update 2016/03/29 : The " Property List Editor.app " is long gone .
Xcode will still edit " Property List - Text " format files but Xcode wants them to have the " . plist " extension , rather than the " .dict " extension required for the " DefaultKeyBinding.dict " file .
It 's probably just easier to create a plain text file at the " DefaultKeyBinding.dict " path with the contents : { " ^y " = " yankAndSelect : " ; }
Both yank : and yankAndSelect : are standard commands on NSReponder , so this just exchanges one for another .
In a totally bizarre twist of documentation , yankAndSelect : is an undocumented method ( it 's not in the Cocoa.h headers ) that appears in the documentation where you are encouraged to used it as required .
The other step to make multiple kill buffers work is to specify how many buffers you want .
By default , there is 1 but we want multiple buffers .
To do this , just add the key NSTextKillRingSize with a string or number value greater than 1 to any . plist file .
For example , if you only want this behavior added to Xcode , add the line to the Xcode . plist file .
I like to add this like to my Global Preferences .
To do this , type :
open ~/ Library / Preferences / . GlobalPreferences .
plist
in a Terminal window ( the file is hidden by default in the Finder so you need to open it like this unless you 've turned the display of hidden files on ) .
The NSTextKillRingSize setting in my .
GlobalPreferences.plist file .
With these changes , you can use Control - K to copy something to a kill buffer and then Control - Y to cycle through the last 3 items stored in your kill buffers ( the collection of kill buffers is called the " kill ring " ) .
You can use any number or kill buffers but large numbers may make cycling through the complete set harder ( since you can only cycle through in one direction ) .
The Tab key binding in Xcode
While I 'm talking about key bindings , one of the biggest shocks in Xcode 3.2 for me was the fact that the Tab key is configured by default to select the next Code Sense Completion , instead of inserting a Tab character .
This meant that if I had code like this :
and I hit the Tab key to indent the second line , it would n't indent — instead the autocomplete field would be selected .
I found this particularly frustrating since I normally use Ctrl - / to select autocomplete fields , making the Tab key redundant as well as interfering .
Fortunately , Xcode supports a " Insert Tab without Extra Action " that is normally bound to Option - Tab which will only ever insert a Tab character ( will never perform other UI actions ) .
By exchanging the key bindings between " Insert Tab " and " Insert Tab without Extra Action " , my complaint was solved .
On the topic of search and replace : a change to menus in Xcode 3.2 means that single file Search and Replace no longer appears in the menu ( unless you 're holding down the Control key , since its binding is now Ctrl - Command - F and " Ctrl " variants of menu items are n't shown unless " Ctrl " is held ) .
This can make search and replace hard to find in Xcode 3.2 .
Another feature that has become harder to find are the search options — the little magnifying glass on the search field hides a popup menu that contains the essential options like " Ignore case " .
A sideeffect of changing the tab bindings is that all text fields in the user interface — including the Search and Replace text fields — will change their behavior when the Tab key is pressed .
Once the bindings are changed , Tab will no longer move the input focus from the search field to the replace field — it will instead insert the tab character into the selected field .
This means that to jump from the Search field to the Replace field you will need to type Option - Tab .
Of course , the ability to easily enter tab characters in the search field has its advantages too .
Conclusion
Text editing on the Mac is loaded with features that most people never use .
While there 's often no need to use many of the extra features , extra navigation options or extra kill - and - yank buffers can be useful additions .
The .GlobalPreferences.plist and global DefaultKeyBinding .dict files used to alter global key mappings provide a surprising amount of flexibility to applications that respect their content , like Xcode .
You can use them to remap most key combinations to other commands if you choose .
A corollary though : you should try to respect these dictionaries if writing your own custom text editor .
Ferrari might have come away with a commanding one - two from the F1 2010 curtain - raising Bahrain Grand Prix at Sakhir at the weekend , but still the Scuderia 's team principal Stefano Domenicali insists the result can only be graded eight - out - of - ten - with the Italian alluding to a series of ' issues ' that need to be dealt with prior to the second outing in Australia in a week - and - a - half 's time .
Following long - time race leader Sebastian Vettel 's loss of power caused by a faulty spark plug in the Renault engine of the young German 's Red Bull Racing RB6 , Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa swept through unchallenged to comfortably claim the top two steps on the podium in the desert kingdom - earning the Prancing Horse a handy advantage with the new season only just underway .
However , it is not ready to gallop off into the sunset just yet , Domenicali cautions , and there were tell - tale signs over the course of the weekend that all was perhaps not quite as seamless as to the outside world it might have appeared .
The engines in both cars were changed as a precautionary measure between qualifying and the grand prix itself , and Massa was forced to back off during the second half of the race as high temperatures and fears about overheating led to excessive fuel consumption for the Brazilian 's F10 .
" The temperature of the engine is the result of the aerodynamics of the car , " Domenicali revealed of the cooling trouble , " so we have to work on that in order to make sure we do n't have any more of these kinds of issues for the next hot races .
" Of course , the result at the end was excellent - first and second places in the first race was really an outstanding achievement for the team - but we have seen that the list of problems is quite high .
We need to address them all , and make sure that they are solved before the start of the next weekend in Australia . "
There is also speculation that Ferrari is developing a ' B - spec ' car incorporating a new , innovative diffuser - designed by former Toyota CFD guru Giuseppe Azzollini , and based upon a concept that was due to be fitted to the TF110 that never ultimately raced .
Regardless of any future advances in pace and performance , though , the two scarlet machines already look to be in fine fettle indeed this year .
" For sure , the incredible result has given all the people [ at the factory ] in Maranello a great [ sense of ] relief , " Domenicali acknowledged .
" It was a big emotional push , because we had a very difficult winter - time and do n't forget how our season was last year .
Saying that , we know we have completed only the first race , and the season is very , very , very long .
" I would say a good signal that we have seen is that for sure the car is competitive - but it is in the same field as the other competitors that want to win the championship .
We know that already at the next grand prix in Melbourne the situation could be different .
At least this is a different starting - point [ to 2009 ] , though , from which we can do good things . "
ALÞING , Heathrow , Thursday ( NTN ) — Prime Minister Gordon Brown has condemned Iceland ’s terrorist attack on British air travel and their refusal to refund tourists ’ air tickets .
The UK government used anti-terrorism laws to freeze all British - held assets of Umhverfisráðuneyti , the Icelandic Ministry Against the Environment , after minister Kolbrún bin Halldór threatened to further unleash the power of the Katla volcano in the wake of the devastation to school holidays caused by Eyjafjallajökull .
Thousands of confused and angry passengers wandered around Britain ’s becalmed airports today trying in vain to find out how long the disruption caused by the ash cloud might last .
“ Ca n’t we just , you know , give the planes a try and see if they fall out of the sky ? ” said Brenda Busybody , 54 ( IQ ) , of East Cheam .
“ I reeeally need to go and rest on holiday , Monday I ’m back to doing nothing in the office .
I pay my licence fee ! ”
The Prime Minister offered his outrage and sympathy , in lieu of money or anything useful .
“ This is fundamentally a problem with the Icelandic - registered El - stodth Thyonustah Voweld , ” said Mr Brown , attempting not to choke on his own tongue .
“ They have failed the people of Iceland and they have failed the people of Northern Europe !
You pay my licence fee !
Er , hold on … ”
Icelandic Prime Minister Jóhanna bin Sigurðar also offered her sympathies to British travellers .
“ But , you know , we ’re still pretty upset about the cod . ”

I 've always hated the term “ dynamic programming ” .
It 's big and imposing , making a simple concept sound far more intimidating than it should .
And it 's completely opaque : if you did n't know the term , would you ever guess that it meant memo functions ?
( Yes , memoization is the right concept ; see the followup . )
I always supposed it was historical , and must have made sense , in some context , at some point .
Groping for some way to remember the term , I came up with a fable : if you see the cached results as part of the program , then dynamic programming involves augmenting the program at runtime .
So I imagined memoization had initially been seen ( or even implemented ) as a form of self - modifying code , and that explained the term .
But it turns out it never made even that much sense .
Richard Bellman , who coined it , explains :
An interesting question is , ‘ Where did the name , dynamic programming , come from ? ’
The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research .
We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named Wilson .
He was Secretary of Defense , and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word , research .
I ’m not using the term lightly ; I ’m using it precisely .
His face would suffuse , he would turn red , and he would get violent if people used the term , research , in his presence .
You can imagine how he felt , then , about the term , mathematical .
The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force , and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss , essentially .
Hence , I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation .
What title , what name , could I choose ?
In the first place I was interested in planning , in decision making , in thinking .
But planning , is not a good word for various reasons .
I decided therefore to use the word , ‘ programming . ’
I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic , this was multistage , this was time - varying — I thought , let ’s kill two birds with one stone .
Let ’s take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning , namely dynamic , in the classical physical sense .
It also has a very interesting property as an adjective , and that is it ’s impossible to use the word , dynamic , in a pejorative sense .
Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning .
It ’s impossible .
Thus , I thought dynamic programming was a good name .
It was something not even a Congressman could object to .
So I used it as an umbrella for my activities .
“ Dynamic programming ” never meant anything ; it was nothing but a political euphemism .
But somehow it became attached to one of the useful concepts Bellman discovered , and to this day , students of computer science struggle to learn that simple idea , because it 's burdened with a nonsense name .
Please call it “ memoization ” instead .
And tell your students .
( Via Wikipedia , of all places .
It 's not usually a good source for CS information , but it 's pretty good about linking to historical sources , or at least , as in this case , to an article quoting one . )
( “ Dynamic ” does have some negatively connoted uses nowadays , in particular in the static type theory community — partly from the perennial flamewar rivalry with dynamic typing , and partly because the main practical purpose of static analysis is to eliminate dynamic uncertainty , so “ dynamic ” suggests failure . )
Several people have quoted Russell and Norvig : “ This can not be strictly true , because his first paper using the term ( Bellman , 1952 ) appeared before Wilson became Secretary of Defense in 1953 . ”
Perhaps the antipathy to research did not originate with Wilson , or perhaps Bellman initially intended the term to make sense , and only later adopted it as camouflage .
Information lumberjacks are digital apparatus that capture different kinds of information .
They are usually little makers work on electric battery power .
Making use of chargeable batteries are actually extremely convenient with these units .
The wonderful thing regarding these tools is that you may document relevant information without must be actually certainly there to record the information .
Although electric batteries may need to have to be altered often .
However these devices possess the capability to capture data for many months each time .
Each of the above help to capture necessary records that could be utilized for a wide array of factors depending on the data obtained .
Most of these units make use of turn vital data programming on a personal pc to use the logger as well as consider the records gathered .
Other kinds of information lumberjack are actually standard reason created to become linked to a variety of voltages and also sensor kinds .
2 names frequently made use of with each other are records logging and data acquisition .
Having said that these are certainly not the very same and have extremely various historic histories .
Records loggers typically have slower example costs , commonly the highest possible example price of 5 HZ can be looked at to be actually as well easy , however it is on the sluggish side for a data acquisition system .
A Data logger is actually unconditionally a stand - alone part of devices contrasted to the records acquisition body that needs to remain connected to a computer to collect relevant information .
There is actually debates over which one is actually well , but they both possess pro’s and also cons .
Each tool offers something different depending upon what you intend to utilize it for .
Considering that the data - logger is actually a stand - alone unit it possesses to possess on - board moment .
From time to time this mind is very huge to permit for several days , or maybe months , of recording that has been actually left ignored .
The memory of this gadget might be electric battery worked stationary arbitrary access memory , flash memory or even EEPROM .
Records lumberjacks have actually transformed rather a whole lot given that they were actually first Historically records loggers utilized magnetic tape , punched study tape , or straight shareable reports like “ strip graph recorders ” .
Information loggers generally have built - in time clocks whose published drift may be an important point to consider when choosing what gadget to decide on .
The lumberjacks are available in several kinds coming from essential single - channel input to difficult multi-channel units .
Frequently , the absolute most general the device the less computer programming versatility .
The even more complex units enable the consumer to execute cross-channel computations .
Likewise alerts produced for fixed problems .

How to run
These functions can be executed as one liners from a shell .
For example , to use the Haskell version of ' wc ' :
$ cat file .
txt | ghc -e ' wc_l ' UnixTools.hs
Or , one could define ' main ' to be a chosen tool / function ( add a line to the effect that " main = wc_l " ) and then compile the tool with
$ ghc -- make UnixTools.hs
The given Haskell codes presents yet a third way of doing things : much like the BusyBox suite of Unix tools , it is possible to compile a single monolithic binary and have it detect what name it is run by and then act appropriately .
This is the approach the following code takes : you can compile it and then make symbolic links ( like " ln -s UnixTools echo ; ln -s UnixTools cat " ) and then run those commands ( " ./ echo foo | ./ cat " would produce output of " foo " ) .
Fossil eggshell is a previously unrecognised source of ancient DNA .
Copyright Dr Jean - Luc Schwenninger .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
In a world first , scientists in Australia announced on Wednesday they had extracted DNA from the fossilised eggshells of extinct birds , including iconic giants such as the moa and elephant bird .
In a world first an international team of researchers have successfully extracted ancient DNA from the eggshells of various species of extinct birds .
The research , published in scientific journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B , shows that fossil eggshell is a previously unrecognised source of ancient DNA and can provide exceptional long - term preservation of DNA in warmer climates .
The findings will boost research in archaeology and biology where species identifications can add significantly to our understanding of biodiversity , evolutionary processes , past environmental change and dispersal of animal and human populations .
The study includes samples of Aepyornis sp , the giant Madagascan elephant bird collected by Dr Jean - Luc Schwenninger , a Quaternary geochronologist based at the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art ( RLAHA ) at Oxford University .
The bird looked like an outsized ostrich , standing about three metres high and weighing in excess of half a tonne .
It was the heaviest bird to have ever existed and produced eggs with a capacity of 11L ( equivalent to over two hundred chicken eggs or seven ostrich eggs ) .
Its eggs are the largest eggs ever known .
Since 1991 , Schwenninger and a team from Sheffield University , the University of Colorado , and Antananarivo ’s National Museum of Art and Archaeology in Madagascar have conducted large scale archaeological surveys of the Southern region of Madagascar and studied the timing of extinction of these giant flightless birds .
Whilst scouring the coastal dunes of Southern Madagascar they have found evidence of many of the bird ’s former nesting sites from concentrations of eggshell debris .
They have also excavated archaeological sites which document the rise and fall of a lost civilization with long - distance trade contacts to Africa ’s Swahili coast , the Persian Gulf and China .
Dr Schwenninger and his colleague Professor Michael Parker Pearson , from the University of Sheffield , believe that by the time this civilization flourished , from the 11th to the 13th century , the population of elephant birds was in serious decline .
The precise cause of extinction is not yet fully understood but it is probably linked to the arrival of humans .
AMS radiocarbon dating of eggshell remains , carried out at the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit based at RLAHA , indicate that most of the birds seem to have died out at about the same time as large numbers of settlements appear in the archaeological record at around AD 1000 .
The French governor Etienne de Flacourt refers to indigenous sightings of the Aepyornis in 1650 which describe the bird as a ‘ type of ostrich which people cannot catch and which searches out the most deserted places ’ .
The DNA breakthrough was achieved when Dr Schwenninger and doctoral student James Haile , based at Oxford ’s Ancient Biomolecules Centre considered analysing samples of sediment for his research .
Dr Shwenninger said : ‘ This time last year , I gave James a few samples from several of our archaeological and subfossil sites in Madagascar to see if any plant or animal DNA could be extracted .
I also mentioned to him that I had some eggshell which might be worth looking at .
In fact , we had already tried this back in 1998 and again in 2003 but without success .
He was very keen to give it another go and he succeeded where others , including his thesis supervisor had previously failed . ’

The labor movement has become a force to be reckoned with in the Arkansas Democratic Senate primary .
Lt. Gov. Bill Halter , labor ’s candidate against Sen.
Blanche Lincoln , is on track raise more money and is polling much better than her against all potential GOP opponents .
As of today , the Halter campaign has raised more than $ 2 million since it began March 1 .
That amount , which does not include millions of dollars pledged by the AFL - CIO and other unions early last month , is more than double the amount raised so far by the Lincoln campaign .
When all of the union money pledged comes in Halter could have a total of more than $ 6 million compared to Lincoln ’s war chest of $ 4 million .
In addition , state polls now also seem to be breaking his way .
A Rasmussen poll last weekend showed Halter performed better than Lincoln against all the potential GOP candidates .
( Both are still behind the Republican field , but Halter is less behind . )
Those numbers came after a Research 2000 poll for DailyKos showed similar results .
That poll had Halter gaining ground on Lincoln , closing the gap with her to 11 points .
Halter is challenging Lincoln in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate because Lincoln has refused to fight for important issues like the Employee Free Choice Act , health care , finance reform and the environment .
“ Our members have been watching Blanche ’s votes and they ’ve decided enough is enough , ” said Alan Hughes , president of the Arkansas AFL - CIO .
“ We ’re not throwing our money down the well and getting nothing back from it , he said , referring to his federation ’s earlier support for Lincoln .
“ The final straw , ” he said , “ was her decision to join Republicans in opposing the nomination of labor lawyer Craig Becker to a seat on the National Labor Relations Board . ”
Gerald McEntee , president of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , and chair of the AFL - CIO ’s political action committee , said the decision by the labor federation to support the Arkansas unions with large amounts of money was part of a new strategy by labor .
“ We ’re not going to let anybody take labor support for granted , ” he said , “ and if you double - cross us , we will take action . ”
Advocates of health care reform and many other progressive groups , including MoveOn.org . , have abandoned also Lincoln .
Many raised money to pay for TV ads against her during last year ’s health care debate when she came out against the public option .
A Halter ad running now declares , “ She did n’t stand up to the special interests .
She worked for them . ”
Liberal and progressive leaders from around the country are lending their support to the effort to dump the Senator .
MSNBC host Rachel Maddow drew applause during a recent talk at the Clinton School of Public Service in Little Rock , the state capital , when she said , “ It ’s one thing to be a conservative Democrat .
It ’s another thing to act like you do n’t want to be a Democrat at all . ”
The Halter campaign is also being helped by the anti-incumbent mood among voters .
Halter takes advantage of this by pointing out that Lincoln has spent four years in the House and nearly 12 years in the Senate .
On the issue of incumbency , the Lincoln campaign is clearly on the defensive .
The senator , who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee , is running ads in which she tries to embrace her long government experience and her votes against health care reform and curbs on polluters .
In one ad , she is standing in a crowd of children who are wildly tossing dollar bills up into the air .
She explains that wasted tax dollars are the reason she opposed the public option and cap - and - trade .
Another ad shows a farmer lifting bales of hay .
He looks sternly into the camera and says , “ It took us 184 years to get that chairmanship .
I do n’t know why we ’d want to give it up . ”
Responding to that ad directly , Halter has said , “ You ’re not chairman of the Agriculture Committee if you ’re not reelected . ”

I ’ve been a bit quiet over here on the blog the last couple of weeks , big apologies to those of you who have been waiting with gritted teeth for a new installment .
We ’ve been buried up to our necks in Project Archive , trawling around in the deep and dark depths of my past .
It has been a self illuminating experience , made all the more enjoyable by the fact that , Liam , one of the smashing interns helping out on the project , was about 4 when my career began , so , for him , I get the feeling that some of this stuff is , like , ancient history ?
The one area of my work that I had wanted to concentrate on initially was all the personal work that was undertaken while I was living in New York , beginning with the “ 9/11 Patriotic Road Trip ” that I embarked on with my then girlfriend .
About a week after the destruction of the Twin Towers we set off on a drive from New York that took us down the east coast to Jacksonville , Florida , along the Gulf of Mexico to New Orleans , up from Galveston , Texas to Alberquerque , New Mexico and on through to San Francisco , California .
It took us a month and it was a strange and intense trip .
In Alabama , I remember , a man in a pick up pointed his gun at me when I tried to take his picture .
However , my plan to start scanning all that stuff was interrupted by an incredibly exciting offer from some people in Moscow that we received 2 weeks ago .
It required that I pull out lots of portraits from the archive for a big show there .
I ca n’t say much more than that about it until we have signed contracts in the can , so my plan to show y’all a slice of post 9/11 Americana is going to have to wait on for now .
In the meanie , here ’s something we have dug up instead .
This is from a 1994 shoot with Milla Jovovich at her apartment in New York City .
I do n’t think I ’ve looked at the film since I shot it .
Seeing it for the first time in 16 years has been a bit of a shock .
The thing that immediately came back was the memory of being mugged by a gun and knife wielding duo on the Lower East Side the night before the shoot .
My camera was taken from me and I very nearly did n’t get to see the sun come up the next morning when I called the assailants a “ bunch of f****** c**** ” as they walked away from me .
It was a calculated decision , based on the belief that they were far enough from me to not be bothered about coming back as I uttered the words at them .
I was exactly 100 % wrong in my calculation .
They took it so personally that they decided to try and kill me and the friend I was with by chasing us all the way up Ludlow Street until , at the junction of East Houston we ran into 2 of the NYPD ’s coffee slurping , doughnut gobbling finest , hanging out on the bonnet of their blue and white .
Saved .
The muggers scarpered back the way they came and the Po- Leece were so not arsed about trying to catch them .
The next morning , though , all I had was my other camera – a Contax T2 point & shoot , which you can see Milla holding in some of these pictures .
I was so naïve in those days that I do n’t think it occurred to me to even try and get hold of a replacement camera from one of New York ’s rental houses but , then again , I had no credit card and thus , no means of securing anything I might have wanted .
However , David , my fellow muggee from the night before had an old Pentax K1000 and he very kindly let me borrow it .
Looking at the film now , what strikes me is how cavalier I seemed to have been in my methods back then .
My choice of film is all over the place .
I photographed her on 4 different films : 400 Tri-X , 3200 T - Max , Agfa 1000 E6 , Fuji 400 C41 .
Some of the Agfa I processed as straight E6 and some of it I cross processed in C41 , which was all the rage back then .
When I look at it now it ’s disgusting .
What is absolutely clear , though , is that I was totally experimenting .
I had not yet found myself because , at that age , 25 , I did n’t know who I was .
Nowadays I absolutely know who I am and I ’ll shoot in a consistent way throughout so that a portrait session will , in my head , have a clearly defined beginning , middle and end period , because I have learned some craft to go with my art , or if you want to put it this way , I now have some head to balance out my heart .
Back then I regarded it all as a bit of a laugh and it ’s hard to see why I should n’t have .
I was photographing people who were the same age as me .
We were equals and peers , it felt personal and free , which is just the way it should be .
1 . The number of federal employees exceeded 2.8 million for the first time in January 2009 , and federal jobs have increased by 82,000 employees since December 2008 .
2. Average federal salaries exceed average private - sector pay in more than eight out of 10 comparable occupations .
From
USA Today
, a sampling of average annual salaries in 2008 are displayed below , the most recent data ( click to enlarge ) :
3 . Also from USA Today , the typical federal worker is paid $ 11,091 more per year ( 20 % higher salary ) than private - sector workers in the same occupation , based on median annual salaries .
Federal Employees : $ 66,591
Private - Sector Employees : $ 55,500
4. According to USA Today , average annual benefits ( health , pension , etc. ) in 2008 for federal employees was more than 4 times greater than benefits for private workers , a difference of almost $ 31,000 per year :
Federal employees : $ 40,875
Private sector worker : $ 9,882
Other key findings from
USA Today
:
• Federal .
The federal pay premium cut across all job categories — white - collar , blue - collar , management , professional , technical and low - skill .
In all , 180 jobs paid better average salaries in the federal government ( 83 % ) ; 36 paid better in the private sector ( 17 % ) .
• Private .
The private sector paid more on average in a select group of high - skill occupations , including lawyers , veterinarians and airline pilots .
The government 's 5,200 computer research scientists made an average of $ 95,190 , about $ 10,000 less than the average in the corporate world .
• State and local .
State government employees had an average salary of $ 47,231 in 2008 , about 5 % less than comparable jobs in the private sector .
City and county workers earned an average of $ 43,589 , about 2 % more than private workers in similar jobs .
State and local workers have higher total compensation than private workers when the value of benefits is included .

30th September 2009
Some months ago I wrote about a reference I found in an official intelligence report , written by a British officer in Berlin soon after the end of the Second World War , that another war was likely and this time German soldiers and airmen would fight on the side of the British and Americans against the Russians :
“ The war between the Russians and the democracies is approaching and indeed has already begun , and Germany will of course be invited to participate .
An International Air Brigade is to be formed for use in the war against Japan .
Volunteers are invited and will be trained in England .
Several offers have been received . ”
( See : More on Goronwy Rees and his six day tour of Germany in July 1945 )
I was surprised by this , and since then I ’ve looked out for other references to people believing that war between Britain , America and Russia was likely , well before relations between the four victorious Allies broke down , the start of Berlin airlift in 1948 and the division of Germany .
While researching a different subject – the way ‘ communism ’ or ‘ Bolshevism ’ was described as a ‘ disease ’ , rather than as a set of ideas or a political doctrine , by people in Britain between the wars and after and by Winston Churchill in particular – I came across a reference to Operation Unthinkable .
Apparently documents released by The National Archives in 1998 showed that in May 1945 , immediately after the end of the war in Europe , Churchill instructed his staff to prepare top secret plans for a surprise Anglo - American attack on the Soviet Union , with the assistance of 10 German divisions , under the codename “ Operation Unthinkable : Russia : Threat to Western Civilisation . ”
The aim of the plan was to get “ a square deal for Poland ” with free and fair elections based on secret ballots and the participation of democratic leaders from all parties , not just the communists , in the government of the country .
For planning purposes , the attack was scheduled to be launched on 1st July 1945 .
The military planners soon discovered that the idea was hazardous , to say the least , as the Soviet Union had four times as many soldiers and twice as many tanks in Western Europe , as the British and Americans combined , and recommended it was not taken any further .
Churchill gave way and modified the terms of reference to defence rather than attack : covering the “ hypothetical ” case that US troops would go home , and the island of Britain needed to be defended against an attack from Russia .
But the question remains whether “ Operation Unthinkable ” was just an isolated example of military planning for all contingencies , and how close Britain , the US and the Soviet Union really were to war in 1945 .
Here are four pieces of evidence I ’ve come across in my research which could have some bearing on this :
Firstly , the curious incident of the missing telegram .
In 1954 Churchill said , in a speech in his constituency at Woodford in Essex that , even before the war was over , he had “ telegraphed to Lord Montgomery directing him to be careful in collecting the German arms , to stack them so they could easily be issued again to the German soldiers whom we should have to work with if the Soviet advance continued . ”
This caused a furore in the British press , and rather spoilt the celebrations for Churchill ’s 80th birthday , as a number of Labour MPs , including Barbara Castle , refused to sign a Birthday Book in his honour because he had been willing to “ use Nazi soldiers against our war allies . ”
Montgomery , when asked about this , at first said he had received the telegram , but then could not find it in his papers .
Churchill withdrew the remark saying he must have confused one telegram with another and the matter died down .
However , as David Reynolds and other historians have found , in Montgomery ’s papers at the Imperial War Museum archives there is a handwritten note , dated June 1959 , entitled “ The Truth about the Telegram ” , in which Montgomery confirms he received a verbal , but not written , order from Churchill to ‘ stack ’ German weapons , in case they might be needed to fight the Russians .
“ On 14th May 1945 I flew to London from Germany to see the Prime Minister to tell him that the problems of government in Germany were so terrific that he must at once appoint a C - in - C and Military Governor … .
The announcement was made on 22nd May .
At our meeting in Downing Street the P.M. got very steamed up about the Russians and about the zones of occupation – which would entail a large scale withdrawal on our part .
He ordered that I was not to destroy the weapons of the 2 million Germans who had surrendered on Luneburg Heath on the 4th May .
All must be kept , we might have to fight the Russians with German help . ”
A month later no further instructions had been received , so according to Montgomery :
“ On 14 June I got fed up with guarding the weapons .
We had signed the surrender in Berlin on 5th June and agreed to set up the Control Commission for 4 - Power Government of Germany .
So I sent the attached telegram to the War Office on 14 June 1945 .
Things were pretty hectic in Whitehall in those days , the Coalition government was coming to an end ; a general election was announced ; it was impossible to get a decision , a firm one , on anything .
I got no answer .
I waited for one week .
I then gave orders for all the personal weapons and equipment to be destroyed !!
Then in November 1954 , Winston Churchill in a speech at Woodford referred , unwisely to the order he had given .
He said he had sent me a telegram .
It could not be found .
There was no telegram . ”
Secondly , despite official denials by British officials that there were differences between them and their Soviet allies , rumours abounded that things were not as they seemed .
For example in his book ‘ Berlin Twilight ’ ( published in 1947 ) Lt - Colonel Byford - Jones described the lack of cooperation between the Russians and other victorious allies immediately after the end of the war , writing that :
“ If a man builds a high wall round his house , locks his gates , refuses to admit his neighbours , he should not be surprised if the building becomes the centre of morbid curiosity … .
This illustrates the situation in which the Russian zone of Germany found itself in the eight months after the war ’s end … .
Officers of the Allied forces , with whom Russia had been co-operating in the world ’s greatest war , were suddenly treated as would be saboteurs or spies , and were refused admittance into the Russian zone , the frontiers of which , adjoining those of the American and British , were closely guarded day and night ….
Journalists and broadcasters belonging to Allied and neutral countries were forbidden to enter .
It was not surprising in these circumstances that a new Crusade seemed imminent , that officers talked of little else at one time in their British and American messes over strong Schnaps and Steinhaiger [ beer ] than ‘ the coming conflict ’ .
There was something too ‘ cloak and dagger ’ about these conversations .
One did not mention the words Soviets or Russia or even the Red terror ; one spoke of ‘ they ’ and ‘ it ’ in appropriately lowered tones , and everyone had the key to the code . ”
Thirdly , a key element of Nazi propaganda in the closing months of the war was the attempt to persuade the Western allies that they should join with them in forming a “ Bulwark against Bolshevism . ”
For example in a speech on 2nd May 1945 , after Hitler had committed suicide , but before the end of the war on May 8th , Count Schwerin von Krosigk , foreign secretary in the interim German government headed by Admiral Dönitz , said :
“ But the more German territory in the east , which ought to form a basis for food supplies for the starving people in the west , falls into the hands of the Bolsheviks , the most speedily and terribly will famine sweep over Europe .
Nurtured by this distress , Bolshevism flourishes .
A Bolshevised Europe constitutes the first phase on the path towards a world revolution which the Soviets have been persistently pursuing for over twenty - five years . ”
Incidentally , this speech , by Schwerin von Krosigk contains one of the first references I have found to the existence of an “ iron curtain ” separating East and West : “ In the east , the iron curtain is advancing even further , behind which the work of annihilation proceeds hidden from the eyes of the world . ”
This was well before Churchill used the phrase at his speech at Fulton Missouri , on March 5th 1946 , to say : “ From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic , an iron curtain has descended across the Continent . ”
Please note I am not claiming that Churchill or other British politicians or soldiers were influenced by Nazi propaganda – if anything this made them take extra care to emphasise the unity of the Allies – but it is still interesting that plans were made to attack Russia , Britain ’s wartime ally , despite the enemy they had both defeated saying this was exactly what they should do .
( In war you do n’t normally do what your enemy says you should ! )
Fourthly , how much did Stalin and other Soviet Union leaders know about “ Operation Unthinkable ?
It seems they were , justifiably , very suspicious of British intentions at the end of the war and for several months afterwards .
At the Four Power Control Council in Berlin , the Russians claimed , on several occasions , that the British were not meeting their obligations under the Potsdam Agreement to disband the German army .
At the meeting on 20th November 1945 , Marshal Zhukov , the Russian representative , tabled a formal notice objecting to the “ presence of organised units of the former German Army in the British Zone of Occupation . ”
Montgomery was incensed by this , writing in a telegram to Arthur Street , the Permanent Secretary of the British “ Control Office for Germany and Austria ” in London that :
“… it is a mystery to me why it should be thought that we do not want to carry out the POTSDAM agreement in disbanding the German armed forces .
We have fought them in two bloody wars and our very existence as a nation has been threatened by them .
That we should retain any affection for them or should desire their continued existence is a matter beyond my comprehension . ”
Perhaps Montgomery was sincere when he wrote this , or perhaps he was being disingenuous .
I do n’t know .
In any case , by now , in the autumn of 1945 , the situation seems to have become very messy .
Of the roughly two million German soldiers who had surrendered into British custody at the end of the war , over half a million had been released to work on the land or in the coal mines ( under operations codenamed “ Barleycorn ” and “ Coalscuttle ” ) .
Others had been sent to the US zone , but around 700,000 were still detained .
Whatever British intentions were immediately after the end of the war in May and June 1945 , there were now other reasons for not fully disbanding the German army , as Montgomery explained in the “ Notes on the Occupation of Germany ” held with his papers at the Imperial War Museum :
“ There were two main reasons for the presence of the 700,000 ex-Wehrmacht personnel in concentration areas awaiting disbandment … first , we had nowhere to put them if they were disbanded and we could not guard them if they were dispersed in prison camps over our area ; second , His Majesty ’s Government required 225,000 Germans as reparations labour for the United Kingdom . ”
As Montgomery explained in a statement at the subsequent Control Council on 20th November , German soldiers who surrendered at the end of the war were not formally designated as prisoners of war because if they were so described “ we should have to accord them certain privileges in conformity with the Geneva Convention .
We should be debarred from using them for certain tasks .
We should have to feed them on a relatively high scale of rations . ”
In addition , the British army in Germany were using some German soldiers , still under the command of their own officers , as so - called ‘ Dienstgruppen ’ ( or service units ) to carry out general labouring tasks .
As Noel Annan explained in his book ‘ Changing Enemies ’
“ The labour for these schemes was provided by keeping the German army in being and renaming them DienstGruppen , although these had shortly to be dissolved following Russian complaints … ”
Somewhat reluctantly , in response to Russian pressure , the remaining captured German soldiers were released , in a process given the intriguing name of “ Operation Clobber ” , which , according to an army conference held on 4th December was due to start on 10th December 1945 and finish on 20th January 1946 – so you could say this blog post traces British ideas on what to do with the two million German soldiers who surrendered and were interned at the end of the war : from Operation “ Unthinkable ” , via “ Barleycorn ” and “ Coalscuttle ” to “ Clobber . ”

PayPal Problems [ 6 comments | View | Add a Comment ] Written by Admin Kalante at 01:20 PM -- Monday January 31 2005 GMT
The PayPal situation has still not been resolved , thus the majority of payments that have been made over the past few days have not yet been processed .
We will not be able to do so correctly until PayPal fix their notification system , but as soon as they do our system will begin processing the backlog of payments .
We have received a fairly large amount of emails about this issue and have been reluctant to deal with them individually until we knew exactly what the situation was - However , any that have n't been dealt with yet will be informed via an email to come read this news item .
Again , I would like to apologise on behalf of Newzbin for these issues -
We will be extending the free 14 days to all affected users once this situation has been resolved .
You can check the status of PayPal 's IPN system here :
http://www.paypaldev.org/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=8270
We will provide updates as we find out anything new .
In the same way that PayPal appreciate our patience , we also appreciate yours - There is n't much we can do until PayPal resolves their situation . :)
Update :
The situation appears to be resolved according to PayPal .
Please note that transactions may take anytime between a few seconds to a few hours ( or days in the case of eChecks , ) that is normal - Hopefully all accounts in the backlog have been updated now .
Let us know if you have any further problems !

While unquestionably grotesque , leeches tend to be rather benign creatures .
They latch onto a host , gorge themselves on blood and fall off of their own accord – a little disgusting but nothing to worry about .
Of course , there are leech species that have adapted to feed on mucous membranes and that have a preference for bodily orifices ; the newly discovered “ T - Rex ” leech , is one of those .
The leech was named Tyrannobdella rex ( tyrant leech king ) for its spectacular choppers , which stand 130 microns high and are slightly wider than a human hair .
The leech species was initially discovered in 1997 but forgotten .
Science Daily reports that it came to the attention of Mark Siddall , curator in the Division of Invertebrate Zoology at the American Museum of Natural History , when Dr. Renzo Arauco - Brown , a Peruvian medical doctor from the School of Medicine at the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Lima sent him a specimen that he had collected from the nose of a nine - year - old girl who frequented the lakes and rivers of Peru ’s Amazon region .
Further research by Siddall uncovered two forgotten specimens from 1997 .
T - Rex seems to have adapted to feed from bodily orifices .
Alejandro Oceguera - Figueroa , Siddall ’s student , described it as having “ a single jaw with eight very large teeth , and extremely small genitalia . ”
Siddall noted :
That ’s at least five times as high as other leeches .
And everyone found with these had a frontal headache .
Their teeth are big and these things hurt .
Regarding the choice of name , Siddall told Science Daily :
We named it Tyrannobdella rex because of its enormous teeth .
Besides , the earliest species in this family of these leeches no - doubt shared an environment with dinosaurs about 200 million years ago when some ancestor of our T. rex may have been up that other T. rex ’s nose .
In his PLoS ONE article , Siddall concluded that T. rex posed a very real threat to the health of people in the western Amazonian region :
This new species , found feeding from the upper respiratory tract of humans in Perú , clarifies an expansion of the family Praobdellidae to include the new species Tyrannobdella rex n. gen.
n.sp. , along with others in the genera Dinobdella , Myxobdella , Praobdella and Pintobdella .
Moreover , the results clarify a single evolutionary origin of a group of leeches that specializes on mucous membranes , thus , posing a distinct threat to human health .

Iffit Rehman : " Our goal is not to remove a child from his or her family " Protecting families from guns and gang - related crime , child trafficking and prostitution , are issues that Birmingham social worker Iffit Rehman has to deal with - along with trying to get home on time for her son 's birthday .
The senior social worker for Birmingham City Council said her role was " very draining , emotionally and physically " .
Recently it felt like the whole service had received " a kicking " from an outraged public in the wake of the Khyra Ishaq case , Ms Rehman said .
And this , despite child protection workers being rebuffed on several occasions when they tried to visit Khyra at home , a High Court inquiry into the girl 's death heard .
Inside the Aston social services offices , the chief executive 's motto hangs on the wall , and reads : " A good day for me is when I get positive feedback on the service we provide . "
It is hurtful when people say we are not doing a good job when you have members of staff who are committed and dedicated
Iffit Rahman , senior social worker
Its modest ambition is perhaps not surprising , bearing in mind Birmingham has the busiest social services offices in England and is currently trying to fill 150 vacancies .
Ms Rehman said : " You 'll get doors slammed in your face , you 'll get verbally abused .
" As yet I have not been physically threatened but I know a few colleagues who have come very close to being physically assaulted . "
Seven - year - old Khyra was home - tutored and kept a virtual prisoner at home in Handsworth , Birmingham .
She was starved to death by her mother Angela Gordon and her partner Junaid Abuhamza .
The pair have been jailed for manslaughter .
Couple jailed for starving girl A High Court ruling into Khyra 's care proceedings said she may have survived if there had been " an adequate initial assessment and proper adherence by the educational welfare services to its guidance " .
Ms Rehman said : " Morale has been low and it has been difficult .
" It is hurtful when people say we are not doing a good job when you have members of staff who are committed and dedicated - and they are in this office . "
" If they were n't I would n't be working here , but I like my job and I do appreciate the management and I appreciate my colleagues . "
The service was repeatedly rebuffed when it tried to intervene in Khyra 's case , the High Court inquiry in 2008 heard .
Social workers made numerous house calls to check on Khyra , but were denied access and Khyra 's mother eventually rang social services to tell them not to attempt further home visits .
She was found emaciated at her home on 17 May , 2008 and was confirmed dead at hospital .
Work can feel like running around like a headless chicken , Ms Rahman said The NSPCC has now called for social workers in child protection cases to be allowed to see children away from their parent or guardian .
Back in the office Ms Rehman said : " It can feel like running around like headless chickens .
" It is a fairly smooth day today .
I have n't had my lunch break , it 's my son 's birthday and I am looking forward to going home on time .
" We have to do a specific job and yes there will be times we are unable to meet certain needs .
" There are positive changes being made by upper management and senior management . "
Ms Rehman said child protection social workers were often " stigmatised " as people who only removed children from their families , without recognising the supportive role they played too .
" Our goal is n't to go in to remove the child from his or her family , " she said .
' We are accountable ' " We always try other options , we try to build relations and we try to get them to realise how their behaviours are impacting on their children . "
If that fails social services tries to enlist the support of the extended family , friends or neighbours to help support the child at home , she said .
" If all else fails that 's when children 's services have to resort to care , " she added .
The decision to place children in care is not made by frontline social workers like Ms Rehman though .
" We go out and assess a situation , as a frontline worker that is our job , " she said .
" Yes we are responsible for our assessment and we are accountable , however any decisions that have to be made are made by team managers and upper management .
" We do n't sort of say OK , right this child is at significant risk of harm , therefore I am going to put him or her into care - we do not have the authority . "

* For homeowners owing more than 120 pct of home value
* BofA to offer forgiveness of up to 30 pct in two stages
* Statement due Weds , also covers negative amortization loans ( Adds detail , background )
WASHINGTON , March 23 ( Reuters ) - Bank of America will on Wednesday announce plans to start forgiving mortgage loan principal for troubled homeowners who owe more than 120 percent of their home ’s value or are battling ever - expanding “ negative amortization ” loans .
According to a summary of the program obtained by Reuters , Bank of America pledged to offer an “ earned principal forgiveness ” of up to 30 percent in two stages .
The lender will first offer an interest - free forbearance of principal that the homeowner can turn into forgiven principal annually over five years , provided they stay current on their payments .
The forgiveness can allow a homeowner to bring the loan value back down to 100 percent of the home ’s value over five years , according to the plan , confirmed by sources close to the matter .
The plan , to begin in May , is among the first by a U.S. mortgage lender that takes a systematic approach to reducing mortgage principal to tackle the thorny issue of preventing foreclosures when home values drop well below the amount owed .
A Bank of America spokesman declined comment .
Announcement of the program in Washington comes as U.S. lawmakers and housing advocates are becoming increasingly vocal about the need for principal writedowns in order to save homes on a large scale .
Amid stubbornly high unemployment , homeowners are seen as more likely to simply abandon an unaffordable mortgage when they have no equity or are deep “ underwater ” on the loan .
The U.S. Treasury ’s mortgage modification program has largely relied on reducing interest rates , and has been criticized for failing to address a steep and painful reduction in home values .
The announcement also will come two days after two Washington state residents sued Bank of America for allegedly reneging on a promise it made to modify troubled mortgages when it took $ 25 billion in taxpayer bailout money .
The lawsuit alleged that the lender has “ seriously strung out , delayed and otherwised hindered ” modifications because it had financial incentives to do so .
NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION LOANS TARGETED
Under the plan , Bank of America also will slash the principal balance on the worst of the high - risk mortgages written during the height of the housing boom , the so - called “ payment option ” adjustable rate mortgages that had a negative amortization feature that allowed the principal balance to grow .
On such loans that are delinquent and in danger of imminent default , the lender will announce that it will cut principal to as low as a 95 percent of the property ’s value .
Bank of America lender also will expand its modification program to consider payment reductions on prime hybrid adjustable rate mortgages that have floating interest rates after two years and will extend its National Homeowner Retention Plan by six months until the end of 2012 .
The bank expects to be operationally ready to start the earned principal reduction plan in May .
It plans to identify mortgages that may be eligible for these programs and proactively contact homeowners to request documents to verify eligibility .

DETROIT --
The Detroit Red Wings played with urgency from the drop of the puck Thursday and maintained that desperation for 60 minutes as Henrik Zetterberg led the way with a determined effort .
, Zetterberg responded with one of his best performances of the season , contributing a goal and two assists in a 5 - 1 victory against the Minnesota Wild at Joe Louis Arena .
The three - point night was Zetterberg 's second - most productive game of the season ( he had five points against Anaheim on Nov. 14 ) and tied him with Pavel Datsyuk for the team lead with 56 points .
" You always want to contribute and help the team win , '' Zetterberg said .
" I have n't really been doing that like I have the last few years .
When you 're going through a slump , you just have to keep going , shoot the puck a little more and work a little harder , do the little things right and , hopefully , it will turn . ''
Johan Franzen scored two goals .
The Red Wings were strong on special teams , getting a power - play goal from Tomas Holmstrom , a short - handed tally from Drew Miller and continuing their recent stretch of strong penalty killing ( the Wild were 0 - for - 5 on the power play ) .
" Everyone 's aware of the situation .
We 're fighting for a playoff spot , we do n't have a lot of games left , '' Miller said .
" We know we have to bring it every night .
We can't just bring it for part of the game , we have to bring it for the whole 60 . ''
Zetterberg said he realizes he is one of the players who must lead the way in getting this team to the playoffs .
" I always put pressure on myself .
I try not to care what other people are saying , '' Zetterberg said .
" You just have to believe in yourself and keep going and do the best you can . ''
Red Wings coach Mike Babcock tried to spark Zetterberg by moving fast - skating , playmaking third - line center Valtteri Filppula to his wing , opposite Dan Cleary .
" No one is challenging himself more than Z is , '' Babcock said .
" These are proud guys .
They know how good they 're capable of being .
He wants to be that good every night .
" We tried to give him as much help as we could tonight with linemates .
Fil 's a good passer , we just felt that might be a good situation for him .
Good for him .
He 's got to feel good about himself , and that 's real important . ''
Said Zetterberg : " He 's really skilled , offensively and defensively , he can make plays .
It 's fun to play with him .
We 'll see how long it lasts . ''
The Red Wings raced out to a 3 - 0 lead in the first period , scoring on three of their first eight shots barely 10 minutes into the game .
Franzen ignited the rally with a blast from the top of the faceoff circle that bounced in off of goaltender Josh Harding 's glove at 2:25 .
Holmstrom scored his 19th goal at 9:19 , taking a pass from Zetterberg just inside the blue line and firing a long shot that deflected in off the stick of defenseman Nick Schultz .
Zetterberg followed with his 19th goal at 10:15 , converting a pass from behind the net by Patrick Eaves , who also spearheaded the team 's penalty - killing efforts .
" This is the type of game where you can't just let them hang around , because they 'll come back and hurt you , '' said Red Wings goalie Jimmy Howard , who improved to 25 - 15 - 8 .
" We knew we had to get on them quick .
And once we got them down , stay at it , keep going . ''
The Wild cut the Red Wings ' lead to 3 - 1 on Andrew Ebbett 's goal with 11 seconds remaining in the first period -- a shot from a sharp angle that went in off Brad Stuart 's skate .
Minnesota was n't able to build off that momentum , however .
Miller made it 4 - 1 at 12:58 of the second period with his first career short - handed goal .
Filppula broke in alone after taking a pass from Miller .
He skated past the front of the net , stopped and fired a close - range shot off Harding 's chest .
It bounced in off Miller , who crashed the net .
Franzen wrapped up the scoring with his seventh goal in 12 games this season , firing a wrist shot through Harding 's five - hole at 14:43 of the third period .
" We 've had some good games and have n't been able to put enough strings together , ' Babcock said .
" This is a challenge for us .
We got to put a run together . ''
Fashion and nerds do n't generally mix , but a growing bunch of creative , anime - obsessed Australians are breaking down that stereotype by getting their geek on through cosplay .
Cosplay - a combination of costume and role play - originated in Japan as a way for comic , video game and animation fiends to imitate their favourite characters .
It spread to Australia in 2001 and experts say the often expensive and time - consuming hobby is becoming increasingly popular .
Bryan Marriage , 27 , and Melanie de Chantraine , 32 , are two of the country 's oldest cosplayers .
The Queenslanders have been cosplaying for nearly eight years .
Between them they 've created more than 40 costumes , spending between $ 100 and $ 1,000 on each .
Bryan described his foray into the scene at Brisbane 's 2003 pop culture expo Supanova as nerve - racking .
" I was very nervous because I did n't know a lot of people there and I 'd come from Toowoomba , so I was n't in and around the fandom crowd at that stage , " he said .
" Getting up on stage was scary but everyone was cheering and it got the adrenaline going ... through that I got in contact with a lot of other cosplayers . "
He admits his obsession is left of centre .
" I was always a little bit bizarre and quirky , " he said .
" At school I did drama and I had a lot of fun doing that , but when cosplay came along it was sort of a release , to do something similar to drama .
" Probably what 's kept me in it is friends and the people I get to meet and also a love for different shows and different series .
" It gives me that extra dimension to show my fandom ... you get to display the feelings for a character you have and it lets you release your inner child . "
Melanie , thought to be Australia 's most experienced and well - known cosplayer , says she thrives on the hobby 's creative challenges .
" It 's a creative outlet and it gives me something to do .
I can't imagine what else I 'd be doing if I was n't doing this , " she said .
" It 's just seeing the challenge - if I can make this 2D character exist in the real world - and sometimes I reckon they 're trying to break me . "
She says Japanese anime is not like anything you see in Australia .
" With Western characters the designs are a bit prudish , but the Japanese characters are just so out there , " she said .
" They do n't care if they look stupid and I think sometimes they look so stupid that they loop back around to awesome . "
Game on
Supanova 2010 begins in Brisbane today .
It will then move around the country to Melbourne , Sydney and Perth .
Supanova is a hub for both veteran and budding cosplayers , hosting competitions for them to show off their intricately designed costumes and play out their much - loved characters .
Sydney student , 22 - year - old Christie Lee , won the national cosplay competition last year .
While she has only been cosplaying for a few years , the dedicated champion has already concocted more than 30 costumes .
" Making every costume is a learning experience , " she said .
" It 's a way of expressing how much I love a particular story or how much I love a particular character .
" A lot of people appreciate it and they are amazed by how you created your outfits ... when you get to a convention it 's kind of like walking into Disneyland .
" You see your favourite characters walking around looking beautiful .
It gives you a sense of satisfaction and happiness . "
Her winning piece was based on Alice , the heroine from the Japanese manga ( comic ) and anime series , Pandora Hearts .
" I 'd never made a big , humungous Victorian dress before and I never really want to make another one again , " she said .
Brisbane student , 19 - year - old Sabina Myers , is also excited by the costume side of cosplaying .
" A lot of people have different approaches to how they prefer to do cosplay , " she said .
" I like to design my own costumes because it 's more fun and I do n't always pick things from Japanese anime . "
One of her recent designs was an interpretation of the White Rabbit from Alice In Wonderland .
" Even I think it 's weird , " she said .
" My friends and I try to keep real about how strange this hobby is .
It is a strange hobby and people will think it 's odd , but I 'm okay with that and I enjoy it . "
Popular culture
Madman , an Australian distributor of anime , initiated the national competition last year .
Head judge Sylvester
Ip says there are hundreds of cosplayers around Australia .
" We attend about 20 events and every event we go to there are more and more people in costumes and cosplaying in general , " he said .
" We 're definitely seeing an increasingly popular pop culture thing that kids are getting into .
It 's definitely increasing and as the years go by we expect to see more and more entrants . "
Veteran cosplayers Bryan and Melanie agree the scene is growing .
" With more conventions , more competitions , people are becoming more aware of it and participating , " Bryan said .
" So it is increasing probably a lot more quickly than I would have ever expected . "
But Melanie says the rise in cosplaying has been accompanied by an increase in cattiness .
" The first con that I went to was in Adelaide and there may have been 10 of us , " she said .
" I went back to that con two years ago and there was over 100 , so it has definitely grown ... with the rise that I 've seen over the last eight years it can only get bigger .
" But it is getting competitive and nasty , with a lot of people taking it far too seriously - a lot of bitchiness and people talking behind people 's backs . "
Melanie is an Australian representative for the World Cosplay Summit - an annual international event held in Japan - which includes 15 countries and hundreds of thousands of participants .
Christie just returned from spending a week in Japan , her prize for being last year 's national champion .
After experiencing cosplay there in its most original form , she says she still prefers Australia 's take on it .
" Japan is very strict with the cosplay thing , which was really irksome , " she said .
" Japan cosplay is much more extreme ... I 'd never seen so many cosplayers in one place in my life .
They 're more perfectionist than us .
They put much more detail into the hair and their make - up .
" They 're just so used to seeing so many cosplayers all together , I guess it just loses the spark of uniqueness over there .
" But here there is a lot more variety .
No -one really looks the same and it's much more open here in saying : ' Oh my god , your outfit looks awesome .
Can I take your photo ? '. "
Eleven Years of Erlang
I 've written about how I started using Erlang .
A good question is why , after eleven years , am I still using it ?
For the record , I do use other languages .
I enjoy writing Python code , and I 've taught other people how to use Python .
This website is statically generated by a Perl program that I had fun writing .
And I dabble in various languages of the month which have cropped up .
( Another website I used to maintain was generated by a script that I kept reimplementing .
It started out written in Perl , but transitioned through at least REBOL , J , and Erlang before I was through . )
One of the two big reasons I 've stuck with Erlang is because of its simplicity .
The functional core of Erlang can and has been described in a couple of short chapters .
Knowledge of four data types -- numbers , atoms , lists , tuples -- is enough for most programming problems .
Binaries and funs can be tackled later .
This simplicity is good , because the difficult part of Erlang and any mostly - functional language is in learning to write code without destructive updates .
The language itself should n't pour complexity on top of that .
There are many possibilities for extending Erlang with new data types , with an alternative to records being high on the list .
Should strings be split off from lists into a distinct entity ?
What about arrays of floats , so there 's no need to box each value ?
How about a " machine integer " type that 's represented without tagging and that does n't get automatically promoted to an arbitrarily sized " big number " when needed ?
All of those additional types are optimizations .
Lists work just fine as strings , but even the most naive implementation of strings as unicode arrays would take half the memory of the equivalent lists , and that 's powerful enticement .
When Knuth warned of premature optimization , I like to think he was n't talking so much about obfuscating code in the process of micro-optimizing for speed , but he was pointing out that code is made faster by specializing it .
The process of specialization reduces your options , and you end up with a solution that 's more focused and at the same time more brittle .
You do n't want to do that until you really need to .
It may be an overreaction to my years of optimization - focused programming , but I like the philosophy of making the Erlang system fast without just caving in and providing C - style abilities .
I know how to write low - level C .
And now I know how to write good high - level functional code .
If I had been presented with a menu of optimization - oriented data types in Erlang , that might never have happened .
I 'd be writing C in the guise of Erlang .
The second reason I 'm still using Erlang is because I understand it .
I do n't mean I know how to code in it , I mean I get it all the way down .
I know more or less what transformations are applied by the compiler and the BEAM loader .
I know how the BEAM virtual machine works .
And unlike most languages , Erlang holds together as a full system .
You could decide to ditch all existing C compilers and CPUs and start over completely , and Erlang could serve as a foundation for this new world of computing .
The ECOMP project ( warning : PowerPoint ) proved that an FPGA running the Erlang VM directly gives impressive results .
Let me zoom in on one specific detail of the Erlang runtime .
If you take an arbitrary piece of data in a language of the Lua or Python family , at the lowest - level it ends up wrapped inside a C struct .
There 's a type field , maybe a reference count , and because it 's a heap allocated block of memory there 's other hidden overhead that comes along with any dynamic allocation ( such as the size of the block ) .
Lua is unabashedly reliant on malloc - like heap management for just about everything .
Erlang memory handling is much more basic .
There 's a block of memory per process , and it grows from bottom to top until full .
Most data objects are n't wrapped in structs .
A tuple , for example , is one cell of data for the length followed by the number of cells in the tuple .
The system identifies it as a tuple by tagging the pointer to the tuple .
You know the memory used for a tuple is always 1 + N , period .
Were I trying to optimize data representation by hand , with the caveat that type info needs to be included , it would be tough to do significantly better .
I 'm sure some people are correctly pointing out that this is how most Lisp and Scheme systems have worked since those languages were developed .
There 's nothing preventing an imperative language from using the same methods ( and indeed this is sometimes the case ) .
Erlang takes this further by having a separate block of memory for each process , so when the block gets full only that particular block needs to be garbage collected .
If it 's a 64 K block , it takes microseconds to collect , as compared to potentially traversing a heap containing the hundreds of megabytes of data in the full running system .
Disallowing destructive updates allows some nice optimizations in the garbage collector , because pointers are guaranteed to reference older objects ( this is sometimes called a " unidirectional heap " ) .
Together these are much simpler than building a real - time garbage collector that can survive under the pressure of giant heaps .
Would I use Erlang for everything ?
Of course not .
Erlang is clearly a bad match for some types of programming .
It would be silly to force - fit Erlang into the iPhone , for example , with Apple promoting Objective C as the one true way .
But it 's the best mix of power and simplicity that I 've come across .

It 's not often I find technology - related items when reading bedtime stories to my kids , but there it was : Fozzie Bear discovering a cloud computer .
The book in question is " Baby Fozzie On Cloud Nine " , written by Barry Keating and copyright 1987 .
A bunch of Muppet Babies books were given to us by a neighbor , and we 've been reading through the stories each night .
The plot in this book is that Fozzie Bear has a really good joke to tell the other Muppet Babies , but they 're all busy doing other things .
Fozzie gets taken on a journey via his red kite and visits a bunch of other clouds , where the cloud people are attentive and listen to him .
Each cloud , however , is specific to a different Muppet , and Fozzie ends up on Cloud 5 where he discovers the cloud computer .
Here 's the photographic proof :
I 'm sure that if Fozzie stayed on Cloud 5 he would have perfected a way to create software - as - a - service applications that are secure for data sitting in the cloud , but it also looks like the cloud people might not have wanted to do such a thing .
Maybe you want to get started gardening with just a few herbs , but , like us , feel like a natural born plant killer .
Grow Bags provide breathe - able , portable containers you can plunk down just about anywhere to grow herbs and small vegetables .

We suggested looking into a windows box garden over the weekend , but for apartment dwellers without such amenities , and those who fear the dangers of over - watering or too much heat , Gardener 's Supply offers these 13 - by - 10 bags .
They 're made of double - layer polypropylene , similar to what long underwear is made of , and that allows excess water to escape , air to get in , and direct sunlight heat to dissipate , while still providing a fairly firm container for your plants .
The bags come in a few different shapes for herbs , tomatoes , peppers , salad greens , and potatoes — plants which can , generally , grow on front steps , patios , or anywhere that gets a little sun and a little water each day .

You have to buy your own potting mix or dirt and seeds , but after following the directions on the seed packet , you 're pretty much good to go .
If you want to upgrade and ensure constant moisture , even when you 're forgetful during dry spells , there 's a self - watering tray that fits exactly two Grow Bags .
We 're eager to start out with two bags of our own , now that the weather 's started to turn the corner here in Buffalo .

For the first time in its history , the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has banned a nominee from attending the Oscars .
The group said Tuesday that Nicolas Chartier , a producer on best picture candidate “ The Hurt Locker , ” will not be allowed into the Kodak Theatre for Sunday ’s ceremony .
Chartier ’s tickets have been revoked , and he will not be granted entry as a guest of any other attendee , an academy spokeswoman told The Times .
The decision comes on the heels of Chartier sending an e-mail message to a group of colleagues that included academy members asking them to choose the Summit Entertainment - distributed “ The Hurt Locker ” for best picture and “ not the $ 500 - million film ” -- a clear reference to “ Avatar . ”
The message was deemed in violation of the academy ’s ban against creating a negative impression of a rival nominee .
Chartier subsequently apologized for his actions .
“ Chartier had recently disseminated an e-mail to certain academy voters and other film industry figures in which he solicited votes for his own picture and disparaged one of the other contending films , ” the academy said in a statement .
“ The executive committee of the academy ’s Producers Branch , at a special session late Monday , ruled that the ethical lapse merited the revocation of Chartier ’s invitation to the awards . ”
Should the film win best picture , Chartier would be given his Oscar at a later date .
The academy stopped short of the more draconian penalty of disallowing the film from competing for Oscars .
Still , the move was unprecedented .
While studios have previously had their overall allotment of tickets reduced because of campaign violations , no individual nominee had previously been forbidden from attending .
Chartier was not immediately available for comment Tuesday .

||| Sjokkert forlot publikum Black Box Teater en forestilling der høner ble halshogd og en kvinne ble voldtatt på scenen .
Forestillingen har fått 270000 kroner i statsstøtte .
Ikke som planlagtDet gikk ikke som planlagt , verken for publikum eller teaterledelsen ved Black Box Teater under avslutningen av ukesfestivalen « Marstrand III » søndag .
- Vi ble like mye rævpult som hun på scenen .
Det sier Black Box ' teatersjef Jon Refsdal Moe .
Dildo i anusPerformanceartisten Julian Blaue og musikeren Liv Holmberg i teatergruppa Storkunstsolteddystaten står bak skandaleforestillingen « Bestialitetsteologiske fakultetsgrunnlegging » .
I løpet av forestillingen ble en kvinne utsatt for en voldtektsscene der hun ble penetrert med en dildo i anus — i det som skulle forestille en voldtektsscene .
AvskyDa den brutale scenen fant sted , forlot de aller fleste av publikummerne salen i avsky .
- Dette var helt forferdelig og ingen del av den planlagte forestillingen .
Julian
Blaue gjorde noe helt annet enn det som var avtalt , sier Moe .
Halshogde høner - Jeg er veldig forbannet og lei meg .
Dette er et totalt tillitsbrudd .
Blaue kommer aldri til å få vist noe her så lenge jeg er teatersjef , sier Moe .
I løpet av forestillingen pisket den mannlige skuespilleren seg selv og drepte tre levende høner med øks .
ProvosereMoe beskriver norsk - tyske Blaue som en kunstner som liker å utfordre og balansere på grensa av hva som går an å vise .

- Jeg har fått mange reaksjoner , folk har tydeligvis hatt behov for å snakke med meg om dette , sier Moe .
Han hevder at kunstnerparet bare var ute etter å provosere .
Ble dårligMoe satt selv i salen og var vitne til at en kvnne på scenen ble bundet , voldtatt og tre høner ble halshogd — og beskriver det hele som et grovt tillitsbrudd .
Therese Bjørneboe , redaktør av Norsk Shakespeare - og teatertidsskrift og teateranmelder i Aftenposten , var til stede under forestillingen .
Den erfarne teateranmelderen ble dårlig og kvalm av det hun så og måtte ut og få risk luft .
Ble sjokkert - Jeg tar avstand fra slike voldsforherligende virkemidler .
- Dette er en forstilling som ideologisk og kunstnerisk er helt ute å kjøre , sier Bjørneboe .
Hun legger til at flere i teatergruppa også ble sjokkert over den retningen stykket tok — og forlot teatret .
270 000 i støtte
Performanceartisten Julian Blaue har tidligere hatt forutstillinger og kunstinstallasjoner på Kunstnernes Hus og i Kulturkirken Jakob .
Han er også et kjent navn hos Norsk kulturråd , som har støttet skandaleforestillingen med 270000 kroner .

If other people 's marriages makes you retch , you might wanna see someone
by Jeremy Hooper
This writer does n't watch " Dancing With The Stars . "
But I did see this week 's clip related to both anti-miscegenation laws of the past and inequality laws of the present , and it was one of the most heartfelt moments I 've ever seen from a reality competition show .
Even if you thought it was cheesy , I do n't see how you could fail to see that the heart and emotion attached is incredibly pure .
But then again , I do n't think like a social conservative , who heaves at the thought of freedom .
This from the blog of The Ruth Institute ( A National Organization For Marriage affiliate :
Those who value the survival of their brain cells do not watch Dancing With the Stars .
Until now .
Now we can also say that those who value either the survival of their brain cells or traditional marriage also do not watch that execrable show .
Witness this ( if you can keep your lunch down ) .
I think I got stupider just watching that .
It made no attempt to engage the issue ( and why should a stupid talent show engage this or any issue ? ) instead , it just attempted to tug at heartstrings .
It was like a sucker punch saying that those who support traditional marriage are just mean and nasty people .
Well , to DWTS , I say this .
Do n’t strain yourself trying to persuade me so much next time .
If you can stand to watch people dancing , then perhaps you ought to watch a Fred Astaire film or something .
At least Freddy never attempted to change your mind about the definition of marriage .
Anyway , I think , after watching this , I ’m going to retch .
I bet you will too .
Retching with the stars … [ Ruth Institute ]
But wait , this writer is faulting the show for supposedly not engaging , yet he or she limits the discourse to " this made me want to retch " ?
Typical social conservatism .
The truth : Groups like the Ruth Institute hate to see scenes like this one national television because they know that it has the ability to open far more minds than they will ever be able to seal back shut .
They know that the dots of connection are being put into place .
They know that the boob tube has power , and that it 's firmly committed to taking us out of the darkness ( with ABC really stepping it up in particular ) .
When looking for hope , TV is one bright star that should certainly put a dance in all equality - favoring people 's weary - but - stoic shoes !

“ Fatah is living through a crisis of vision , ” said Mahdi Abdul Hadi , chairman of the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs in Jerusalem .
“ How can they combine being a liberation movement with being a governing party ?
This is one way .
The idea is to awaken national pride and fulfill the people ’s anxiety and passion .
Of course , Hamas and armed resistance still remain a real option for many . ”
Image The Palestinian prime minister , Salam Fayyad , said he planted trees in the West Bank last month “ to establish our presence on our land and keep our people on it . ”

Khalil Shikaki , who runs the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah , said : “ The society is split .
The public believes that Israel responds to suffering , not to nonviolent resistance .
But there is also not much interest in violence now .
Our surveys show support for armed resistance at 47 percent in March .
In essence , the public feels trapped between failed diplomacy and failed armed struggle . ”
Israeli military authorities have not decided how to react .
They allow Mr. Fayyad some activity in the areas officially off limits to him , but on occasion they have torn down what he has built .
They reject the term nonviolent for the recent demonstrations because the marches usually include stone - throwing and attempts to damage the separation barrier .
Troops have responded with stun grenades , rubber bullets , tear gas and arrests .
And the military has declared that Bilin will be a closed area every Friday for six months to halt the weekly marches there .
“ We respect Salam Fayyad , ” one military official said , speaking under the army ’s rules of anonymity .
“ But we do n’t want him to engage in incitement .
Burning goods is incitement .
Destroying the fence is incitement and is not nonviolent .
They are walking a thin line . ”
One reason a violent uprising remains unlikely for now , Palestinian analysts say , is that in the two years that Mr. Fayyad ’s security forces and ministries have been functioning , daily life inside West Bank cities and their surroundings has taken on much greater safety and normality .
The police and the courts are functioning again after the intifada of 2000 that led to many deaths on both sides .
Traffic tickets are now routinely handed out .
Personal checks , long shunned , are increasingly in use .
An intro to modern OpenGL .
Chapter 2 : Hello World : The Slideshow
Updates : I 've fixed a few problems people have reported , particularly problems building on Unix and using Visual C++.
This chapter also got featured on Reddit .
In the previous chapter I gave a big - picture overview of the graphics pipeline .
Now it 's time to put it into action .
Before we try rendering any fancy 3d scenes , I 'll follow standard tutorial protocol and use a simple , two - dimensional " hello world " app to demonstrate the basics of the OpenGL API .
We 're going to take this image :
and draw it to an appropriately - sized window .
But static images are kind of dull — how about we make it a little more interesting by fading back and forth with this image :
Still not all that exciting a program , but despite its simplicity , the program will exercise almost all the parts of OpenGL a more complex program would .
The completed source code is up on Github here .
At 380 lines of C and a couple dozen lines of shader code , this program may seem like overkill just to draw an image to the screen .
However , much of it will lay the groundwork for the more interesting demos to come .
The hello - gl .c source file contains the OpenGL rendering bits , while util .c contains boring utility functions for reading TGA image files .
I 've included the two images , hell o1.tga and hell o2.tga , in this format , because it 's easy to parse without depending on an external library .
Our shader code lives in two files : hello - gl.v.glsl for the vertex shader , and hello - gl.f.glsl for the fragment shader .
In this chapter , I 'll explain how the different parts of the hello - gl program use the OpenGL API to feed data into the graphics pipeline and put it in action .
I 'll also give a brief overview of the GLSL language when we look at shaders .
It 's a lot to cover all in one blog post , so I 'll break the chapter up into four parts .
In this first part , we 'll get a window open with GLUT .
In the second part , we 'll set up the buffer and texture objects that will contain the raw vertex and image data for our program .
After that , we 'll write the shader code that will process that data into our final image on screen , and then feed the shader into OpenGL .
In the final article , we 'll go through the OpenGL calls that actually render to the screen .
Now that our game plan 's laid out , let 's start putting the players on the field .
We 'll start things off by setting up GLUT and getting an empty window up on the screen .
OpenGL header files
#include < stdlib.h > # include < GL/glew.h > #ifdef __APPLE__ # include < GLUT/glut.h > #else # include < GL / glut.h > #endif
Different platforms keep their OpenGL headers in different places , but with GLEW , you do n't need to worry about that .
Including GL / glew.h will pull in the system OpenGL headers for you , wherever they may live .
Unfortunately , including GLUT still requires you to manually step around some cross-platform landmines .
Its header traditionally lives in GL / glut.h , but MacOS X's bundled GLUT framework uses Apple 's own header file convention , putting the GLUT header in GLUT / glut.h .
There 's also a bug in the way recent versions of Visual Studio 's standard C headers interact with glut.h that requires stdlib.h to be included before it .
Setting up our window with GLUT
int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutInitDisplayMode ( GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DOUBLE ) ; glutInitWindowSize( 400 , 300 ) ; glutCreateWindow ( " Hello World " ) ; glutDisplayFunc( &render ) ; glutIdleFunc( &update_fade_factor ) ;
GLUT provides a limited , but straightforward and portable , interface to the window system .
After prepping GLUT by calling glutInit , we use glutInitDisplayMode to specify what buffers our default framebuffer should have .
In our case , a color buffer ( GLUT_RGB ) with double buffering ( GLUT_DOUBLE ) is sufficient .
( Double buffering provides two color buffers to the framebuffer , alternating which buffer is displayed onscreen and which buffer is drawn into every frame so that animation appears smooth . )
If we needed a depth or stencil buffer , we could also ask for them here .
We then set the initial size for our window to the 400×300 size of our images with glutInitWindowSize and create the window with glutCreateWindow .
Finally , we designate two callbacks to receive window events : a glutDisplayFunc to render our image when the window needs displaying , and a glutIdleFunc to continuously update the fade factor between the two images over time .
glewInit ( ) ; if ( ! GLEW_VERSION_2_0 ) { fprintf ( stderr , " OpenGL 2.0 not available
" ) ; return 1 ; }
After GLUT creates our window , it prepares OpenGL so that we can start making calls into the library .
The first thing we do is initialize GLEW .
When glewInit is called , it sets a bunch of flags based on what extensions and OpenGL versions are available .
We check the GLEW_VERSION_2_0 flag here to ensure we have OpenGL 2.0 available before proceeding .
Besides the version flags it sets , GLEW 's role is mostly invisible , and we wo n't need to interact with it after it 's been initialized .
if (!make_resources ( ) ) { fprintf ( stderr , " Failed to load resources
" ) ; return 1 ; } glutMainLoop ( ) ; return 0 ; }
With GLEW initialized , we call our make_resources function to set up our OpenGL resources .
We 'll build up that function over the next few parts of this chapter .
If our resources load successfully , glutMainLoop takes over .
It displays the window , starts receiving UI events from the window system , and invokes the callbacks we set up in response to those events .
It will also exit the program for us when the user quits .
The return 0 merely suppresses compiler warnings and never actually gets reached .
Compiling and running our program
At this point , we can stub out our GLUT callbacks and make_resources function and get a working , if pointless , program :
static int make_resources ( void ) { return 1 ; }
static void update_fade_factor( void ) { }
static void render ( void ) { glClearColor ( 1.0f , 1.0f , 1.0f , 1.0f ) ; glClear ( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ) ; glutSwapBuffers ( ) ; }
glClearColor sets an RGBA clear color ( in this case , white ) , which glClear then uses to fill the framebuffer 's color buffer .
glutSwapBuffers then brings our cleared color buffer to the screen .
With these stubs in place , we can now compile and run our program .
This stubbed - out version is in the Github repo as hello - gl - dummy.c .
The command to compile the program and link it to the OpenGL , GLUT , and GLEW libraries will vary across platforms .
On most Unixes it should look something like this :
gcc -o hello - gl - dummy hello- gl - dummy .c \ - I/usr/X11R6 / include -L/usr/X11R6/lib \ -lGL -lGLEW - lglut
On MacOS X :
# Assuming GLEW was installed to / opt / local gcc -o hello - gl - dummy hello - gl - dummy .c \ -I/opt/local / include -L/opt/local/ lib \ - framework OpenGL - framework GLUT -lGLEW
On Windows with Visual C++:
cl / Fohello-gl - dummy.obj /c hello-gl-dummy.c link /out:hello-gl-dummy.exe hello-gl-dummy.obj \ opengl32.lib glut32.lib glew32.lib
On Windows with mingw :
gcc -o hello-gl- dummy.exe hello-gl-dummy.c \ - lopengl32 - lglut32 - lglew32
The repo also includes makefiles for each of these platform groups .
You can build this version of the program using the hello - gl - dummy ( or hello - gl - dummy.exe on Windows ) :
make -f Makefile .MacOSX hello - gl - dummy # or Makefile .
Unix or Makefile .
Mingw
nmake /f Nmakefile .
Windows hello-gl-dummy.exe
Once you 've built the program , you should then be able to run the program and get a white window , as promised :
Next time , buffers and textures
With the red tape of getting a window open out of the way , we 're ready to actually feed our vertexes and images into OpenGL .
In the next article , I 'll introduce OpenGL 's buffer and texture objects .

I firmly believe that a programmer must know several programming languages well in order to be top - notch .
And the less similar these languages are , the better .
The reason for this is that different languages often present different programming philosophies - different approaches for solution of problems .
Being acquainted with several techniques to solve a single problem makes it easier to solve the problem in an optimal way .
Additionally , my philosophy in programming is that no single language / methodology is good for everything .
Some languages are better than others to solve specific problems , and an experienced developer must know when to use " the best tool for the job " .
I am programming computers non -stop since late 1998 .
Below is a description of my current programming language " arsenal " .
Namely , the languages I am most familiar with .
C / C++
C was the language I began programming in , and is still the language I know the best .
The reason for this is C's simplicity .
It 's a small , easy language to learn and to master .
For the vast majority of applications , however , C is too simple .
C's focus is on performance , and hence it lacks modern abstraction mechanisms , which makes C programming much more wordly and tedious than contemporary " high level " languages like Perl and Ruby .
C++ is its older brother and a much more complex and sophisticated language .
C++ is a very difficult nut to crack , mostly because it combines complex abstraction mechanisms with terrific performance ( if C is the measurement criterion set at 1.0 , C++ has performance that 's rarely worse than 1.1 ) .
I know C++ quite well , but far from the total knowledge I have of C , for instance .
In fact , I know only a handful of people who really know C++ perfectly .
If you think you 're one of these people , try reading Alexandrescu's " Modern C++ " for a harsh return to reality .
These days I rarely use C / C++ for " desktop " coding .
I still use C heavily for programming embedded devices , where it really is the only real option .
But on PC's ( where code runs on top of full operating systems like MS Windows or Linux ) , C / C++ is simply inferior to other languages in terms of programmer productivity , which is a very important factor these days .
Whatever I can write in C++ in a day I can write in Perl in a couple of hours .
The only occasions I turn to C++ are when top performance or a low - level interface to the operating system or a third - party library are required .
But even in these cases , the C++ part is usually encapsulated as a small library with the main Perl code controlling it using one of the many interfaces available .
I had both linked C code to Perl for performance , and used a stand - alone C++ program connected to the main Perl script via a socket for accessing operating systems internals .
Perl
Perl is my main tool at the moment .
Criticisms of Perl are numerous , and many of them are true , but whatever they say , Perl is a productive language .
I know I can write good and useful code in Perl that accomplishes the tasks I have satisfactorily .
Perl enjoys an enormous collection of ready libraries for any purpose - the CPAN , a very mature base of documentation and literature , and the best programmer community ( by a mile ) one can find ( Perlmonks ) .
However , Perl is getting old and some of the most advanced programming idioms take some teeth screeching to implement .
OO in Perl 5 is a known fiasco ( no matter how many Class : :* modules they throw at you ) and functional paradigms lose some of their charm because of the clunky syntax .
While there is currently no language better than Perl to solve specific problems " at hand " , superior languages exist when it comes to writing big systems .
Ruby
Ruby is the best candidate to replace Perl as my " main tool " in the future .
I just discovered it this year , and so far I 'm charmed - and I try to write all my new " toy project " code in it .
Ruby is everything Perl is and more .
Language - wise , Ruby allows the same level of productivity and ease of programming as Perl , and adds a lot on top of it .
Much cleaner syntax , an excellent OO system and even better tools for writing functional code .
If there is a potential Perl - killer in the world , Ruby is it .
Even Perl 6 wo n't help here , because although it cleans
Perl up and fixes some of its gravest deficiencies , I can't fail noticing that it still looks inferior to Ruby 1.8 in many aspects , and Ruby 2.0 will be even better ( and will arrive earlier than Perl 6 ) .
The best thing about Perl 6 is , IMHO , Parrot - from which Ruby will also benefit .
Ruby is not without problems , however , which is mostly why I still use Perl for most of my serious coding .
The documentation is far worse , the community is much smaller and much less powerful , the libraries are incomplete and immature ( and many have only Japanese docs and home - pages ) .
The threads implementation is very weak and the GUI bindings are nowhere as polished out ( Perl TK maybe is n't the prettiest and the simplest library in the world , but you can create complex and useful GUIs with it , right out - of - the - box ) .
Ruby is also slow .
Though compared with C++ ,
Perl is n't exactly the king of speed ( it is on average an order of magnitude slower ) , Ruby is much slower than even Perl ( x5 or so , according the the Shootout benchmarks and other sources ) .
This is n't a very big problem , because critical sections can still be written in C++ ( for which Ruby has good bindings ) , but still I wish it could be faster , at least as fast as Perl , say .
Lisp
Lastly , I must mention Lisp , which is probably the most controversial language out there ( it seems that people either love or hate it , without much in the middle ) .
Although I do n't use Lisp for any real coding and unlikely to do so in the future , Lisp has taught me a lot .
I feel that learning Lisp made me a much better programmer , and for that I will be forever grateful .
As Eric Raymond famously noted :
LISP is worth learning for a different reason — the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it .
That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days , even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot .
What Lisp " teaches " is the functional programming style , which is IMHO the cleanest and the most elegant way to program .
Conclusion
Do n't stick to just one programming language , even if you like it a lot .
Besides looking bad on a resume , knowing only one language will lock you in a very narrow point of view on the world of programming .
Learning and knowing well at least 2 - 3 different languages is essential to become a much better developer .
